{"hvcAM7yKzNY": "yo how is everyone doing today davon dad hit it back with another video in this video we're gonna be doing a cartridge review and I'm really excited for this review because this is that dang faith now I've been trying to get my hands on this for a while now and I finally found a dispensary with them this one is the Apple Jacks and here is the beautiful pen I'm gonna try to set you guys up here so you can see it better I mean there's some money it is really bugging [Music] there's a good golden color and it's completely completely full there are no bubbles there is no little little bottle bubble there's nothing and so this isn't don't be say there's no cartridge this part is that no it's not from a dispensary now on the back here this is the Apple Jacks one so on the back here it says Apple Jacks is the beautiful and popular hybrid classic jacket and white widow which I believe I both sativas white widow might be a sativa dominant hybrid but let's keeping this potent combination embodies the uplifted clarity of Joshua while applying a warm soothing relaxation to the body this stream works wonders for patients and consumers suffering from chronic or from chronic physical pain and nausea Applejack's aroma as you might guess is one of the sweet sliced apples with hints of skunk and earth so that's what it says on the back down on the side it says all organic no propylene glycol and then it has their little instagram database official account and then on the back here this is ninety point twenty-one percent THC Bush I can get you guys show that but the box is really dope it's like shiny and it pops out and you know it's really dope the oil is amazing so let's turn this bad boy on I've been making longer videos that I've wanted to so let's just get straight into this Apple Jacks from database let's go this closure just makes you want to just keep smoking it without stopping it's so smooth I don't really taste an Apple jobs per se I just taste kind of like that like a cinnamon cinnamon kind of Apple II taste and the hi is already kicking in you're feeling in my eyes I'm feeling in my head only on this cartridge is just not even moving like it's still completely ball good smoke very hard and I had the reason was out of the boxes because I did smoke a little bit took a couple habits before I had to go run some and and yeah so this thing now you can kind of see some little bubbles oh yeah gonna see the foil a little bit better there as you can see it's completely full this is probably after six seven hits let's make it seven right now I'm gonna try it on the lower setting for this battery because this is a three voltage battery now I'm gonna try to get a taste like it's so good it tastes clean like really stays really clean and to see cell cultures as well as you can see there and I'm hi man so [ __ ] I really like this cartridge that she's dispenser I went to they had a lot more of these day vape so if you want me to do more reviews on them leave a like and leave a comment down below the oven let's get it a mom but I'm really high about I get my head I can feel it and I can also feel a body high with it it's not all a head high it's really it's all over I feel really really good really good this is honestly one of the best cartridges I've had behind these dang babes and I was really excited for him they really didn't let me down and yeah if you want to check him out on Instagram his date-based official account so yeah if you want more videos like this on date face let me know I'll do more videos um yeah

I'm for sure but probably won't get on this granddaddy purp right after this oh wait this Applejack I'm tweaking me partying on get on his granddaddy probe right now finally make a video right now right now right after yeah yeah all right I'm gonna close this one off woman let me just tell you a couple more heads ouch oh that I try to French you know I'm barely learning how to French inhale [ __ ] so I'm not that nice at a year with that's the end of this video only I'm gonna get straight to the door right now", "eTb7xVO_FE0": "what's going on it's Little Miss cannabis and this is my part two video on how to use the pure distillate in the syringe form so earlier I told you how to warm it up to loosen up the consistency so it was easier to use so when it's in that state the best thing to do is if you want to eat it on a cookie just put a little rice grain piece on there and directly eat it that way and if that's not enough you can always up the dose and make your little amount on there bigger another great way to use it when it's heated up in the syringe is you can directly put it into say like a cup of hot tea or warm coffee and that's a great way to use it as well so another way you can use it at is you can vaporize it so if you have a vaporizer that looks like this this is a barbed coil vaporizer you see right in there there's a coil in there and that's what you're going to want to put the actual you know little des of medicine right in there and that coil is going to burn it pretty hot and you're going to be able to be braise it in that way now the best way to use the distillate is a way called dabbing and that's something that they are not allowed to talk to you about at the dispensaries so that's why I'm gonna do this video and show you exactly how to dab it so there's different devices you can use to dab this right here is called a dab straw so what you need to do is use a little torch and heat up the end of it you're gonna want to get it nice and hot it's going to turn a little bit once it does and you can see mine is a little bit you're gonna want to bring that parchment paper out of the freezer put it right on there and go ahead and take an inhale now this is gonna go way down in so you can tell it is definitely a deep hit for sure but this is gonna affect you really really well so another way to dab excuse me is to use add a brick so this is gonna be probably the most beneficial way to use it so what the daybreak looks like is this right here you heat this piece up right here until that gets red you put this piece on and then what you're going to do is have your little piece of distill it on here put it down in hit it that way and then feel it go away down in and then the party begins I have a good one see y'all later", "oNFmWo_JMI4": "yo what the [ __ ] is up guys it's been a fat minute man i am back with another video what's up it's been it's been a fat ass minute since i dropped a video it's been almost a week it's been like five weeks almost five five weeks almost five days guys five days ago i made a drop the video and i think it was in the gorilla glue on the big cheek guided by the way anyways guys i'm going to get y'all another card review i got i mean another big chief this time is applejack uh i'm so excited to review this one with y'all guys i heard applejack is really tight like not tasty but it's it's it know the taste is becoming better and i had applejack before guys and it was alright i guess it was it better didn't taste much much apple jack like you know the cereal apple jacks but anyways guys what the card looks like my plastic government warning all of that the gold stamp silver stamp the scratch me right here and we'll see what's up guys we'll see what's up with this with this one in the new boxes so how y'all doing anyways this is gonna be there's gonna be one more strain i gotta review after this one will be sour tangy that's the last one and now and i'm probably gonna redo the videos of the other big chiefs trains that i did but in the new boxes i might do that guys because i [ __ ] with big chief so much i might even buy me a big chief mask taking the plastic out always the quality big chief gotta have to see the seed sticker right here it's all taken out i'm gonna go ahead and open the box this with the card and so what's what inside it looks like that always gotta look like that to get out the little container i'll show you the cart and the apple jack's gonna be a sativa take the little top out big chief symbol at the bottom so i'm gonna screw that off take the little red top yes sir big chief applejack i've been waiting to do this one guys i haven't got applejack in a long time see if you can spot anybody see that's a bubble right there it's not moving it's staying still like a guard i like them dudes from london london them big ass [ __ ] black cats they stay still bro ca sticker all qualified all qualified all [ __ ] certified big chiefs i'm not tasting nothing distinctive in the dry hit i taste bud but that's not the case when you [ __ ] taste these big cheeks on my pants over there okay screw the this other card up we're gonna screw on the new one applejack so how are y'all doing guys how are y'all liking the elections i'm not [ __ ] with neither neither of them but i hope biden wins i'm not gonna lie i hope i don't i don't want trump winning bro but i don't talk about politics guys all that politics [ __ ] gotta be out of my mouth but but i'm not really i don't really care about the elections man i just hope the i just hope somebody makes a change you know with all this [ __ ] going on around guys just trying to spray positive vibes i already did right here taste a little bit of bud nothing distinctive all right let's take a drink let's take a hard hit now applejack uh i got one more to review left and then that's it oh oh i don't really taste that much i don't really taste apple jacks but i do taste citrusiness i'll tell you that right now i guess i taste it's a little bit of citrusiness in there like no cap that's what i take this that's a little bit of taste that i got from this applejack damn it's already hitting me hard oh this [ __ ] is [ __ ] good i guess if i would have known uh applejack had been gas before because i've been too [ __ ] up but i've been smoking on [ __ ] for the longest i just knew applejack i just knew applejack would [ __ ] hit you really hard bro and i just hate it once i well i did hit the gorilla i did the gorilla glue right here i did hit it and [ __ ] before doing this review so yeah i think applejack's boosted up but now applejack's only packing up at 87. a total 87.4 percent and 9 thc 82.9 so it has 82.9 percent tac 33 cb uh wait point 33 cbd so it has some cbd in there so make you call 0.33 really ain't nothing but see if you got activity you gotta kick into this [ __ ] is [ __ ] fire i like i like the little citrus in this you can tell the [ __ ] top that's [ __ ] light as hell this is stupid this is a tiva this is not indica guys big clouds all the time this [ __ ] is gas you see this off the hook with them applejack's good with terps in this one no cow i don't know if i was tripping back then if i didn't taste no chirps and the other apple jacks that i smelled from the other big the other old boxes but in these new boxes bro it's like they put a little bit more citrus in this and there's a little bit more chirps in there bro like that's crazy but nothing much taste a lot of flour like it's 60 i taste distill it too like about 35 and the citrus in this i taste 30 pretty good numbers for this card and the potency i'm gonna go ahead i'm gonna take a little few more hits and i'm gonna give you all the potency and [ __ ] but i'll give you all the flavors right now show y'all what this [ __ ] is all about we have the cali right there gotta say it's gotta say establish 2013 see if you can see that they all gotta have their ca sticker guys that's what they're supposed to look like like that under there but nothing much guys big chief been hitting the same it gets me high as [ __ ] the same [ __ ] high and i like that i like this big chief i said gorilla glue really fire gorilla glue super fire too it just has lower thc percentage than apple jack wait not even my wrong my back your glutes more potent than applejack that's crazy though applejack's hitting me right away but i've been high so applejack's just boosting it up giving me that sativa high bringing that bringing that [ __ ] up even more not [ __ ] with it guys well i guess i'm gonna go ahead and just have a little beer chill just [ __ ] enjoy the rest of the night wake up tomorrow go to work if i go to work tomorrow i don't know if i go to work tomorrow to be honest hopefully i do but as applejack's really hitting me hard as hell guys i'm already [ __ ] up out of my mind just look at that [ __ ] and i kind of jeweled a little bit bro this [ __ ] is too fire he's going to be in this video guys the potency is going to be a straight 9.5 like always stay [ __ ] let's stay [ __ ] safe peace", "FNCwMmWLBDA": "hey folks is whatever got here because whatever with me and do you want to know about this new ion cbd uh applejack delta tc vape cart from ioncbd uh stick around i'll tell you a little bit more about that that's the company that i was telling you about um yesterday that i wanted to bring forward and talk to you guys about today if you'll like and subscribe to this video also uh stick around to the end i will tell you how you can get on a giveaway for uh delta farms vape card giveaway on christmas day giving one of these away flavor of your choice you guys can go to vapeful supply i'll put the link form down at the bottom take a look at them man and see what flavor you guys want because on christmas day when somebody wins this you're going to send me your address and i'm going to ask you what flavor you want and for barring that you can go to maple supply right now and use code whatever and they will give you 25 off on their 30 cards man these are primo carts uh they're the most poking cards i've found so far uh i don't think you'll find one any better if you do we'll put them to the pepsi challenge um so having said that uh somebody asked me you know i've actually had a couple questions and people ask me how i'd dose and uh how i you know what would i choose what i choose tinctures what i choose vapes uh stuff like that so i'm going to answer that question right here um i live week to week like everybody else and let's face it you know uh going to vape car route um tends to be a little bit cheaper in the long run for vape cards but my normal um i've done a lot of things in my life you know i spent a lot of time in the army and whatever guy um so i kind of beat my body up i'm i'm 48 years old um i'm six foot tall probably i range between 200 and 220 pounds i'm in pretty good shape um i can work uh i can work with the best of them i can still put you know some of your young bucks in the dirt and if i don't put you in the dirt at the end of the day you're gonna you're gonna give me some respect um so so i don't mess around um so but you know coming you know the cost of that comes a little bit of pain and i carry around a little bit of pain every day um we can sink back their pain levels whatever cases but you know everybody's pain levels different and i may be a [ __ ] or maybe compared to you or i may you know my pain level may be higher but whatever it is whatever my pain level is i've got pain and and most people do um so what i normally do is what i like to do is if i if i've got the money to do it um i like to take attention first thing in the morning the way i do that is i'll get up in the morning first thing i'll take probably about if it's a 25 milligram for a full dropper i'll take about three quarters of the dropper first thing in the morning and then i'll do my you know uh ablutions and then i'll come back and i'll take the other quarter about 15 to 20 minutes later and that seems to kick it in a little bit quicker for me what i found is when i use a tincture a lot of times is i'll forget all about the vape cart for about three or four hours um and then about the 34th hour what will happen is i'll end up dosing this um you know one two three times an hour maybe you know until i hit about six eight hour mark and then i might dose another one again and then i'm good for a while um if i have to go with one or the other and i don't have the money i'm going with the bait simply because i get uh immediate relief right then um with the tincture is something i know in the long run is better off for me um and i know that it's uh you know cost wise it's probably better but for some reason i just i gravitate back to the babe um but hitting this first thing in the morning it makes me forget all about this for a few hours um sometimes i'll hit it out of habit if it's sitting in front of me but i found that i don't even need this if i hit the signature um and then you know four hours into it i might hit this just a little bit um until i uh it's sparingly until i until i decide to hit another one of these doses okay so moving on from that um the slow stuff so yesterday i told you i went to um pensacola florida uh somebody put me on cbd i'd actually gone on um facebook messenger and hit these people up find out what their address was the symptoms of coal on creighton road you guys check them out um so they claim to be northwest florida's oldest or first uh cbd store and so i'm kind of surprised they haven't heard about them um and that's probably because they you know i mostly deal with delta a products and you know marijuana um having said that um so i take off and go down there yesterday i leave about four thirty five in the morning my girlfriend's got an appointment at i think uh eleven o'clock um at a dentist and my plan is to go down there and and to uh take her to this dentist appointment not just because she needs to go you know who needs to probably need to ride at the dentist's appointment but because i want to get a picture of her with that slight jaw they know they can't turn inside so i have something pickled her about from now on but i didn't get a chance to do that because i had texted her on the way down there i left about you know 5 36 in the morning piddling around dirt roads on the way there and i hit her up and i asked her could she be ready to go by nine because i figured i you know they opened a 10 in pensacola i could get there from her place and then get her back to her appointment at 11 and she said to be pushing it so i ended up going straight to pensacola so i take my old truck i go down to pensacola i get to this place i end up getting there about 40 minutes early i'm texting the guy back and forth i don't know it's a guy by the way at the time i'm texting on this uh the facebook messenger and so i'm waiting in the parking lot finally a lady gets there really really nice lady gets there and i go in the store and i tell this lady sell this [ __ ] to me and she does man and she gives this [ __ ] to me blood raw gives it to me the way i wanted no jaw jack around no messy ass [ __ ] she just she told me what i wanted to hear and she sold me that delta a day card okay so i leave out i get the vape car to go out and i and i get to my truck and the first thing i do is like now on the way out there's a couple in there and um uh they're a young couple they're uh i'm talking to them about my my youtube channel and stuff so i leave there and i go out to the truck first thing i do is screw the pillow and i hit it and i'm like wow i'm getting this pretty good pin man and so hit my truck damn thing won't crank up so go back inside and i you know say hey i need to jump or whatever so a young couple they're from bat louise uh baton rouge louisiana and they're they're living in pensacola uh really cool dude and a really cool uh girlfriend he's got man uh she had pink toenails but uh just she painted her toenails pink but they jumped me off man and i had a really nice conversation with those folks man they were really good folks um so the customers you know the type of customers that go into that place are great too um having said that let me tell you something folks there's there's a few key things about this part that uh that i found out i'm i really was hesitant you know how you like you find something that's like really cool when you want to

cap to put on the bottoms make it more extra clear i mean for 18 bucks the or twenty dollars a full gram dude that's a [ __ ] steal i like what what legal shop is gonna show a full game if anything for twenty dollars dude [ __ ] that's where you gotta go to up north for the best deals on your product dude and this is well worth the banking bang for the buck man my pockets are kind of tight right now and i'm usually a big full-grain smoker i like the half grams only last many days so once that once i figured out i thought i didn't thought at least we'd be 20 like 22 23 dollars out of tax but only 20.76 at the tax that's [ __ ] insane if she recommended it she knows your [ __ ] so this is got it on there one two three one two three black on green for low temp dab i don't even prime it p prime without battery connected connect the cartridge to the battery inhale and start big chief so i guess that's how he's um supposed to start each cart you're supposed to inhale before i guess that cause priming it i'm not gonna pee here i'm just gonna just hit it on the spot dude so five blinker hits for 500 subscribers dude this [ __ ] game make sure you guys have the eighteen plus twenty one

I brought it with me everywhere I went Seema Herman never expected that what she thought was a harmless habit vaping would end up nearly killing her I took two days for my lungs to fail and I almost died the 18 year old going viral with this photo from her hospital best a tube still pumping oxygen to her failing lungs in her hands a call-to-action asked for like a pen and paper because that was the only way I could communicate and I wrote I want to start a no vaping campaign that was the first thing I did when I opened my eyes Seema's story is just the latest in a landslide of incidents linked to vaping sparking what many officials are calling a national health crisis what we've seen in the course of the past let's say month is an increased number of people coming in with respiratory problems as a result of vaping so far the Centers for Disease Control report more than 450 possible cases in 33 states of lung illness associated with vaping and six deaths have been confirmed in California Illinois Indiana Minnesota Oregon and now Kansas last Friday the CDC issued a stark warning if you are vaping no matter how old you are you should consider stopping like I didn't think of myself as a smoker the vaping just makes it seem like it's nothing like you're doing nothing wrong Seema was in high school when she started vaping nicotine I was 16 the first time 15 and even the first time I bought it at the smoke shop I went in and I was like can I get a pack of jewel pods and they were like how old are you and I said 22 and they were just like okay it ended up becoming my oxygen I couldn't live without it I needed it all the time every day but because all of my friends were doing it all the time and no one else had symptoms that I had I couldn't like I wouldn't even have imagined that maybe this is killing me sima was an active healthy teen she'd been dancing for years even making dance team her freshman year of college but as her vaping habit increased adding in cannabis her ability to dance disappeared she was vaping a cartridge a day that's like smoking the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes in one day her parents had no idea their daughter had become hopelessly addicted this healthy dancer dancing 12 hours a week stopped dancing because of it stop living because of it stop going to school in college because of it Sima says she was feeling sick all the time over a year I lost like 50 pounds without trying 50 pounds yeah by this summer Seema had stopped going to her college classes she says her health issues were getting worse but no doctor could nail down what was wrong did you not tell the doctors that you've ached I actually did I made sure that every hospital every ER every doctor's office I went to I told them that I smoked but you never thought I can't breathe I feel like I'm gonna die maybe it's because I'm vaping every 10 to 15 minutes no doctor ever said like maybe you should stop vaping it all came to a head on August 15th when Seamas dad rushed her to the ER I said go fast don't let me close my eyes don't let me fall asleep or I won't wake up now why did you say that because I knew I was dying you felt death on you yeah it was terrifying the worst part was I couldn't I couldn't let it like my parents watch it happen to me but hospital staff couldn't figure out why Seema couldn't breathe two days later doctors had to put her on a ventilator I was begging them found her faster event her faster she's going to die it was terrifying it was in that agonizing moment that Seamas cousin revealed her secret addiction she said you know she smokes every day what what are you talking about you said she smokes every day she smokes that beep I said you tell the doctors right now you go tell the doctors right now and I ransacked her room and I found all the vapes it looked like gum wrappers they look like little candy wrappers they look like little cute a mascara wands this progression is so fast dr. Catherine Melamed is a pulmonologist at UCLA Medical Center she worked on Seema's case this was Seema's chest x-ray when she came into our Hospital these hazy white areas here at the base at the bottom of her lungs just show that she could have a pneumonia but what you can then see is if we choose an x-ray from just less than 48 hours later now her lungs all of this white haziness here is inflammation from just day 1 to day 3 is remarkable dr. melamed is on the front lines of what health officials fear is an emerging crisis the National Youth tobacco survey found a 78 percent jump in East cigarette usage among high school students alone but any research on the impacts of vaping lags far behind part of vaping is heating oil and then inhaling that oil and that's not something the lung is used to inhaling and so with that comes an inflammatory reaction that then produces phlegm and sputum and gives the lungs sort of that wet cough when property that sounds terrible and dangerous yes last month 17 year-old Tristan zou fell described how he spent 18 days in the hospital fighting for his life after vaping I woke up just throwing up everywhere how it was just pounding on my chest going 100 miles an hour Tristan lost 15 pounds and said he had to relearn to walk and just yesterday a Texas teen had to be rushed to the hospital after vaping at school passed out and you and I wake up like he was not waking up in Wisconsin today a man was arrested for making thousands of illegal THC vaping cartridges the state of New York is taking an aggressive approach in an attempt to find answers and crack down on black-market products you shouldn't be vaping products that clearly you don't know what you're you're smoking or vaping many vaping products are popular with young adults and teenagers but no company has taken more heat than Jul the industry leader the company says it's designed to get adult smokers off cigarettes but just this week the FDA sent a warning letter to Jewell accusing it of illegally marketing its nicotine bait products as safer than traditional cigarettes without proof Jewell responded we share these concerns about youth vaping it adds it shut down its Facebook and Instagram accounts and recently began deploying new technology to verify IDs this yeah.but Seema's mom blames the whole industry for trying to hook kids early the fact that they market this crap to children and they turned into pink pretty purple packaging candy pisses me off there's a lot we don't know about the both short-term and long-term consequences of vaping and so I would just say don't and the week since Seema has worked to rehab her lungs she still feels that pull to pick up the vape now I don't necessarily crave the nicotine I don't necessarily crave the weed it's just craving like the act of smoking so that's been my hardest thing of like staying away from it but she hopes that going public with her story can keep her and countless others like her alive what would you tell somebody who's under 18 who's thinking about vaping and says I'm just gonna try it one time to see what it's like I would show them my pictures and say I tried it once too and then I tried it another time and then another time it's just remembering that you don't need it like it's gonna kill you for nightline I'm Adrienne banker in Los Angeles hi everyone George Stephanopoulos

don't forget to download the ABC News app for breaking news alerts thanks for watching", "erXpR_x6YzI": "what's up YouTube it's your boy mr. bling seed back again with another video today I'm coming at you with an unofficial dank vapes comparison and review the carts I have in question are pineapple express an ace of spades OOP I move the pineapple Express so the reason I'm making this video is because I know that dank vapes carts are all illegitimate but there are still some that are better than others and some that are more healthy for you to smoke are at least more safe for you to smoke than others um and if these are all you have like availability for it then you should at least know which ones you should buy and which ones you should just stay away from altogether because that way you don't waste your money and you're also at least being an informed consumer and you're staying relatively safe so today we have two different cards as you can see the packaging is also different the strains are different but they're both say tank faiths which is wild and you can see like if you look more closely there is a lot of difference in these cart packages you have this one which shows the card from this side it says 1.1 grams and DANC on the side it has raised sort of like background art I guess I could call that and a holographic dang face logo on the top the front the bottom and the side except this side on this side it says dang clips official account all organic no propylene glycol and on the back it says Ace of Spades is a creation from TGA sub cool seeds that takes advantage of the popular sweet and sour combination that never goes out of style a crossbreed of black cherry soda and Jack the Ripper this strain has an earthy berry and citrus smell that carries over into the taste with distinctly lemony flavours Asus blades pants ace of spades plants grow fast and need a lot of space because they will get both bushy and tall flowering occurs at eight weeks and they are generally large and heavy see the funny thing about Danks vapes is that on the back of all of their carts they just have the leaf Lee articles written right there which I mean I don't hate because it's easy for reviews because I can just read the back of the packaging but like it's also kind of lazy what do you think about it anyway so the Apple Express card we have raised letters but flat background art we have irregular art on the front and Danks waves on the front you can't see the cart from the side but it still says dang faves official account all organic no propylene glycol on this side it says the same thing and it has a holographic tank on the top and bottom the description for pineapple Express after I drop the cart and focus pineapple express combines the potent and flavorful forces of parent strange trainwreck and Hawaiian the smell is like into fresh apple and mango with a taste of pineapple pine and cedar this hard-hitting sativa dominant hybrid provides a long-lasting energetic buzz perfect for productive afternoons and creative escapes so there is the packaging review of these cards now the question is which one is real and which one is fake so after doing a bit of research online you can find that there pretty much four major ways to see whether your dank babes carts are real or fake and that would be looking at the packaging itself which I just showed you guys but now I'll go more into detail with that the Instagram account that's on the side of the packaging the C cell atomizer itself and the wax quality so I'm gonna go over each of these cards one by one and just show you like the different points to look at and then uh I'll go ahead and review them and show you guys how they both hit and I'll give you my opinion on which one tastes better so after doing a bit of research online you find that they're pretty much four major ways to check whether or not you have a legit sort of official tank vapes cart versus a knockoff that your dealer just kind of put some snake oil in the four major ways would be looking at the packaging itself the Instagram account on the side the there are signs on the bottom of these C cell atomizers that'll tell you and a wax quality so in this review I'm gonna be going over each of those four points with each of these carts and showing you which ones are more trustworthy and which ones aren't but then I'm also going to be hitting both of them to show you guys the wax quality and I'll tell you how the hits feel if they're chemically and burn or if they're like sort of smooth and tastes good um and then finally I'll tell you guys about the highs based off each of them so yeah let's get into this review I'm actually pretty excited for starting this recording I did do some like light sort of examinations of these karts to see which ones I thought were real and fake before starting the video and I'll just tell you that right now I'm pretty sure this one is legitimate banks vapes carts and this one is not so let me show you why I think this so according to my research and I'll link all my sources in the description below but first off it says that the dank vapes packaging that is legit has the cart shown on the side and that's kind of funny to me because I've had a dank faves carts like this before which was the strawberry shortcake one and it had the same packaging pretty much exactly except a sort of like red theme because it was obviously strawberry shortcake and that being said I've also had carts that are like the pineapple Express ones I'm going to this more in a little bit let's go back to the Ace of Spades anyway so online it says that legitimate dank babes carts have raised lettering for the stream but like lowered lettering for the actual date vapes logo and the back art should be raised and that the theme of these carts are basically all black secondly on the side it should say dank vapes official account because that is the only actual dank vapes official Instagram account that exists some fake carts will just say like dank vapes official or like dank vapes account but if it doesn't say if it does say tanks beeps official account then usually it should be a more legitimate current than others I say that because as you can see on the pineapple Express it also has the right thing so next up if you open the packaging and you take out the cart first you can look at the wax quality and see that uh this one is a bit runny it's not slow it's sort of uh the air bubble transfer is really fast in superfast which is not really a good sign for wax quality so I would definitely watch out for that oh when I actually hit it I'll be able to tell you more about if the wax like is good but for now I'm not very like excited to try this cart um if you look at the bottom let me see if I can get that to focus okay yeah so you see this K you see a stamp number and you see C so though that shows that this is an official C cell cartridge or atomizer at least zoom out there we go looking beautiful um so yeah as you can see this is a real C cell atomizer with some lower quality wax in it which is kind of funny to me because well I go through the process of like getting the best packaging getting good like atomizers and then putting late some kind of crappy oil in it obviously I'm saying it's crappy just based off of these like visual tests but when I actually get into like tasting it maybe I'll be wrong who knows umm another fun thing that I did look into or my old C cell cart or atomizers so we have this one from the serial curtain they see that this is a real C cell cartridge as the C sell the CA and decay on it if it's a fake it could still have all of these but the font will be um kind of stretched out and big and not like actually etched in to the cart like it is with these um on this traphouse Curt atomizer that's supposed to also be a C so you can see that it doesn't have C cell on it it has like another brand so this would be one of those knockoff sort of atomizers that are sold from China and that's on this trap house card so a lot of companies have been using DC cell cars because they do hit nice and they give you good flavor but some still use legitimate C cells and some also still use like knockoffs so this is the ace of spades one final look before I go on to the pineapple Express and I'll be right back alright so with this pineapple Express cart you can see that you can look at the wax itself and the atomizer from the front of the packaging which if you look online and will say that this would be second-generation tank vapes packaging which I'm not really sure how like believable that is but I mean everything else on the packaging checks out the Leafly description on the back it's got raised lettering on the front and not a raised deck vapes logo but those dang capes logo is still holographic and gold um it's got raised artwork it has the actual like tank vapes account on it and the packaging just feels like it feels quality and premium which i know sounds weird but like if you're getting a fake packaging you can sort of feel that the Pat the paper would be like kind of shitty and not like good quality and thick like this is let's go ahead and open up the packaging and look at the sea salt cartridge itself now looking at the sea solid cellphone this is what leads me to believe that it's a fake because as you can see it checks out it looks fine um the bar in the middle is not thick on some fakes that bar will be hella thick but uh when you look at the bottom of it its it will focus it's a sea cell but it says M 208 when you look up see sell em 208 on google it'll bring up the Jupiter Cecil atomizers and in case you didn't know Cecil also owns Jupiter so like the liquid 610 or batteries and any of the lake Jupiter atomizers are also legitimate Cecil atomizers except for the fact that Cecil atomizers always have to have three prints on the bottom it'll have either Jupiter or that little K C cell and then a a lot number or a serial number this only has two so it can't be an actual C cell cartridge so it's a fake atomizer bought from China but if you look at the wax quality you can see that it's sort of good the bubble is small and it's moving very very slowly so this needs me to believe that the lacked quality itself is either very good or it's mixed with something very thick to make move slower which is why you have to like look at all these sort of uh signs that I'm trying to show you guys versus just like one or two of them so what I'm gonna go ahead and do is throw these cards onto my C cell m3 battery and I'll just show you guys how they hit um just so you can see a bit of like the wax quality and like the clouds you can get but I'm not gonna do a full review until tomorrow because I'd like to have a day with them to actually be able to test the wax quality and the highs because when I'm doing a video on something that could be like like health risks I'd like to at least give you guys a real review that's comprehensive so I think having a day to test like if the wax gives me a headache or if it makes me feel sick or if it just burns and tastes bad like I can tell you that better based off like a full day of using these than just um like a little five-minute review so let me go ahead and take these first hits and then we shall see tomorrow what my final verdict on these cards is I got a new sort of filming spot for now because it's summer and oh my god it is [ __ ] hot as hell in this house anyway so we're gonna be taking our first hits off of these dang babes carts what I'm probably gonna do is I think I'm gonna hit the Pineapple Express one first than the ace of spades second because while I think the Pineapple Express could be a fake I really want to test out this max quality more than anything because really that's what matters when you're buying these carts too is wax quality so let's go ahead and screw it on with the C cell I'm three let's just take a rip cheers guys so as you can see that's a pretty nice cloud I think especially for like a first hit off of a cart that's not even like preheated yet so let me take another hit and then I'll talk about the taste and like how it feels but so far I'm having positive opinions on this it tastes really good it actually tastes like like a bit of mango and pineapple so I'm already becoming a fan of this pineapple Express cart I'm gonna hit it one more time and then I'll go ahead and switch over to ASA spades Cheers yeah yeah I'm definitely a fan of this right now plus as you can see like I'm not coughing right now and if you watch any of my other videos you'll see like Ike off like a [ __ ] with baby lungs so positive opinion on pineapple express tank vapes let's go ahead and check this Ace of Spades over the next we're gonna hit this ace of spades card let's see how that goes okay packaging go ahead and screw it onto the seesaw 11 3 let's take our first rib Cheers okay so it tastes kind of bad and like I don't even think that was a very good cloud from it so let's try again I'm not sure how familiar you are with Indian food but this current sort of tastes like cardamom which is a very big seasoning in Indian food and I'm not a fan of it um it also just kind of burns the back of my throat when I'm hitting it so I'm not really feeling too confident about this an ace of spades card from dang babes let me hit it one more time and see if my opinion can change yeah it is really spicy not spicy but it just really tastes like cardamon and I was expressing a sort of like sour sweet taste so I'm kind of disappointed but either way I don't think it'd be a true mr. blinky review if I didn't hit these cards out of the dab cap just to test them out even further so I got the daily high club piece from a a blue dab cap in this cart let's just hit both of them through the dab cap for today I'll see how they feel then tomorrow I'll come back at you with like a full review so Cheers on the Ace of Spades so late even ripping it out of it to have cab it took forever in a cloud of the piece and then it still just didn't even taste good so hazel speeds right now I definitely have a negative opinion of it it could change you to eat today and tomorrow but for now I really think this pineapple Express is gonna be the better card let me go and load it up and then I'll take it through the top cap and they will end for you today all right so we got the pineapple Express on the dab cap let's go ahead and hit it through this piece and then I'll catch you guys tomorrow Cheers okay so I cut out the coffee but they ain't very nice you could see the cloud it was very uh thick and dense and it tasted amazing it made me coffee lot that was because I think it was just a really good hit so i'ma go ahead and review these carts in like my personal use and then tomorrow come back and tell you guys like which one is better or not I can tell you right now though I am fried as hell so one of these carts are maybe even both of them who knows they definitely work so yeah I'll see you guys in the next day I've been vaping on to ace of spades which is this current and the Pineapple Express since yesterday evening and I think I have an actual good review for each of them so my ace of spades review would be that the atomizer itself doesn't nearly hit as hard as the Pineapple Express won which in retrospect isn't necessarily a bad thing because it means this wax will last longer then the pineapple Express wax but it'll also take you considerably longer to get high initially when you're trying to smoke in um the high on it lasts three and a half to five hours which was really cool and the way I can describe the high for me at least was that it made me feel kind of tired but relaxed enough and like it also helped me focus enough that I could edit like this video as well as do some studying so that was really cool I really like that so I'm a fan of the high for that the negatives of it would be that it did make me feel a bit paranoid which I'm not a fan of because like just having like general anxiety this cart made that a bit worse so I would definitely only smoke this car at night and if I'm trying to actually like either just go to sleep or maybe get something done at night other than that I would not smoke this during the day simply because it would make me paranoid and it just doesn't seem worth it especially when the Pineapple Express makes me feel pretty like energetic imma go into it more in a second but like my overall review of the Ace of Spades would probably be a 6 out of 10 it would get a 7 if the atomizer hit a little bit better and if it didn't make me paranoid but uh I would recommend these dang babes carts pretty much only if you don't have any other choices or if your other choices are like exotic carts or Mario karts cuz these are at least a bit better than those but they're not like amazing so yeah that was the a subspace I'm gonna take another hit as the final review hit of this cart so cheers guys hope you're vaping along or smoking something let's get it so ya didn't cough so that's nice it's a nice smooth hit this is a fully charged C cell m3 so yeah Ace of Spades six out of ten would recommend only as an alternative for like worst cards now let's get to this pineapple Express find out will Express if you guys can remember is the fake cart which is funny to me because it's my first cart out of the two um the wax is definitely thicker and it hits better than the ace of spades cart but like I said the ace of spades cart is definitely gonna last a lot longer than this one um the high off of this cart makes me feel a bit energetic helpfully focus on my tasks and one of my favorite things is that it makes music sound a lot better and more clear which I'm always a fan of when I'm smoking because I love listening to music um well I was a high off this drain I went on a walk I cooked dinner and I cleaned my room so definitely a very very like good day stream especially if you have some stuff to get done I'm about to edit or finish editing this video on this high so I'm very excited for that which is funny to say because like editing is boring but uh now this card makes everything feel a bit more like interesting and definitely just helps me focus better um a negative of this cart would be that I sort of felt maybe a little bit aggressive at like when I was coming down from the high so I'm not really a fan of that but other than that it's pretty much all positives this car I would give like an 8 out of 10 it's better than a lot of other like brands that I've had like chrono Polly is not as good as damn boots but it's uh it's as good as most of the other dang babes I've had so it's funny to say but I kind of almost prefer this little fake packaging on the pineapple Express card just so y'all can see it hopefully it's in frame like this is packaging that you can buy generically but the wax ended up being better quality than the real dang vapes so I guess what I would do if I were you guys would really be to just test that wax quality by like flipping it because it seems to me like that is what is like the biggest indicator of if your wax is gonna be good quality versus like if it's an actual see saw cartridge looking at the packaging really all you got to look at is wax quality because all of these cards are fake although they're not fake but like all of them are illegitimate and they all have the pesticides in the loop so at this point you just gotta like choose which is the biggest bang for your buck and the biggest like risk you want to take and I really don't think this is bad quality wax like it tastes fine to me and it doesn't really hurt let's just take a hit so I can show you guys it takes so amazing I really can't express that enough but uh yeah so eight out of ten would HIGHLY highly recommend the pineapple express if you ever come across it um make sure to stay informed and try to stay safe guys cuz like this [ __ ] black market card business it's kind of wild I'm learning more about it everyday and I'm just gonna keep like showing you guys what I learned I hope you enjoyed the video welcome to the channel if you made it this far please subscribe and like and I'll catch y'all later stay warm lacet Cheers", "JHuSstnceBE": "do you have a cartridge and you're having a hard time refilling it I'm going to show you how to remove the mouthpiece from these cartridges in a way that they can then be reused or the oil can be recovered from them now the tools that I'm going to be utilizing are simply a common pair of vise grips and these are going to be csail one mil or one gram disposable one-time use ceramic coil cartridges let's take this to the deck okay well here we are once again these are one-time use non removable sea cells as you can see right here this is a sea sell brand we're going to take a pair of vice grips common rice clips and we're going to adjust them so when we apply them we apply them just at the base of that metal see how it's just barely barely at the base of that metal right there and we want to close it so it closed it just a little bit it pinches down just ever so slightly nothing cracks it barely bows and then you rock it back and forth rather firmly now there you have it you will get some flyer marks on the mouthpiece but if you look this caller right here which is what you want to preserve is undamaged completely undamaged okay now well there's the silicone ring right there that will seal around this shaft so you don't worry about that now in this outer sheath you can see that it is also undamaged all right I will show you again on this one here you take the pliers right at the base of the metal hinge it lock it back and forth pulling the cartridge off of the mouthpiece just like that [Applause] very simple easy there you have it", "SBiNwQibNzQ": "we're outside of dispenser here in illinois and we're actually going to be approaching people to let them try delta 8 thc

so if you were to buy that car or just let's say if you were to sell that car how much would you say it's worth from like zero to 100 like in terms of dollars that's the currency okay if i were to sell it i could sell it for 69. what do you think about the taste crisp clear crisp and clear it's piney you know what like yeah if you got a taste for it you know exactly what you want if you don't smoke tsc very much excuse me i mean taste and flavor-wise yeah that's worth the money that's why it's worth any dollar amount you assigned to right up to i'd say 60 70 bucks i could pick me worth it

ready to take on the day ready to take on the day well what would you say on a scale like of one to ten how what do you think about the cart taste nine smoothies that's pretty good nice i don't know pretty i mean they're up there if you were to buy that at let's say that dispensary right there how much you think they charge you for it they charge like 80 bucks for stuff like this yeah so if you go to the dispensary there for a point five card it's like a hundred dollars after tax yeah definitely so they're you're definitely getting taxed so with this stuff because it's hemp there's no like

we are in top gear with our top performance tank that we just launched here in three colors today's brief episode is gonna run through this awesome 510 thread tank which is gonna put definitely big sub ohm style power into your regular 510 thread batteries that you have available we have them here in three awesome colors and I have paired them with three of our awesome batteries just to showcase and accentuate exactly how nice they look we're gonna run through some of the performance specs get you guys some close-ups of this tank as well as show you how to fill it so without any further ado let's just jump right in here we have our performer tank let's get a close-up with these three nice colors we have this wonderful rainbow color which is our multicolor as you can see here I have it paired with our B master battery or a little three temperature battery you see it changes colors as the light hits it from the stainless steel mouthpiece each one of these tanks has a glass reservoir and two millimeter orifice openings with a ultra low resistance coil in there for fast heat up times as well as good flavor the block on here is a ceramic so it's got ceramic performance but it heats up faster than your standard ceramic now let me show you the stainless here we have the stainless steel performer tank I paired it with our stainless steel Gold Line battery as you can see it's a very good match each one of these tanks is a half Milka Pet fill capacity on it and we're going to jump into how to fill it very quickly and also we have a nice gold finished which I've paired with our Black Gold Line vape battery nothing like mi is a black and gold like a honey stick color okay so each one of these glasses is made out of Pyrex the internals are actually made of a stainless steel as well as the mouthpiece so just can be very durable it's gonna feel very high-end and rugged for your glass tank it's not gonna feel like one of those little flimsy glasses that you know you squeeze on it's gonna break you know it's a pretty solid tank now one thing I do want you guys a note is this will work with a majority of your 510 thread batteries and also your push button concealers however because it does not have an air hole right here let's get a close-up right here on the thread because it does not have an air hole here this is not gonna work with your auto draw battery so don't try to pair this up with your bee box with your elf or your auto draw stick batteries because it's not going to be compatible you're gonna need a push button battery to power this thing up now if you're powering this up on mod batteries I don't recommend you really go over 10 watts because then you could hurt the taste but this one will take a little bit more power than your standard vape cartridges that I would normally only recommend you run it like seven seven-and-a-half watts now how do you fill this tank this is a little bit more of a process and you do have to be careful because you don't want to overfill and you don't really want to top these off because then you could make a mess so let's go into how you're gonna fill these now if you're one of those guys who orders ten cartridges at a time on our website you know who you are there's a lot of you out there that are filling your own cartridges this is actually a really easy cartridge for you guys to fill if you guys are feeling quite a few cartridges because it's very simple you just unscrew the top piece and the whole center post comes out so you have this really nice big filling area and the tank stands securely on its thread so you have this wonderful nice filling area that you can fill with a syringe you don't have what you have with several other to where they would have a center post that blocks up a majority of it where you're filling on the outer edges and with really thicker oils that can be a real problem for you to fill because the oil kind of doesn't it doesn't pour down fast enough and it kind of comes out over the edges and can take a really long time with this it's very simple you have a big fill surface area you could put thick gunky oils in there and wait for the oil to kind of sludge it down and you don't have to worry about coming out from around the sides or bending the center post the one thing you need to be careful of when you're filling it is don't fill it beyond this max line because when you put the center post and the top assembly back in you're gonna cover up and that that level is of the oils is going to come straight up to the top and if you fill above that max line it's gonna come out the sides and you're gonna waste your precious oils or CBDs so just to demonstrate how he would fill it I have some gold lines TVD here what is it it's our 500 natural gonna purge it a little bit all right so I'm just going to slowly fill it I check my level nope I went a little bit over the max line because I wanted you guys to see it more than I was trying to do a good job so I'm just gonna take a little bit out yeah that looks right about perfect I mean I still might be just a hair over but what we're gonna do now priming this tank is really simple all's you have to do is make sure when you're putting it in and you're screwing it in you do that very very slowly then once you have it screwed on tight you're just gonna let it sit for about 20 minutes and these these pores are wide enough to where it's gonna be pretty good priming for the tank so I'm gonna go ahead and very slowly put that in okay you put on too fast the oil could shoot up too quickly and then it can come out the sides as well and you don't want that then you want to get a nice good hand tight on it don't over tighten it but you're gonna feel the gasket make contact with the metal and you're gonna feel it compress right when you feel that you stop which is I felt that let's take a look at this level yeah it looks pretty much like it's right up to the top like I said you don't want to top these off then you're gonna put it onto your battery and generally I would let this sit for about 20 minutes but also you can do to prime as once you've let sit for the 20 minutes because I'm not actually gonna be vaping on this right now is if you click it twice it goes into preheat mode you see it flashing that means it's preheating so with that really low voltage heat cycle did it put soother your heater is actually priming I'll let it run through the preheat cycle of it priming once it's done flashing I'm gonna put it into the temperature I desire let's say I want to go middle and it is ready to vape if I want to go higher oh yeah I can hear fizzling so this is now ready to vape make sure that you guys definitely get a good prime on the tank you do not want to you do not want to you know fill it up right away start ripping on it at a high temperature and then you're gonna get a metallic taste because that's gonna ruin your vaping experience is a nice ceramic high performance cartridge you definitely want to enjoy the taste that it has in it so make sure that's properly primed and you set it up good and then this is definitely gonna be one of the higher performance small tanks that you have in your arsenal so I hope this video was informative for you like I said you can check it out in one of its three colors pair it with any one of our nice honey

they have this brand hold on Cheers hmm tastes just like it bro tastes just like jacker and his/her area shout out man shout outs of eating bro this is my first time ever trying this brand whoa that cough came kind of late whoo my first hit Tom wants his brand-new Club this cannabis club and they have freaking like sauce diamond cards dude oh dude let me [ __ ] I want to search that [ __ ] up but I want to see a thing is instead of searching it up I'm gonna just have to reveal it but some guy was like the bud center I was like oh so out of all these brands are here man which shouldn't like do you recommend what should you like he's like this is a new one you know he's like a lot of people like that raw garden cart so I'll select cards sneezies they got the pax pax is a little bit different I think that's that's a little bit different they got some one will caught a battery or something they calm darts the darts or something like that something like that and he told me that this is like the necks of up-and-coming brand and I'm like okay you know what I gotta test this [ __ ] out you know first of all let's do that quick little test yup stuck no one oh [ __ ] so you know we're not smoking a hot dog water cuz we smoke that [ __ ] once the one like oh oh the state just like decorate honestly it really just tastes just exactly like the [ __ ] like distrain to be honest with you guys like so little piney some five sativa 81.4 six percent THC so we're getting to the low where the low 80s right here so it's just cool you know it's a nice little wake and bake I did actually smoke a little bit earlier this new dish with the foot I did actually wake them back using this and I got a man the high is not too strong you know it's not like crazy you're not crazy lit you're feeling it but you know you're definitely so it's cool you know especially like for like morning jobs and sure you don't want to get too baked but you want to kind of get baked just to kind of like you know go on with the morning you know does that make sense it doesn't matter because I don't I don't make sense you know but you know cuz like against like rock garden real raw garden is a cartridge that you're gonna get [ __ ] baked but like I'll take like two three roots of that [ __ ] and I'm at all cloud ten there's some [ __ ] cloud 22 have you guys ever known as I hit this is it like a blast I'll grab the shell be that she kind of packs a punch the taste tillow piney little bit you know little piney come out with like a lot of new cartridges and stuff like that and I to be honest with you guys and I'm gonna be real with you guys man I don't think cartridges are healthy for you whatsoever I mean if you think about it hers has you know some flour that shit's been around for a minute and wax and all that shit's been around for like would they see like 3040 years or some [ __ ] you know like 40 years I think so it's like with all this new [ __ ] coming out and all these like chemicals are sick of man I you know what this is 100% cannabis you know it's 100% but sometimes when you guys buy certain brands I mean these are cool these are cool these are all like you know I think they're they're they're FDA approved you know they're like they're legal you know 100% legal it's been tested all that [ __ ] so I can't do like no crazy arm obviously smoking wax can cause like can cause harm over time you know I can [ __ ] damage your lungs all that smoke no matter if it's bait cigarettes whatever smoke [ __ ] I suppose being your life mashup fuk so but as I was saying like I feel like a lot of there's probably a lot of companies [ __ ] [ __ ] there's a lot of companies out there a lot of wax cartridge companies right we're gonna sell you some fire [ __ ] you're gonna be smoking that [ __ ] but little do we know man that has some type of chemical that could cause cancer like 30 40 years down the line yo and that's what a lot of people are saying to like when you guys are smoking try not to like over smoke trying to get all crazy with them because again these cards bro we're smoking them these cards came out I was even [ __ ] high school Bravo's out of high school these [ __ ] came out I first came I first got my first card back in like 2016 honestly like in 2016 and I'm just like damn it's only been out for like five under like six who knows how many years let me know in the comments down below like what year was the first year you guys got your first cartridge but I was like oh it was 2016 I got my first brass knuckles you know I got it off a plug - so a little did I know spice smoking some fake-ass [ __ ] you know who [ __ ] knows I've never seen a cartridge none of mine but besides the one that I reviewed on this channel - super Lemon Haze that fake art besides that one other than that you know I've never had a cart that it was like watery inside all the carts I've ever had in my entire life always had you know it was always thing but again you never know so it's just like I think about it somebody that smokes cards I can tell you guys a story right now man the time I apply some fake cards I don't even know it one time I bought six cards right cuz it was like a deal was like a hundred and something for like six like six cards right so I'm like [ __ ] it right let's put my plug again this was like two or three years ago for my playground like lucky I bought six cards dude's albums [ __ ] it was the first time to where I was like walking in my house and [ __ ] and I was just puffing on the shamino was all my [ __ ] but you know and you know when when I had the family [ __ ] I'd be in my room just puffing on that [ __ ] you know gaming watching the movie getting [ __ ] baked in my room and I was like bruh it's just sick I don't stink I don't go I don't lose I don't gotta go out of my way shit's a row sum up you know and [ __ ] go song something stink you know era like [ __ ] this shagging I could just get kicked back slap charge my charge my battery put this [ __ ] on take it [ __ ] bag Jesus whoo anyways I suppose six cards and under like like a week and a half or likes imagine that six cards for us like a [ __ ] full last gram for like two days smoking but I would wake up in the middle of the night coughing I would cough cough all the time especially when I would I would wake up in the middle of the night in my throat would be so itchy I had to take off medicine and I would always cough all the time bro all the time and I was like look bud and I stopped smoking Carson are like you know that bro mm-hmm to be honest with each other I think I was smoking them fake cards all right but uh bless my health right bless my lungs and I was like [ __ ] dude but anyways like stuff like that right I'm thinking about that there's still [ __ ] little fake cards being sold out to like a bunch of like high schoolers and [ __ ] like that like people who shouldn't even be smoking in the first place it has like it's batch number and all the shit's like it's manufactured the company their license you know it's just snatched and it's just all natural you know it's like natural cannabis you know and it even talks about here so what's the company has a license and all that [ __ ] then you should be pretty [ __ ] good you know you got a as our license you know but a [ __ ] man has a lot of warnings out here man I would just say my advice is try not to smoke a [ __ ] load of cards you know limit your self to like two three quarts [ __ ] a month you know what I try to do is I try to limit myself to like I would say maybe like a half gram cart this is me halftime cart like every like 12 to 14 days so like a week we can have two like two weeks you know around there you know that's what I would say I'd give it maybe like two weeks sometimes if I if I another notice when I caught carts I caught maybe like three a month to be honest with you guys and they're not even four grams you know this month I would say let's see what did I review I've reviewed probably one 1/2 gram of select 1/2 gram of bra garden and then a full gram of all pounding this thoughts about like teen Rams and a half you know I'm not bad I guess [ __ ] I'm telling you guys man I know hello people that bro no [ __ ] kill a [ __ ] half Grammy today and I'm like although [ __ ] me eyes imagine you know so that I'll

cannabis patient a patient a new let's you can see like a new cannabis patient they don't really know much about cannabis and they don't really like smoking smoking but they do like baby you know there's like you know what it's [ __ ] crazy man it blows my mind how there's so many people there's another like a good there's another group of people that are older they're like you know London late thirties in [ __ ] and one time like it's like kind of I got a family party right family friends all that [ __ ] right and one time I was just like we're just drinking whatever again everybody

out of mass and [ __ ] were telling the Machine run and what's the crazy part about it is that now when he has like little get-togethers or some [ __ ] you see this fool with the [ __ ] battery like he doesn't really suck cigarettes anymore I'm like oh my head I'm like down we could have potentially like saved his [ __ ] life that day literally for him like this would like see his [ __ ] body because he says that you could smoke these anywhere and you get like a head high and my head I'm like oh my and I had were like no that's you're literally just high you know he said well it feels like it feels like you know I've smoked a cigarette but it's like the beginning the beginning feeling of the cigarette which is the head high he's got but I feel like that for like two hours and in my head when I tell you know he's sick he's like fallings an animal you know we're like we're like down but technically shoes go from smoking cigarettes every day to smoking this [ __ ] and he doesn't in any sense doesn't really buy a lot he says he only smokes maybe like like three or four of the big ones at a month big ones so it's like a gram you know he smokes like three four grams I'm like you know what back there needs to smoke like two three cigarettes a day so I'm like you know what that's cool I mean [ __ ] it's still unhealthy as [ __ ] this [ __ ] but hey you know what better than smoking tobacco right it sounds like damn dude we could probably we just [ __ ] expanded his life his [ __ ] life right there dude like who could've who knows [ __ ] crazy man 20 30 years from now bro he could have had lungs all [ __ ] up brooch and but then again you know 20 40 years from now bro [ __ ] knows what kind of what what what the what the wax would do to us I say you know I'm just I'm just trying to speak the truth you know it's like who knows you know in reality like getting it go good or could go bad you know hopefully it goes good you know cuz this is all tested and all that [ __ ] but hey sometimes man some companies bro the labels you just can't but then again if you buy it at a club bro then it's you should be fine you know just don't abuse it that's it it's gonna be zit

thank you for taking your time and watching them i also want to welcome other new youtube subscribers twitter followers and instagram followers to the family remember to click the subscribe button below to join the fam that way you don't miss out on any new episodes new giveaways and more let's get right to it on this video i'm going to tell you about the all glass 1 milliliter vape cartridges that i got from o2 vape dot com by delivery order i paid 40.99 for five of these cartridges i could have gotten one by itself for 9.99 but i can't do just one of anything this right here is the most beautiful coil system i have ever ever seen gravity does its job oil is absorbed by a ceramic coil and it vaporizes so flavorful on this beauty i have run at least six syringes through my main cart and it still hasn't clogged due to its design this is the cartridge side at the top even the paper pass is 100 glass too makes any oil tasted on this is the tank put together after the first fill as you can see once the oil had gone to the glass part of the cartridge i removed the blue phillip tool first and then i installed the coil on the cartridge by just screwing them together as usual we will start with the cons the first con i found was that learning how to fill the tank was a steep learning curve for me and i'm used to filling up tanks the syringes with the plastic tip in the end will need the little blunt tip extension that will fill it'll fill the card without spilling over that's the only issue i found with this tank as of now onto the pros because the design is all glass the tip never gets hot so i can use it all day long without ever burning my lips the flavor on these cards is amazing on every single hit no matter how much you use it through the day plus due to the coil design it doesn't take more than three to five hits in between strains to see the flavor change completely and cleanly they are super easy to clean if needed for example i spilled some oil into the vapor path while filling up the first one and i was able to just stick a q-tip dipped in alcohol in there to clean it right up i don't know what it is about being able to see right through the whole thing or being able to see the vapor path fill up and empty out as i hit it that just warms up my heart it makes me giddy inside too i can honestly say i had never up to this point in my life used a cartridge that didn't clog this one i haven't been able to clog it up yet that alone makes it the winner in my book then you add the flavor and how long they last come on now and as i sherry on top there is the savings from buying your oil and syringes instead of paying extra for the cards every time you need oil that right there turns in from a winner into a champion in my book i use these cards all day and night i hope this helps you medicate right have a great day", "UiPTL9knP3E": "[Music] hey welcome to cbd headquarters in my last video about delta 8 i explain to you what you use

prices are so stay dialed in if you leave you're just going to spend more trying to find the right cbd the right dosages so stay clicked in go down on the bottom click that subscribe button so you don't miss my videos my content uh i don't want anything all i want to do is see a smile on everyone's face there's tons of natural products that we we could all use uh whether it's sleep um anxiety stress uh pains epilepsy there's uh autism so let's stay on the subject let me show you uh by starting out with the tinkatures that are available in unflavored cbd so these are the delta eights that i spoke about in the last program actually only one of them is this one the 500 milligram delta eight by creating better days it's an incredible delta a product that you could use by just squeezing the dropper getting a full dropper about an hour before you go to bed because it takes some time to kick in and this will help you sleep through the entire night the price range uh for these tinkeaters that i'm going to be talking about both flavored and unflavored are 50 to 70 so not a lot for a great product that i vetted and i take and i know it works and retailers professionals whether they're sport and medicine doctors that are also on board of retail shops that are using them and selling them like health food shops that are uh in alliance with us are seeing and getting great feedback from customers that are looking for products to help them sleep through the whole night uh they have four or five hours like me that they could sleep they have a tremendous day ahead of them and they can't risk you know crappy sleep and they just don't want to take the synthetic ambience and whatever else there is available for you that makes you groggy so another thing to talk about is these things don't make you groggy they have no flavor they could be added to salads being that they're flavorless beverages as well whether it's a tea or a coffee so the new bottle is a thousand milligrams so it's double the strength and from fifty dollars to seventy dollars for only twenty dollars or more you get double the strength so if you were taking two droppers like i was uh because i have a high tolerance of the 500 you can now only take one and one bottle lasts you for the entire month now i'm going to talk about because we covered the dosages we covered the flavors um and the pricing the flavored uh tinkatures what's available in the flavored i did show you in the last video the mango and the strawberry shortcake these are 600 milligrams and i love these i know uh comes the nighttime hour before i take my delta eight uh if it's just flavored and i'm not adding it to the beverage like the other one i just showed you i know i'm gonna sleep the whole night so and i know whoever i give this to is gonna enjoy their sleep their whole night so these are also great products in that 70 price range as well but remember if you did subscribe uh to my channel you could then go use the code youtube sub on the site and get 20 off anything you buy one everything one time or all the time so remember to subscribe and use that code youtube sub uh at checkout for your 20 off at tinkeature make sure you shake up the tinkature before you take it and it's got that child seal so you're gonna have to push it down make sure when you pinch and you fill it up with oil that um you'll see it's only half so when i say take a full dropper i mean a full dropper so if you only got half make sure to take another half all right just making sure we're all on the same page now we're going to go to the fun category which is gummies and quite a few have been added since the last video just like in the oils the last video what we did is we went over the gummies the blueberry raspberry rings that are 25 milligrams each there's a 10 uh piece or 20 piece so 250 milligrams is 10 pieces obviously and the 500 is 20. these are great products they do take a little bit more time to kick in i'm going to open them up and show them to you so one of these blueberry uh delta eight rings is 25 milligrams uh you take it about uh two hours before um you know takes a little time to kick in some people say one to two for me it's almost two hours so that's why i say two hours allow some time for it to uh kick in um price range so these are only 30 for the 10 piece and 45 dollars only 15 dollars more you get double the quantity so there's your layup shot if you want to try it for 30 dollars and then you're sold on it and you love it you can get some value right there by doing just what i said another important thing about these guys is they're vegan so they use a plant-based binding material as opposed to gelatin which is the next set of gummies that i'm going to talk about that are delta eight so i hope you got all the information on the pricing and the dosages just to go over again is one of these to two of these if you have a high tolerance like me it's two if not you're fine with one uh take it about two hours before and you should be good to go all of these are on the site in the delta eight section the next one i'm going to talk about is sun state this is 30 piece 300 or 600 milligram gummies and they come in two different sizes 300 milligram or 600 milligram and each bottle has totally different flavors so the one that we did last month was a delta eight sun state 300 milligram which had great flavors blueberry mango and watermelon and all of the tastes of these cubes um like i said are amazing the the second you put this thing on your tongue you start salivating so these little cubes come in those three different flavors that i told you and moving on to the double strength 600 milligram which puts you at 20 milligrams a piece to the 10 milligrams a piece you have different flavors so the flavors here are strawberry grape and passion fruit which is by far my favorite flavor uh in anything i don't know if it's yours but it's definitely mine um these are the feedback we get on these 20 milligrams is that they're more potent taking one of these than taking two of these gummies so you could actually buy the 600 milligram and cut it in half and that should be good to get you to sleep um pricing these are now 300 milligrams are down to 42 bucks from the 60 70 dollar area if not more depending on where you're going and on the delta 8 600s they're down to where the three hundreds were in that 69 area so if you want to pick up really potent gummies that are excellent and do the job to get you to sleep and stay asleep uh these are them the flavors are amazing there's 30 count in each of these bottles and it's definitely something to write on your list as a keeper oh yeah the professor's here so let's get this program started dosages for the delta 8. each little cube they have those three different flavors uh the mango the blueberry and the watermelon and in the 600 milligram you have the passion fruit the grape and the strawberry so those you could cut in half again if you wanted to see those little cubes they're easy to slice in half and very effective so these delta eights are 10 milligrams you could take two to three of these to go to bed so moving on to the carts that are available there's quite a few we're going to start off with the creating better days 500 milligram cart and these will require that you go out and buy a pen however if you shop with me on my site anytime you buy your delta 8 carts i'm going to do a special promo where i send you a free battery that you could use with your carts so there's a ton of different carts different flavors that i'm going to talk about that are delta 8 right now but first i want to show you how to use them so you could use a standard 510 pen any one of them will do the trick just take your cart right out of the packaging and get it ready to screw onto your battery screw it on press your battery five times to get it on and then you'll hold down inhale and hold it in for at least three seconds and when you exhale wait about 20 minutes before you take another hit these things are strong they're potent because you're inhaling them they get right into your system right to work and you should feel relaxed right away so the flavors that i'm going to go over now that you know how to use your vape pen and the proper dosage are um well let's start with this one this one doesn't have uh flavor so if you don't want to have that overpowering um candyish perfumey taste not that the other ones have that then this is this is the item for you creating better day's 500 milligram uh nano delta cbd very strong very good and you can get it for only 55 bucks it's 1 ml so it's a full tank it's a quality tank and you're going to enjoy the benefits from this product okay so sun state you're going to be uh looking at a couple of fun flavors like apple fritter blue dream um i think i messed up with the color looking it on the screen sour diesel blue dream apple fritter banana kush and a strawberry lemonade so those are five sick flavor carts that are amazing delicious and uh they work great so i hope you loved this program i hope you're gonna stay tuned into my channel the next program i'm going to put out is a special all about sleep products every single thing you could tape take for sleeping in cbd whether they're capsules or their gummies or other products so if you want to find out you've got to subscribe have a great day happy 21.

indeed guys so we have this blueberry delta eight cartridge that's coming from farmer extracts and um this is a blueberry flavor guys so if you like blueberry i'm pretty sure you're gonna like this i've been smoking on it [Music] and the blueberry is like a blueberry gusher or something it's just real candy like and with this cart guys blueberry is in abundance i don't know exactly how much but let me show you guys something you can scan this code right here let me cover my face you can scan that code right there and it'll let you know exactly how much terps and everything is inside of here but i'm gonna tell you the ingredients is hemp derived cannabinoids blend terrapins of course and other hemp compounds it says it's made in the u.s it's 100 hemp derived no cutting agents it's terrapin infused delta eight that's under it's under the 0.3 delta nine percent gaza right and i have to let you guys know the effects now that's interesting okay so it doesn't tell me if it's an indica or anything but um i'm gonna tell you guys now the effects is uppity so i'm going with sativa on it it doesn't really tell me [Music] it doesn't tell me if it's a sativa or indica guys so we're just gonna go with sativa because of the way i feel i've been smoking it for a little while so far today just i could be able to tell you guys the effects and um like i said i got to tell you it's a good um effect that that comes along with this car it's just for me it's too sweet i like it to taste like cannabis that's the only flavor i like i'm sorry but it's not nasty don't get it wrong it's not nasty it's just too sweet for me okay but i know a lot of people a lot of my friends a lot of people actually like that they don't want to know that they're smoking something else they want it to taste like candy okay so that's good in a way but for me it's not but it's not that bad i mean you see i'm still smoking [Music] you can get this at the calm leaf what you got to do is type in smoke dot check out duh jeez nah guys but yeah go ahead check out the website the calm leaf all right guys that's where i got this from and it's pharma extracts and this is the blueberry delta eight cartridge okay so it's 100 natural smoke doctors signing out right now but i will be back with another review soon guys [Music] peace [Music] you", "nqT_otOuUnM": "what's going on guys welcome to the deaf connection and today we're gonna be telling you the difference between real authentic and fake serial cards so before I even say anything about this I just want to say quickly about the company there's no like telling if this is even a legit company to begin with so there's like no information to be found on them online the only thing I did find was an Instagram account but it's private so you can't see anything at all and apart from that dang creeps show them a lot in their Instagram accounts so like if not every day every other day they'll be posting sharing cereal carts and a lot of people know cereal cars by 10 faves actually but with that being said because they're unknown if they're legit or an authentic company in the first place they could be fake overall but we're still not too sure and um we did encounter like this is a legit when a supposedly quote-unquote real one and we did get fake ones we knew we noticed right away so the first indicator to tell if they're fake was not packaging so check this out the one in the right is fake right this one's fake or this one's real this one's real the one that has oil in it or distal is fake and look maybe a little hard to see but if it's a little difficult to tell the one in the right has a lot more holograph like a holograph package to end appointing left doesn't at all so hey let me show you the back actually so you can see a little better yeah I don't know if you could tell from this video we look at that on the logo or says serial cards to see how the one in her eyes a lot more shinier than the left so that's a huge indicator right away both of these cartridges are plain looking like bland that you could say they have no shine or hologram to it whatsoever so that's the main indicator a another one is the coloring the packaging so if you take a look this one's actually a lot more lighter the cereal itself is a lot more lighter than this one like this one's a darker stronger color not darker but stronger color so just a really light faded go6 internet so scrunch one so with that with a packaging excuse me with the packaging you can tell that right away but you could also tell with the cartridge itself so the serial card stands beeps and all of those companies they use authentic cecil cartridges and this thing you can actually tell this um with this you could tell if they're fake with dankmemes c or any other cards that you see sell cartridges but okay let me show you and another thing the oil is a sometimes the oil will be really really dark or really light make a strong clear gold color it usually it it should always look like this actually like with these fake ones the oil looked exactly the same so and they're not like too dense to quality oh and i've had to tell you another thing to notice is the taste so the every single car should taste literally exactly the same as this whatever the strain is these ones didn't taste nothing like the cereal itself it just tastes like artificial chemicals and flavors and vapors pretty much it wasn't strong but it was it was a light taste too but it still don't say it's that good so another indicator to tell is if they're authentic cecil cartridges check to so it's a little hard to tell if you can see that this only says Cecil it's just say all three stems here I'll show an image right now but it's just say all three stamps the case stamp see so and a see a stem and apart from that they should all have a the same font style they shouldn't be a different different color and misplaced or different font sizes or anything like that they should look exactly like the one that shown an image right now so yeah those are the main indicators to tell there's legit or even if they are legit legit cereal carts so you know a lot of fake vendors are something a lot of Chinese manufacturers are selling these things so alright before I let you guys go I'm on let me just show you really quick how this hits well you can see anything I'm Trevor yeah not very sad anything at all but those smoke is really light another thing I realized with these fake off and not been sexy cell cartridges the atomizer is weak so I have one pointers I was actually collecting a lot of reclaim up here I switched the batteries to a stronger stronger battery and it didn't go away but yeah those are how to had identify the fake serial cards if you guys ever encountered these have any information about them at all please post them in the comments below I love hearing about this and hope to see you guys soon see you later guys", "JCHnclO36Fg": "yo what's going on guys intro bringing you a new youtube video if you guys give me a huge favorite like comment subscribe to this video comment down below what you're smoking on make sure you turn on post notifications so you would never miss a video once we hit 1k supporters we're going to be giving away 50 dollars so make sure you guys stay tuned for that let's get right into the video but today you guys we are going to be doing some push cards we are going to be doing the apple flitter i do want to say a couple of things about these cards i have smoked a couple of them and i have tried a couple of them and i do want to tell you guys the downside to these cards and what i do not like and what i like about them but tell you the downsides and what i do not like you know because these cards have a lot of things that i do not like and review the flavor from one to ten i have smoked different push carts before and i want to tell you guys down things that i do not like about and what is it about the cart that i do not like so i'm just gonna open this up right here like i said you guys if you guys want to verify that and know if it's real you guys can scan it right there but as you guys can see i'm gonna peel this off and once you peel it off the sticker should stick on like this i pulled it all the way off but the sticker should stick on to like right there like that the lettering and we're gonna open this up and i do want to tell you guys a couple of things about these cards and say what i'd not like about one that the oil of the wax moves quite fast you know you guys i'm gonna say that right off the bat as you guys can see look at the oil it moves quite fast a little faster than the krtz you know but the characters don't even move or the mohammed's don't even move but these you can tell when they move especially when you hit them it gets really hot and yeah you guys the wack starts moving like crazy but that's one thing i do not like about these cards when you're taking many hits and you're doing consistent hits you know of course the wax is going to come out of the freaking circle where you inhale right but once you stop you know smoking it some of the wax stays stuck onto like the cart of the tip and you can see right through it as you guys can see you guys this is like see-through you can see right through it but you can see the wax later on when you're emptying the cart you can see the wax stuck onto the edge of the tips of right here like everything around where my finger is as you guys can see everything around this whole part you can see and i'm gonna show you guys what i mean in a little bit but as always yeah we're gonna review the flavor from one to ten high white flavor-wise and i like how the wax moves fast you know and i do not like how the center inside the wax stay stuck onto the tip you know the wax um smoke it reflects and turns into a wax on the tip see but i'm gonna take a couple hits you guys let's just get right into it this is a apple flare review let's get it it tastes kind of weird hey guys it tastes [ __ ] weird i'm not like it does not taste like apple but see what i mean by the wax moving fast like let me show you guys that's what i mean by the wax moving fast the wax is running quite fast we're gonna take another hit but the waxes went quite fast i could see it in my screen i might i don't know if you guys can tell on camera i'm gonna take another hit it does not taste like apple flare i'm already telling you the flavor is disgusting is zero out of ten i do not like it tastes like nothing near apple flavor normally it tastes like a tropical you know and just tastes awfully disgusting you guys and i don't like it but now the high is like whatever i guess it could be a 6 out of 10 but the flavor is really disgusting i don't know i like it this is the downside to these cards and i like these pushcarts are not okay you know i don't know like um so far i smoked a couple of them and i like i have reviews on those i will be uploading those sometime soon but i'm not sure when but i want to show you guys this one in particular because i've already smoked a lot of them and i want to you know give my honest opinions about these and these are not going good for me you guys i'm being real with y'all and i like them much but we're gonna take another hair you guys make sure you guys have that wax out and yeah just know i'm not enjoying this hit [ __ ] it yep kind of does taste this [ __ ] raw apple not gonna [ __ ] lie you guys but this was the apple flare review guys i do not like it and the high is six out of ten like i said and the flavor is zero out of ten i don't know i like it this [ __ ] is wack i'm not gonna lie these push cards i'm not liking them you guys i'm just being real with y'all i have smoked a couple of them there's only one that i kind of did like but overall it's still [ __ ] i do want to say that it's been a couple hours since i last said that word yeah [ __ ] the last one you guys heard me say was [ __ ] from the last clip that cut off but it's been a couple hours like i'll say five out of four hours i'm not sure like to say six max no more but as you guys can see i smoked a lot of it not really i've been normally [ __ ] around with it i do not like this car i like the way apple flair tastes it tastes really disgusting you guys literally look at this you guys so did you get remember i told you guys earlier in the video that the wax stays stuck onto the the cart into the tip right here yeah you guys right there look at the cart on the tip i do want to show you guys the q-tip right there but look i'll put the q-tip and you can tell and there's wax right there like see look it's just and another thing to look i'm gonna show you guys that i'm just gonna press the button and you guys gonna see it preheat hopefully you guys could see that as you guys can see that right you see that preheats and but overall i'm not [ __ ] with this or these cards really you know i don't like them the wax moves fast i'm gonna do a time lapse and see how fast it moves even though i'm talking right now it's gonna be moving quite fast i'm not gonna lie i do not like these kind of cards but as you guys can tell these cards are practically most likely fake when they move fast like this you guys get the melody you guys the [ __ ] wax moves fast as hell i do not [ __ ] with these cards overall letting you guys know i do not like them i don't know like it's hard practically with smoking them i've just been pressing it and letting the wax freaking hit like that you know as you guys can see look at it the smoke is coming out as i'm pressing the button right but i'm not inhaling that or nothing not hypothetically i was smoking it i was smoking a little bit of it just to get slightly a little high but as you guys can see there's a bunch of wax stuck onto the tip inside the cart and that wax stays stuck into your mouth when you're inhaling you guys and i'm not like that [ __ ] i don't [ __ ] with these cards i don't like them i would say let's do one more blinky when i end this video but we're not going to take any more blinkers because i do not want to feel that [ __ ] nasty taste in my mouth but just for the video i guess i'll do blinker you know [ __ ] it it is most likely a fake heart it is a counterfeit and i like these cards this is the first time i've ever tried them if this brand if you ever smoked this brand let me know if you guys ran into this kind of counterfeit or do you guys have this kind of problem you know in the comment section below if you smoke this kind of cart or this you know whatever you want to call it you know push carts you know it's just yeah prophetic i don't [ __ ] like them this is my first time ever trying them and i don't like them [ __ ] that let's just do the blinker i guess [ __ ] it there's no it's not bad you know you guys as i'm taking it but it's just i don't like [ __ ] smoking cards that wax moves fast because the oil is not thick it is not good if it's not good i don't want to smoke it but we're just gonna do it [ __ ] it let's get it i peed my lungs it takes nasty you guys spit in the toilet right there you guys but i hope you guys have a safe and amazing day stay blessed don't stress as always peace the [ __ ] out subscribe

got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign",

two three four five hey how you guys doing just tallying up these numbers right here because I get an experiment on how many full hits it takes to or how many full hits there are and a half gram cartridge you know cuz I was curious so I went ahead and did that if you ever wondered well now I have a almost exact precise number so if you stay tuned and watch this video then that by the end then you'll know the number and you know a little bit more information as well shout out to shout our house you know these are some good good cartridges if you find them out there and dispensaries there anywhere you might want to check them out on that note stay tuned and watch the whole video and I appreciate you guys into the next one everybody has the question so I'm gonna go ahead and give you guys the answer to the best of my ability that is the question is how many true hits can you get out of a half gram cartridge so I'm gonna go ahead no not this one as you can see this one's kind of empty but I'm going to be using this one and this is a timeless sfv og right here but this so you see because most of the time I tap it and I hit them you know a few times at once but for the sake of this test I'm gonna be hitting them one time for through each pool just like this so that's one hit most of the time I like to tap them and try to give it a maximum hit for the back some effect but for the sake of this experiment we're gonna see how many of this take so stay tuned [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now people see that it might be one more Inlet someone mark 20 34 34

comment down below any suggestions you guys like would like to call us like what can we call us something cool my name is rocio what can match with rosie the only thing that comes up to my head is roosters and i don't wanna got you [ __ ] roosters because i don't even like [ __ ] chicken like actual chickens in real life the animals i'm scared of them enough of that though i'm gonna be reviewing this really pretty cartridge today look at it it's so [ __ ] pretty it's the new edition the new strain addition to roaf the strain is apple pie it's a hybrid and the packaging is definitely different than the other ones it's like a i don't want to say rose gold because it's more like on the pink side with some sparkles on it and then it has some gold as well i mean maybe you can just call it rose gold right but i don't really like apple pie but we're gonna see what this is all about this is a half gram and i'm really digging the packaging let me before i open it though let me go ahead and let you guys know how much thc percentage it does have and this contains this holds up to 88 i mean this has 88 oh look at that right when we open it the packaging is gold definitely different it has the rove what has the r right here for rogue which is [ __ ] sick i think i'm gonna keep this packaging just because of how pretty it is i really like like packaging that grabs my attention and this for sure grabbed my attention even the cartridge itself is so different i wish i would have brought one of the older ones to compare it but if i do i do have one at home i will be inserting it to show you guys the difference oh look at that it does have a big-ass air bubble though i think that was because i did have the cart in my car like upside down and also what i do know is that these usually come black i don't know it it came red this time which is pretty interesting and i just noticed this one says happy holidays how cute all right enough of that i'm pretty sure you guys want me to tell you guys how it tastes is it getting me high [Music] and let's talk about to blinkers get you more hmm are y'all fans of blinkers or nah personally i don't like taking blinkers every single hit that i'm taking out of a cartridge obviously i mean i don't know if anybody's out there like that but i feel like majority of us that do do blinkers we won't be doing it just for fun it's mostly like well we will do for fun but we'll only do it for like challenge wise i used to think for a while um when i was first smoking cartridges that inhaling it inhaling the smoke longer by just holding it until like there is no smoke to exhale was like much better and it would get me more high and i came i ended up doing some research and turns out it don't even get you more high the longer you hold your hit so there's no really reason for you to be doing that i connected it to my every let's go ahead and take it oh my god it tastes super super super good super super good i do have it on one of the lowest settings on every because i didn't want to see um i wanted to taste more of my cartridge and that tastes like apple pie i never tried apple pie but i feel like this is how apple pie would taste because i can taste the apple flavor but it don't taste bad god definitely i like the flavor i mentioned this i mentioned this the other day that i i haven't i have said that i like more um constituents on the terpene side but and i so i think i like strange that tastes sweet to me on the flavor side it's fun smoking them i'm gonna go ahead and change the setting to green i've got more clouds in the green setting i can still taste that flavor for sure but i for sure notice that i got more clouds right off that hand the thing i do i like about rope is that i feel like no matter how long of a hit i take or even just a hit in general because for all my cartridge smokers you all know there comes a point where cartridges just mess with your throat it like feels rough on your throat from smoking it so much but i feel like rove i've never had that problem with rope it's always such a smooth hip and their flavor um accuracy is on point like all the time i think my favorite one from them is wowing like wowie is such a good strain i wonder if in the future they will come out with any live reds and cartridges because this is not live resin this is only distillate the only thing was that they did have like a special edition the strain they went all out with the packaging shout out to bro not sponsored obviously but they they're doing it right have you guys checked them out which is your favorite strain i definitely recommend trying this straight plus it's a hybrid mixture of both indica and sativa so i actually just checked you guys i don't know how i was mentioning oh you know they should make um they for sure should drop live resin they actually do would you guys like a live resin review on robe versus regular regular distillate uh just live resin review comment down below make sure you guys drop a like any comment to show you guys support i really appreciate you guys who show endlessly love we are now at 7k [ __ ] subscribers like i

this is Nick from disk have a pen and today we're going to tell you about the difference between using a ceramic made cartridge and a cotton wick baked cartridge [Music] alright guys so when you have your 510 threaded cartridges this guy or this guy you're gonna have two types one of them is going to be a cotton whip like this and one of them will be a ceramic heating element like this guy well they both have their advantages and disadvantages if you're trying to do a lower voltage meaning the lower power setting you want to go with the cotton cartridge they can't handle such a high voltage from the battery which would mean you know if you know especially if you have one of the ones that are adjustable where you can turn it up or down you're gonna want to keep at a minimal setting because if you put too much power into one of these guys you risk burning it out early or you know you could turn your juice dark and black because it just stresses the heating element out too much now with our other guy these ceramic these are gonna be a little more up to date where you're gonna be able to run them at a higher setting not super high but with the spinner batteries or the adjustable voltage batteries you'll definitely be able to turn it up a little higher and will give you a little more of a kick with your v the way you can tell the difference is if you look inside the barrel of this one the cotton one you can see a little cotton poking out at the top of it as opposed to the ceramic where you have kind of a cage sitting down on it onto it and you'll have some wick holes where you'll see where the juice will flow in both of them are gonna be 510 threaded and both are gonna be acceptable for batteries like this so you know again just to make sure if you're adjusting you're gonna want to have a ceramic type that'll let you turn your battery up a little higher we recommend a voltage no real higher than about 4 volts that should be the highest you go if he's something a little higher but take it bit by bit and then if you're using a traditional cotton cartridge that's gonna want to stay at a minimum about 3.7 volts you don't really want to turn it up much higher than that and obviously the question too is well what if my battery doesn't adjust well then you're fine for both you know that's going to run at a lower setting that'll be acceptable for both types so if you liked the video give us a like subscribe and if you want any of these products available for purchase you can check us out at discount vape pen com [Music] [Applause] you", "_vGVnBIqGV8": "[Music] hey guys Phil here from got vape when I first started vaping I would always leave my batteries and cartridges inside of my car because I couldn't take them to work and then when I came back from work I would always have leaky batteries leaky cartridges and that was really before I looked into proper maintenance of my oil cartridges so today I wanted to share a few tips I've learned along the way that I'll help you get the most out of your oil cartridge oil cartridges are great great for my producing they preserve your contents for a lot longer like most devices it's the small things that go a long way save you time save you money frustration but you don't want to take advantage of this by refilling new oils in the same oil cartridge do not fill your cartridge more than twice why is this bad to do well if you keep refilling the same cartridge over and over again it can cause leaking clogging lots of paper production thick oils will begin to harden on the wick and you won't be able to vape new oils properly stuck in an endless loop pulsing for good drawls and there's a special circular inhale for things like that especially you'll burn the cotton and the oils and once that happens even the best tasting oils they won't be able to mask it I like to think of it like oil in a car you wouldn't want to change your oil too often without changing your filter and the cotton inside of your atomizer is like the filter in your car you can go and get new oil but without changing the filter you never really have clean oil don't do what I did and leave your cartridges inside of your car or any hot place for that matter I know it might be convenient but for most you out there a good rule of thumb is heat bad cold good high temperatures can not only degrade the oil taste and potency but it can cause leaking the best places to store your oil vapes are cool dry dark places like a desk drawer or a refrigerator put the rubber plug back onto the bottom of the cartridge and start it ideally in a dark place around 70 degrees Fahrenheit or less but don't go too far to the extreme to the other side when stored in the freezer because that can create moisture inside of the cartridge so avoid heat and avoid freezers but now when you take your cartridge out of the fridge the oils gonna be thick and all thick oils need to be primed first priming your new oil cartridge is going to make the difference between the first hit being smooth and magical or dry and burn the nasty teetsi oil is thick so you need to give it some time to soak into the atomizer here's how to do it make sure your oils are at room temperature if they're fresh out of the fridge pull the cartridge in between your palms for about two to three minutes to warm it up if you're loading an empty cartridge only fill it with a small amount so if you run into problems you don't waste all your oil take about five polls on the cartridge without the battery being attached what you're doing is simulating vaping and pulling a little oil from the atomizer then attach the cartridge to the battery and give it a try I recommend pulsing the battery here it's the best way to ensure that you're not burning your oils if it's still too cold go back and warm it up and then try it again so there you have it guys those are the main ways to get the most out of your oil cartridge dont refill it more than twice always prime your new coils and always keep them in a cool dark place to prevent it from leaking on you keep in mind that not all cartridges have wigs some only come with ceramic or glass cores it's your responsibility to know what you're buying it's always smart to clean the bottom of the cartridge before storing it with cotton swabs or alcohol wipes that way when you take the rubber cap back off you can see if it's leaked hopefully these tips helped you guys where do you personally store your cartridges if you have any other questions leave them

what we don't hear too much about is the potential dangers of CBD oil or more specifically the potential dangers of a CBD oil vape pen CBD vape pens are often marketed as a healthier alternative to smoking and it's probably some truth to this whether you're talking about tobacco or marijuana most experts agree that vaping is less severe on the lungs than the smoke that's inhaled from combusted plant material the reason for this comes down to a simple temperature comparison standard joints and cigarettes can burn anywhere between 800 and 1600 degrees Fahrenheit but some high quality vaporizers operate at less than 400 degrees nowhere near hot enough to produce the tar and combustion that wreaks havoc on the lungs in fact there's really no reason to inhale at temperatures much hotter than 400 degrees Fahrenheit as most of the cannabinoids in marijuana are already fully decarboxylated by this point that being said the dangers of CBD oil vape pens come from the fact that improperly processed products may contain compounds that pose hazards to respiratory health the first thing to be wary of is something called cuticle wax cannabis flour is covered in a thin outer waxy layer which when smoked in a joint or Bowl is simply burned off under the extremely high temperatures of combustion in low-temperature vaporizers it may be possible for the wax layer to break off into tiny particles rather than burn away some have suggested that these particles may end up in the lungs as solidified granulomas to avoid this potential hazard look for CBD vape oil that has undergone winterization this is a chemical process that removes the cuticle wax from the plant material before it ever reaches a vaping device another concern to be wary of is thinning agents like polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol more commonly known as PE g and PG in its natural state cannabis oil is much too viscous to be compatible with vape pen heater coils for this reason thinning agents are often added to make the oil more fluid and also to produce the tasty thick vape clouds that so many people love the only problem is both PE g + PG are known to break down into carcinogenic formaldehyde when exposed to temperatures above 440 degrees Fahrenheit a range that even top shelf vaporizers commonly operate in while the dangers of formaldehyde are most evident in other kinds of products it is probably not a substance that you want to be inhaling on a regular basis lastly in terms of the potential dangers of CBD oil vape products be advised that when you're shopping around for a vape pen you're going to get what you pay for some low end vaporizers have been known to operate at temperatures of up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit this quite obviously defeats the purpose of vaping as you're still combusting the oil and plant material into a thick tari residue in other words try and invest as much money as you can into a good well reviewed unit also try and find a vape pen that has manually controllable temperature settings this allows you to adjust the operating temperature to around 340 degrees Fahrenheit which many suggest is the perfect vaping temperature for CBD and cannabis for maximum safety and to avoid the potential dangers of CBD oil vapes as much as possible try and also look for winterized VAE boils as well as oils and eliquid 'z that RP eg free

to think of it every day is a good day to be alive when i'm with you i start to lose sight of the identity i've created for myself i'm blurring becoming something new i want to be happy with who i am what's up ladies and gents and if you're new to the channel my name is shaka zulu and i'm back here for another video guys so today guys um i really just wanted to get outside and i hate that you know that whole just sitting down in the same spot every time for a cart review so your boy has to get out nature because honestly when i do get my carts guys i go out and chill you know i don't necessarily just be smoking my carts at home all the time i like skateboarding and going out especially to this trail because this trail right here that i'm on guys and if you guys were in the live stream you know what trail i'm on uh this trail right here guys is literally in my neighborhood i can just ride my board like a few minutes and i'm on this trail so this is one of the dopest trails we've got it's right next to the freeway so i hope you guys can hear me um it might be a little windy but i think you guys can still hear me if anything i'll just have to make another car review sorry but um today guys uh we got a new strain and this is a new strain by legion of bloom uh again i got another legion of bloom this time i think some of you guys i showed you guys this but i just haven't tried it yet but um it's called apple fritter so it has 77 thc it is a hybrid guys it's a hybrid um and it's only a half gram so [Music] only a little half gram um just because i didn't see any full grams sorry gotta switch up the hands but um i didn't see any full gram guys so i just got a half gram um it has thc v cbn and cbg in it um and then you know obviously the thc uh delta nine and it's a live resin apparently triple refined cannabis oil and the the thing that i question about this and i hope legion of bloom can even tell me is this a real live resin because it does say live resin vape cartridge but under it it says california sauce so is it a distillate with you know cannabis derived herbs but this isn't even the cannabis derived terp line i don't think this isn't the monarch line so i'm not sure but hopefully someone can explain it to me and let me know if this is just derived herbs to make it taste like live resin or is this just a sauce cart it's not necessarily a live resin car let me know down in the comments down below guys shout out to everybody um for always watching the vlogs um it means so much that you guys check me out and see what your boys up to every day so that's pretty much what we're doing i got my board and let's [ __ ] open this [ __ ] sorry i might have to put my camera down [Music] so all right guys finally got it out open ready to go uh let's see what it tastes like huh so off jump um if you guys seen my last vlog uh i tried apple pie by friendly farms and the apple pie by friendly farms is just super big tastes like a straight up like live resin um it's just super dang guys and uh this time i got the apple fritter but it is legion of bloom but off the back the first hit it tastes slightly sweeter it definitely has a earthly taste to it you know what i'm saying but obvi it definitely has a little bit of a sweeter taste to it like it's not necessarily that that full earthiness you know what i mean but it tastes like it tastes pretty good let me see let me try one more time but it's definitely dank though definitely dank and it still has a little bit of the earthy taste but it definitely has a little bit of sweetness in there i don't know if they use you know uh what terps they use actually i do know it's on the box but i put it in the uh put it in my pocket so i'll put the terps on the screen right now hopefully right now you guys see it if you guys don't see it sorry your boy got lazy with the editing but um shout out to everyone in the uh in the video that's watching so far it's just a beautiful day and we're chilling um but i do like the um friendly farms apple pie a little bit better than this one i just like that thickness more but this one is definitely a good one it's not too bad the only reason why i won't buy this one probably again it's just um the fact that it's a half gram and your boy needs four grams like uh hopefully they get these in full grain shout out to legion but yeah guys it's been a chill day um you know same old same old work mode and all that [ __ ] and just you know grinding and um just chilling man listening to beats you feel me just doing me uh just trying to save that money up that's my goals for this whole year is to save as much money as i can this year guys so let me know if you guys got some goals throw them in the [ __ ] comments right now but yeah i've been just trying to set a couple goals for myself because i never really set goals i'm more of a going with the flow type person i just go and i do everything like i obviously do stuff with like a little bit of a purpose but you know i kind of just go with the flow of whatever comes to me i end up doing usually and stuff like that but you know there are goals that i want to reach so we're going to set some

so", "4AvISpz3z_E": "hey welcome to cannabase IG's today we're taking a detailed look at how to use 510 oil cartridges with vape and batteries this episode is brought to you by New York vape shop you can find all the devices that were using in the demonstration today at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with the code rough 3 first we're going to take it look at the anatomy of a 5-10 cartridge first I want to talk about the tip and the tips are pretty much a up to you like however you decide which is your preference is they come in all types of metal they're come in ceramic and they come in wood so the tips are pretty much straightforward next we're going to talk about the tanks the tanks themselves are what holds the oil and they're usually half a milliliter to one milliliter and sometimes the really big ones like the two gram or 2.2 gram heavy hitter cartridges can be really long but referring to the tank is the actual part of the cartridge where the oil is inside of it the two part and then there's the oil inlet and sometimes they come in various whole sizes you can see the one at the top there has a little bit larger hole size than the cartridge there at the bottom and generally for the thicker THC oils you probably want more of a thicker hole then there's the airflow if you can see at the very very bottom this is a bottom airflow and you can see that the airflow hole is right there in the threads at the bottom of the device other devices sometimes have them at the top near the tip and so generally one is either a bottom airflow in most cases sometimes a top airflow and then there's also what they call a variable airflow and you say the case here the airflow is adjustable at the top there so that's the one one thing to consider as well as part of your cartridge and the last and perhaps the most crucial part that we're going to talk about there's here at the base and that is the atomizer and the atomizers are usually either wick or ceramic and the wick they're okay but preferably you probably want to use ceramic today's you get a lot better even distribution better flavor and you see the ceramic heats the oil as it passes through now let's talk about best practices one of the most important things when it comes to using your 510 cartridges with a pin is to use the right voltage setting and you can see generally if it's a variable voltage for these kinds of pins that will vary somewhere between three and five volts and that's the appropriate range for most 510 cartridges but if you're using something like a box mod like the steam cloud that you see here that goes up to sixty watts it's going to be way too much so you're going to want to bring that down to like five watts or to the lower settings and to make sure that you're using the proper voltage or wattage another thing that you want to make sure is that using the proper airflow type you can see this is a bottom airflow device but used on this box mod if you pull it all the way in there there's no air inlet and so for this is the type that you'll need a top airflow so there are types of devices that may not be compatible with certain types of cartridges so that is one thing you want to make sure that for instance of this case you'd want to use a top airflow device and a variable and would be even better and you can see here - this is a bottom airflow and on the bottom airflow there will be a little bitty notch where the air would be allowed to flow through at the bottom of the device so you just want to make sure that you're using the right kind with the right type of device another thing is that when it comes to your empty device you probably just want to throw it and not throw it away but you want to refill it and not just keep hitting it because you're going to burn it out so when you get done with it either go ahead and toss it it's done or stop hitting it until you're ready to refill it or you're going to burn it out another thing is when you're putting in your pocket you really want to be careful with the tips especially with the ones that have an exposed tip and rather than sitting down into a sleeve because if you leave it in your pocket you can do something like this a lot of times it'll bend the tip over one way or the other can expose the electronics and cause you some problems so if you're going to be putting it in your pocket you might want to go with a device such as this where the cartridge sits down inside of it like a sleeve and the last tip we're going to go with here is to make sure that you keep your battery charged or keep a backup battery so if you have a nice pin that you like to use you might want to keep a little cheap on the side that you can have always kind of have as a backup by your charge in the other and that pretty much brings me to the end of my tips and best practices on using your 510 cartridges with your vaporizer batteries if you'd like to learn more about their products here

"XSFrzkVRPNY": "[Music] what's up guys simplisec here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another reaction video but this one's going to be on the clean cards not the fake carts you guys have been asking for a part four for a few months now you know and uh now that um for tuesdays i'm mainly gonna be doing reaction videos till i can stream again i wanted to do a clean cart one because one of the videos is actually picking up steam right now and if it's picking up steam might as well add another one because that that tells me that people are watching that and i know you guys have wanted this one as well and uh before i start this for any further the clean cards moderators i do not know any of them i don't give a [ __ ] about any of them uh because most of you guys say that they're mostly douche bags and stuff and like self-righteous in some ways but i would like to say that i am in no way affiliated with them it's just me reacting to their subreddit and uh just seeing what the legal cards are in the whole country you know what i'm saying i do have a card for this video you know i've been slacking with cards in terms of you know i'm making a fake cartridge video i don't even i'm not even smoking out of a cart this is actually the moonwalker brand uh video will be out in a few days but you know with these reaction videos i try to get these out the day that i record them that way you can follow along you know while i'm watching the video i guess but cheers for those of you who don't know this is delta eight it's called moonwalker the strain is called grape runts and honestly it's one of the better distillate cartridges that i've tried d8 or d9 it's just really flavorful now you do get a strong taste of grape if you guys are interested in this it will be in the comments below you can actually buy these in 38 states so shout out to moonwalker like i said videos on this product will be out in a few days but let's take another hit oh you can see the clearness in it that was bad so as usual with these reaction videos i like to post the comments from the previous video at least the best ones so here we go right now [Music] all right now that we're here let's just see what the clean card subreddit's been doing since uh since the last video right tnt extra expo in new york is this legit or did i waste 40 bucks [ __ ] come on what the [ __ ] let's just let's just take a look at what people say use your account to rebound or another thing [Music] well if it last time made you sick and you bought another one come on come on well let's be honest washington state bans iso isomerized tse and recreational marijuana system what is isomerized oregon to limit use of delta eight tac and other artificially derived cannabinoids really this week's lineups from com can in millis massachusetts we get the pax error okay okay friendly farms terp hogs so this is clean cards guys so don't be expecting any like fake ass bougie cards just appearing i know there's probably going to be some because people are you know still going to be questioning what card they have if it's legit or not and uh most mostly on here you're gonna see legit [ __ ] and i'm interested to see what's legit in oregon washington colorado all that stuff so i feel like these videos they uh show shed light into that you know ever more dark safety but recently learned about reagents and leeches during isomerization and when i understand the only d8 that steak will be extracted from real cannabis to avoid these leftover cans and crusts however these are sold in dispensers possibly because of height delta 9. what method which method to make delta 8 is used to get a real clean stuff and not bathroom chems or is it all blue also i don't care about your favorite brand coa unless you got tests for reagents and bleaches i like you you get it from what i understand the only thing this is the case which method to make d8 it could be clean but they did a lot of lots of cleanup work after the synthesis but not real rn no one test enough for us consumers to know and worse every time so far that brand has been independently tested it variably turns out to be low potency and contaminated to be considered clean synthesized or hemp derived d8 must have safety tests for each and every of the following solvents metals pesticides microbes mycotoxins and reagents and bleaches block to prevent the chills from the dirty pizza from telling you to smoke their dirty deed so disturb spark or whatever i think i mentioned him in the last video he's one of the guys that a lot of people are saying is a douche bag in some sort of way and um he brought up some really good valid points you know obviously d8 has to be safe when it comes out from what i've tried from delta it seems like pretty good you know this is just some stuff maybe that they write to scare people honestly i don't know but uh it is some good stuff that they brought up because obviously you would want your delta eight stuff tested as much as your delta knight and i do see that um but speaking for myself the delta eight brands that i've tried delta eight hemp moon walker serene tree all pretty good i didn't taste any you know chemically ass taste or anything it was just you know some good old distillate and stuff um but then again distillate can be you know iffy as well you know you really can't tell um but just be safe you know just be aware of certain brands and just look out for your own health at the end of the day um like i said this this guy right here that brought up the d8 very good questions but uh i'm gonna have to say that the guy that responded is a moderator of this and he's been known to be like questionable you know what i'm saying like i don't know garlic cookies life hazard ross or live hash rosin cartridge clean pleasant trees that's a [ __ ] nice name liquid trite okay yeah this is only a half gram too it's probably worth so much we're selling for so much real or fake there's the flare right there it says fake and y'all i need help bought this from the weed man and i can't tell if it's there's no lighting and it came in a plastic bag came in a plastic bag come on can i post a picture of a few raw ground cards to help try and verify authenticity and see the community's minions 99.5 percent sure they are real from this message just am super skeptical about cards given my poor health but lemonade lemon pepper from cookies in there not bad yeah i don't [ __ ] with i don't [ __ ] with half gram cartridges or i mean i do but i don't [ __ ] with companies that only sell half gram questions i think that is some [ __ ] [ __ ] and i think that that's their way of saying hey i want your money and i want you to pay for less or get less from it so to be honest anything any company that's still to this day only half grams and are selling it for 60 to 70 for a half gram [ __ ] you washington dispensary anyone tried 30 a gram put in a card in the skittles tastes like grape soda with the hint of wine that's crazy this doesn't taste like great so this is delta eight as well and honestly this is one of the smoothest hitting cartridges that i've tried are none like for distillate usually i'm coughing well most of the time when i'm hitting this is plug play and those those pods and that battery they'd be hitting of course you'll be coughing but this is very a smooth this is a very smooth experience i believe moonwalker is also featured in high times too so i don't know if that brings you some sort of uh clarity but i mean it's it's high time right cheers all right where can i get this tested i know it's fake but i'm curious just about how just i'm just curious to how bad found it on my sister come on bro what the [ __ ] is this 1.1 like what stop solvent free 97 tac like what solvent free or solvent lists and there's a difference right i believe solvent free is no solvents in it at the end product solvent list is extracting without solvents so what that's at best is going to be distillate uh making my own cards terps plus delta e can i mix tears in delhi i want to buy from natural extractions so i've read something about we don't really know how much terpenes we're supposed to be in taking so it's not really good to mix terps homemade you know you don't know the right amount you're not a scientist you know what i'm saying and most of these guys on here aren't scientists as well they ain't going to be able to tell you how much terps and all that stuff to mix delta 8 with so just be careful with that do your research uh i recently just saw that article so it could be like some brand new study or something but it says something about not taking too much or too much terpenes might be a bad thing if uh paraphrase it oil forms around oils from local dispensary here in miami truly i think i've seen truly videos and they're from florida so that should be good i don't know uh the cartridge scene in florida so if if true leaves are fake then just be careful you know what i'm saying you eat raw garlic let's see peanut butter bread sauce never seen this [Music] looks okay that looks so lame with their instagram handle right there on that packaging it looks so crafty looks good west coast cars real or fake no comment i do have some west coast wax though actually no more but did i have some very popular in my state i mean you know a couple people with them obviously improvement there's no branding and everything do you think it's fine because they're getting high i'm not sure i'm just going to pass that anyone recognize this brand as a fake oh sorry it's fake live terpenes delta 9 thc distillate cartridge live terpenes huh not live rising terpenes just live terpenes how do you spot a fake delta eight disposable my buddy runs the smoke to tell me this but there's nothing but the paper and vaping inside come on bro getting from a smoke shop albeit there probably are some delta good delta 8 products and some smoke shops but are you willing to take that risk buying it no like when you can buy it online these people these are the type of people that want it right now they can't wait they can't wait to order online they want to go to a smoke shop and get it they want a little club and get it they want to go to their buddy and get it no patience on these guys really all i have access is to black market but dispensary or so can i put that rsl on but it's working possibly it was probably going to make your butt taste like [ __ ] i bought rso before and i thought it was just regular dab i thought hey you know in a syringe it it was black as [ __ ] i dabbed it it tasted like [ __ ] rso is for the medicinal side rso means rick simpson oil and i guess that's the guy who like popularized it or made it or so so uh you basically use it to to fix your ailments you know what you're smoking on tonight that is the yocan right i believe okay cleaner trash this brand from a local dealer there yet [Music] keep fake carts it's your plug okay i'm gonna end this like if you're getting it from the plug 99 of the chance it's fake you know there's maybe a one percent chance that plug can somehow get it from from the real [ __ ] but come on from the plug from snapchat like really that's gonna be end of this clean carts video hopefully you did enjoy this one i believe this is number four or so let me know in the comments if you did enjoy it let me know if you want a part five and uh like i said like when you comment and leave likes it it motivates me to do more of these and like i said i'm gonna try and get this out today today is tuesday tuesdays i usually go live but i'm thinking that since i'm not going live anymore maybe just do reaction videos on tuesday and maybe on friday as well but or rest it just depends on my mood i guess that day but hopefully you did enjoy this video uh like i said let me know if you want to part five and i'll see you guys in the next one [Music] so", "76etd8Ye6BA": "[Laughter] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another nug product video so yeah we got an authentic bag right here i paid 41 out the door for this shopping mall so yeah let's just see how much should i pay yes 40. 40 99 you see that for a full gram cartridge not bad not bad so this is ambrosia this is their nug live resin line and uh yeah as you can see in the back all that good stuff the the percentages i believe it's uh eighty percent exactly well not exactly but that's what they put it and also the manufacture date and all that stuff is uh fairly new about three three months old so not bad date of manufacture is a bit older i think april so but got the nug family i haven't had a nug cartridge in a while i've only had one of their cartridges i forgot what strain it was but i just remember that it was a actually a pretty pleasant experience um i did enjoy it and it lasted pretty long so i'm excited to try this other one and uh let's just see if i can find my battery all right so if you didn't know by now i lost my chill battery i dropped it in the hole when we went to sf you should have seen that video by now but it's unfortunate but we got the press slide right here so you just okay well it's a ceramic heating core as well so that's pretty dope and also nugg.com if you guys want to check them out so just pull it out to use attack wow okay you got the logo right there let's do a little box little thumbnail action hopefully it's getting it go up go down right there so we're going to be hitting it in my dash vape retro you guys already know the deal and uh yeah this is looking pretty good i'm not gonna lie screw that bad boy in let me know if you've tried nug before like i said i've tried it only once and i really enjoyed it it lasted really long compared to these other cartridges so uh i'm pretty excited let's see i haven't used this battery in a while i've been using my chill one so cheers boys oh very very smooth you can you can tell that ceramic heating oil works because i do not taste no burning sensation very very smooth hit it's very very comparable to an erza i'm not gonna lie wow let me take that hit again this is the ambrosia by the way cheers boys that's a blinker for a blinker it's not as fat hits that i'd uh i'd normally see from other live resin cartridges um but the taste is there wow i feel like i could probably like do a five second hit and then a blinker and that will do a pretty decent size hit which is what i'm gonna do so hold on oh there you go wow that is really enjoyable so would i like i said what i remember from the other nug is that it lasts longer than other cartridges so i'm hoping this one lasts just as long because i'm really enjoying the flavor here uh for 41 dollars is generally the price of what you get from typical live resin cartridges uh except for the exception of urza which is like 55 to 60. but this is good i'm not gonna lie like i'm honestly it's one of the better tasting live resins that i've tried lately lately and uh i don't know where i'm gonna be placing this but i know it's on my top five nug is definitely on my top five uh from my last top five video i said i believe it was four or three um i just feel like maybe buddies edged it out a little bit because they had more of a selection and it's a bit cheaper but this taste like i've been on a bad roll right now of buying products and not liking it and honestly i'm kind of happy that i bought this uh this was like the only one in the display that they had left that authentic so i knew that maybe out of all the strains that they had of the nut cartridge that this one was the one that was chose the most and honestly i'm glad i chose this wow i'm really enjoying this and look at it i think i barely even touched it and i just did maybe like two three blinkers maybe two let me take another hit for you guys so like i said the hints aren't going to be as fat for you know blinkers on other live resin cartridges but not [ __ ] bad not [ __ ] bad i'm probably gonna take two more hits off of this and then and then we're just gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed this video if you haven't tried nut cartridges i've tried two out of i've tried two of them so far and it's been two out of two [ __ ] a hit so uh i'm gonna take two more hits like i said cheers boys enjoyable so also i'll post the link to this battery if you guys are interested in that i believe the cheapest that i've seen it was like 15 to 20 i don't know and then there's obviously uh shipping involved but nonetheless very very good battery from daz vape shout out to them always supporting me um yeah just uh i don't know i'm happy about this cartridge right now i'm ecstatic that i bought this cartridge i was gonna buy another buddy's cartridge because i did lose my buddy's cartridge i was gonna buy another train wreck but then i was like let's just try something new and a nug well it's not totally new because i've done a video on their their uh i forgot what strain it was but it was a good strain i'm gonna take another hit for you the last hit and then we're gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed the video you know like it subscribe if you haven't already if you want to and yeah i'll take this hit cheers boys all right guys peace out [Music] [Music] you", "NYweYsi0x2E": "everyone Pope all's well so recently there's been some negativity when it comes to vaping and buying carts off the black market knowing what you inhale into your body should be priority number one and when stepping into the realm of vaping you don't want to inhale something that's gonna harm you long term so today we want to put an end to all the pleasures out there regarding bad practice and to truly answer the question what is a fake oil cartridge and how to avoid [Music] they coil cards go beyond branding and counterfeit boxes the number one question you should be asking yourself is where am i buying my cards from most reputable companies have authorized retail stores that are allowed to sell their cartridges if you're buying from anywhere other than licensed reputable companies or their authorized retailers nine times out of ten it's a fake and companies that are legit aren't gonna risk selling products to non-leap States eBay Amazon Alibaba are not where they experience weavers goaded by high quality oils sure you can compare your boxes to the boxes on the website but unless you buy from the right site you can still get it wrong also if you're buying oils on a budget you're gonna run into the same problem a big red flag is recognizable big-name brands at low prices let's face it if you paid bunk prices you're gonna pay for bunk oils but how do people get ahold of big name brands and if it's the same cart how can it be fake that brings us to fake cartridge answer number one fake oils take these sell cartridges for example defconn action calm says that all seasaw cards must have two logos a serial number and a transparent rubber ring at the bottom of the cart this cartridge is everything a vapor should look for but I know for a fact that the oil inside is fake meaning that nothing's tested and they let the name brand to sell the cartridge for them to me this is black market plus most cards and boxes can just be bought online and some people think that if cartridges and boxes look legit then there's nothing stopping people from putting their own formula inside plus cartridges can just be a replica and they use cheap metals unless you have somebody you trust a source who tests their oils you never really know what's in it from a normal customer standpoint so what could be in here was they can put synthetics in there like k2 which is a huge deal you shouldn't do that oil thickener or anything that you usually wouldn't see on the cartridge unless your oils are solvent free distillates which indicates that the substances are environmentally friendly with no des lunes then you're gonna run into terpenes in PG you want to limit the amount that's put into your oils both drippings and PG act as carrying agents to carry more flavors into your discipline because distillate itself doesn't really have much flavor and no PG does not cause formaldehyde companies only use these agents to give it their own unique formula and it may also indicate on the stickers the percentages that they use but not always think about as buying mid grade versus Private Reserve but you still don't know what a fake oil cartridge is so what's a fake oil cartridge okay so you got your cleaning lab all set up you got your formula lock down and now you're ready to start filling it up cartridges can you just use any cartridge no no you cannot in January this year of 2019 a new California State law was passed calls phase Reena saving that all California cartridges must be lab tested for heavy metals these tests are specifically for for metals cadmium arsenic mercury and lead and phase threes testings limit is 0.5 parts per million of lead allowed in your oils this is a big deal for vape cartridge producers because unless you have glass pores cartridges contain metal and sometimes the exact same cartridge will pass in one lab and fail in another causing producers to just bypass testing all together just to make a quick buck also the price of testing in a lab has gone up so people are cheating the system by avoiding it entirely so why the variation of testing there is no standardized testing procedures for each lab to follow this means that each lab extracts oil differently and if oil touches exposed brass then it may very well fail phase 3 testing so how to metal get inside of your oil cartridges well that's easy 99% of companies buy cartridges from overseas which allow up to 4% of your oils to be made up of lead which is much higher tooth into what phase 3 wants and unless you're on top of your menu this could be a problem let an arsenic is added to metals like brass which help make metal easier to mold into cartridges and oil is acidic so it eats away at cheap metals allowing particles to be invaded into your body so stop giving people reasons to ban they don't become a victim of uncertainty unfortunately some companies don't want to know how the cartridge is made because they don't want to be how reliable and there's just too much money to be made not to get inside of the oil cartridge market we can't change state law or lab test procedures but we sure can certainly change babe cartridges there are companies out there that are responding to the issue companies like Herve pur have already started innovating carts that are guaranteed to pass phase three testing and multiple facilities and are currently leaving the market who completely lead-free cartridges that vetted testing facilities in California that know how to properly test for phase three requirements the next generation of VAP cartridges might be hidden stores in winter time this year but keep in mind that cartridges made before January 1st 2018 are still allowed to be sold and could still be in circulation and states like Washington and have passed similar laws only allowing 0.7 parts per million so be aware of your state's requirements I know it seems like a lot but now you're in the know and knowing is half the battle so please no more black market cards we hope this video was helpful to you guys let us know what you'd like to see in the next video where do you buy your loyal cards did you know that metal could be in it as always don't forget to subscribe and like and we'll see you next time face", "iNcCGMXn2bA": "[Music] we're here with bloom farms and

connoisseurs and they got a good one for you today so today we are going to take this C cell 1/2 gram refillable cartridge we picked up at vape part smart comm and we're going to be putting some oil in it and showing you just how easy it is to make your own cartridges well here we go what we're going to be putting in it today is some dab ex gelato this is 92.9% total THC for a grand total of ninety four point three total cannabinoids as you can see the color on this is absolutely beautiful let's open this up and get to work okay there you go opens it up every time very nice very nice look at that color it's about as clear as it can get right there loving it now all of this is extracted using ethanol alcohol so it is definitely the way to go this is a good company they make really nice distillate it is quite thick so I do recommend a cartridge with large holes like this see cell first things first you need to try to acquire an applicator tip this is very simply a very large syringe tip to administer the distillate into the cartridge now there will be a link to where you can get some of these in the description a lot of people ask about them and I did the work find it one now first things first we take our distillate we assemble it not too hard now as you can see when I pull off this cap [Applause] the tip is slightly frosted that is to ensure that this when you apply it has a good mating surface and does not slide off now would they recommend first and foremost is that you heat this syringe up just a little bit using whatever method you prefer to get it nice and viscous you take your oil that you want to load into the cartridge have it ready you take the cartridge simply unscrew the lid from the cartridge very easily take your syringe full of the fluid that you would like to dispense into your cartridge insert it into the cartridge as far as it can go and begin to diminish pinch the fluid you can see it pushes down simply go around the cartridge filling it up as you go okay I knew at that point just top it off a little bit remove the syringe take your lid replace your lid on the top [Applause] and there you have your cartridge simply allow the oil to run down to this spot and test it for function as you can see the oil as has gone all the way down to the bottom is filled to this level at that point in time so if we remove the mouthpiece and a small silicone seal on the bottom get a standard 510 thread battery this is a VAT mod very nice battery 510 thread screw it on to the bottom [Applause] and let's try this thing out shall we [Music] all right well there you have it that's how you refill a C cell cartridge you guys have an absolutely wonderful day thank you so much for tuning in and if you want some cartridges to refill yourself make sure you check this website out Bait part smart vpm comm very great place you guys have a good one that thanks for tuning in peace", "LfdsaO34phE": "hello everyone and welcome to my channel I am low to describe and today I'm gonna be talking to you about a product that I have here that I have been using for a little while now I have been using CBD products before and they have helped me and so I decided to try this brand this brand is called just CBD and the these are their Signature Series cartridges the one that I have right now that I am currently using is the pineapple express this is a hybrid cartridge it says so right here on the label and another one that I have been using is the is the Sour Diesel this is one of those sativa cartridges they come in this clear plastic container with like a cork top so I think that's pretty nice that they do that this is how they actually look right here so this is the full-spectrum container this is glass right here and it comes with this pretty awesome wood tip and I shall see that right there how it looks and I have been using it with this vape pen its BIOS if y'all haven't heard of that brand or I'm sure that y'all have heard of the brand it's very good very reputable brand it comes with a that you can set the voltage down here at the bottom and you can choose which voltage you would like to have it as so with me I use CBD products mostly for my depression in my anxiety I also use it to calm my nerves whenever I feel stressed out or in a stressful situation I have used Lazarus naturals before the only thing with that is with that one it kept me up at night and then I did you CBD MD and that helped me as well and so I decided to try these out since I have been tired more tired lately and so I decided to try the pineapple Express and the Sour Diesel since the pineapple Express is a hybrid cartridge and I read on there it is a 60% sativa and a 40% what's a 60% sativa and a 40% indica and they're Sour Diesel is a sativa so they have lab reports on their cartridges and they also have lab reports on other products that they do have that y'all can check out so with these with the Geist CBD brand the cartridges they have another one also so they have the sativa the Sour Diesel the hybrid pineapple Express and they also have another one called Northern Lights now Northern Lights is an indica as for more of like whenever you want to relax more of you can use it before bedtime to help you sleep I haven't tried that one yet but I'm going to be trying that one soon enough I might get it later on today or tomorrow I have to see if I have time to actually go purchase it but these two cartridges that I have here they have been really helping me out lately with giving me more energy with giving me more of a positive outlook because usually with my depression I was given by the doctor antidepressants to take but I haven't taken those yet because I would like to try more natural stuff before I actually take antidepressants so I have been doing my research on what products to take I have been doing my research on on the different terpenes on that health depression and different terpenes that help would get more energy more activity more focused and so far these have really been helping me this brand has really been helping me so far and I'm gonna try there like I said I'm gonna try there indica Northern Lights and then also with this whenever I take a hit from it it is like the smoothest inhale I have ever taken from from a CBD brand it is like very very smooth on the throat does not irritate the tro does not irritate the lungs these two that I have they come in 200 milligrams CBD and it's 100% u.s. grown hemp has a right here on the label and also it has it on their website and like I said before they have lab reports on all of their products so y'all can check their products to make sure how much CBD or you are getting how much what the terpenes are that you are getting I highly suggest this brand I bought these out of my own money so I'm not endorsed I'm not a paid by them or anything and I don't have like a affiliate link to use I have just been using these out of my own interests and out of my own for my health to help me get better and so that I can do more one thing that I want to let you know that I have talked about in my other CBD products reviews is that with any CBD product there if you have to take a drug test there is a possibility that you come out positive for THC depending on your on where you work if they drug test you or if they don't there are people or companies that say like on here it says zero percent THC I'm not sure if you I can see that zero percent THC let me show the other one actually they have recovered up but it says zero percent THC on it and so whenever it says represent THC that is 0% basically it is under the amount that's that's not legal it's under the amount that's that's detectable for THC on the lab reports that they done but there have been cases in a group that I follow on facebook called CBD oil users I highly recommend y'all check it out if y'all can but on that group that I follow they have been cases where people have said that they took a drug test from their job and they came out positive and they ended up having to lose their job because they thought the product was you know the people told them it was zero percent THC you're not gonna be show up on a drug test and all that but you can on any CBD product you can show up on a drug test because over time it accumulates in the fat cells and it also depends on your metabolism and each person is different they're having people who have been on CBD for like a year and they have not come out positive and there's people that have been on CBD for a month and they have come out positive so it each depends on the person but as for these the gist CBD brands the pineapple Express in the Sour Diesel the taste I don't know if it's just me but they taste very similar but that just could be my taste buds I'm still you know China deciphered the flavor it's they taste to me more of like floral what do you type but that's just me and my taste buds and on what I've tasted so far there is another CBD product that I have been taking that our review next time and I just wanted to show you all these these ones that I had I bought these at my local smoke shop they had a very good reputable reputable brands that I seen these were $34.99 for each one and I would think that it's worth it because of the way that they look the way that the glass and the full-spectrum is and also comes with this really awesome tip one thing that I do get to say though that I didn't like about them it could be the shop itself on and on how long they had the product or it could be the way that they are packaged but when I first bought the my first cartridge which was this one it was gunked-up at the bottom it was gunked-up at the bottom and I'm not sure if you I can see these little holes right here but they were like black and I'm guessing because maybe the CBD oil with the conduit it just got clogged up and so when I went to take a hit and nothing came out so I had to go back I got another one that looked like this like they had the black and nothing came out of that one either until we found one that was clean one that was clear and I made sure with this other one to make sure that it was clean and clear and I took a hit from those that let me test it before I took it out to make sure that the product was working well and it was and since I've got these it's just been phenomenal so me personally I suggest y'all try it out if you want to like I said next time I have another product that I'm going to be reviewing by funky farms and so hopefully y'all stick around for that one so with these the pineapple Express the Sour Diesel and then the Northern Lights by just CBD and I also suggest checking out their website I'll put the website in the link in description down at the bottom so that y'all can check it out but if you are having any problems like let's say tired anxiety the or any other symptoms that you can find on the on ano zone there is CVD that might be out helping CVD can work for you or it cannot there are lots of products that are out there and it just takes time to find the right product that y'all are looking for I highly suggest if you are getting maybe like discouraged or anything don't give up on trying the product don't give up on on find the right one because whenever you find the right one it'll make a world of a difference thank you for sticking around and listening to my review on just CBD on their Signature Series vague cartridges and hopefully I'll enjoy talk to you later", "U_Ka0JKesCY": "[Music] what up y'all said [ __ ] Academy ha yeah big man [ __ ] today we're just gonna answer a question the question is how long should a cartridge last you and how many hits should you get out of it but before we get into that sure the question I'm asked you [ __ ] a month I guess please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always Sega's always [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that things you can get a notification anytime I post some [ __ ] also make sure you go over academy.com get yourself some terpenes shirts get about 10 11 13 [ __ ] I also cuz the contest is still going on you put in cold [ __ ] get 20% off in your whole [ __ ] order and again sirs you into the contest to be able to get yourself a terpene ball I send it out to you no charge you don't be paying shipping and handling under that [ __ ] I take care of everything and I send it out to you so [ __ ] man can't a mink on get your Terrapins o-obviously go over instagram academy kind of underscore me so all right the question of how long should it last and how many it should you get out there [ __ ] I give that [ __ ] all the time i'ma keep my honey with you if you talking about just a free-range like if you get a cartridge and put it on a free a free-range battery meaning that you kind of have up to seven seconds or 13 SEC's something like that's a hit the [ __ ] bait cartridge that's going to determine how much you're getting out of it so it's no way kind of that I can tell you how many hits you can get out of a [ __ ] cartridge so like when a person comes up and says how about a little 1 gram cartridge less I'll keep it 100 with you there's no such thing as a 1 gram cartridge it's a one milliliter cartridge because liquid is Mac [ __ ] measured in grams so it's a 1 milliliter cartridge with an X amount of grams InSAR milligrams inside of it so let's take for instance if you look at the back of a cartridge and it tells you that 3 milligrams is a serving right and then it also say below it the package has 450 milligrams of THC in it okay so that means that theoretically you would have 90 servings if that makes sense you would have 19 servings out of that that that half milliliter cartridge because that's probably what that will be if that if that's the number four right however how do you know you had three milligrams worth of eight and I'm not dissing it I'm just more so say how do you [ __ ] know this meaning it's kind of really hard to answer this question and then I don't know how often you smoke [ __ ] don't to [ __ ] you me how long does come in every two days getting the same [ __ ] I got my burgers coming in every three weeks every week like everybody got that you old [ __ ] habits and they [ __ ] that's like if I gave you a [ __ ] glass of water and on my a man how many sips is it gonna take to finish this that's just stupid right so at the end of the day you got to get the [ __ ] on your own and figure it out so companies try to give you a mindset of what it is but I got I got batteries that I could take a 13 second hit you know long 13 seconds is to be inhaling [ __ ] vape [ __ ] so come on spot it's it all depends on you man if you do like I think it's this matter like oh you didn't help for like two seconds or some little [ __ ] like that that's like a standard but just like I say it also depends on the force of how you inhale for that two seconds you can inhale like little B actually you can [ __ ] hit that [ __ ] up you know so it really just depends on how you [ __ ] hit you as well so those are the things that have to be taken into consideration when you expect someone to answer a [ __ ] question like that it really just depends on you see my life flashing man yeah peanut series it's yeah but it just really depends on what your habits are how you actually smoke at how long something is gonna last you I personally say have more than one method of consumption so don't just have one vape that you just constantly hitting on and then wonder why is going down that's like having one pair of shoes and heel shoes just get [ __ ] up you know versus like man like 27 pairs of kicks that's why my shoes usually all look new because I got so many so I can just switch them out you know so much it lasts longer so I say I've never met this at some edibles that's Mars so yeah I mean admit you [ __ ] I have some real weed my admission up and I think you'll see that the cartridges will last longer but if that's your only source that motherfucker's gonna be here it's gonna be how for like a month okay you have a graveyard of all these [ __ ] cartridges just laying there there's a little bit of [ __ ] oh you know there's no way of saying it now there is one I know some companies that they'll give you like don't dose it out to you it's actually a company called OC and then it's a okay you get 50 hits out of this pin so when you inhale it cuts off at what the proper dose is and you just inhale until it cuts off so think you know aren't exactly how much are the dose you're getting and you're knowing how many hits you get so I would say like if you can try a company like that just so you can kind of have our idea your mind just for shits and giggles I don't mean like all of that gotta make you be in the right place but just for shits and giggles like just think about it and see like man let me see how long this pin lets me hit and how much of a dose this says it is and that might help you out a little bit I don't know that's just theory of mine yeah me but at the end of the day that's what it is just read the back of the package and you'll see what the milligrams are inside look admit it should tell you what's suggested those are some companies do that so anyway that standard [ __ ] I'm out this [ __ ] y'all make sure y'all keep the log or I love each other keep the peace gon be peaceful to each other go over it kind of mean get yourself turn t-shirts I'm out this [ __ ] another one I want to hit the seat blow we in the jungle smoking we in a jungle smoking legal", "kz1nVMODQ4o": "oh my god you guys hey guys how's it going so thanks for being here in my bedroom and i'm going to do another dmt trip so i said i was going to go for a big one so i think i'm just going to go for a big one and i also said i'd do my next one in the park but i don't think i want to go for a huge trip in that park so i'll do the big trip here now in my bedroom and then i'll do like a milder trip out there in the coming weeks i got some music playing but i'm gonna you know cancel it out of my video it's um carbon based life forms i don't know if you've ever listened to them but they play pretty mellow electronic music and i got the lights fairly dim as you can see and i got this really nice video for visuals that i put up on my screen in case i end up leaving my eyes open which sometimes i do and i will link that in the description if you want to check out what i was watching and i'll link the carbon based life forms album 2 which i'm listening to anyways i'll be using a dmt cartridge which don't ask me how i got it or where to get them guys i've been getting that that question a lot in the comments i don't want that stuff in my comments or not you guys i mean new viewers probably if you're new to the channel that's just keep that in mind just you know do your own research where there's a will there's a way get get resourceful i had a friend who who had the cartridges so i got lucky with that i don't really know where he got them all right so i'm not really like in a very talky make a video mood but i wanted to document my trip so uh if you don't mind i'm just gonna get to it and then if i feel like speaking about it later i will speak about it later but maybe i'll just do that tomorrow or something i just wanted to film the actual trip itself because i just wanted to trip tonight you know you get it you know what i'm trying to say so so we'll see or i might end up talking afterwards i don't know sometimes i have a trip and it's just so like intense i just sort of feel like waiting a bit like i said in my last video i lost the mouthpiece the tip just the tip i lost and um so i have to like make sure my lips go around it you know so that's why i'm hitting it funny if it looks like i'm hitting it funny and i'm gonna lie down i prefer to lie down usually sometimes i sit up but usually i'm like taking a hit or something and i got to deal with that so it's nice to have the pen i can just lie down and put it in here after i that's why i got this because because the tip is missing it will leak out if i hold it upside down so i gotta like keep it upright that's not quite small enough actually i'll put this cloth in here there we go genius such a genius okay guys thanks for watching the video i do lots of videos like this so check out my channel for more trip reports and stuff like that and um there's music and there's just you know okay boys and girls i bid you farewell is that that's that is that what they say it's an old english thing right i bid the i bid the farewell okay i think that's about it i'm ready i'm tired i find dmt is good if you're like tired and getting ready for bed if you're relaxed skip you're in a relaxed mood for sure i'm stalling i'm stalling [Applause] here we go [Music] uh [Music] huh [Music] [Music] so [Music] sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep [Music] um [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] um oh my god you guys oh my god [Music] oh [Music] oh my god [Music] it was pointing at me it told me oh my god you guys [Music] the coordinates tracking my like eye movement i'm just saying this so i don't forget later sorry if it doesn't make sense the coordinates it's pointing out to me what the fuck it's trying to decide whether or not to close my eyes it's always something i struggle with and when i was doing that it felt like the trip was getting mad at me and then when i just and then i decided to leave them open and i think i was telling it was telling me like it doesn't matter it doesn't matter like nothing you say or do matters really it's in control always and my god the further i get away from it the less ability i have to describe what i just saw fuck still really high i wasn't blacking out at any point but like i still can't it's like it's trying to make me forget like i saw how the universe worked there's some being that can just do whatever it wants whenever it wants it can move wherever it wants and just you know i saw different reality different universes multiverses and just oh my god maybe the details will come like what the fuck i kept saying too like i should talk about this because i'm gonna i'm gonna forget later but i'm like no no i'll remember i'll remember it all makes sense and then just every minute that goes by makes it's less and less sense but i just saw what the fuck [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] watch i wasn't recording this whole time i'm still recording thank god well that was cool i just saw the universe work to you guys and it looked like it was like okay hear me out it's not gonna make much sense but this is the best i can describe it like every universe was on like a string and it was like sort of moving they were sort of moving towards me like they're all connected but when i was trying to decide whether to open or close my eyes this like entity came it was invisible an invisible entity but i could sense it was there and where it was it suddenly moved like through the realities and was getting mad at me it's like it came from wherever it was all the way here to tell me that sorry let me just mute my music i came from wherever just just to tell me like just to tell me where was i holy fuck this is so hard to talk about i came oh yeah i came from wherever was just to tell me it doesn't matter like when my eyes are open or closed like stop thinking about all that stupid shit and i didn't see any entities as usual i don't see entities sometimes i do they're usually robots but uh this time it wasn't except that that that entity i guess you would call it but it was like invisible and then also when it was telling me not to um it doesn't matter if your eyes are open and closed it wasn't telling it to me it was telling it to something else i don't know what that was and i was just like obser observing that that that message what was it talking to like maybe my brain and i the observer like the soul i guess you can refer to it as or whatever was the one observing that you know which sort of like lends to the idea like the separation of body and soul you know like two separate things like you and your life aren't the same thing look at this pose i'm sitting in this very i don't know it feels right though okay i'm not a two-year-old sit like a man oh where did this come from was i holding this the whole time i don't know i don't know i just don't know um the visuals are very cool like yeah i realize now definitively i know now it doesn't matter if your eyes are open or closed people always have that debate if you smoke enough um like maybe it will vary the experience but it not the intensity of it or how good it is necessarily you know like if you smoke enough if your eyes are open it'll take whatever you're looking at and transform that into whatever so like i was looking at you know my room became all multiple universes like on a thread like reeling past me and then this fucking being darting around it was like this that was like the master i don't want to say god because it wasn't that it didn't seem benevolent either it didn't seem evil but it just it seemed like it was getting shit done it was busy and it didn't it seemed a little angry that it had to be there to tell me like deal with this trivial shit like it had better things to do i got the sense and it's like you know tell this idiot whoever it was talking to he doesn't need to or he wasn't he didn't call me an idiot but i got the sense that he was frustrated like short he she whatever it and um it was like yeah tell tell him it doesn't matter you know or it wasn't even saying tell him it was just talking to him it was like it doesn't matter and i was just like observing it and i didn't hear those words it was just i got the sense that's what uh it was trying to communicate to my body or whatever it was talking to um the visuals like afterwards and then before that seems like a short trip also i start talking like while i'm still tripping and i think that's what sort of takes me out of it because i'm like aware i wasn't for a second or two but i'm aware that i'm recording and doing a chirp report so i start like i start talking sitting up while like most people still probably have their eyes closed i don't know or maybe it wasn't short maybe just uh that's my perception of it that was fucking intense though it's funny the visuals i had on my screen oh yeah another thing too the audio went it muted itself i'm gonna have to check uh the playback and see like if my actual audio muted because i have music playing i'm just i'm gonna cut out the parts when i'm not talking um i'm going to check if it actually muted because that was weird because at one point i was hearing the music and it just cut out completely it was silent for a few seconds which is a weird hallucination like canceling out your sound that's pretty like intense like it has some like pretty high permissions in your brain to be able to like access that that sort of shit like mute all sounds you know that's like administrator privileges you know like you can't just mute the fucking sound in my brain like what are you doing it's crazy it did though and then well oh yeah when i was closing and opening my eyes i don't know if i was or not but i think if you if you look in the video they'll show a part where i'm like sort of like opening and closing them i was like going back and forth at least my memory tells me that's what i did during that part like all the effects were like flickering on and off like i mentioned in my when did i mention that i think it was in my live stream i don't know but i was talking about how sometimes the effects they just flicker on and off like an rgb cable being wiggled in the back of an old computer you'd see the colors just flicker instantly right and what was oh yeah that was happening when it's opening closing the eyes with everything all the effects it's just like very computer simulated like themes of simulation here but not not totally this time that that entity seemed beyond beyond like a computer simulation you know uh it's weird too when that's happening it's like oh my god i have the answer this is crazy but so that's like a delusional thought obviously but i'm still there i'm still conscious because i remember thinking like wait till i tell my subscribers i got to see her to the universe like this is going to make a banger video you know meaning of life and i'm at for a good 30 seconds 20 seconds 30 seconds i thought that i'm like i know i know everything i know the answer and uh i can't wait this can make a great video isn't that funny and then slowly it starts you start realizing like wait a second that can't be true and i know it's not true because every trip is like different like last trip like something else was the answer now the answer is this you know there's several meanings to life apparently but this i've never had a trip where i imagined something that it's like beyond like something i couldn't come up with myself you know so i'm not convinced that dmt is um anything supernatural just yet but i don't find it any less poetic or beautiful or spiritual or anything like that you know it's just to me it's a testament to how complex the human brain is and how incredible nature is you know in life itself life is the trip as i say dmt is just like i made this analogy to someone earlier in the comments life okay dmt is like a program and life is like the operating system you know what i mean like psychedelic trips are just a small thing that happens within life oh my shit's about to shut off i think or no i just split the recording so part of it might just cut out so i'm just gonna repeat what i just said i forget what i just said fuck am i scratching my nuts geez okay ignore the last 10 seconds i'm probably going to keep it in for comedic effect but ignore it that was a really cool trip that every trip has a different vibe to it there's like a few main categories each one is unique but there's some broader categories too like some of them are funny some of them are very spiritual and uplifting like my two live trips one and two those ones were very spiritual and uplifting and afterwards i felt like at peace with the world i don't really have that this time although i do feel good but um i this one was more like the ones based in outer space always have the same vibe to them and those ones are all about like how the universe works and god and stuff like that and higher powers and those ones are fascinating not necessarily positive or overwhelmingly positive or scary just it feels like it's showing me the truth so it's it's not trying to be anything it's just the truth right and it's those ones are like awesome not like awesome like you know like awesome dude like it's full of awe you know awe inspiring like mind mind-blowing and just i don't know i'm going to have to look back at the tape but i'm pretty sure i was just like oh really good like five minutes not that long three or four minutes maybe i don't know it's funny i'm like the visuals on my screen ended up being like the least interesting thing ever i'm like looking at universes suddenly i'm going to watch i want to watch this youtube visual oh i've had youtube visuals turn into amazing things before so that's why i throw them on sometimes thing barely went down too how many hits that i i tried to take more hits but i couldn't feel the pen anymore it felt like it was over here and my jaw was like disconnecting and like it was like numb and shit you know when you don't know like where the pen is or how to hit it or and this thing's easy to hit when you you can't feel it you know that's when you're good to go this is a pretty strong pen or the liquid i think both um seems to work really well compared to most anecdotes i've heard about the efficacy of these pens a lot of people say it's really hard for them to get like a breakthrough dose that was like borderline breakthrough so that was like a low-level breakthrough dose i would say i don't like the term breakthrough but for those of you who go by that system i would say this is like a barely breakthrough barely i broke through barely it wasn't like uh as intense as some breakthrough trips i've had and it doesn't definitely wasn't sub breakthrough i was yeah i was out of here and when that fucking entity started beaming around i felt so powerless like i felt like oh fuck like this thing is boss whatever you i couldn't see it i just sense where it was it was invisible i'm wheezy okay that was great guys i think i'm gonna play some video games smoke a big bowl of marijuana and um maybe have it no no i gotta quit drinking fuck for real for real i gotta quit drinking i gotta stop masturbating snow not november is not going well guys what is it it's fucking february i think i need another extension i failed again i failed every day every day i failed no not november in february so the ninth extension this thing is dope as fuck i hate smoking empty even if you're doing bong hits which is like the easiest way to smoke tmt it's still kind of like a bit of a process to get the lighter to pull the ball out you know just it's it's hard on your second or third hit to do that this thing's fucking easy though i took double poles like someone suggested to me in the comments whoever what that was thank you good idea because this thing cuts out after five seconds so but if you just stop and then start again it resets the timer so um i could take two hits in one that that way essentially that fucking second hit i took or was it the third i don't know that was a huge fucking hit and i held those in for a long time you guys i have a pretty big lung capacity so i think it's easy easier for me than most people to get the dose in you know like i imagine for someone who doesn't smoke weed every day um it would be much harder much much harder to take hits like that because dmt is pretty harsh it's harshly different way it doesn't burn because it's vaporized but it's it's it's spikier you know it's got a i don't know if you know what i mean by that but it spikes your lungs more than weed weed is like it's hot obviously because you burn it and it can burn if you take a big hit but i don't know vapor has like it's like the initial feeling when you you take it in is harsher for the empty for sure but then once it's in there then it's fine work weeds the other way around it kind of burns more and more the more you hold it in uh no nausea at all which is good okay guys i'm sorry if the camera just uh changed angles and it was jarring i apologize but i finished the vlog then i went and got a hot dog which i would which i can't wait to eat but but a couple more details came to me and i will forgo eating this hot dog i'm not foregoing it i'm putting it off i will eat this hot dog but a couple details came to me while i was in the kitchen that i forgot to talk about so during the trip i talked about i think i mentioned i blurted out like eye coordinates or something like that that was supposed to be a reminder for me to talk about it later because i couldn't explain it at the time but i knew i'd be able to later i want this offering so bad this happened to me in at least 10 trips before and in a couple of my last ones i keep forgetting to mention it though but at the very beginning when i'm coming up and i'm looking around i'll see numbers in the corner two numbers and i'll see like a crosshair in my vision like tracking my eye movement and it moves wherever i move my eye and the numbers change depending where i'm looking like they're coordinates tracking my eye movement like an x and a y coordinate it's very weird another thing too is in the trips where like it's the universe being revealed to me how it works in those trips like in outer space at the very beginning often it's like you've been chosen we're selecting you it doesn't say that but i it's like i hear i sense what they're trying to say without hearing the audio so it would be like you know you're chosen like you're special basically we're showing you how the universe works and you're going to be the messiah you're going to be the one to like tell everyone about this and i i get that sense and i've gotten that sense in several trips probably at least five before where it's like you've been chosen almost like a lottery like uh out of like trillions infinite number of souls they chose me to like give me the secrets and then i'm gonna go and tell everybody apparently that's how it works and that's weird that i get that but i've gotten that yeah several times i just wanted to mention that okay back to the video or maybe the video is ending now i don't know where i'm going to insert this clip so maybe bye i love you guys or maybe back to the show i don't know i'm leaving my options open it's hot talk time i deserve this hot dog pro tip pro tip if you're microwaving a hot dog throw the bun in there for a good 10 seconds the water molecule something happens to them in the bun in it it gets soft and like reinvigorates the bun especially if they were in the fridge microwaved that bun i had a couple drinks too and um smoked some weed not like pretty much right before the trip i broke the rules guys i broke the rules that pro pretty much is a rule though i would say if you do if you don't have a tolerance to weed or alcohol oh that's black that's black that's not a good color no weed you're smoking weed yet um i guess it's essentially resin building up in your in your in your in your phlegm i'm gonna say it no one likes that word but it it is it's phlegm you guys that's fine though doesn't mean anything bad it's just black you know black doesn't necessarily mean death you guys doesn't mean it's bad doesn't mean it's evil you know it's just but it's black there's a little blackness okay okay you know guys i've been feeling good in the last few months relatively speaking and [Music] i pretty i pretty much attribute that directly to my channel and how it's been doing it's been doing good and i just want to thank you guys again really thank you thank you so much you guys rock and i hope you enjoyed the video you know more to come more to come this thing hasn't even gone down that much so i feel like i got a good i don't know 10 10 videos at least out of this pen so that's that's gonna be great for the channel and it's great for you you guys like it right so everyone's everyone's winning i get i get what i get charlie sheen now that's it i'll end the video here like i said i didn't want to make a video tonight right but i think i got everything i think this will be a good nice easy edit i didn't stall too much so there's not too many cuts and that's it okay all right thank you guys for watching peace out uh i love you cheers much love be safe [Music] [Music] alright [Music] you", "dU9NVR4mOx0": "[Music] hey everyone today we're gonna be giving you a list of our top five oil cartridges so that you have a good idea of what you're getting into next time you make your oil cartridge purchase all Auto draw batteries need a cartridge with the airflow hole at the direct bottom of the tank if you're wondering why the new vaporizer you purchased won't vape your oil cartridge this is usually the reason cartridge tanks with solid connective bottoms will not work with buttons vapes this is the ex1 plastic wit cartridge with a flat head tip not really known for its big hits and good taste but it's a tried-and-true tank that's lightweight with the leak proof design and they easy to feel blue plug system be sure to preheat properly with this system as sticker oils can build up to a semi solid state on the wick so if you're looking for a cartridge that won't shadow around it though this is the cartridge for you the ex3 is a glass cartridge with a surco me of fiber heater similar to coils this cartridge gives a unique taste it feels heavy and very well made the big glass surrounding the heater allows for durability and will give you a truer quality of flavor this tank has been known not only to vape oils but ejuice to this tank features two dual Inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and because of the air hole at the bottom this can be baked with a south draw device the ex4 is a glass tank with ceramic heater it's great because of the rounded base the round base is great so that no oil or wastage get caught up there it has a wider mouthpiece than most cartridges so you'll be able to get more vapor production it features two inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and yes it's Auto draw friendly as well next is the only tank on the list we need a push to fire base and will not work on buttons as vaporizers or batteries the ex5 ii need each pilgrim or epub done for inlet holes for mediums against viscosity the egg v improves on the cartridge game by allowing you to control the amount of airflow you get great for heavy hits and with the mouthpiece being the largest of the bunch the vapor production is completely customizable to your liking but if you're not going to use the cartridge for a while it's best that you completely close the air vent even more amazing is the baseless center post assuring that you get the most out of your cartridge and that no oil is left behind and last but not least the e a fix-all cartridge this ESL style cartridge is the best fit for even the thickest of oils it features four large two millimeter inlet holes ceramic oven thick glass housing and ceramic mouthpiece and yes it is Auto drawl compatible this glass cartridge is a ceramic oven so you know what's going to give you a greater taste than any whipped cartridge out there all these cartridges are no wider than any CSL cartridge on the market and can fit into any vaporizer with the bore of ten point seven five millimeters or less please keep in mind that the thicker your oil the wider inlet hole that you'll need so that the right amount of oil can reach the heater to be vaporized without getting burned keep in mind that you shouldn't refill the cartridge is more than three times to assure you're getting the best vapor production consider subscribing for more videos like this drop us a like if you found this video helpful and leave us a comment with your feedback take care everyone", "ajCmAbusdHw": "hey guys what's up its Keith Ville here with the CVD stored comm so what I want to show you today is how to take those old cartridges and basically just refill them okay so it's pretty simple now there's a few different cartridges out there so this one here let me just move my mic out of the way but this one here what you do is you just simply unscrew the top okay if you can see that so now what you do is there's a little rubber piece here and you're gonna pull that out and you just want to make sure that you don't lose this little rubber piece say see the hole at the top okay so now what you do is you just take your refill container and there's a mail that will just go right into the female there of the cartridge once you fill it up all three quarters of the way or you know just below the top just put that little rubber piece back in let's screw that on hand tight like that and there you go and you can refill these cartridges right now there's different ones there's also um this is a thicker 350 milligram CBD oil so this one here screws off as well but it basically the top doesn't screw it off it screws off on the bottom so on this one you're gonna fill this up to the line max okay because when you put this back in what this is going to do is gonna push that oil all the way to the top so if you fill that glass all the way to the top and you put that plunger back in you're going to I'm spill the oil all over the place okay so this is what it looks like when you have it unscrewed okay this is the other part of the cartridge okay this is the mouthpiece and you're just gonna put that back in like that and screw that in so these are great when you buy a few of these what you can do is just refill them okay so you don't have to throw these out and a lot of folks don't know that so again you just unscrew this here and again you see that plunger now you could actually clean this out if you have a particular flavor in here that you know you could actually just clean that out with a a simple brush to get all that out of there or just rinse it out with some hot water but that's it you just put that together like that and not many people realize that you can filled with cartridges pump okay guys so that's it hey this is Keith with the cvd store look for some more videos guides we've got some great new products we've got the um some bee's knees 1000 I'm sorry 1200 and 3,000 added to the site those are on force we have our new 1000 milligram vape oil that is on the site that's in 12 different flavors so check us out guys CBDs store.com and look for some more videos coming your way pretty soon thanks", "AZViYFUeDac": "[Music] hey what's up guys logan here from o2 vape today we're going to address the question as to what cartridge you should choose for your 510 thread battery when it comes to cartridges there are a plethora of options to choose from it will mainly come down to what type of oil you're going to be putting in your cartridge what the viscosity of that oil is and what voltage your battery will be operating at as a general rule of thumb the thinner the oil you are using the smaller the intake hole size you want to use think of it this way if you have a super thick oil it is not gonna flow very well through tiny holes just the same if you have a very thin oil almost water like you would not want a very large intake hole because you would then most likely flood your atomizer this could result in leaking and could ruin both your cartridge and your battery here you can see the difference between a 1.2 2 millimeter intake hole in a 2.0 millimeter intake hole the smaller holes ranging from point 9 millimeter to 1.2 2 millimeter are going to work best with a thin oil such as an e juice or thin CBD liquid then there are medium oils such as a cut extract oil or thick CBD oil which are going to work best with about a 1 point six six millimeter intake hole the largest intake holes such as the 2.0 millimeter or Oh to vapes very flow cartridges are intended for very thick oils such as an uncut extract oil as for the tanks they generally come in glass or pei however the older cartridges could come in polycarbonate or plastic as well the glass tanks typically give you the highest quality however you do lose some durability most of the pei cartridges look just like glass however they are going to be much more durable these cartridges are meant to hold up to your terpenes and solvents better than the older plastic or polycarbonate cartridges which used to break down the plastic or polycarbonate cartridges are durable but not ideal for anything but thin oils such as an e liquid or highly oil there are also different types of atomizers or wicks in the cartridge the wick technology is the original technology that was used with eliquid x' this type of cartridge uses a wick to soak up the oil and then directly touches the heating element which will then heat the oil in produce vapor wick cartridges can come in either a plastic polycarbonate or glass tanks as for the ceramic atomizers they are the pinnacle of cartridge performance when it comes to using thick oils they are able to heat hotter quicker and more evenly than a wikked cartridge here at o2 vape we use what is called a wickless ceramic atomizer what this means that there is no heating element that directly touches your oil this will give you the cleanest burn and also help produce the best taste from your oils ceramic cartridges come in either a high-grade Pei or glass tank another big factor as to what cartridge to choose is going to be what voltage your battery operates at if you are using a ceramic cartridge then you will want to make sure that you are using a battery that is about 3.7 volts or higher to give you the optimal experience if you use a battery that has a lower voltage than 3.7 folds then you may be able to get a draw however it most likely will not be very big if you are using a plastic or polycarbonate cartridge then you will want to use a voltage that is lower more around 3.2 volts or so if you use a higher voltage than this on plastic cartridges or polycarbonate cartridges then you run the risk of frying that cartridge which will then lead to a burnt taste every time you draw in the cartridge unfortunately if you get to this point there is no way to fix the burnt taste one last important thing to take into consideration when choosing the right cartridge for you is going to be if that cartridge is heavy metal free currently about 99.9% of cartridges on the market come out of China with that being said there are a lot of inferior products out there that are being made very poorly some of these cartridges are starting to test positive for heavy metals such as lead cadmium arsenic and Mercury rest assure that if you are using an o2 VAP cartridge that ours have all been thoroughly tested and have all passed I hope this video helps you guys select the correct cartridge for your oils remember to check out our website at WWE to vape calm and take advantage of our coupon

bait cartridge autofilter this machine is designed to fill small disposable vape cartridges such as this quickly accurately consistently for long periods of time if you're currently filling these vape partridges by hand and looking for a better way I invite you to keep watching as I break down this durable and affordable piece of machinery first let's start off with a discussion of exactly what this machine will not come with that you're going to need to make it work number one is an air compressor you're going to need to buy an air compressor separately and make sure that it is at max 125 psi with at least a 10 gallon reservoir tank a good rule of thumb is the longer that you intend on running your machine the larger a reservoir tank you're going to need so that your air compressor doesn't work so hard to keep up with your machine now the second thing that you're going to need that we don't provide which likely you're going to need for both the machine and the air compressor is electricity so pay your electric bill and you'll have a happy machine and a working machine which means a happy business the first piece of equipment there we're going to focus on here that you will receive with your order is this pressure pot now this pressure pot is very important because this is where your material your liquid or oil will go in order to become pressurized and ultimately feed into the machine now this pressure pot is comprised of three individual pieces that all fit together number one you have this hood and through this hood it goes the feeding tube as well as this air pressure regulator valve the air pressure line which is feeding from your air compressor is going to feed pressure into this valve become regulated to a hundred psi fill up this machine and inside of this there's actually two other pieces number one you'll see an inner container here this inner container ultimately can hold your source material or hold a bottle that has your source material in it if you don't want to cover the inner container with your my source material and have increased loss then it's fine to just keep it in the bottle that you have it in the second part is of course this lower holding container once you have put the inner container with your material inside you have placed your cover on top you're going to then make the whole unit airtight by placing these four very heavy-duty wing nuts into place tightening them down in order to secure your top to the pressure pot and then you'll release the valve on your air compressor and begin to pressurize the tank in preparation for running your machine the next important piece of equipment that we're going to focus on is the pressure gun this will actually take a supply line coming from your pressure pot feed directly into the pressure gun which controls the flow of your liquid or oil into each cartridge as it moves along by the machine assisting the pressure gun in doing its job is this third piece of equipment here which is the temperature control unit which controls by degree the temperature of the entire head unit helping and assisting you to process thicker viscosity oils and liquids without encountering any sort of clogs in the needle or head unit as its processing through the machine now the fourth piece of equipment that we're going to focus on here is probably the most impressive as well and that is the filling robot itself it has two control panels that a user should become very familiar with one of them is this handheld controller right here it allows you to program all parameters for this machine as well as containing all pre-mapped programs that will become preset from the factory to work with the cartridges that you want to process through this machine now once all the parameters have been set in this handheld control unit there is a very simple front terminal interface that a new user can step up and start using immediately with a minimal learning curve it only consists of five buttons one is the on/off button number two is the start pause button number three is this stop reset button for use in an emergency number four is this program reset button for whenever the machine becomes out of calibration for any reason and number five is this line purge button this button is used to hold the air pressure gun in place and purge the line of any air bubbles or clogs before you start the machine the final piece of equipment we're going to focus on is arguably the most important and that is this custom cartridge holder we call it a jig it's designed to hold 100 cartridges in rows of 10 by 10 now you may be wondering how do I get one made for the cartridges I use and how do I fill it well these come pre map from the factory to fit transferring cartridges and one of the advantages of ordering transferring cartridges is that they will come in these wonderful foam inserts these foam inserts are designed to match the machining of your jig exactly so that you can simply lay them on top press them down into place vastly reducing your loading times and saving you time and money throughout the life of your machine now as I stated before the front panel has a dead simple user interface so that a new user can immediately step to this machine and get it working to begin the action here I'm simply going to press this lighted start button in order to start our filling now as we zoom in for a closer look at this machine as it begins its filling program you're going to notice how quickly it fills each cartridge it's currently programmed to fill each 1 ml cartridge in under one second meaning this entire 100 cart jig can be filled in under two minutes now as we move in for an even closer look the second thing you'll notice is the incredible accuracy of this machine no cartridge is under-filled no cartridges overfilled and there are no drips between cartridges this helps eliminate human error reduce waste and ultimately increase your profits and yield over the lifetime of this machine now I spoke before about the dead simple operation of this machine let's say you're a new user and you'd like to pause the action well all you need to do is come over here and press the start pause button pausing the machine allowing you to restart the action from where it left off at your leisure by simply repressing the start pause button much like the start or the play pause button on your DVR or DVD player now let's say that you would like to stop the filling completely and reset the machine back to its original starting position all you need to do is press this start button and with a simple twist the machine resets back to its original position releasing the jig and allowing you to address any issues so now that we've seen this machine in action I'm sure that you have a lot of questions including how to order one well I can answer all those questions and more if you contact me directly by emailing me at USA at transferring comm or by giving me a call at 925 four zero five five five eight to offer the only us-based sales and service for this filling machine and I have warranty service that is back directly by the factory so I can answer all your questions about ordering customization installation and ongoing maintenance for this machine also in the meantime be sure to subscribe to our channel as we post more videos about how to clean this machine calibrate it and customize it for your particular operation I want to thank you for watching and stay posted for more informative videos about the transferring vape cartridge autofilter machine", "vM4mFkJN7kU": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we're bringing you the latest addition to our honey stick 510 slim tank family which is our full ceramic honey stick tank now a lot of comments that I've gotten in the YouTube channel since we've started whenever we're launching cartridges and emails I've gotten from from you guys of viewers as well as my extraction clients and partners that we make cartridges for is they want something that is a hundred percent heavy metals safe state of California as they have cracked down on eliquids and a lot of other things because they are definitely ahead of the health curve and an innovator in the cannabis curve has outlined that certain cartridges once they've been prefilled have contained heavy metals and those may be harmful for you so they are still testing all of that and not all the research is in but a lot of companies and a lot of you guys out there like hey I want a cartridge that I make sure there's absolutely no heavy metals in it because I don't want to take the chance and rightfully so so we had cartridges made and brought in and they're now available on our website that passed the phase three heavy metals test of California before we even brought them in our manufacturers had already been working with with California we told them the designs we wanted and these came back and passed the test because they are 100% ceramic on the interior ceramic on the exterior they use a ceramic heater and do not use any heating components that will set off the heavy metals test and also they're the only ones that pass all those tests with flying colors and we can really sign off on and say it lives up to the honey stick performance now all of our other tanks we have sent over we are testing and we will get those published as the industry moves more towards that but we want to be ahead of the curve and make sure we offer something for you guys so this right here our full ceramic cartridge we have them available and are already private labeling these for a lot of our extraction partners and a half mil size so that's a half gram and also the 1 gram size which is the one milliliter capacity cartridge now these are gonna be full ceramic interior body if we can zoom in and get a nice close-up as you can see you have a full ceramic interior body center post bottom base medical grade silicone gaskets sealing the bottom pieces which the blocks are also made out of ceramic and it has a ceramic heater core power plant now you say oh you know that's all good and well it's safe but does it vape up the challenge and yes it does these things definitely do hit hard and they vape well and because of ceramic in tin internals they're gonna maintain a really nice flavor of purity for all you purists up there you're definitely gonna get more of those turf tastes out of here because it is not interacting with anything except for the pure coated thick grade ceramic now the heater actually people say okay what's the orifice hole size now this has a unique orifice hole and I'm not sure you can a hundred percent get this onto the camera from this angle but it is a dual two millimeter valack kind of a moon shaped heater absorption system so you're still get a lot of good absorption you're gonna get a nice vape cloud it's not gonna you know run into any bad situations when you're putting the thicker oils or CBD oils or distillates in there you know this cartridge is made to perform so you also have the medical grade silicone internals as I said to make sure this thing is sealed up and doesn't leak and you have the the full ceramic mouthpiece that is gonna feel nice on the lips and is also going to be sturdy as well as easy to clean now these are not one use tanks however they are disposable so you could get a handful refills out of them as long as your key easier gentle with them because they are ceramic you do have to be a little bit more gentle with them even though the glass is a high quality of Pyrex grade glass you do have to be gentle with them because the ceramic internals are not metal and they if you bend them or put a lot of pressure on them ceramic does have the tendency when you put unneeded pressure on them to break so be a little bit more delicate with these tanks however know that you are getting a good bang for your buck now how do you fill these up and what are some of the tips that that I can give you guys when you're when you're filling these tanks and using these tanks because they are relatively new and innovative so when you have these tanks there we're gonna send them to you partially opened right there to make it easy you're gonna remove the mouthpiece and as you're gonna see you have a threaded ceramic shaft along with the little silicone gaskets these are gonna help give you the seal so you're gonna have the top mouthpiece that's also gonna have a little gasket that's gonna be a glass sealer because these threads are ceramic if you put a lot of pressure on them and twist because the ceramic threads have to line up you're gonna strip the ceramic and it is then going to compromise it's not gonna you know particle eyes or anything like that but it's gonna wear down and you are not going to have a good seal and if you leave your tank on its side they're upside down once it's been filled you do run a higher chance of leaking and you're not gonna have you know the fully sealed air flow possibly that you want so it might affect your rips as well so this is just a caution point this is why we do the videos so when you're putting them together you're gonna fill around the outside edges around the center posts you're gonna fill up with your oils or concentrates your CBDs and then you're gonna take this top and you are going to gently apply pressure and it's going to kind of stop and then you're just gonna twist and give it a little bit of prep just very little pressure and it's gonna take a little bit longer and then you're gonna feel the thread catch and the rubber gasket the glass is going to compress and as soon you feel the rubber gasket compress against the glass then you're gonna know that you are all sealed up there you go boom nice and sealed I wasn't pushing it out enough buddy there you go now it's nice and sealed it's flush I felt it it came to a stop do not overtighten the tank otherwise you're gonna run the risk of stripping it that's why I twist a little bit more times because I didn't want to put too much pressure on it I gave it a little bitty push it was enough I gave a little bitty more push and the thread caught perfectly and now it is all lined up it is sealed and you are ready to vape just remove this end cap here screw this on to your favorite 510 thread battery and yes this does work with auto draws as you see the little air hole on there I don't know if you could zoom in to see the little air hole so it does work with auto draws screw it on to your favorite battery and give this thing a try so again if you're looking for a purist experience something that passes the latest legislation

cartridges in an eight-hour day with next to zero waste an absolute minimal clean-out required for the next minute or so we're going to give you a very quick look at this remarkable new system to include its speed precision and flexibility you probably have questions and may wish to see more so will follow with a detailed step-by-step guide to the installation and operation of our new 810 hotshot systems for openers you're looking at the number one reason you need our hotshot 1500 speed at the rate you're now watching you can fill this entire tray of 50 carts in a few ticks under 2 minutes without removing them from vendor-supplied foam blocks we'll show you how in the demo for now let's do the math 50 carts in 2 minutes 1500 carts an hour 12,000 filled cartridges in a single eight-hour day from single a 10 hotshot system reason to control and precision fill any volume cart from point 3 3 grams to one full gram with total volume control in point 0 1 gram increments point zero 1 reason 3 flexibility use our Hot Shot 1500 to fill any oil viscosity use it to swap out batches mid-run use it to quickly and precisely fill almost any style vape cart pen or syringe speed precision flexibility you're 100 percent card filling solution our new 810 hotshot systems are available in two models and both are detailed at hotshot cool jars comm check them out right now however there's a lot to know about the new a 10 and you probably have some questions so here's an in-depth up-close very detailed look how to put our new hotshot to work let's start with system setup this is the super speed 810 hotshot 1500 the fastest of the two models cool jars offers it weighs around 15 pounds and takes up about 2 square feet of table space just make sure it's on a stable level surface to start find the 16 ounce bottle of blue heat transfer fluid and pour the entire contents into the blue reservoir now slide the Innova stainless-steel immersion heating element into the reservoir twisting slightly to make sure it's fully seated positioned correctly you'll see three dimples level with the top of a reservoir next mount our black nonstick oil tank onto the a10 to ensure proper connection align this white cam with the slot in the a10 press down firmly until seated then turn clockwise to lock in place here's something that will interest you our oil tanks features self sealing one-way check valve so you can swap out tanks and batches mid run to remove the tank turn counterclockwise to unlock then pull straight up model 1500 comes with two oil tanks and you can order additional tanks as an option more about swapping tanks later next install an a-10 oil injection needle our component kit contains needles of varying sizes which gives you options to fit style cards your filling we suggest you select the shortest length you can to lessen pressure on internal piston assembly and thread the needle into port and use the blue plastic thumb socket in the kit to tighten being careful not to over tighten now install your selected fill switch in our high-performance model 1502 options are available our new button activated speed tray plus our foot activated fill pedal both options plug into the USB port on the left front side of the a10 we'll use our new speed tray for purposes of this demonstration next connect power source plug the round mail and the power transformer into the rear of the a10 control box now plug the transformer and the Innova heating element into a switched power surge strip that's rated for at least 10 amps that's it for system setup let's talk about operation first activate the a-10 system by powering up the surge strip now power up the Innova heating element by pressing the red button on front of the display panel the button will display white when activated quick note press and hold this button for a few seconds to switch readings from Fahrenheit to Celsius press and hold again to switch back select whichever scale you prefer now pour desired amount of batch oil into the nonstick tank it will hold any amount up to one thousand grams per tank cover with lid next adjust system operating temperature using the thumb wheel on front of the Innova display rolled up to increase roll down to decrease you can adjust the Nova in 1/2 degree increments an initial setup adjust he's set into 170 degrees Fahrenheit to fully heat the a-10 system and set the onboard heat switch this is important when the a-10 system is fully heated actual oil temperature will be anywhere from twenty to thirty degrees lower than the Innova setting depending on viscosity of oil use a heat gun to determine the actual oil temperature then adjust the Innova as necessary to reach your desired oil temperature once the a-10 system is activated the main touchscreen will light up the screen will not show operational controls until a system and oil are fully heated if attempts are made to operate system prior to heating this waiting for heater message will be displayed when operational controls appear on the touch screen the a-10 is ready for use use a test screen for all inputs first select this casa t from one of three options available on the model 1500 olive oil glycerin and honey select the option that best describes the estimated miss custody of your batch at fil temperature now select shot size from one of three options point three three grams point five grams at one gram a custom setting is also available volumes are adjustable in point zero one gram increments next select speed using the up and down arrows on the five bar graph each bar represents a 20% increase or decrease in fill speed finally select end count to input the number of fills you wish to perform once desired fill count is reached the a 10 will stop flow of oil to reset press hole to reset for a few seconds to zero out the reading with these few settings in place they're ready to go following initial setup first prime or purge 18 system by holding a container under needle and pressing fill switch several times until oil is dispensed returned priming oil to main tank so you don't waste it next test cartridge fill volume using a very precise scale weigh the container you're using to prime the system inject a shot then weigh container again the difference will be the shop volume repeat as necessary adjusting volume on touchscreen to achieve desired amount adjustments can be made in point 0 1 gram increments as an alternative volume testing procedure way an empty cart before and after filling and make any necessary adjustments once made these volumes will remain consistent throughout the batch now let's fill some cards the a-10 model 1500 features a new high volume speed tray with a button activated fill switch it is really really fast to use it cut a typical vendor-supplied 100 card foam block in half and place a 50 cart block in speed tray this lets you fill carts directly in the block instead of removing and filling one by one now position needle in corner cart inject pre-measured fill using onboard switch and move on to the next cart you will be absolutely amazed at the speed you can achieve with our new 8n hotshot with speed tray once comfortable with the process you can typically fill this tray of 50 carts and something under 2 minutes even a 2 minutes per tray that's 1,500 carts an hour and that's 12,000 carts a day if you prefer to use our foot-activated fill switch there's no need to cut a hundred cart foam block unless you prefer to fill smaller quantities so you can cap them quicker simply position the foam block under injection arm insert needle in the corner cart depress foot pedal to inject each shot and move on when you fill 50 cards on one side reverse block and Faure it could not possibly be quicker and easier incidentally flow rates will depend on a number of factors including viscosity of oil heat of oil size of carts etc you can fine-tune your fills by adjusting viscosity speed and shot size settings to achieve optimum flow rate finally we'd like to show you a few quick procedures that will keep your oil processing operation running smoothly first a quick needle change demo use the blue plastic thumb socket in the kit unscrew the needle and return the kit insert new needle tighten lightly with tool and you're good to go next a tank change if you're changing in the middle of a batch run the tank will be warm so make sure you're wearing gloves turn tank counterclockwise to unlock and pull straight up a check valve will stop the flow of oil though you may have a few residual drops to wipe up now insert a fresh tank it can be empty full or partially full twist a lock and you're ready to rock fix maybe 30 seconds since we're talking about the tank if you wish to do a total clean-out and would like to replace oring in the valve first remove tank as previously described and empty remove valve with three-quarter inch socket using six in one tool in the kit without the bit push up spring-loaded valve to reveal Oh ring remove old ring with a single edge razor blade replace the spare o-ring in the kit we install valve with socket and you're done additional earrings are available on our website if you're having problems achieving a consistent shot size it may be a partial blockage of the upper or lower valve due to oil residue here's how to replace both for the upper valve remove tank as previously demonstrated and use supplied socket drive to remove valve model 1500 comes with replacement valves so look for one in the kit screw into place tighten lightly with socket drive replace tank reprime system is described previously and continue filling procedures finally here's how to replace a lower valve remove tank as previously demonstrated using Philips screw bit on the 61 tool in your kit unscrew the 90 degree bulkhead on front of the injection arm next use the hex wrench to loosen the two screws on either side of the arm and slide injection arm straight out using the six in one tool without the screw bit carefully unscrew the lower valve reverses procedure to install that's all there is to it as mentioned early on our new cool drawers Hot Shot cart filling systems deliver the speed precision and flexibility you need to achieve optimum profitability from oil product lines and here's something else to consider if you're like most current 810 users you have at least one filling system gathering dust on your shelf because it just flat doesn't get it done enough you've tried the rest not ordered the best the all-new cool jars a

some questions that you sent to us through YouTube or Instagram and yeah everybody's gonna be anonymous for privacy purposes so here we go question number one new to vaping what factor does voltage play in to vaping amazing question first of all I would say in order to understand voltage you need to understand mas casa t so viscosity is just the thinness or the thickness of your oils so if you have a thick oil which basically you can tell by flipping over your cartridge upside down and if it doesn't move or takes forever in a day to move you have a thick oil if it takes like five seconds probably a medium and then if it's almost instantly you got a you got a thin oil so thinner oils would need a lower voltage and thicker oils would need a higher voltage if you vape thin oils on a higher voltage you run the risk of burning the oil itself and if you vape thicker oils at low temperatures it might not heat up all of the oil in and you might not get the draw that you're looking for also cartridges play a factor into this sometimes because of the air hole but that's a whole nother video I'll link I'll put a link to it like right around here somewhere so you want to make sure that you get the full inhalation of your draw and you also want to make sure that you're not burning your oils either alright question number two can I refill my cartridge with new oils absolutely I would say don't do it more than twice otherwise you run the risk of clogging old oils might get stuck in there and so don't burn your new oils correctly you might lose flavor taste vapor production it could leak you know because it's just over time I mean you know you want to change the oil in your car and with this it's just like this is you're actually inhaling it and this is going in your body so you want the best quality of you know oil that you can find plus if you're like a flavor chaser and you know somebody who likes to try and taste different strains you know it's best if you change your oils you know once maybe twice and then dispose of them because they're they're not meant to last forever next question says do these work with normal vape liquids no no they don't uh vape liquid is too thin it'll drip out it'll leak out into the battery you know that you'll have connectivity problems if you do that I wouldn't put a juice in it odds these aren't meant for a juice how do I put a juice into my ex5 cartridge so again not free juice but all the cartridges that we sell they're all top fill so you unscrew the top cap or if it's plastic and it has a plug you just fill down the plug if it's a ceramic mouthpiece just take the mouthpiece off fill it around the heating tube because the heating tube is gonna or the heating post is gonna be directly down the center there's gonna be a hole down there where you can look straight down through it that's where the air flow comes from do not put anything in there what you want to do is have the oil drip around that post touching the glass and and being on the inside of the glass you want to be able to see the oil rise up you don't want if you put it through that post you're not gonna be able to see anything it's just gonna leak straight down into your battery and the ex5 cartridge is as a top fill you just remove it I believe the heating post is actually connected to the mouthpiece so you just squeeze it on in there it's it it's it's a dope it's a dope cartridge you can control the air flow through it - it's pretty hardcore um next question how long do I inhale while holding the button so the button will usually just hold for a good 10 to 15 seconds and you uh you can't you can't hold it for for more than that but usually as soon as you put the cartridge you know to inhale you're gonna hold the button down and then let go when you're done and just you know it won't last more than 15 seconds and then the really the rest is just up to you how long do I have to charge the battery for it does the pen light have to flash or the battery and the charger have to stay green so I know it's full it really depends on the unit you have and for the most part for the most part pins that have adapted connectors or you plug you plug them into the 510 threading you plug that into a computer it's gonna light red and hold red and then it will transition into green and hold green if it's something like this sometimes they'll flash 20 times I know the snap flash is 20 20 times and this one it flashes eight times and then it goes blank um you know just read the instructions I would say so to answer your first question how long do you charge the battery I would say no more than two hours you know some even less than an hour depending you got to watch them and get to know it you know it's something that you're gonna be carrying around in your pocket with you all day every day you know so it's good to know like what what you have on your body but usually what I would do is when I first get it use it up let it die twice charge it for two hours and then never past one hour again alright and can you use it while charging he was talking about the wolf duo no you cannot you cannot use it while it's charging it's not it doesn't have a bypass on it but this one does this is the wolf uni you can charge it or yeah you can't vape it while you're charging it next question hey I just got a new cartridge and whenever I put it in my uni just flashes but when I put in another cartridge it works fine what should I do the best method is basically what you did you know you tried another cartridge inside of the battery and it works so you ruled out that the battery was fine it was just the cartridge that I was having an issue the cool thing about all vaporizers is that they'll try to talk to you they'll try to okay with you if it's something internal with the cartridge it'll probably read as a misfire which will flash three times if it's something as simple as like the cartridge is fine the battery is fine maybe there's a magnet involved it's just not getting a connective touch to it it just can't read the cartridge it'll flash five times just an error like that it could be something like with the magnets you know the magnet might not be screwed into the proper length so sometimes maybe you want to back off the magnet a little bit from the from the cartridge itself back it off put it back in and see if that works so right now it's telling me one two three four five that means I cannot it cannot read the cartridge there's nothing wrong with the cartridge nothing wrong with the vapin but five times tells me that it's just not connecting to the battery so when I screw it back on I put it back in I'm able to get some draws try different cartridges different batteries different batteries and different cartridges kind of rule them out rule out problems if they indicate if you don't understand what the indicator is trying to tell you other than that I would say you know give customer service a call I'm sure we can take care of it for you that'll do it for today guys hope that was helpful let us know if you want to see more of these send in your questions I want to know I want to answer them but yet peace", "JycsAewFOz4": "COUNTY JAIL.

kit that is gonna take care of a problem that I know everybody who's in oil vaporizers has encountered which is your vaping your favorite cartridge and all of a sudden it stops working or you're vaping it down to where oil is no longer going into the orifice holes and you have a bunch of your valuable oil stuck at the bottom of the cartridge or your heater gives out or your disposable runs out of battery life but you have a cartridges no longer functioning which still has some of your precious oil CBD e-juice terpenes whatever and you want to try to excavate them so what honey stick did it was we made it really easy for you by launching our oil recovery kit which is everything that you need to help get a non-functioning cartridge that still has valuable oil in it out of the kit in today's episode we're gonna briefly run through the contents of this kit and how to use it to excavate oil out of your cartridge now just to backtrack a little bit the way that that we got this idea is actually one of our authorized distributors and my buddy Darrell over a rich mountain distribution he sent me a picture which I'm gonna make the video guy find and put up here on the YouTube screen as it said modern-day roaches and it showed a bunch of vape cartridges that are you know like quarter full or half full and not working laying around like you know people would have these Roach jars of these little collections of people have these little graveyards of non-working cartridges and vape accessories with oil left and so I was like man I showed that a couple of our employees just to get a laugh out of it and they were like oh I have one of those I have one of those I was like wow you know everybody must have one of those so let's make something to try to bring those non-working vape devices or the valuable contents in them back to life hence our oil recovery kit and let's make it affordable and easy to use so oil recovery kit available on WWE stay calm is gonna be selling for under ten bucks if you use the promo code that I'll give you guys at the end of the video you get an extra couple bucks off so let's jump right into what the kids contents are and how we generally use it so just to come this real simple plastic container which a lot of stores that because we whole sale and distribute a lot can have them just hanging in the stores so they have a little hanger here you're gonna get your kit you're gonna have your contents of the kit on the back let's get a little close-up so two filling syringes four blunt tips two syringe caps and some VG PG solution so let's go ahead and jump right in you just gonna open your kit and it's gonna slide right out you're gonna have a nice tray to keep all your stuff organized in and you're gonna have a really nice large instruction card here that basically explains very simply how to use this kit but we're gonna go through all this in the video so let's even though I briefly ran off the contents let's go through what we have here so you have two syringes these are two medical grade plastic syringes that you can use and this is used for excavating or rejecting your oils now these syringes they have a thread on them right in here which you will screw your your syringe blunt tip the into nice and firmly to pull pull the oil out or to re-inject the oil and when you're not using it if you have any oils in them you're gonna have these syringe caps right here which you're going to be able to use to seal up your syringe to make sure that you have no leaking all right so let's go through what type of blunt tips we have and what really they're used for on this side over here you have different you have different lengths of syringe needles because you're gonna have different cartridges and different devices where you might have to get down either deeper into the device or you might need a skinnier device to work with because certain cartridges for example they have a center post which doesn't give you that much space along the edges so you might need a skinnier needle to fit down in there or with certain cartridges you might have a thicker oil that you need a wider gauge needle just so that you can draw it out so here we have our thinnest gage oil and I'm going to use this just to kind of pry out here you have a very thin gauge needle let's get a close-up of that this is like a teal green color in our kit very thin it's about a about an inch in length the the shaft here is about an inch and a half and then no it's about an inch and it has a very thin opening you're not going to want to use this for any oils that are really thick you would mainly want to use this for thinner terpenes or for very thin oils or for CBDs or even for a liquid if you have it trapped in a cartridge don't use this for thicker oils and you might also be forced to use this if you have a very thin area between a cartridge and a center post to excavate your oils so this is a needle used for those devices now if we come down here to the gray needle blunt needle tip you'll notice it is slightly wider but the shaft here is only about half an inch now what you would use this for is you'd use this for slightly thicker oils or CBDs cartridges that aren't very deep because when you get down inside the cartridge the oil is more than likely to be trapped around the bottom so this would be more for larger tanks that have very open areas Torrey you can actually put the whole needle down in there to excavate your oil and this is also a good needle tip that is used for dispensing oil so once you've recovered your oil from being able to shoot it back into your cartridge because it's a very small it's a very agile you know you can you can point it down into places you don't have to worry about using something that is much longer that might be a little bit clumsy or when you're dispensing your oil so that's what you would use this needle for here it's a blunt needle tip so here we have four even thicker oils you have your kind of a kind of a Shrek green colored cartridge here or you know like a little Oscar the Grouch shade you have a thicker needle with a longer base this is gonna be for also for excavating out much thicker oils so the thickness and the needle you're gonna use for what type of thickness of material you're trying to draw out of your cartridge so make sure that you use the right and you know because if you have too thick of contents you use too thick of a needle it is just not going to draw out or it's gonna be very difficult so you have this needle is slightly thicker then if you come over here to the very far end you have a needle that's slightly thinner but longer so this is probably gonna be one your go-to stand that's why we showcase it because it's nice and long so you can get down inside cartridges it's not overly thick but the ring gauge of this needle is thick enough so it's gonna be all draw up a lot of the the thicker oils or sludgy oils now the other thing that we have that we explained here earlier is your needle covers they're gonna cover your syringes these don't cover the actual blunt needle tips but they will screw in once you've drawn oil out and you you're gonna store a syringe for later use you simply screw it in to the syringe and then it's sealed it makes a nice airtight you don't have to worry about leakage or anything like that you can put it up for storage now here we have some pg/vg solution now before my purists jumped into the comments section of this this video and start saying you don't want to mix out with your oils this is really only to be used in circumstances that you cannot draw the oil out that is too thick you cannot heat up the oils it's not it's not going to come out or there's just too little oil in there so what you would do is you would take some of this pg/vg which is available and you take it you put some into your cartridges close the cartridge up mix it around it'll give you something to draw out because if you're saving oil saving some oil and being able to vape it is better than being able to save no oil and vaping it so this is only really to be used in very difficult circumstances where you're not able to draw your oil or there's not as much oil in there to draw out it's really just you you add it in there you mix it around let it sit for a little bit and then you would go on with your excavation process so there's really for emergency situations where you would have something difficult to draw now let's go into what the procedure would be we're gonna do some much more specific videos of some of the customers if you guys can drop into the comments section below what cartridges you guys have had difficulty with so we can get the type of cartridge and make specific videos for how to excavate oil out of those cartridges that would be really helpful to us and we can make some really specific videos for other people who are having problems with and getting oil out of a specific cartridge how myself or James would go in there and go about maximizing the amount of oils you can salvage out of your cartridge that fail but I'm just gonna run through a real general kind of basic procedure of what you want to go through when you're looking at any cartridge to save some oil and as you guys comment we'll make some more specific videos and get them up here on the channel for you so first thing you want to do is you want to have your cartridge now I have these little styrofoam blocks in our shop because when we're buying a lot of cartridges that are made of glass it's really safe to ship them in these but what you want to do is you want to have a cartridge and you want to have it standing upright on a surface where you can get at it and perform a little bit of perform your excavation process without worrying about the cartridge falling over there falling out of your hand and breaking so these things are just really useful to have you can really easily just cut out a piece of foam or whatever use a small vise or something but you want to have your cartridge standing upright in on a stable area to where you can use both of your hands and not really worry about what you're gonna do this was actually a child lock cartridge so it's locked but you want to have it to where you can access it you can see it and you can use both hands to jump in and perform what you have to perform in there second of all most these oils especially colder temperatures a thicker before you start any excavation process you want to get your oil as viscous as possible you want you want that liquid to flow okay and be as thin as possible so you can pull it out easier so what I recommend is once you have it sitting there get a hairdryer and heat up the cartridge if you're in a warm climate state we're in Florida a lot of you guys are in sunny you know Southern California you can simply just walk outside and leave the cartridge outside for a few minutes and it'll it'll get really nice and thinned out take a hairdryer if you're gonna use a lighter make sure you don't put the lighter directly on the glass or plastic or whatever you're drawing it out of because you could compromise the cartridge you could you know burn it you can have it react with your oils you can melt a plastic one so if you're using a lighter or something be extremely cautious to hold it at a safe distance so you're only using the outside of the heat cone to get your cartridge warm you don't need to get hot you just need to get it warm and then once you're your contents in there they're about as thin as they can be then you're gonna go through and you're gonna select the appropriate tool that is gonna fit down in there but still be thick enough to draw out your liquids if I have a thicker oil that I'm using then I want to make sure that I'm using a nice as we mentioned before a nice wider gage syringe tip blunt needle tip which we're going with Shrek green and you want to make sure that it's gonna fit between the center post this one does fit however because this has an edge here I might want to use something a little bit thinner just so I can really get down into there this one is gonna work a little bit better now the thing is is because this come this specific cartridge comes in so close here I'm never gonna fully get everything that is around the orifice holes I'm if I kind of heat and then I tilt it and I come in at an angle so you're gonna have to play around with each specific cartridge certain other cartridges you're gonna be able to just jump right in there but it really depends on where the where where the base where how the base is how the center post is and how big of an opening you have to work with not each cartridge is gonna be the same you're gonna have to tinker and tamper around with them a little bit which is why I'm really encouraging you guys to drop into the video section brand names of cartridges you guys seem to be having problems with so we can do really cartridge specific videos but I've taken our performer tank for example which has a really open surface that you can get into so it's really not going to be picky as to which blunt needle tip you're gonna work down and get in there with okay and I've even had our sub-ohm which for example if you had a heat or go out and you're trying to pull your oils out I have it open here it's not gonna be picky you could basically fit the whole syringe in there so what you're gonna do is you're gonna select your proper cartridge make sure there's the needle plunger here that's what they call this a plunger it's completely pushed in okay then you could take this and you can make sure that's firmly screwed in there so it's locked in there then once you've made it down heat it up the cartridge you go down in there and you very slowly place the needle down to the bottom but you don't push it down to the bottom to where the needle cannot draw up the oils or get off air this works on air suction from you guys who aren't familiar with it and then you're gonna very slowly just draw up the oils don't reject them and draw them up so that when you're drawing it the oil doesn't get stuck here in the in the the syringe valve and the so as you draw it up the oil is gonna travel up here even if you see that you've pulled all the oils out give this an extra pull so you don't have any oils that are stuck inside the blunt needle tip because if you just take it out of the cartridge and you stop you stop withdrawing and you take this off you can have a significant amount of oil stuck in any portion of here so you want to make sure to keep drawing so the oil makes its way past the blunt needle tip as well as the base and makes its way into the syringe and once you've drawn it out take one of your syringe caps here with the kit take off your blunt needle tip you can drop this in the isopropyl alcohol right away to clean it if you do have some stuck in there then take whatever new cartridge you would be filling it in to use your other syringe [ __ ] it back a little bit screw it on and then push down and it will shoot the oil the air pressure will shoot the oil into whatever the little remaining oils into whatever cartridge you are placing it into so that's just a little tip there once you have this sealed you can store these syringes even though it says discard after use that is for safeties you don't want to be constantly you know mixing stuff but these are cleanable you do have to clean them after every use if you're gonna reuse them we will be selling extra bulk syringes on the website so you guys don't have to buy the whole kit at one shot we will be putting those up a little bit later but this should serve as a very useful kit for those of you who have experimented with cartridges or just any type of oils or CBD mixing or injecting you definitely want to have one of these definitely come in handy I mean we've already had half of our employees have already taken them to go work on their graveyard of cartridges so definitely get a lot of use out of this get it will be

the best Penn batteries for 510 THC or CBD cartridges this episode is sponsored by New York vape shop you can find all the devices use in this video at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with a code rough 2 with a growing trend of THC and CBD oil 510 thread cartridges out there you may find yourself in the dilemma of wondering which is the best kind of vaporizer battery to use for it there's almost as many types of devices as there are cartridges themselves we're gonna look at the stylist type the flat micro a variable voltage a mini compact as well as it box mod vaporizers [Music] first up is the stylist now the stylist is the most simple of all of them it doesn't have a power button does it have any controls or anything like that is air operated and it's just usually a simple stick with a 5-10 thread on one end they are compatible with most types of cartridges and are really really easy to use you just inhale and it automatically works just by inhaling through it the pros of a stylus are is they're simple to operate and usually like I said the most affordable the cons are you have very limited temperature options and usually they're small and they have a small battery capacity next up we have the micro or the flat style and you can see it's flatter it's not round like the other ones and it still has the 510 thread at the top and it fits most different types of cartridges one thing I like about these is that they're usually charging by USB and like I said they are adaptable with many different types of the cartridges pretty much any kind the difference between this and a stylus it does have a power button and many times not always but many times it also has multiple different power settings this is a Z steam cloud micro available at NY vape shop comm and it does have three different settings for temperature the pros are the micro Penzer they're affordably priced usually about 20 bucks for these they usually have micro USB charger rather than the the kind of you plug into the USB adapter they're very compact easy to hide a problem again is that they're usually small and have a small battery capacity next up we're gonna look at the variable voltage pin now much like the other ones this is a style like a pin style vaporizer but the big difference on this is that it has a variable voltage and usually this is at the bottom sometimes it's at the top though but usually at the bottom there's a little dial that you can use to set the voltage at different types and then you could use it for different temperatures different types of cartridges or just to get a different flavor intensity when you use the vaporizer these usually have a power button and rather than having multiple settings it's a variable control at the bottom the pros of these type are is that you can dial in the best voltage for your cartridge that you're using and you can use them with other types of add-ons as well - and usually they have stronger batteries than the other two smaller the cons are is that the height of it leaves the carts vulnerable and they're larger and they're less stealthy and can't really put them in your pocket as easily and this brings us to the compact style pin or them this is the actually of the Steam Cloud Mini 2.0 and these are like a side-by-side the cartridge actually goes down beside the battery they're USB charging usually and you can see that there's a little cut out there where the cartridge will go down into it they do require usually some sort of magnetic adapter that will help you adapt the cartridge and so it'll stick into the device when you stick it in there and they also require or they don't necessarily require but they work better with the cartridges that are a little bit longer and unless they have an adapter that actually extends it which some of them do I really like these kind because they're very pocket friendly the pros are that they're compact and stealthy and that insect connection it protects your cartridge because your cartridges handout in the device cons are it does require a magnetic adapter they're usually included but they're small and easy to lose and it's best suited for the longer cartridges as the small ones might get lost out inside and now we're going to look at the box mod you might consider the Box mod sort of the helicopter uh vaporizer pens it's a little bit more complicated most of the others it has a power button it also usually has a an up-and-down button to control the variable voltage it also has a compatibility with sub ohm tanks so you have a lot of vast compatibility here and you also have a lot of functions on these that you may not ever even need to use with a actual cartridge pin because they work with a lot of other kinds of add-ons and adapters and sub ohm tanks and such like that but they are so very effective for the cartridges they fit most 510 threads just fine and you can lower the voltage down to suit whatever kind of cartridge that you have in the device at the time I really like using the Box mod especially this one this is the steam cloud and it's the steam cloud box mod it's a lot smaller than some of the other ones it's very compact and really easy to use with these cartridges the pros and cons are the sizes 510 cartridges and sub ohm tanks it has most options for the power and resistance and different settings and it usually has the strongest batteries the cons are is that they are bigger and less stealthy although this is a small one and usually they're more expensive than the standard types of vaporizer pins so when it comes down to it it kind of depends on your needs if you really want simplicity and affordability one of the micro or the stylus is probably best for you if you like adaptability then you probably want to go with the variable voltage at the minimum I personally like these compact ones because they protect the actual cartridge itself and they're really really pocket friendly and stealthy and if you're a purist or if you really want to get the most bang for your buck you might want to get with the box mods and use it with lots of different devices if you want to pick up any of the devices that we use today be sure to check out NY vape shop comm use the code rough 2 to get a free gift and thanks again to those guys for sponsoring this video I hope you

this is Matt Roth how stereos thanks for watching [Music]", "ldodqwERjx0": "[Music] hello everybody welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are going to be reviewing a cart from a company that i've seen around for some time i've seen them selling their flour at a lot of uh shops here in southern california especially the long beach area for it seems like a couple of years uh and now it looks like like a lot of folks they are branching out getting into other kinds of products um i know uh that this these people are now doing cartridges they're doing uh different concentrates and they are also doing tinctures of uh different varieties uh and what is that company that company is cresco cresco and this is their indica cartridge just uh nominally called rest it is their half uh gram cartridge 500 milligrams um and i picked this up for i actually couldn't tell you what the real cost was i it was uh some combination of purchasing this and one of their tinctures some kind of uh discount but i think they're a more affordable brand i think this is probably in the realm of like 20 to 25 for a half gram cart not too bad um in terms of packaging um it is uh refreshingly minimalistic not a lot of uh you know extra materials here just simple cardboard but all the information you want to see uh so the it is also in addition to being their rest line uh it is the critical purple push strain uh excuse me critical purple kush rather we all knew that and then you've got lab testing results there on the side a little sticker and then on the bottom you do have the um thc results and that comes in at 76.5 percent uh for 382 and a half percent or 382 milligrams of thc if that'll focus so uh this is pretty standard 510 fare here um uh no special pod or different kind of battery involved just your standard good old-fashioned 510 vape thread battery which you know feels to me like is uh becoming more and more of a uh a rarity to find uh the universal beloved 510 thread okay so we've ripped some tape off here at the bottom now we've got some push to do pushing pulling and there we go ah yes and this is a liquid live resin the uh still uh lost a little bit of its luster the term live resin not as much of a buzzword as it once was but still a lot of uh live resin devotees and this is apparently live resin uh and so here we are here is our cartridge design um got the plastic acrylic tip which is not my favorite uh but otherwise pretty standard looking 510 thread doesn't look like the nicest materials in the world but i don't think it's the most expensive cart either so let's go ahead and use my trusty 510 here as you know if you've watched me do some of these before i used to try to use nice 510 batteries uh to do these reviews with uh but for a variety of reasons i no longer do one because even the nice 510 batteries suck and they break down and then two i realized most people don't actually who are using these cartridges don't use a nice fancy online purchase battery they use the one that came free in the store the one that costs 10 bucks at the convenience shop or whatever they're not you know out there looking for the best so this is more uh in line with what a lot of people are experiencing uh not that this one's terrible just a standard 510 uh this one is raw garden branded i think it cost me like 12 bucks some number of months ago so uh without further ado let's go ahead and shut up and try this cresco uh critical purple kush half gram cart yummers wow yeah that is pretty good that is a pleasant surprise that that both hit harder than i thought um also came out more than that's a pretty nice hit for a um 510 thread and it was uh quite tasty it didn't taste like any added terpenes um tasted like your good old-fashioned full spectrum there wow yeah this is an unexpected trait this is pretty good stuff um i was not expecting to be as enamored with this as i am um super tasty it's very strong um this is a pretty remarkable amount of draw or um pardon the term cloud for such a small hit watch this not bad at all not bad um feels every bit of that advertise what was it 76 76 and a half percent for sure um and then again very very um nice flavor super smooth um and if you like your cartridges to have a very authentic non-added artificially terpene taste this is gonna do it for you wow this is uh a a nice little surprise i'm i'm quite enjoying this cresco liquid live resin uh and even the cartridge itself is is surprising me in terms of the kind of draws i'm getting here so let's get one board yum well this uh first half of this review is extremely positive but you know you're gonna have to stay tuned for the whole thing because here at wheats we don't just review the first half of our cartridges we do the whole gall darn thing um we do it from top to bottom so that i can come back to you guys give our whole thoughts let you know that the whole thing went through smoothly it never started to burn uh the wick didn't go out the uh didn't start to get clogged all those things that can go wrong with these uh 510 threads make sure we'll give it the whole wheat's review really really looking forward to uh doing so and uh i'm looking forward to come back in here coming right back here to report those results so i will see you guys right back here keep sitting right back here uh in probably a couple of days or so until then take care stay healthy and stay high my friends welcome back guys it has been about 60 hours two and a half days uh since i had started our journey with the cresco rest purple critical purple punch live resin cart uh and i still really enjoyed it uh this is a very good little cart um that oil is uh very quality stuff uh it tastes great um never got this super super hot burnt taste there at the end that you sometimes get you would get those sort of um uh they would burn a little bit hotter at the end but not nothing too much to worry about uh the one thing that i would say to be cautious of uh and i haven't had to say this in a while um is the thing that i brought up in the first half is uh there you're gonna get some unexpectedly big draws off of this uh i was very surprised uh more than once uh sort of devolved into a coughing fit because i took bigger draws than i um intended to i don't actually mean that as uh um a slight against it i i wish actually more carts uh had uh the ability you know you didn't have to uh draw as much on them to get such big hits but this one uh definitely does not have that problem so uh be careful if you're accustomed to other ones this one can give you a huge powerful hit without much effort uh it's not the oil is that much more powerful it's you know good oil but nothing crazy it's just that whatever this card design is airflow or whatever heating element uh causes much larger actual intake than normal uh but i did not think of that as a bad thing i just screwed up my implementation every now and then um so on the whole really really enjoyed this cresco rest critical purple push punch excuse me i assume they probably just have uh hybrid indica and sativa with the generic name but they have different strains it's like this is called the rest but it is also critical purple kush don't quite get that um but what i would get is this cartridge if i saw it again for an affordable price uh i'd love to try their one grams if they have them i'm not sure if they do or not but this half gram was a big thumbs up for me uh again that is the cresco liquid live resin indica rest cartridge pretty good stuff especially if you're a live resin fan well guys that's going to do it for this review here on wheats thanks for staying tuned here till the very end it's been a blast hanging out with you and until our next review guys be sure to stay high and even more importantly stay healthy and we'll see you back here for the next video goodbye", "SsC4jaIY8sQ": "[Music] welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I've got my trusty pour one out 510 vape battery that is finely [ __ ] the bet on me after 15 cartridge reviews or something it finally [ __ ] the bed and my trusty 510 battery has died so I'm pulling out the backup the cheaper chintzy er one here that's okay we'll get a new one we'll get a better one but I'm gonna miss my old friend there has died but outside of the funeral for our trusty 510 vape pen we are here for a joyous celebration and we are here to review the product that I have had to me suggested the most of anything I have ever reviewed or intended to review and that is brass knuckles we are finally reviewing brass knuckles I have had you guys a lot of you recommending me check out brass knuckles check out brass knuckles check out brass knuckles and I've used brass knuckles in the past and but we won't talk about that but today we are going to be reviewing brass knuckles finally found some here in Long Beach and I'm very very excited to give it a review so this is the one gram Gorilla Glue cartridge and it comes in some a primo packaging that I have no doubt I'm gonna have difficulty opening here really nice packaging as you can see plastic on the outside it's got all the information you want on the inside lab tested contaminant and pesticide free that brings me up to the controversy I I know that there was a big controversy with brass knuckles for a while about pesticide usage but apparently that is no longer the case I hope that is no longer the case I I would a vet suggest you do your due diligence and research if you're really worried about those kind of things what you might probably should be maybe so do your own due diligence make sure you know this is something for you but from what I've heard they have all of their problems in terms of having pesticides or whatever fungicides or whatever I was that was in there it's no longer the case so Gorilla Glue is my favorite strain as I have said many a times I have seen it listed as both hybrid and indica this is a hybrid gorilla glue I like it both as hybrid and indica this cost me as you can see $52 at my dispensary which is a bit of a miss which is a bit misleading because really with the 35% taxes it can cost considerably more than that but $52 is the base price so you know pretty expensive but not outrageously more expensive than other cartridges this one just has the reputation sort of throughout Southern California as being the best of the best and I think I actually got it open without too much trouble there maybe here we go here's our cartridge in its little packaging there for medicinal use only not for redistribution and we can see their weed maps all that logos blah blah blah blah blah they have a snapchat how fun alright we have got our standard 510 pen here not our former best friend bottoms cap just like all the others with these little rubber stoppers whoever makes these little rubber stoppers must be doing pretty bonk owes business right now I would imagine let's screw this in ooh I like the color of this oil nice dark golden oil beautiful looking oil there a nice brass tip I guess that's where the name brass knuckles come from and a nice wide intake hole there so very excited to give this a drop let's give it a go oh wow that is a premium experience that is a smooth with smooth draw Wow ignore the cough that's my fault not theirs I'm a coffer this does not burn hot at all you can barely feel it entering along it's wonderful the taste is exquisite and Wow I'm already feeling pretty nicely medicated actually oh wow they use a bad word on their packaging here I'm gonna have to read that for you guys I don't see what their THC potency is listed at on here but I do know that they are among the highest in the state I think I've seen before that it's over 90% it certainly feels that way I'm already feeling quite high after just 3 3 little puffs there one negative thing and it might actually be this pen is I'm not getting this huge a draw as I would want for pulling I like the bigger clouds but it's sort of ameliorated by the fact that even the small draws are getting me quite high and it might actually just be this pen doesn't have the voltage to get the huge clouds I'll double check I'm gonna be getting a new pen before I finish this so I'll I'll be sure to let you guys know in the follow up if that still the case Wow but up into this point brass knuckles definitely definitely earns their reputation tastes great hits like a dream oh man really really really enjoying the brass on my brass knuckles experience here guys if only it were a little easier to draw from it would be perfect but again that maybe the pen and I'll be sure to let you know guys because I'm gonna review this entire cartridge I'm not just gonna take a couple of puffs and say it's good I'm gonna come back to you guys after I finish this whole Graham here to let you know exactly my thoughts let you know if anything's changed if the starting to leak if the oil got tacky whatever the case may be I'll be sure to let you know in the follow up so I'll come back to you guys probably in four or five days after I finished this bad boy off and let you know exactly what I'm thinking thank you so much for watching weeks to this point guys and I will see you in just a bit it has been actually I believe eight days since I last checked in with you talking the one gram brass knuckles Gorilla Glue cartridge so right off the bat I wasn't doing this really any less than any other cartridge I don't feel like but it lasted a long long time I really got your values worth with this one certainly a gram in there the other thing is it is still very potent this is a potent a blend that they've got in here this is certainly as strong as its sort of reputation lends it to believe but all that being said my initial I'm not as emphatically as in love as I was with my initial impressions or as I was when I gave my initial impressions there have been a couple of things that have walnut spoiled me on the experience have certainly damper the experience one is it became significantly more difficult to draw as time went on I did get a new battery to test it with and even with a new battery it was still kind of tough to draw from and it got harder and harder as time went on and which is something I really have a problem with with the VBA I much prefer the ones that have nice easy drawers that you can make nice big you know take nice big inhalations with as the kids call them make nice big clouds this wasn't really that and I'm not sure if it was this cartridge in particular as you can see there's actually some oil left there at the bottom I just had such a tough time drawing from it that I think I'm just gonna have to leave it there the other thing is it did start to get a bit of a burnt taste as I got closer to the bottom the closer I got the more burnt the taste was it for the most part tasted great I really enjoyed the taste but as we started to get near the end or trim it's the end of its life that burnt taste started to amplify so tough to draw from and increasingly tough to draw from and an increasingly unpleasant taste those aren't good things for sure those those weren't those theirs don't keep it and there's hold it back and getting in my highest remarks for sure but I feel like I'm definitely gonna get brass knuckles the second chance I've heard enough about them that I'm wondering if maybe I just got a bad card what the case may be so I'm gonna give him a second chance we're gonna review something else from them in the future but for now between the two because they're so often compared and they're so look alike I actually think I might prefer the heavy hitters to brass knuckles maybe yeah I think in my initial impressions I would go with the heavy hitter of the brass knuckle but let's get let's go ahead and do another brass knuckle review before we give it any the definitive conclusion and overall my impressions are still pretty positive this is a potent a long lasting cartridge that you're gonna get your money's worth from so you know I it's still really positive review it's just not as good as I initially had hoped but we will be examining them and given the future so fingers crossed and that guys is gonna do it for this review but before I bounce I want to share with you a little cherry on top just something I can share with you guys that isn't necessarily weed related but could be enjoyed with weed or with or without weed and so on this cherry on top what I wanted to share with you guys was something nice and simple something nice and easy an 11 minute web clip from the fine folks at where I guess fine folks the mostly male folks over at Adult Swim make Krueger's of creators of chosen Rick and Morty or at least the hosts of such shows as Rick and Morty but that's not we're here to talk about is Rick and Morty we are here to talk about their 11 minutes short too many cooks too many cooks too many cooks it is an 11 minute video and if you haven't seen it a lot of you I'm sure have that sort of tries to replicate many 90s opening credit songs but things go awry and that's about all I want to say because you should know as little about it as possible before going in because it is who it's gonna be one of the most surreal 11 minutes of your life Definitely Maybe recommend if you do have some cannabis on hand doing some before hand if you're not prone to paranoia if you are definitely pass on it but it's gonna be enjoyable I think for you guys again that is called too many cooks on Adult Swim I'm sure you can find it on YouTube just search too many cooks so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat sand that's gonna do it for this cherry on top as well thank you so much for sticking around to the very end here guys I appreciate it as always and we will see you on the next review peace", "ZIPLMpaH-JI": "want to do like some I've not just I don't know if you guys I'm pretty sure you guys have had select cartridges before I've no they were just me if I'm just tripping but honestly like to meet all of these cartridges they kind of taste us safe so yeah they kind of have like a strong hashey taste to it some of them's up so I have I got this one for like around $35 here to attack so it's a citrus SAP you know I grabbed the citrus top because it sound like I had it you know it was like fruity so we're gonna see we're gonna see how what it tastes like you know if it's like really fruity or is it just hashey you know like the rest of them so let me know if you guys know too you know like I'm talking about if you guys have select cartridges before if they have that strong agitation or let me know so the total carnival noises 87% you know it's been a while since I don't select you know these I used to [ __ ] with select heavy I used to get one of these a lot no every week Gracie [ __ ] would select so and I don't know where I just you know like I expanded I started trying new things you don't [ __ ] it when your cartridges so I mean don't get me wrong these are pretty far you know they're still good the quality of all it was pretty good so I had done this for like 35 bucks you guys want to see the back full grams so so yeah let me know what you guys doing on this Sunday afternoon I'm just kicking back you know I'm trying to get this Vito before it gets darker so you go ahead and put the button push the pushing the button but let me know if you guys [ __ ] with these stuff you guys you know these stone you guys this list some people say no some people say yeah but I don't really care you know these cartridges are still pretty good so you gonna pop it open you're gonna get a nice little seesaw cartridge I like these right here these [ __ ] rip you know out of all the cartridges they have you know there's some different kinds and [ __ ] these are one of the ones that hit the most you know you get big clouds so you go ahead and take it out so we're gonna go try hit it I'm gonna let you guys know if it's like if it's like really fruity so this is a citrus up you know I'm gonna be doing a dad in video if you guys you guys stay tuned for that you know I already done I still need an editor and [ __ ] so I probably have like two videos uploaded at once so yes stay tuned for that so here we have the whole ever know and flip it over it's pretty nice to go you know garance looks pretty good but they could do better like in the flavor why isn't she I don't know if they Todd what's the process they do it but most of these cartridges they kind of taste the same to me so yeah guys pack on this flight 35 attacks she's not bad you know so not here in Cali do the bubble test I really appreciate my new subscribers if it wasn't for you guys you guys I wouldn't be where I'm at right now you know you guys are [ __ ] awesome I'm just trying my best to like bring keep bringing our content [ __ ] for you guys you know so you guys just keep you know supporting the channel you know I really appreciate that and we're just gonna let no we're gonna let hit a hitter out this battery it's just a simple you know battery to church buddy icon from the other cartridges it's pretty good you know it's a big big [ __ ] paddy and they [ __ ] rip so we're gonna enjoy hit this and we're gonna see if there's some flavors of it yeah I'm not lying to you I can't read it tastes like that strong catchy tasting this one and that's why I kind of like stop [ __ ] with select because they just have that strong hash taste to I mean it's not bad like I said but it's like I want to taste some mouths besides I want to try some fruity that's what I grabbed the citrus tabs or they don't taste like citrusy I probably I don't know probably want to stop I'll stop buying select so we're gonna hit this cheese if you got a smoke along with me go ahead and do so bring out your bongs pies whatever the [ __ ] you guys got to KI this one along with me cheers guys yeah guys it tastes it tastes clean it tastes good but it tastes like exactly like the other cartridge I had a gun like two weeks ago exactly like yeah I hope you guys got to fill me on this one I'm pretty sure you guys know what I'm talking about if you guys [ __ ] with select most of them they just taste the same like this one it tastes good I'll get it wrong you got some nice clean taste to it can't want to describe it but it's just like the profile that the terpene profile is not there I don't know man but don't get me wrong these are pretty good I really like them a lot so but I probably will not be getting so many more this probably gonna be the last gram I get in a while so so yeah I probably just stick to like rock gardens and I'm know if you guys heard of bear labs I probably get like a half gram with some bear labs or I don't know this just I'm not grabbing the same [ __ ] you know I like trying new things but sometimes it's just I run out of options you know but that likes Dizzy's they have plug plays I have a whole bunch of [ __ ] you know so you guys just let me know like on the comment section what kind of cartridges you guys would like to see in the future and yeah if you guys like hot box of videos you know I haven't done one yet but I will soon I'm I just haven't got the time yet so I'll probably do that tomorrow you know get out of work something and yeah guys I'm going to hit this again for you guys well yeah these cartridges right here they [ __ ] rip these see Stiles right here with the c-23 these are like one of the best cartoons you guys can have oil in because they [ __ ] [ __ ] but oil goes too quick so the high on these cartridges they're pretty good don't get me wrong you get I'm like you know you feel like the quick buzz like after like two big hits you feel like a good buzz off him this was a hybrid this one's a hybrid so you know you get the boat effects you get the indica sativa so it's a pretty good it's a pretty good cartridge guys and I'm gonna have to shut again one more time before I cut the video short oh my god flip it over after ripping the [ __ ] out of it it's to hold its thickness there so it's pretty good quality but just the taste it has that strong hash to taste to it it tastes like some of the cartridges that were made when the cartridges were first [ __ ] you know came out like the oil like just straight hash you know with no [ __ ] terpenes in there but it's still clean and still good and I really like to select so I don't know guys it's probably like the last car I don't know yet let me know what you guys think in the comments section if you guys [ __ ] with select I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure you guys know what I'm talking about so you guys let me know in a comment section if you guys like these or not so or which or which ones you guys have favorite flavor and let me know in the comments section I would I'm just curious mind guys hope you guys having a really good day and stay blessed cheers guys peace", "880TLs3fjmg": "okay so I'm gonna show you how do you save my oil transfer this is just a small kit that can help you transfer your oil from one to another and it's kind of small so you could keep this anywhere you want this is what it looks like when you open it up what you want to do is on most of them you can unscrew these tops if not you have to figure out another way to actually get it off and now I just want to place this one down here sometime these are gonna be a little bit tight when you first get it because once used to last for a long time you'd see there and they'll stay in there so that's the one that I want to actually put in another one what I'm gonna do is take this cylinder filler and you could use a toothpick if you have one put that in there and now what I'm going to do is pull this out a little bit put this on so it keeps it straight connected and then put this right on here now we have it connected and what I'm gonna do is flip this over sometimes I like to put it on a little bit of an edge so that way it will stick to that glass and that is how that is set up right [Music]", "pQIp6xChq0U": "I so basically how you want to start is with wires just like this just from a USB cord just like that and you just cut the charging part off and then you'll have this right here so you want to spread your wires out evenly and then I already nipped down the green and the white cuz you don't need those you just want to want to cut those off and just leave the black and the red you don't need to Greener the white just make sure that when you cut them off you just have two wires that aren't touching and you'll be completely safe because the other ones don't have anything to do with power so once you look like this you're perfect that's exactly what you want to do alright so then what you want to do from here is get these Clippers these little nail clippers and then you just want to kind of score the wire and pull it off this is if you don't have a wire stripping you could do this cuz this is what I did as you can see I suddenly cut it right there but after you just strip this little coating off you're gonna be done you're gonna be completely set it's that simple you're gonna be able to vape without a battery it's literally that simple right after you get the it stripped alright so this is exactly what you want to look like right now you wanna have your two wires your red and your black wire and that's exactly what you need for this to work just the silver tips right there it's already stripped and everything that's perfect so what you're gonna do is you're gonna take your device your cartridges your vape cartridge you're gonna stake the black wire into the hole and then once you get that and you're gonna use the red wire and touch it to the side of the thing and then that'll start eating up but it won't burn don't worry it won't burn through fingers so you can see smoke inside of the thing there you go there you go so that's exactly how you do it you just need to be plugged into a source and you can just keep hitting it over and over and it's infinite all right let me know if you want to see another video like this guys I could teach you how to make your homemade bait battery an entire battery that you could take on the go portable let me know if you want me to tell you how to do that let's go for a hundred likes and I'll do that are you", "_jZ-A8NNhL8": "[ __ ] platinum vape it's a what's up y'all due to the youtube community guidelines if you are under 18 get the [ __ ] out what up guys it's your boy exo coming

enjoys a really potent really intense vaping experience and though vaping tends to be less expensive than traditional smoking there are some things that you can expect to spend money on regularly atomizers being one of them there's still some confusion on how often to replace your atomizer the difference between the number of coils that they come with and how to properly use them so today we're talking about how to get the most out of your wax vaporizer let's first start off with the basics like what is an atomizer how do they work and what makes them go back the word atomized simply means to convert a substance into a very fine particle or droplets in this case vapor so the atomizer is simply the part that heats up the extracts and every vaporizer has one for me this includes the base that screws onto the battery power source as well as the oven that sits on top of the base now there's different types of atomizers but generally manufacturers stick with ceramic dishes or titanium coil ovens and they have a few variations in between let's start off with coil atomizers they're gonna give you the largest hits and provide the best amount of vapor production if you come from a large dab rig then this would be the starting point you can get atomizers that feature one coil two coils or as many as four coils depending on how heavy of a hit you're looking for the coils are almost always titanium wrapped around either ceramic or quartz rods and are either fitted inside quartz or ceramic housing a noticeable difference between quartz and ceramic atomizers is that quartz will get hotter than ceramic the higher heat output off the quartz results in a harder hit but both are gonna provide the same great flavor so coil atomizers are for heavy draws but what about someone who's more of a flavor chaser then I'd recommend a ceramic dish atomizer ceramic dish atomizers have no heating coils and ultimately heat up at a lower level than traditional coils which make them very durable since they're easier to clean so that brings up the main question how long do these types of atomizers usually last there really is no telling how long atomizer will last before it needs to be replaced if you're lucky you can get a couple months of use out of it at least much better than 2 to 3 weeks from a traditional ejuice atomizers but wick atomizers have a shorter lifespan a couple things will determine the lifespan of your atomizer one being the quality of materials used a solidly built atomizer from a good manufacturer won't last the atomizer that's been shot at we put together and titanium wires will last longer than nichrome wires because nikon wires tend to burn out faster cuz they're softer vape brands like wolf moths use titanium coils it's always important to check the packaging for a QR codes or holographic stickers that the company provides so that you can make sure that you're getting a legit quality product high power settings also play a factor if you're running the vape on high voltage you're gonna notice more wear and tear on the atomizer but not all wax vaporizers have variable voltage settings that you can switch to which is fine some batteries give off the right amount of energy for that brand specific coil if you do have variable voltage start off at the lowest setting and then work your way up but can you put a four coil atomizer on a smaller battery like an oil cartridge battery with 350 ma or vice versa I wouldn't recommend it simply because wax vape wells tend to need more energy from batteries and smaller 300-mile batteries might not power coils in the way that they were intended and the same goes for oil cartridges on non variable voltage wax batteries it might put out way too much voltage and he might end up burning out the oil cartridge atomizer faster now I know what you're thinking I can do whatever the heck I want to do and you're right but the goal is to make your equipment last as long as possible how often you vape also plays a factor in how long your atomizer will last this goes without saying that if you babe often you can expect the atomizer don't hassle s the atomizer should be in how many hours of use you got from it as opposed to how many days went by since you installed it so now the big question when is it time to replace your atomizer an atomizer that needs to be replaced will leave no doubt about it and though it's unclear how long this process will take horrible taste very harsh hits our big red flags over time your atomizer will gunk up on the coil or dish if you let it this can cause clogs or flow if the wax clogs the airflow holes on your atomizer it can render it useless do not let your extracts hard it on your coil this will cause burn hits and you'll have to keep continually pressing and holding the fire button because your wax won't reach a good vaping point you'll end up putting more stress on the coil and eventually burning it out faster if you let wax harder on your coils it'll be harder to clean them but pulsing your vape is not a bad idea your coil doesn't have to stay red in order for you to get your drawl pulse the power button will help keep the coil hot but not always red-hot at least if you're trying to give them atomizer longevity and yes you can't clean your coils to make them last longer and here's how unscrew your atomizer from the battery with the coils exposed so your atomizer and isopropyl alcohol overnight for a thorough cleanse coils are pretty sensitive and they should be handled with care though throughout the process you can't gently use a q-tip dipped in alcohol to clean the oven I suppose you can let them sit for thirty minutes at a time if you're looking for a quick turnaround I would suggest you just shake it up every now and then to loosen up the gunk whatever route you do end up going with the most important thing here is to let your atomizer dry properly for a full dry flip the atomizer upside down on a paper towel and let it sit for 24 hours you want the point of connection to the battery to be fully dry before you fire it again for safety issues if your wax hardens in the airflow holes this could cause airflow blockage it's okay to use a paperclip along with a lot of patience I suggest heating up the oven to make hardened oil softer or even try heating up the paperclip itself just be careful not to be too rough because ceramic and quartz have been known to crack under heavy pressure and if you're not careful you can damage the atomizer the final way to clean your old coils is to burn off excess wax without adding any extra materials onto the coil dry burning then take a q-tip and scoop off the excess residue but of course dry burns will still shorten the lifespan of your coil so I've also seen people use a stove and a hot plate to mount wax off the coil but I can't recommend any method where you can possibly get burnt so be careful you spoil on the skillet to catch any loose oils and run the stove on low because you don't want to bake your concentrates or maybe you do but less than 160 degrees Fahrenheit if you can but the thing that I really must hit home is to just replace your atomizer when the time is right eventually you're gonna go fire your coils and you'll have lots of power or a coil just won't heat up know when it's the right time to throw in the towel sure you can always clean your coils to prolong them but if you can't even get good flavor from your atomizer or if the residue is just too baked in and it won't budge it's time to admit defeat and get a replacement now you might still have some questions like when I load my concentrates do I put it directly on the coil how much should I put in what happens if I put a giant glob and those are all great questions so let's start with can you dab on the coil yes absolutely but just be sure to not let extract sit on the coils they can harden and ruin them quicker next how much should be put in whatever vape in you're using for wax start off with the small ball you'd be surprised how far that will get you take your dab tool and gently place it inside make sure not to poke down you don't want to touch the coils directly with a dab tool if you do that you can damage the coil do not over pack it if you smother the coil you can damage it long-term the oven needs space for heat and oxygen and vapor to travel over pack in the oven can block air flow hole you won't be able to get good vapor production so putting a giant glob isn't recommended but like I said the way the quartz and ceramic

empire of illegal drugs that's the description of a massive THC vape cartridge operation busted in Kenosha County investigators say they saved about a half a million and a half dollars of illegal drugs our Hanna Jewell is live with what's been found so far and how this all started with somebody's worried parents yes is this one of the largest drug operations you've had in Kenosha I don't think it was but of this type it's the largest we've ever had and as far as I know it's probably one of the largest in the country Kenosha County Sheriff David beth says the THC vape cartridge operation was being run out of a house and paddock Lake and a condo in Bristol Beth says they seized THC products with a street value of 1.5 million dollars focus was on making money sheriff Beth says two brothers 20 year old Tyler Huff Heinz and 23 year old Jacob hoppings are both facing multiple charges for illegal drug violations that's just the tip of the iceberg in this operation search warrant served at the residences last week led investigators to find more than 31,000 illegal THC vape cartridges almost 100 thousand unfilled cartridges and dozens of mason jars filled with THC oil imported from California they would take a syringe and they inject it into the cartridges the sheriff says they also found guns marijuana buds cocaine pills and $60,000 cash investigators say they may never have uncovered the covert business if it weren't for a couple of parents in Waukesha who tipped them off to a THC cartridge they found with their son I asked all parents out there this is a perfect opportunity and a friendly reminder to have that conversation with your kids six deaths have been blamed on vaping nationwide many more injuries federal investigators are stepping in here now to see

we're gonna focus on how to properly fill the C cell m60 cartridge now it's available in a 0.5 ml or a 1 ml a cartridge size we internally refer to it as the c6 cartridge so if for any reason you give us a call and you are looking for this cartridge you can refer to it as the m60 or the c6 cartridge however it is very tricky to fill there are a number of small details that you must pay attention to to properly fill this cartridge without any issues so I'm going to separate this video into two different portions the first portion we're going to identify the proper technique to fill this cartridge as well as the tools and techniques used to cap it now in the second part of this video what we're going to go into is more of a troubleshooting mode when we show you some of the common mistakes that can happen why they happen and how to prevent them so without any further ado let's begin [Music] so to begin explaining how to fill the m60 cartridge we will first review all the parts and identify each piece of the m60 so you know how they all fit together and what order they should be put together that's very important to note these should be placed together in a particular order number two I'm going to identify the tools that you'll need to put them together two of these tools are a blunt tip syringe as well as an arbor press now this Arbor press is maybe something that you have not seen or you may not have however it is available from air vapor for under $300 and it helps greatly with consistently and reliably capping these cartridges in fact it's recommended by the factory again we have these arbor presses for sale but it's highly recommended that you use an arbor press to cap these cartridges so that you can consistently cap them properly now to begin let's identify the pieces here of the m60 cartridge it actually consists of four pieces the two main pieces are here the cartridge body as well as the cartridge tip now the cartridge tip is available in two styles you have a round or a flat mouthpiece tip available these other two pieces that you see out here to the side this piece here is the mouthpiece cover it goes on after the mouthpiece has been mated to the cartridge body and this other piece over here is the bottom thread cover for the cartridge body this also goes on after you have maded the tip and the body together so these pieces last these pieces first to begin filling the cartridge properly you will first notice that the m60 here is a side fill cartridge meaning that you're not going to fill the center post in the middle although it may be tempting what you're going to do is you're actually going to take your blunt tip needle and insert it into the side of the cartridge between the center post and the the inner rim you're gonna want to use a blunt tip needle for this because blunt tip needles are not sharp and it will prevent you from injury once you have your material loaded inside of your blunt tip syringe you will fully insert it all the way into the cartridge and for this syringe I am using a 15 gauge blunt tip needle that a 15 gauge needle is somewhat wide and allows me to easily fill this using thick material I will push my material into the cartridge and begin slowly raising the needle as it fills taping taking proper care not to fill this past the bottom edge of the metal top metal collar that is the fill line for this cartridge the bottom edge of this metal collar is really where you should fill this too and not above the explanation for that will be later in this video then you're going to take the mouthpiece and place it onto the cartridge and you won't have to press it in hard all you need to do is place it onto the cartridge so that it seats it self partially and then you're gonna take this cartridge and put it into the jig for this Arbor press then all you'll do is take the handle for the arbor press and push the tip all the way down until it fully seats into the cartridge body you want to make sure that this kind of bottom edge here of the tip makes fully to the top edge of the cartridge once that is done you now have a fully filled and capped cartridge and then you're just basically going to add the two other portions onto it which is the mouthpiece cover as well as the bottom thread cover to complete your cartridge and there you have it a full m60 C cell cartridge okay now that you have seen how to properly fill in cap the m60 cartridge we're going to move into the second portion of this video where I describe to you some troubleshooting scenarios and explain the actual physics of how the m60 cartridge fits into itself so that you can see in diagnose any issue that may arise during filling now the m60 cartridge has a very unique capping system what it features is a tip that pushes down into the body and remains in place through friction the way it creates this friction is by having a reinforced rim around the top of the cartridge body and then a tapered plastic tip at the bottom of the tip so that when you place this taper tip into the cartridge body and push it together friction causes it to mate to itself and hold it in place much the same way that friction acts to keep these two plastic cups connected together now if you've ever pulled two plastic cups out of the dishwasher or maybe out of your cupboard you might notice sometimes these things can get really hard to separate well this action where two plastic cups fit together and don't come apart is the exact same way that the m60 cartridge fits to itself you have a bottom cup here with a reinforced rim this top cup has a tapered bottom to it and as I insert the first cup into the second you have this tapered bottom eventually widening out all the way until it meets this reinforced rim and with just a slight press down further friction begins to engage around the tip holding the two together now the two ways in which you can counteract that friction is by either a over filling this cup or by be getting material on the inside rim of it let me show you how this can occur so as you can see on this cup I have a fill line drawn on it this fill line is meant to resemble the bottom edge of this metal collar the top collar around the m60 that is the filled line for the m60 cartridge whether it's in a point 5 ml size or a 1 ml size the bottom of the metal collar at the top that bottom edge is your fill line do not fill past that edge or what I'm about to describe to you will occur however I'm going to explain it just so you can see it just a little bit better and see it in action using these two cups now to represent the material that I'm going to use I'm just gonna have this right here this is basically vegetable glycerin with a little bit orange food coloring in it I'm using it solely so that you can just see what's happening in these plastic cups now I have drawn a fill line on this Cup as I mentioned before and that is to represent the fill line on the m60 or the bottom edge of the top metal collar now when I take my material and I pour it into this cup and I do not pour it past the fill line making sure to not overfill what happens is I get a great seal because there's nothing preventing me from or nothing preventing the cup from grabbing itself and from friction engaging around the rim in the taper tip and you can see because the I only filled up to the fill line the material did not start creeping up the sides nor did it overfill however let's see what happens when you do overfill so I'm going to take this out here it's dripping a bit but let's overfill this just attach shall we now this situation here is meant to basically replicate what would happen if you were to fill the m60 cartridge past the bottom edge of the top collar basically essentially over filling it what happens when you overfill it let's insert this cup down again and see what happens hopefully you can see there that the liquid starts to rise up the sides as the cup is placed into this overfilled vessel here displaces the oil forcing it to go up the side so when that happens what you don't see is the oil starts actually pushing back in wanting to raise this cup up right now that is essentially what happens if you overfill the m60 what will happen is the oil or the liquid that you have placed in there will begin to push back against the tip as you push the tip down pushing the tip which will then force the tip to pop back up on you now if you really try to force the tip down this is what's gonna happen hopefully you can see all of this material starting to pour out the sides of the cup what happens now is basically this this VG juice does two things number one it's providing pressure against the cup so it's pushing the top cup out but because I've now displaced so much oil that is pouring out at the top what happens is it prevents friction from engaging around the rim to hold the cups in place essentially what the this juice has done is it's overflowed and it started lubricating the rim when it lubricates the wim there's no way that it's gonna hold you see it just comes right out because there's no way for friction to engage this is what happens on the m60 cartridge when you overfill it you either have the oil pushing back against the tip or you drive oil up the sides thus lubricating the entire rim and preventing friction from engaging to lock down that tip that's the tip pushes up and out or it easily comes out during use in order to properly seat the m60 cartridge you have to first ensure basically three things happen number one don't overfill it because if you overfill it this is what will happen you're going to drive oil up the sides or you're going to set the oil or liquid against the tip and it's gonna push it out number two try not to get while you're filling even if you can have if you avoid over filling what you're gonna want to do is avoid getting any material around the inner edge of the m60 so what that means is when you're coming in here with your syringe and you're filling this cartridge what you want to do is when you pull out your syringe do it cleanly try not to get any oil trailing into the inner rim of this cartridge or else that oil or that liquid will act as a lubricant against the rim and prevent the top from completely seating inside there and holding together that's the tip will pop out and third the most important thing which we reviewed in our vision previously in this video is to use an arbor press an arbor press will allow you to fully seat that tip all the way down and you're gonna want to make sure that the bottom edge of your tip is seated fully to the top edge of the cartridge body this is usually only consistently achievable if you use an arbor press I've heard of people with strong hands pushing them together I think hands get tired after a while and a press like this is going to be a much more reliable way for you to see if those cartridges there you have it if you have any questions please do not hesitate to give us a call or send us an e-mail which will be reflected below and you can always drop a comment on this video and we will respond as quickly and as thoroughly as possible thank you for listening we'll see you next time [Music] [Music]", "gVRdnEq4in8": "[Applause] today an alarming breaking news report about vaping it's a new piece of the puzzle that may explain the mysterious vaping injuries we've been covering here on the show from double lung transplants to even death I mean big complications is the culprit black-market THC the chemical in marijuana that gets you high and listen products are being sold to unsuspecting customers that have no idea what they're buying may be lethal senior legal and investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden brings us this as an NBC News exclusive our investigation took us to downtown Los Angeles where in a 12 block radius we saw dozens and dozens of storefronts advertising vaping products we're in pursuit of what black market operators come here for the empty packaging and cartridges that they fill with cheap and often tainted substances sold as legitimate THC products within minutes we score we were able to go in one shop one-stop shopping by these dank VAP containers the packaging and a hundred of the cartridges into which you can put whatever you want there's no ID no tax no nothing and it's counterfeit marijuana babes like these that may be making people sick I do believe that I was given black market stuff and I do believe that had a had an effect on me Fabian says his lungs were slowly beginning to shut down he ended up in the emergency room I couldn't breathe I couldn't talk I really couldn't even move my hands so what is lurking in these black market vapes and are the legal ones even safe no one not even the FDA or the CDC had tested the actual vapor people are sucking into their lungs until now we revealed those results Cynthia joins us what exactly is marijuana vape and how do you compare it to the typical East cigarettes or tobacco baby ok so a step backwards vaping is just taking a liquid of the compound heat it up and then that vapor is what you suck into your lung so if it's nicotine like a Joule which has 80% of the market that's tobacco THC the active ingredient in marijuana it's made into a liquid form and then it's heated up and then you suck that into your so again the cartridge looks like this that's what we were buying that's what we were buying on these are the ones we bought on the street so we bought for a hundred bucks we bought a hundred containers and a hundred of these so if I'm a black-market manufacturer of THC oil I'm in business when you walked into that store yeah what actually transpired what was the conversation like you said I got a hundred bucks when you got for me did you have to sort of lead him along how'd you hook that the fish well the first thing I would say is that we had our choice of dozens and dozens and dozens of stores in downtown Los Angeles all of them selling these kinds of illicit products and so we said hey we want to buy some containers we rolled off a few of the illicit names that are popular dank vapes is one you've got it right here dank vapes it is associated with many of the people who got sick it is not a legitimate brand there is no company called dank vapes so the black market on this which is what's concerning to me seems to be dominant there doesn't seem to be any way of digging taking them out less consumers are unsuspecting well even more insidious there are legitimate brands that aren't contaminated of THC oil that you can buy in states where it's legal and these counterfeiters make boxes and carts that look exactly like those legitimate brands so the consumer has essentially no idea what he or she is going to get so the Mac market operators fill empty cartridges with their own substances and then they're selling them as legitimate tested products but what exactly are they putting in there and is it dangerous Cynthia brought the stuff to a lab to find out if the chemist a flabs in Los Angeles considered one of the top marijuana testing facilities in the world can a safe executives Aaron Riley and Antonio Frazier explain they've come up with a brand new test we wanted to design a system that would be able to provide reproducible results to do something they wish the government would do analyze the vapor produced by illicit THC oil Canas they've tested seven THC cartridges from licensed dispensaries and six from the black-market we come back the shocking results from the lab [Applause] [Applause] [Music] I'm back with NBC News investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden and for the very first time a new lab test is able to tell us exactly what is in the vapor produced by THC oil when you vape what's actually going into your lungs to remind everybody what you tested okay we tested seven legitimate products these are licensed brands from licensed dispensaries and then on the black market we tested six black market these are listen what did the kind of safe lab testing show was in the vapor coming out of it okay there were no contaminants in either the oil we also tested the oil previously either the oil or the vapor here if that was used at the temperature that's recommended we can talk about that let's say that the lowest temperature or lower temperature lower temperature because guess what when you crank the thing up which is what kids do because it makes more vapor Oh carcinogens yeah so not safe anymore not safe anybody know what happened to black market cartridges even when it was turned at the right power setting on the low side okay under the best set of circumstances this stuff is dangerous it's contaminated this is just you're asking for it you vape this stuff you're asking for it well they're stealing your money it's not surprising they would steal your health well what percentage of America is given products that are counterfeit yeah you're asking questions really hard to answer because this is the illicit market the black market it's underground law enforcement is having a really hard time getting a Tanz around this think about it I mean the FDA isn't testing this stuff why it's not legal across the country so the FDA doesn't have the authority to test these brands but you know states are doing the best they can but the best they can it's not good enough in my opinion because we've got a population doesn't appreciate I just the things I've read maybe it's a quarter maybe it's half of all the stuff is counterfeit it's being brought basically from a drug dealer all right the THC oil let's go through exactly what kinds of things were found in your testing by the way it's state of the art and I would applaud you for doing this because our own government is in doing this we've finally got the answers from you well some of the things none of them good carbon monoxide formaldehyde pesticides well we're in the counterfeit stuff the ELISA stuff for rat you find a couple things that surprised you yeah it'll surprise you to cyanide yeah you don't want your kids breathing that stuff you just don't or yourself and vitamin E oil which is a little bit confusing it really sounds healthy but what they want though is the consumer to think it's real THC oil so they mix it with vitamin E oil why they pick that one because the viscosity the thickness is the same as vitamin E oil so these are really crafty dastardly criminals so let's talk a little about vitamin E because I think it's exam it's emblematic of the problem here we all know substances like pesticides and sine are dangerous let me talk about it but vitamin E sounds healthy right but when you inhaled the vapor with vitamin E in it it goes into your lungs right at the high temperature it's converted into an oil to a grease in your body once in a long some say that it coats the Airways and when it does that then coats the Airways it starts an inflammatory reaction making it really hard to breathe the information in the oil get into the tiny little sacs these little sacs alright of your lung they're not hard to treat now the CDC thinks vitamin E is that big culprit behind these marijuana vaping deaths and injuries but we're no unsure and if these black markets your products are being sold like this the question I'm having everybody is what can people do to make sure that they're getting something that's safe well don't buy illicit products buy from a licensed dispensary is one thing I just want to add a little bit to your vitamin E oil here's so the Mayo Clinic as you know did a of testing on 17 patients who had that vaping illness and they discovered that the lungs of those patients looked like someone who'd been exposed to mustard gas so it's why it's important they're only state regulated marijuana dispensaries in states were its legal right to your point the government won't regulate it because it's only in these states so when you look at the country if you're in a red state maybe you're buying marijuana from a legitimate place right if you're in a great state guarantee or not then if it in the red states from Cynthia Stella me is there more of the illegal places illicit places than illegal ones which means you're buying the stuff from drug dealers they're not legitimate sellers I don't see a difference between two groups so you've got another big warning which I wanted to point out which is the temperature warning just make that really clear to folks so when we tested the legal product that didn't have the contaminants that are horrifying the cyanide and other things cranked up higher they produce what the lab told us were carcinogens but you know if your kids are doing it tell them making those big vapor puffs is just not worth it it could be killing them so if you're not buying THC cartridges for a licensed dispensary in states where they're illegal here's the picture again right you're buying them from the drug dealer don't do it and if your vape pen is an adjustable temperature setting don't crank it all the way up because it's dangerous lots of data support in this now use the low power setting Cinthia wonderful reporting thank you very much you can catch Cynthia's reporting on today and

take care to not overfill try to finish the entire run to avoid reheating your mixture when switching flavors purge and clean thoroughly time is crucial when it comes to capping after you fill filling while hot will prevent large air bubbles also make sure the rubber gaskets are intact this prevents spillage during capping see cells feature press caps using a press we press the cap evenly account for a few defects once capped they cannot be taken apart and uneven caffeine should not pass quality control LC and his features screw on caps if you make a mistake you can always correct it place the cap on lightly and screw on either by hand or with a customized drill polish to wipe away any sticky residue and then on to packaging it's important to remember not all carts are created equal some have wicks that soak up solution so you may need to finish off with a hand syringe some carts will need to be inverted after capping storing your finished product will take some care don't leave it

and I've been really craving and so I've known as that plug and play has like a really good flavor like I've tried the Apple slushy before that she was by it's just like actual like gummy like green

as you guys can see that's just pretty fired guys well I haven't tried it but it sounds pretty good you know by the by the sound of the strainer but I had paid like 45 dollars for this so it's not as

going on we are back with another review today's review is gonna be on select elite again just like the last video but this one strain is gonna be green apple so without further ado I just want to say this channel is for 18 21 plus depending on your state and what the situation was with legalization of medical marijuana or recreational you all know the deal just kind of let you know how it is but with that out of the way we're here we're gonna rock through this this review real quick so like I said it's just like the last one this one is the green apple though the THC percent on this one is running it at ninety three point five two percent THC so pretty pretty smacking pretty smacking if you watched the last video uh you know shut us to you if you haven't go watch that one that was a good one that cart actually did pretty smack me pretty hard not as hard as the first select card I did but it definitely did smack and if you did watch that what you also know that I got these buy one get one for seventy bucks so forty forty eight thirty five bucks each basically for these cards is what I paid and these are whole grams as well let's see I'll try to put it up here so there's the CBD zero percent CBD this is all your batch numbers and stuff if I get too close it gets blue interesting so I'm not going to show you guys that because you guys don't care I have not even opened this one yet this one is fresh but I just finished the other one today this morning so I've been kind of have been without any hits or anything today so this will be kind of a fresh fresh fresh or hi this look yeah so let's go ahead and pop this bad boy out there same thing as the lightbox is you're inside your carts right there blah blah blah you already know the deal pull that little tab back here we go come on excuse me you guys are like allergies for some reason right I swear just as soon as I started this video they just decided to kick in so I don't normally get them but I'll let my dogs into my room so they're over there just messing around okay so we got this out of the box I do like the oil on these ones a lot there it's very clean oil it's a very thick and it's it's a gorgeous like piss color I mean it's it's it's a really nice nice oil further oil I definitely give my my tent and a plus whatever you want to do good old smack on the ass I don't know you know if you play baseball these ones you're looking with the little I heard I heard they're called like French kiss their french tips I don't know whatever but I like these ones better than the open barrel ones because they don't get as dirty in my opinion you already know the deal comes with your standard rubber cap on the bottom here's the thing like I said it is a full gram because there's a cool little Select logo on the front if you ever get a card that's slight so puzzling from a plug and it definitely doesn't have that or it looks weird well you got a fake-ass car family anyway Wow alright let's I am charging currently charging my battery speaking of that I went ahead and was messing around the other night I got really high and at about 1:00 in the morning I was like going through some comments already replied to but I was just looking at him and I'm just gonna go ahead and screw this on while I'm talking and I was like you know be funny as hell if I got like a sponsorship right Arab League who's gonna sponsor me at 22 subs I'm like nobody but you know we're gonna reach out let's just forget your [ __ ] and get off so I reach out to a battery company for four cartridges um you know like like sea salt cartridges and I'm like hey man one of my viewers got us the we clean up he's loading recommended the PC Kati pocket I'll leave a link in the description for one but it's the pocket battery I'm like let me get let me go let's just hit them up for giggles and I hit him up and I'm like you know like hey I one of my viewers mentioned your video or you needed my videos and I'm like I'd love to do like a collab or something anything just for shits and giggles and a couple days later as actually yesterday I got an email back saying like hey thanks you know we appreciate the sport Buffalo here's a 20% off gift or gift card on a coupon so guys if you want a dope-ass battery I might even call what you get 20% off if you use my code we have a code guys it's camp see a.m. 20 off so see a.m. to 2 sorry 2 0 o FF get 20% off the battery it's a really good battery comes in a bunch of different colors so if you guys are in a mean I don't get any money I don't know for anything it's just it's literally just a code that has my name on it so it looks cool but hey guys you know it is what it is but if you want one I'll definitely put a link in the description go check them out it's I just think it's funny for shits and giggles and for the jokes with it but you know it's awesome so it is what it is it made me it made me laugh really hard to give me good vibes so ah with all the rambling and jokes out of the way and stories let's go ahead and check it hit let me know together smoking on anything in the comments down below that where they do cheers guys um I definitely I do taste green apple in here for sure yeah green apple if you saw it it's not very strong it's like a very low profile taste and the rest of it you're getting a lot of a lot of the Kush taste but it's probably 30 Priestly apple and then 70% coach maybe like 30 60 and then like 10% some random [ __ ] that I can't even describe but I wouldn't say it tops the last one on flavor but ask for a high like that one hand bro I'm already feeling it a little bit so you know that's kind of weird and I'll be here but that's kind of great let's go for a hydration break guys I just spilled some like reject but ah that's okay um I dye it I'm not the way you guys read off that first rip I could tell you I think I'm gonna like it better than the fruit punch as far as potency but flavor I think the fruit punch definitely takes the tub just off of one hit we'll see if that changes throughout the video but that's just the initial hits so no mad at breath already for some reason let's go ahead and do another one guys Cheers that was bad but I still got enough you know it's not the best taste I've ever had but it's it's definitely not bad in that's pretty good yeah they're doing it they're hitting it right away excuse me is there I'm feeling them even like they're smack and hard they really are yeah hydration right hey guys like I said things coming in at ninety three point five two percent teg that's that's pretty impressive prayer card and it's it's select so you know they're not skipping out on you guys you're getting that quality so it's it's some fire I mean some fire it's expensive it's definitely on the higher price range but if you if you it's that's not an issue for you you're just looking to get that good good hit yeah selects the way to go that mean I can't really change my mind on that so far as for premium quality cards I think select has number one I think the next court I do want to try it was somebody like recommended in my last video as well then max I have seen a few buy one get once every once a week usually two times a week so I think either hopefully the next one should probably be a venom X unless I can find something random that's that catches my eye but yeah I really want to try and Vitamix and a few different ones I want to try like this is the Select unicorn this one they have random flavors that come out likes easily like strains I want to do some strain reviews and you know jointly smoking a joint and dabs and stuff like I want to do all that and I promise you guys that's gonna come soon once I figure out the whole camera recording situation I'm trying every time I I do record a video to edit it but it just keeps saying it's corrupted but it's not it's just I don't know I'm trying really hard I feel that if I spend hours but we're gonna figure it out and what do we do we are gonna post the most fire videos possible I promise you guys so make sure you subscribe and you know like and do all that [ __ ] so we can keep it going but let's take one more hit and I think that'll be four we're three that might be three I don't know that's probably three let's take one more and then maybe we'll do it for two you know we'll see we'll see cheers guys no way through you know one no one's gonna make me cough hey guys yep Niger sorry yeah this one's definitely definitely a snacker guys man it's getting me it is it it it is getting me 100% I don't know I'm hi guys I'm I don't even know if that was three or four I had the call but I was like trying a little bit and it was weird I am I'm a little - I hear an ism as a ribbon shape well honestly as far as poems he goes this bad boy it's like a nine point five out of ten this thing is it it is hitting hard I feel terrific guys I mean this is putting me in a great mood green apple by select if you guys go ahead and if you guys go and see this in your local dispensary I highly recommend checking it out and trying it is the high man it is he's pretty amazing they're not you know not made but it's fruit is really good just on three and I would say I have an insanely high tolerance with cards so that's from me so if you have a feel of a smaller tolerance there go ahead and try it out and I'm I had a harder but I just think no I was gonna in the video real quick but I just realized something guys I don't know just really I or or what but there's a little tab here and I'm pretty sure it's on the other one nobody's pointing up you've literally pulled this and you can see the whole last car in there and there's a little camp or like paragraph here I'll read you guys select elite flavors elevates from medical marijuana enjoyment to the higher level with luxurious luxurious luxurious terpene infused cartridges the top-shelf cartridges pecs powerful punch with our highest levels of activated medical THC which I do in fact believe because I feel well medicated yes well medic um I feel weird saying that but yeah secondly what's going on I'm gonna go ahead and end it on that one guys I don't think there's much left to say I'm pretty damn stone here I really like this car green apple buy select go ahead and cop one if you've seen it in the stores if you get a deal whatever it may be give it a try it's definitely on the top ten but that other way make sure you guys like subscribe do whatever you got to do give a comment anything's appreciated I'll get back to you as soon as I can but yeah it's about it I love you guys appreciate this before I'll see you guys in the next one deuces", "sJNxWvWjCSo": "how's everybody doing this gelatine connoisseurs and we

up so it's time to pick up so I started looking on weed maps you know we usually what I do guys before I purchase anything I don't go in and just [ __ ] go my same old dispensary you pick up whatever the [ __ ] is they have you know I go on weed map see what the deals are if they have if there are good deals I'll get a [ __ ] deal if not then I'll just stick with like a regular basic cartridge fifty dollar cartridge you know whatever the deal is and then um so I was looking on here and then one of the dispensaries that I go to they always have a deal so I'm like [ __ ] it let me check this [ __ ] out so I check on their page and then I'm scrolling through their deals and then she says to grams - [ __ ] grams of tree base right tree base clear for $70 yeah I'm like I look at it I'm like what the [ __ ] that like this can be real this can be because if you guys don't know try to guess how much one have it this is a half game guys I've never seen one full gram of these I know they make them but I've never seen one like every dispensary that I go to they only have half grams so alright so guess how much one half gram costs of this [ __ ] like look at this clear as water guys one half gram of this cost forty [ __ ] dollars forty dollars yup that you could literally grab a full hat a full gram cartridge for that amount and it's [ __ ] insane but but but if like let's say this isn't this isn't your everyday smoke guys UI no-one's gonna go out and buy one of these for fun no one like I don't like unless you're [ __ ] rich you're not gonna go out and buy you like not even I I even I you [ __ ] debate it if I wanted to go like this [ __ ] so I only got it because it was a good deal so yeah guys so they had two grounds for 7d and that was I couldn't believe it so I had to go hit up the dispensary and go check it out and then let me tell you guys so that bats a morning I called him early in the morning outside out like Maine ten o'clock in the morning and now I was like just to confirm if it was that if they still had it in stock cuz I didn't know you know this is [ __ ] good as deal what if it already ran out so I call them they don't pick up I call them apart like three times just to make sure and then they don't pick up you go straight to voicemail and I'm like [ __ ] dude whatever so later on that day I end up going to dispensary and then so I go inside the dispensary walk in there sure I look on to the other menu on the inside they have a menu so I'm looking on there I'm like hey like my deal is and on there the deal that I want so I tell I pull out my phone real quick and then [ __ ] god damn [ __ ] turn your [ __ ] head lights more hoe it's only 7 o'clock so [ __ ] [ __ ] made me lose my train of thought sorry guys so I told how my hey like I want

price is right so she I tell her all right give me this deal she starts getting me she's like I said what tree base do you want to get the for and then she's like hold on let me confirm the deal so she got my phone takes it to her manager she's like hey this is the deal he's game and she's like she said what the [ __ ] [ __ ] no that's not the deal that is not the deal so they had to confirm

you for TV TV in the studio with a very special video for you today I'm super excited about this one we have the best oil pens and 510 threaded batteries of 2020 a lot of your experience will come down to your battery cartridge and oil all working together in harmony but the battery is the thing you have the most control over so choosing one or even multiple batteries that match your needs is the most important thing obviously the better the battery the better your experience will be with your cartridge and oil also because these batteries are relatively inexpensive and you might find yourself with multiple carts it's perfectly OK to own up more than one of them I personally have three that I cycle through if at any point you like this video throw us a thumbs up would you if you're gonna go scrubbing your way through it at least leave us a like before you bounce and if you'd like to pick up any of the batteries I talked about today links will be in the description below without further ado let's get into it sitting in our number one spot this year is the tronie inline of 510 batteries trone ian landed in the market with a splash releasing a handful of batteries all at once the line consists of three batteries the neutron hITRON and tau tron and an oil cartridge called the tron pod they also have a disposable battery which I'll touch on later what I like about Rhoni and batteries is that they've nailed the space between budget-friendly and performance with a device for every consumer their units are versatile and calibrated to work more effectively with a wide range of 510 cartridges and oils the patron is one of the cheapest and smallest offerings of the Tyrolean line along with a distinct pen shape it also has draw activation which works with any draw activated cart so make sure you check the instructions on your cartridge before choosing a battery the Piton battery is built sturdily and can handle any size 510 threaded car it has 350 ml amp hours of power which is impressive for a unit of this size and price point and I absolutely love that there is a USB charger on the bottom of the device it couldn't possibly be any easier to use just screw your cartridge on and inhale the neutron is another incredibly budget-friendly battery and just like the patron comes in at under $15 offering a very similar pen shape the neutron has a one button three voltage settings and a preheat function the on-board voltages are two point six three point three and 4.0 volts giving you a large range to work with that preheat function I touched on before does a great job of warming thicker oils and concentrates it is universally compatible and should be able to power most carts you throw at it five tabs will turn it on two will change between temperatures and three will activate that preheat function it is no larger than a literal pen and can be completely hidden by most hands for some stealth vaping at the top of their lineup is the Tao Tron the Tao John features a magnetic adapter for your carts that you can easily screw on to the base of your 510 threaded cartridge that will allow the cartridge to slip completely inside the housing protecting your car from damage the couch on has been designed to automatically detect the resistance of your cartridge and is calibrated to accept almost any viscosity of oil when fully charged it has a max voltage of 4.2 volts when you draw from the tower on there's a light that illuminates at the bottom of the device to show that power is being supplied to your cartridge the design is just super clean and I love the fact that they have cutouts to show your oil levels which is certainly a feature I prefer for my batteries there's nothing worse than taking a dry head it is draw activated and features a 380 million power battery that charges via USB and even for the top of their line the tower on is extremely budget-friendly I like everything about this device from the size to the power I love how small the tower on is it's shorter than other pens it's smaller than other mods it just works and that's why it's my number one choice I know a lot of your experience is gonna be down to buying prefilled cartridges but for those who like to fill their own cartridge Choa nyan has also released the Tron pod the Tron pods are perfectly calibrated from the tronie in line to offer maximum efficiency they also offer better wicking than most cartridges on the market meaning less time waiting and filling and less dry hits I've also been told some oil producers will be working with Tony and to get these Tron pods filled so keep an eye out for that lastly TRO nyan does offer their disposable vape pen the alphatron the alphatron is the solution for anyone looking for a disposable pen that also has a childproof lock it is designed for one-time use and is geared towards those who prefer to fill up their own cartridges the battery comes pre charged with enough juice to finish the attached Tron pod considering you get an empty cartridge and a battery for the price it's not bad at all the literal only issue I have with it is the spelling alpha with an F come on people as a Greek boy I cannot stand by and watch this travesty happen alpha is spelt with a pH okay droning sitting in our number-two spot this year we have the vessel battery if you are a classy as [ __ ] oh no sir with a need for the top of the top rugged devices look no further than the vessel it is a seriously gorgeous device that comes in a plethora of colors to suit your tastes there are three voltage settings on the vessel 2.8 3.2 and 3.6 bolts there is a notable difference between the voltage settings as well and the vessel can handle any cartridge with aplomb I've been using mine for a while now and I've never put a cartridge in that it could handle if you have a wider diameter cart you will have to forego the shield but it's super easy to take off the vessel is a 240 million power battery that you can get about a hundred rips on before it needs to be recharged it is slightly larger than your average oil pen but it's nothing to write home about as it still fits in any pocket or bag and the included cartridge protector can stave off most dents and scratches and keep your cartridge safe I really like the performance and look of this device it makes me feel super classy as I'm taking ribs in an alleyway on my way to the grocery store the price point is a bit high but if you want a top-of-the-line high performance device the vessel is the battery for you in the number three spot we have the tried and tested and true pocket one plus a great device with a lot of versatility the pocket oneplus has a wide cartridge area and can accept almost any cart you throw at it don't throw your carts at it and then blame me and please just don't do it don't it also works with top and bottom airflow cartridges which is pretty cool the pocket oneplus is another solid device that protects your carts from breaking it also has that magnetic adapter just like the tower on the and it has three temperature settings which is just the icing on the cake it runs up three point seven four point three and five point one volts if anyone cares I use the preheat function quite a bit yes it does have a pretty heat function another thing to love about the pocket oneplus the pocket oneplus has a 660 million hour battery that should last you a number of days even if you're a heavy user ok this is not a challenge don't come back to me and say I hit it 483 times in 30 minutes and the battery died that battery tops up in about 45 minutes which is also pretty great the oneplus is a great size and the button placement is spectacular I'm laughing because I might be the only person that cares about button placement but seriously it's great 5 clicks will turn it on to will change temperature 3 will activate that preheat function it's just simple to use just like the vessel the price point is a touch high but if you're willing to shell out a couple extra bucks you will certainly not be disappointed coming in at number four the C cell battery lineup has two great devices for use with your favorite oil the palm is a great budget-friendly device that is built really well it protects your cartridge and features a 500 million power battery simply screw the magnetic adapter onto your cartridge and slot it into the base the palm fits easily inside your hand great chest and is a great buddy for a night out the silo is the palms slightly bigger brother it keeps most of the same features we loved about the palm like that 500 milliamp hour battery and the fact that it protects your cart the silo fits into any pocket and you won't be worried about any damage to your cart because of that card protection I touched on earlier it also has the little newer slot so you can monitor the level of your oil in the cartridge there is no voltage control to speak up on either C cell device but for the price point I don't see that as a big drawback at all I personally find the silo to have a slightly better form factor and I just like the way it fits in my hand either way C cell batteries are built really well and a solid pick for any user the only thing I would note the narrower cartridge opening means they are not universally compatible but again a minor issue sitting in our number 5 spot the Lynx herm\u00e8s 3 is a solid pen this ultra slim slick device does a good job of pumping out clouds but where it really shines is flavor the ceramic atomizer does a good job of pulling the terpenes out of your oil it has three voltage settings to customize the flavor and the density of your clouds the atomizer doesn't leak and wicks really well this is a solid choice for anyone who sources their own oil and wants a refillable device complete with a tank as the atomizer is really good quality and can handle being refilled multiple times the kit itself comes with the pen the USB charger and the handy carrying case which is really typical of links and just gives you everything you need also typical is their consistency with build quality as the hermes 3 is a well-built device that features a 290 million power battery it's super easy to use five taps will turn it on three will change voltage settings and as long as your buddy Jon knows how to press a button and inhale at the same time you should be okay to pass this around at parties without having to explain to anything I'll leave the choice on whether or not to do so up to you and that's it for this one guys thank you so much for watching this video I hope I helped you even a little bit to choose the battery that will work best with your favorite oil if you enjoyed this video if you learned

have I done oh god no oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] is she dead oh oh oh [ __ ] and welcome to weights everyone the marijuana review show where we help you find folks make sense of that big ol honkin weird place called ear dispensary or that website that you go to that is also a dispensary you know it's less weird that way and I know firsthand having just picked up an order from ease calm a huge retailer here in California a huge online dispensary and I picked up a variety of cartridges from them and perhaps most intriguingly of all is the old pal classic shareable cannabis oil cartridge this is their hybrid half gram here and one reason I'm really intrigued really interested in this one is this was purchased from East which is a totally licensed legit dispensary and it only costs 15 bucks for the half gram granted that's pre-tax so it's probably close to you know 20 or more when you add all the tax in but that is still for a legal you know recreational dispensary that is incredibly affordable so I'm always looking out for those there's sort of diamonds in the rough for the the products that you know aren't gonna hurt the wallet as much but are still just as good so I am pretty excited about giving this one a shot and as I said this is comes from old pal classic this is their shareable hybrid um and it looks like actually on the back it says that it is packaged by a loud pack or manufactured by a loud pack not that's showing up that well but loud pack is a huge weed company they make all kinds of different products they actually have several different brands I don't think this is one of theirs I think maybe they just do the manufacturing of the cartridges there I don't know for sure but I don't think it's one of their brands but yeah so here we go here is our old pal very very simple you know modest packaging just a bag there on the back it shows us you know exactly how to use it which is kind of nice for use with the 510 thread which I've got my trusty brass knuckles here um so then it has just ingredients cannabis oil natural flavours terpenes there uh and then it shows it does not actually give us our th C percentage but it shows boy I really suck at getting that to focus and I am sorry to everybody anyways it shows that it has 400 milligrams of THC in there which would mean if it's a half gram cartridge that it's what 80 percent which again for a $15.00 cartridge seems like an incredibly good deal and you know it's it's lab tested this is their they've got the batch number all that great stuff there so you know it seems like it should be legit well let's stop beating around the bush here and get to the important part of the review we've got some childproof packaging in here very easy for a dumb dumb like me to mess it up but I got it I got it okay alright well I can see first and foremost the materials are very cheap for these cartridges very cheap plastic tip just it does not look like the highest quality materials just flimsy some kind of like you know aluminum or some other metal there and the oil itself looks you know I mean you can't really judge oil by the color and you just have to judge sort of by the the consistency and the viscosity it looks fine it looks totally fine and this is a very standard looking 510 cartridge design you got like the for intake holes that's obnoxious there's the big California weed warning sticker on it but you know I guess it won't affect this too much and then you can also see their little logo they're on the side so let's go ahead and screw her into our battery here power this sucker on and get to the test oh wow I forgot to count down to one second here oh wow okay um very subtle flavor really not much of a flavor at all to to speak of actually what is there is kind of it's a little piney um not bad not my favorite flavor or strain to taste in the world in terms of the hit pretty easy um it comes out a little hot I think not super hot not gonna burn your lungs but it's a you notice it a little bit more I think than some of the other cartridges but not in a bad way it just it's it comes out a little bit heavier it does come out um it gives you a surprisingly big draw for your inhale like I was getting bigger clouds than I would have imagined with the sort of modest draws I was taking um let me do another one we'll talk about the potency here excuse me copyright in the microphone although I always do um wow this is good stuff um I just coming off plug in place so nothing will ever be as potent as that but this is totally totally you know I would say average just better slightly better than average quality and potency of the most cartridges I've had out there so right now I am pretty pleased with this uh Wow Wow yeah I am sufficiently high I you know feel like I could sit down and you know just sink into a chair and watch them king of the hill reruns and be blissful right now this is really good stuff um right now my impressions of this product old pal classic shareable cannabis is pretty great actually again it's not the best stuff you'll ever try in the world but it was 15 bucks pre-tax for a tested licensed cartridge you're not gonna find anything cheaper than that and in terms of value this might be for a legal you know you can just buy it anytime cartridge wow this is one of the best deals I've come across all of that being said hold it you in suspense I'll just go quick all of that being said we do know that this cartridge is cheap the materials don't look very great on it I mean they've been you know fine now but um I would be I'd be curious to know how it's going to last over the two days to three days it's gonna take me to get through this half gram and hopefully it is good like Folgers to the last drop we have no problems along the way but as we all know these things tend to be faulty and certain brands are more faulty than others that's why I like to review the whole cartridge I'm gonna really enjoy this guy for a nice cheap high over the next while that sounds really druggie a nice affordable cannabis experience the next three days or so two days who knows I'm rambling that's how I already a.m. good for you old pal see you back here in a couple days I hope to be as effusive as I am now bye guys [Music] howdy everybody welcome back two weeks it has been right at two days since I first started enjoying old pal classic a shareable cannabis oil cartridge this was their hybrid cosmic hybrid as they say on the back and my first impressions pretty much borne out throughout the entire process I really like this one guys as an affordable product materials aren't great and it did have that little tendency at the very end to get that sort of hotter burn where you get the kind of harsher clouds but it was really only at the end and and it wasn't as bad as some hammock cartridges and again it has kind of you know the cheap plastic tip and all those things but again it was only 15 bucks pre-tax here in Long Beach which is such a good deal in comparison to you know pretty much anything else out there I really don't have a problem recommending to you guys and as you can see all that oil is gone gone gone so you get it all out and just have to uh you know really try those last couple of puffs but totally worth it um I could not be happier if I'm looking for something a little bit cheap or to pack a bunch of you know for a long weekend this might be what I go with you know if I'm if I want it like five or six cartridges for a bunch of friends to go out on a trip or something you can get a lot without breaking the bank and you can be pretty sure that these are gonna be you know clean good stuff they're all lab tested all that wonderful fun stuff um so big big thumbs up for me really enjoyed it again is $15 cartridge with some of those caveats that you would expect for something that much cheaper than its competitors but um the the trade-offs are totally worth it for the price thumbs up loved it that is the old pal classic shareable cannabis this is their cosmic hybrid half gram and of course anytime I find something I enjoy as a much as old pal I like to give a little cherry on top something you can you know take with yous and then that I can recommend to you guys that isn't necessarily weed related this one I'm gonna recommend to you guys AMC's movie pasts if you haven't people live in an area of the country where there's a [ __ ] ton of AMC's and especially in an expensive part of the country like me here in Southern California AMC movie past is the best deal on the planet my wife and I both subscribe for 24 bucks a month you can see three movies a week doesn't matter if they're 3d IMAX whatever three movies of any kind of week 24 bucks a month incredible and of course you can reserve your tickets weeks ahead of time especially if you live in an area with reserved seating which you know can be a double-edged sword it's great AMC movie pests I've been a customer for like four months I can't imagine canceling anytime soon love it if you like movies and you live in an area with a lot of emcees it's 100% worth it and that again is the AMC movie pass which I love and that is also old pal shareable cannabis something I also really really enjoy alright guys that's gonna do for the cherry on top that's gonna do it for the review and that's gonna do it for this whole shebang here on wheats thanks so much for watching and I will see you guys back here on a future review bye bye", "3U2L6gBukS0": "sheriff's deputies seized more than 200 vials of

boy cbd smoke doctor and i hope everybody enjoyed a weekend if you guys quote my live you will see i was turned up to a honey rather in fact a hundred thousand so i did enjoy this weekend and i got two products that also helped me enjoy this weekend guys you guys might want to check them out they're at another super store these i only shop at two superstores guys only deal with two superstars all right dr ganja and my other guy y'all guys already know who that is so dr ganja they have a bigger variety of the d8 cards right now guys right so i got two of them right now just to show you guys i and y'all guys know how i am about these d8s i'm still dealing with them until i find out that they're um really really not good for you or something happens to me so i'm like uh a guinea pig for you guys all right so um i hope you guys appreciate that too so this is coming in from dr ganja those are my guys over there i love dr ganja guys so when you get your package you will receive a card with all of their information it's a thank you for your purchase and ways to contact them also and yes you do get dope stickers they come in different colors so i don't know which one you guys gonna get in the pack when you get them and i got two cards guys i got the mango kush that's this one here all right and i think um the company that made this is um herbal farmer rx and um this mango kush has 92 percent delta eight thc this is a foreground and it says here [Music] it has a whole bunch of warning labels as far as don't take this operate heavy machinery you know the usual and um it also lets you know that this product is not intended to diagnose treat cure or prevent any disease they have a barcode that can be scanned right there i haven't opened this one yet so let's open this up and i know this one is very very turkey deprived i mean derived as far as they put a lot of flavoring in it i guess because this one has a darker color than i'm used to with delta eight i usually have them nice and clear like the canon eight i'm going to show you guys that too and uh this one has flavor so i want to see what it tastes like we're going to hook this one up right now and then we'll go over the candy aid as well but i just want to let you guys know how this one is and this is the mango cush guys that i'm hooking up i get that later not a big deal but just let me hook this up real quick and only take 30 seconds all you got to do is get the rubbers over there now i'm gonna put it on to my battery okay and i like this battery a lot i have a few of them but this is actually my favorite battery guys so if you see it a lot that's because it's my favorite so check this out guys it's all hooked up to the battery and this is what the mango kush is looking like i'm going to turn this on low i always start off low let me tell you guys um i made a mistake with one of my delta 8 carts and i was using them on high and um at the end when it got low i noticed that i was getting um it was getting stuck basically and i had to pull real real hard to get it and i figured if i just turned down the voltage on my battery it would help and it did okay so i haven't had that problem anymore so it's not getting clogged up so i have it on the lowest setting as you guys can see that's me just heating it up a little now i'm gonna let you guys know what the flavors like [Music] definitely got some mango up in there definitely got some mango up in here yes so you guys could get it just like this that has that natural flavor okay [Music] this one is the white widow guys okay this white widow is a cross between the brazilian sativa land race and uh resin heavy south indian indica wow sounds good but what i do like about that one the canon eight is that it makes you talk alive i had a few friends over this weekend and i had them try that out and nobody could shut up so that right there is definitely a sativa uplifting blah blah blah blah blah thing right there i like it very good for company guys and this one right now i'm just enjoying the taste and i haven't got the effects yet this one is 92 percent delta 8 thc so [Music] there's a little less than this one here which is the canon eight and this one has 95 percent guys all right but there's no delta nine tac detected so all of this is coming from cannabinoids from cbd hemp so i don't know how they did it but the minute they make the flower have these effects oh man it's gonna be a beautiful day so it takes a little getting used to with that mango flavor me personally i am not big on flavor flavor when it comes to any card whether it's cbd whether it's uh even the regular cards any card i'm not big on the flavor i take that natural taste [Music] but for everybody that loves flavor this thing is packed this is packed let me grab the wrapper okay so like i said this delta eight mango kush thc is a good taste to it me i'm just not a fan of flavors in my [ __ ] that's okay um it's nothing but added chirps so it's not like it's a bad thing it's just that me personally i don't know if it's just that i'm a type dude but um this flavor is really good you know i just prefer natural guys naturally but i can't get with it so i do feel the effects right now and this one has more of a calming effect if you ask me the uh canon 8 we're going to hook that up right now let me just take this off put this to the side now the canon has that natural flavor natural terps is the white widow strand and let me hook this up real quick guys see i tell you it's definitely doing its job because i'm starting to feel nice warm and fuzzy guys nice warm and fuzzy and it's kind of chilly in um atlanta today guys also so all right so we already got it hooked up so this is the canon eight white widow right here delta eight and if y'all guys could see i just preheated a little bit before i take a pull that's just the way i do it [Music] now this tastes great this really does and it's also a little stronger so gotta be careful gotta be careful [Music] but i tell you guys i've been loving it and a lot of other people they hit me up they're also loving the delta eight so we haven't tried it yet the prices are good here on dr ganja's website so y'all guys go ahead check them out for real not only that they got flour they have accessories they have you name it they got it basically all right apparel so whatever you guys need you probably will be able to get from this so this is another superstore smoke dr shops at guys this candy it's delicious [Music] man this thing is great i love this one this one i like effect wise but i'm just not big on flavor so anybody that loves flavoring and you know that's definitely the way to go this mango kush has a ton of flavor in it guys all right so it says um i already told you guys this is a full grain directions for use hit vape cartridge until desired results are achieved and that's where we are now guys so i think we're going to wrap this one up for now but let me tell you i'm going to continue my quest to find the best d8 out their canon eight is good i really really like that one and i also like this one but not as much as the canon eight all right that's just my preference y'all guys go try them out for y'all so i will put a link below the video there is a small discount if you use my link so there you go guys all right so smoke doctor is signing out for now and i'll be back with another review soon guys all right peace [Music]", "t5Mtbx-W0D4": "hey guys dr. Shawn Mira vici here and I'm gonna do another cannabis product review for you despite all the craziness happening in the world right now with Koba 19 I'm practicing very strict social distancing but that doesn't mean I can't keep doing product reviews for you so today we have the another vape cartridge product using the 510 thread system today is going to be the sundial Zen very also known as shish kebob and so this comes from sundial growers they're based in Alberta some things of note about this company is that they really emphasize that they're putting out pure products meaning that they're free from additives fillers and artificial flavorings so you know you're getting a really pure product they do a glass and ceramic cartridge so a very high quality cartridge and they use single strain extracts so it's kind of like a single malt scotch meaning that your extracts just coming from one strain rather than a mix of different strains a lot of the other cartridges out there are really a mix of a bunch of different strains so kind of cool that this is a single strain extract it comes in at around 72 to 82 percent THC meaning that it's very strong THC level it's available on the Ontario cannabis store retailing for about 49 actually it's exactly forty nine ninety-five putting it into sort of the middle midpoint range in terms of price for for a vape cartridge but I don't mind paying a little bit extra if I'm getting a really good quality product so let's open it up it's also got a sort of a unique box most of the other fake cartridges I've received come in this paper box this one is this plastic round container and you open up by you see those notches you match up the notches there and then you pull it open or at least you try to pull it open yeah there we go okay let's pull it out you could take a look at that looks really nice it's got their logo there a nice glass container and the tip feels really nice too so you could tell it's high-quality and that just fits into your 510 cartridge battery system you screw that in there okay and then you're ready to go one thing I also wanted to mention about this particular strain is that they're terpene profile includes cario Filene Mersin and humulin and alluding to its name they say that you're gonna get like a nice sort of berry flavor with this vapor and I agree so you'll notice like it doesn't really taste obviously like berries but there is sort of this hint of barrenness in the flavor i had previously ordered the aurora indica cartridge and that was just like really just straight-up like cannabis ii flavor this one definitely has a hint of barrenness to it so i've been using this for the past three four days not a huge long time but but I do like the vapor it's nice and smooth it's got that sort of berry finish to it it is quite strong and it's a creeper meaning that you don't really feel this one right away it sort of creeps up on you after about 10 minutes so definitely go slow with this one because it will sort of creep up the effects and they are quite strong so it is quite calming it hits Li you like in a whole body way but it's very short-lived like it only lasts 60 to 90 minutes and then you kind of feel a little sleepy afterwards so I wouldn't recommend this as a daytime strain definitely best suited for evening nighttime use and that's really what I've noticed about this product is that it's strong but the effects wear off quite quite soon after so like an hour to an hour and a half taking all of those factors into account so you know a good quality product stressing that it's added to three which you know is what I want in a vape cartridge it it's that single strain all around like a high quality product but the effects are short-lived and the price is sort of mid to high range so taking all those into consideration I'm gonna give this one an 8 out of 10 good product a couple limitations with it but but there you have it the sundial Zen berry thanks

definition we're reviewing arrow pros live resin series particularly this is wedding cake it's a hybrid coming in around seventy nine percent THC so this is the new thing from arrow Pro that they're doing live resin now all the carts before were just really distill it and I got to say I really like this the flavor is more cannabis oil type flavor it's not as you know flavored with different kinds of flavorings like mosteiro pros are and i like those flavors - I gotta say mountain mists which is a menthol kind of flavor I like it as long as the the carts are clean and it's done right I'm down the flavor carts I've had some that just weren't that strong like the rad vape but I've never had any AeroPro cart that was not strong so I really do like AeroPro and again this live resin something I like as well it's it seems like the oil is a little darker color than the distill it it does not have any like co2 which kind of taste it tastes like a good live resin so people that like that live resin taste and enjoy the Arab for hardware might like this instead of their regular cartridges I probably would still just be hitting both I think strength wise they're pretty comparable so this new method didn't really sacrifice any strength and I found that even arrow pros at like in the high 70s like I've had mountain mists at 78 be stronger than some of the other carts out there at you know in the low 90s so actually I would take I've had an arrow pros at 78 I would take over a Eureka I had at 96 percent THC which was still a Eureka was great but the arrow pros a little better and arrow Pro they've sold over three million cartridges and not had a single health complaint so everyone's worried about oh cartridges people getting sick you know that's all vitamin E acetate and cuts and stuff like that arrow pro is a multi-state company you know I they do have individual people that I think it do something with oil in different areas but it's all like a very high standard and that's why three million units sold and not a single health complaint so I know I mean who safety teas but I'll be hitting AeroPro for for a while so let's take a hit take a look it looks like you know I didn't take the fattest hit here's about what mm-hmm yeah you're a pro hardware it's basically a magnetized automatic magnet I see so with the vibrating function puts out a little more vapor than normal I like it and take another look at that resin and this also has been vaping pretty slow and hit this thing a lot and the oil Dave's pretty slow so AeroPro live resin you got to say overall two big thumbs up and I got to say I kind of expected that from AeroPro everything they've done has been super high quality the only issue they've had is they've had some batteries that have failed and I know there was a bad batch out there so you did have that the information is on our site on one of our prove ease we'll put it there to get that replaced but that's the only issue there I Pro has had and they warranty it so besides that I mean everything has been so great about it the product is excellent it hits well the live resin takes good so our po2 thumbs up this dab connection thanks for watching guys and have a great week", "HqA9UOkw-lE": "[Music] a lot of times they're putting in unknown substances to cut it and to make a bigger volume and to make their their money stretch so we don't know what's getting put in those vials good evening and thank you for joining us I'm John overall dime Angelique Lizardi some may think vaping is harmless but the Centers for Disease Control might have data to prove otherwise here in Pima County the counter-narcotics Alliance says violence can also be associated with sale of certain cartridges or carts used for vaping our digging deeper team uncovered information about some recent cases here in Tucson news 4 - sauce Lupita Mario shows us how bad the problem has become this is a vaping cart it contains THC found in marijuana it's also sold at dispensaries and sold on the black market for half the price that's where the trouble begins in January three masked individuals went to a Tucson home where fake carts were being manufactured counter-narcotics Alliance officers say the suspects beat and robbed the homeowner of cash marijuana and the illegal carts he was manufacturing we've been to several home invasions this year where individuals have been shot because of cartridges sergeant Alfredo Meza is with the Tucson Police Department assigned to CNA his unit investigates violent crimes associated with narcotics a lot of the time dealers are dealing in fake vape cartridges a lot of times they're putting in unknown substances to cut it and to make a bigger volume and to make their their money stretch so we don't know what's getting put in those vials vial such as these all of them fake sergeant Meza told the digging deeper team these were seized during a home invasion the homeowner was shot and a CNA officer found evidence he was making the THC vape cartridges inside his apartment there's not a lot of consistency in the manufacturer of this stuff anywhere there's no FDA regulation that goes through to make sure that they're not putting in cases in California they found cyanide in vape cartridges Captain John Leavitt is also with the Tucson Police Department and heads CNA and it's extremely dangerous it's toxic to your system and it can not only make people sick but it kills people according to the latest numbers from the CDC 2290 cases were reported from 49 states 47 deaths have been confirmed in 25 states and the District of Columbia the median age of the people dying is 53 it's an extreme health hazard and if you look at the guidance from the CDC they they vary circumspectly suggest that you don't vape most of the carts come from the black market these are pictures of the fake ones authorities say the active ingredient in the carts is THC that gives the people the high but people are now adding other ingredients to the carts such as mineral oil and vitamin E a toxic combination the CDC has discovered that is causing nearly 3000 people across the United States to have lung issues all we know so far is that in its infancy it's caused the terrible problems for a lot of people in his destined to do even worse investigators say that the raw THC oil is brought in from California because it's legal there and then smuggled into Arizona to manufacture the fake carts police say just days ago a 17 year old was shot in Tucson and is in critical condition at a local hospital they say he was buying carts and when he realized they were fake there was a dispute and shots were fired digging deeper Lupita more real news for Tucson", "EdoUnJuENuQ": "I'm gonna meet up with John Dawson from kung-fu dates to make some custom flavors of hash oil but the guests can consume music bait pens this is what we call soil tool rental product and what we're doing here is instead of taking oil and putting it on a hot nail and ad average or digitally dabbing write this is the wave of the future well let's make some vape pen cartridges dude let's do it awesome I can't wait to mix and terpenes so give you some blanks all right so this is my blank right here Glo empty cartridge right and this is called a removable center post and urine and screw the top you find your favorite oil people go with some raw okay great I just want to fill it up to this line right here right sure okay so looks like that's almost up to the line there don't want to add terpenes what flavor do you want to do so let's try Wi-Fi OG yeah sounds good to me so for that amount of wallet you need such a small money like a half of a micro drop okay gotcha I'll just put a timer all right okay so I've got that in there and yeah so I could feel from this arrange that that wall was pretty warm so that'll mix up quickly and sure I'm already getting a crazy amount of aroma Wow yeah that's incredible so now I stick my plunger stick your plunger in you kind of move it around you're gonna tear that shirt and just push it down it screws into the bottom there we go how many hits of cannabis are in one of these so you figure when we're at a half you're looking at 500 milligrams of THC now 500 milligrams in the cartridge for average everyday users that'll last a week let me say this real go sit with epic hits man I mean the flavor on this is uh it's pretty epic yeah but like I said we're travelling around the city where we're going to and from this is how everybody's going to be consuming thank you so much for showing me this up I think it's gonna be a great complement to the dinner party absolutely [Music]", "Sgs9cbojCTI": "[Music] yo what up youtube welcome back smoking with small town you know the rules kids bounce on up out of here and if you're new to the channel click that [ __ ] down below and subscribe today we do got a review it's a cartridge review it's coming to you by runts this is the obama runs i have i haven't never tried obama runs before not even the flower i seen this at burners in merced california it's a licensed cookies dispensary and i thought i would try out the runts uh cartridge this is only a half a gram it comes in the package like this let's pop it open it does got a little bit of headroom that you can see there i really don't like that uh it's got the seal on the top and the bottom let's get those off i got a fully charged battery here and on this it's weird the thc and everything the thc a is 10 and a half percent and then the d9 thc is 55 and a half percent and the cbd is at a point two percent so i don't it doesn't tell you the total on here it's kind of all over the place so we're just gonna try it out and see out see what it's like and i did do some research the obama runs is a indica dominant and this half a gram is gonna run you like like 45 bucks i think at uh burners in merced so cheers everybody let's get a hidden see what this shit's all about gotta turn it on oh and how they make uh obama runs is it's afghani crossed with og kush cheers yeah this is not live resin i want to say this is distillate as well it says on here to hit this one at uh low heat which is recommended 2 volts but this battery is the voltage is like you can change it and the lowest it goes is 3.3 so we have it at 3.3 off the first hit it's got a a good taste it's not fruity like they're adding [ __ ] to it it tastes like flour so i really like the taste and it was smooth we just got to see what the high is like because it feels a little light for me but you know we got to take a couple [Music] hits i do got a beer here i don't feel like doing the whole shoddy thing right now it's only uh [ __ ] 10 30 in the morning when i'm recording this so this is early beer and early filming for me i got things to do today 49ers play it one uh later on the lakers play so i got [ __ ] to do i gotta film early today okay off the first couple hits uh it's not bad at all this is all legit [ __ ] though it's got all the you know the seals and all the [ __ ] on it like it's all it's the real deal people i don't buy no fake [ __ ] okay so far i don't know i like an la cushion stuff this is okay but for the money that you're paying for it i don't know i might stick with the uh with the other ones that i've been smoking on this is probably more of like a cbd heavy or something cheers well it's not it's only a 0.2 but i don't know it's not like super strong on the on the thc this is one of those ones if you're a family function or maybe even at work and you still want to [ __ ] go throughout your day without being all [ __ ] up this one's probably perfect for you i think this is the first time i've ever bought a half gram too i usually go with the full grams but honestly it's not that bad it is it is pretty good i am starting to fill it now the more hits i'm taking but when you pay you know top dollar you want to feel that effect quick well i do anyway i've been smoking for a very long time my tolerance is extremely high so you guys need to remember that when you're watching my reviews my tolerance is [ __ ] high so if i'm giving some things like small like lower numbers on my reviews for some people that haven't been smoking that long it might hit you guys a lot [ __ ] harder you know so keep that in mind and the hot chip i am eating this uh i think i'm gonna eat it tomorrow i'm gonna film this tomorrow so you guys will be getting it in the next two or three days you guys will be getting that video somebody uh told me to do it live i thought about it but i think i'm just gonna go ahead and do it the same way i'll have the timer out and everything you know i've never done a live video before i don't feel like it's gonna pull in a lot of audience on my first one so i'll just stick to the video format let's get another hit in cheers hope you guys are smoking on something good having a great day this is sunday when i'm filming this you guys won't see it until [Music] monday morning yeah this one's on the lighter side i would like to try the weed the actual flower of obama runs and see if that's more of a you know if it's stronger if it has a hard punch to it or if it's mellow like the cart is so far and what i just did was i poked a hole in the back of this beer so it'll go down a little faster not like super fast but just gives it a little uh you know air ah okay let's get another hit in start calculating up the results here [Music] okay price this one this brand is pricey runs aren't cheap in any dispenser you go to it's a pricey brand you know it's well known it's one of your top of the lines it's up there with cookies and everything else so price it is pricey it's not your budget cart the the look of it uh it was a little low but it is only a half gram and it looks typical normal like every other cart that i've smoked on the uh the taste it tastes more like weed than it does anything else they like they didn't add any flavors to this or anything i can just taste more like weed like how the raw gardens uh ones taste the uh the smoothness is really good it doesn't you don't even feel the smoke going in or out at all and the high the high is mid mid range this isn't something that's going to put you on your ass at all it's more for someone that wants to function during the day still and and that's good for a lot of people a lot of people will like that you know me i just like to be stoned so um the functionable ones are always a little iffy for me that's why my reviews are a little lower on them you know so overall for the obama runs by runts vape cartridge i'm gonna have to give it the 7.8 because uh it's not it just don't get me high enough to get into the eights but the 7.8 it is real clean and it tastes really good and it's really smooth and i do feel the effects of it but i just want to be more higher when i smoke sorry so i'm giving it the 7.9 i mean 7.8 sorry not 7.9 7.8 some good stuff about it and some negative stuff about it i would say you have to try it out for yourself because not everybody's preferences are the same so i'm giving it the seven eight ah all right that was my review for the obama runs by runs hope you guys enjoyed it until next time smoking with small town [Music] ah [Music]", "4YGrQaN6hBA": "[Music] what is going on you guys so truly just put out there new CEO to bait pin earlier this week and I stopped by and I grabbed one this is what we're used to seeing from truly right now usual truly packaging co2 bait pen says on top co2 this is what we usually see from truly for a co2 vape pen but now we have their new open vape reserve co2 distillate cartridge bait pen so in this video we're going to go over the difference between these two pins we're gonna say this is jacker rare right here I have jacker rare from the open bait so if I have two of these co2 pins that are the same strain what's the difference between the two so we'll go over that today but first we're gonna check out their Instagram right here you can see their Instagram and here's my Instagram as well in case you guys have never seen it this is a great page to follow as well I post on here all the time and I show you new stuff that's getting ready to come out and it's a great place to see sneak peeks for videos that are coming out you ever want to contact me this is the place to do it and I even put you guys in some of the videos to go check it out alright so here's their Instagram page as you can see here at the top they are High Times Cannabis Cup winner and they are in several different states Arizona California Colorado new New Mexico of that and Florida being their newest warm we got three strains for right now San Fernando Valley oh gee which is a hybrid Jack Herer which is a sativa and Master Kush which is a indica so the one thing that I saw on here that I wanted to show you guys was the cartridge that it comes in the Saran cartridge think this is supposed to be the newest version of a C cell which means it has a ceramic ceramic coil which will help burn the product better than a wit coil I know a lot of times with wit coils they can burn out real easy but with this ceramic oil you won't have that problem this is just the newest version of C cell truly uses C cells for most of their babes except for their cheapest distillate faith and their true pod so it says this cartridge is supposed to deliver up to 110 percent larger hits I'm not exactly sure what they're comparing this to but it seems to hit about the same as a regular C cell from B and you also have the open 2.0 battery which you can get if you like you don't have to get this battery this cartridge will screw on to any 510 thread battery alright so let's check out what all we get when we purchase the bait cartridge so we have that then it comes in a separate little two as you can see here open bait and right here it has the terpenes listed the dominant terpenes are turpino lean trans carry opaline and our lemony and the cartridge is coming in at 87% THC and 0.4% CBD total so to open you simply squeeze the sides and it will slide out just like that nice tip I like the tip on it it's a plastic hard plastic type tip that looks like glass but it is plastic on the bottom you have your little cap to keep it from leaking we won't need that anymore and this oil in here looks great too i mean it's some really good looking product inside of here so you can see it's really nice [Music] so as you guys can see right here this is as full as the cartridge is they say that that's headspace where it has go as gone into the coil but I remember the first time I got one of these I actually had to get it going before the oil was even in the coil that's the only thing that I see so far as it looks like they could fill the cartridges a little bit more and I have had this same problem with these cartridges they're just not quite as full as they could be that's the only thing that I don't like about these half Graham carts is it doesn't seem like I'm getting the full product for the price that I'm paying I mean if I'm buying a full gram of this stuff I'm paying you 110 dollars just make it full at least and I have seen them completely full so I mean that whole headspace thing to me just doesn't make sense so let's try it out I'm just gonna screw it on to my favorite battery as you can see here it's a 5-10 thread it will screw on to any 510 battery and you can also see it says jupiter-c cell that's how you can identify if you have a real C cell it will say Jupiter on it just like that alright you guys so everything you've seen so far has been recorded over the last couple of days and I've really had a good chance to try this product out now and I really like it it's a good product but I'm not quite sure I like it better than the co2 bait cartridge right here from truly do like how hard the new C cell hits it does rip really good check this out [Music] nice hit hmm so and then rips really good you can get really nice rips off of this especially with an adjustable battery which is what I have here it's an adjustable battery goes from 4.8 bolts down to 3.8 bolts in a 3.3 volt so that way you have a choice of what temperature you take your head out and how big of a hit you take and that's kind of similar to the 2.0 pin that they have as well I'm sure it's just a little bit more pricier than the one I have here so if this was a jack herer cartridge what would be the difference between these two cartridges since they're both co2 cartridges well this company right here open they have some award-winning strains that they have and they have the terpene profiles on them so that terpene profile is basically what the difference is between these two things right here you of course have different phenotypes of plants you may have jack or air and jack or air so they're gonna be two different phenotypes and they're gonna have two different types of terpenes in them this is just the terpene profile for their phenotype of Jack Herer so what is a phenotype well to make it easy basically not every plant is the same and every different plant is a phenotype and some are better than others and this is why sometimes you guys will see let's say blue dream and it will be really nice-looking and then other times you'll see blue dream and it won't be as nice-looking it's because it's two different plants and you have two different phenotypes we'll get into all that some other time but you guys did want to know one other question and there is one other difference on this product let's jump back on this screen real quick and check this out all right so I'm on true leaves Instagram here and in the comments of one of their pictures from this new product someone asked as anyone tried these what can we expect are there any cutting agents so truly the answers with cut with nothing but terpenes so everybody wants to know of course what these terpenes come from are they fruit food terpenes or the cannabis terpenes so we see right here that the answer they will be botanical or fruit terpenes basically and down here we see some people are not really excited that they are not cannabis Dr terpenes like the co2 pin the co2 pin from truly has cannabis derived terpenes and right here in this message they tell me one is botanical and their co2 pin is cannabis derived terpenes now true leaf also has to do this with any other things that are distilled that of course is a different process than the co2 distillate but regular distillate who has the terpenes added to it to recreate that strain the profile of that strain this is why they came out with the co2 true clear or distillate is because they are using food grade or botanical terpenes and the regular distillate and that is pretty common practice around the country but the co2 distillate has cannabis derived terpenes in it regular distillate does not have any terpenes in it until they are introduced back into it because it is cooked off during the distillation process and is basically just raw THC without any terpene profile to it at all and it is built from there you guys may have remembered a little while back when they came out with Gainesville green this actually is a strain from a long time ago long time Florida strain from way back when was supposedly lost about 30 years ago well this is how the strain was recreated they actually went to Naiya being godfather of gainesville green and had him approved the terpene profile for Gainesville green and that is where we got it from this is actually derived from gorilla grapes though and this is why you don't see any Gainesville green actual flower in the dispensary because only the terpene profile is available for it and only Rick nya supposedly knows it so that's enough for right now take that in and let me know down in the comments what you guys think would you rather have food grade terpenes or cannabis derived terpenes keep in mind both of these products are half grams and they both cost fifty five dollars I hope you guys liked the video give it a thumbs up if you did and subscribe below to learn some more we'll see you guys next time [Music] [Music] [Music]", "xv-7QYC1HhI": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to pop on 4/20 as always thank you for joining this channel won't we get started in this next video guys I'm gonna need you to do a few things as usual i'ma need you to like my video make sure you hit that notification bell and definitely make sure you watch the last deal which I did on candy this week guys I'm so excited because we're doing I'm super excited about this product guys I had a chance to be the representatives of this product at one of the dispensaries that our frequent and sunny day in Vegas Nevada we're gonna get into this product right away alright alright guys so here I have the air pro battery this is an advanced vaporizer system it comes with a graphite air pro vaporizer with a micro USB charger in it so let's get this open and as you can see battery is in here we won't get right into it guys this is you open it up you get a user user manual sorry it's early in the morning this is gonna be a battery it's the graphite I can get it onto the package and there's a USB cord attached to it for the purposes of this video you cannot see this charging but I so guys not enough got it all charged up and as always guys before I attach my cartridge to this I do want to make sure parents know that this is a canvas product we need to keep it out of the reach of children so make sure that you have these items laying around for your children anyone under 21 is not allowed to consume cannabis I'm gonna go ahead and plug in my charger I mean I'm sorry my cartridge guys see that this particular cartridge is a 0.5 grams and this one is called the black mamba and I picked it because it says black mamba but not only that guys and this particular one is the sativa so I want to just start showing you guys to Tevas because I usually use us that even during the day time just to get my day going it doesn't tie up my day and make me tired so I thought it would be great just don't get my work done and I will be able to use this as you guys know I got a bunch of product reviews to do and I need to keep my head straight sativas keep me right but this particular one is black mamba it has a pure distillate oil which only means that they have some clarity and purity to this oil I'm not sure from the research I did how they dissipated the oil there's different ways of getting me away with distillate form so you always want to do your research whenever we serve this particular product we go to air procom shut up at air pro we're gonna open this package up as you can see the package is a little tough to open I have no idea how I'm opening this but we're gonna figure it out okay guys obviously please change our location because it was a little noisy outside but the last you saw I was holding up the package that was childhood but it's also adult food so now we got the package shop guys I'm just gonna get closer got my 0.5 cartridge that's Black Mamba here is my battery is the graphite battery and I'm just gonna show you guys I've already charged it literally the charge only took maybe about 10-15 minutes so you didn't see that because of the purpose of editing the video but the charging takes really fast and it did turn colors when it discharged so I'm gonna go ahead and figure out how to put my cartridge on there we go so you just pop that mouthpiece off and then Oh Meg Nick magnetically it clicked idiot let's do it again wow I like that and I like that because guys it keeps it from leaking some of these cartridges you'll get they'll start to leak into your battery this one is magnetic and I like the way it just draw someone you don't have to like screw it on so you just sit this part to the side guys and we're gonna get ready to see if this thing more all right so remember it's supposed to find rate there's a manual a user's guide so I'm just gonna look quickly and see what it's supposed to do okay so it's supposed to vibrate lightly in your mouth yes I just said something's gonna 5r8 lightly in my mouth so let's see the vibrations oh my gosh that's amazing okay instantly guys this is amazing I can taste the blackberry as the top note with the hint of citrus but it's not a tangy centrist now let me let you guys know that I do know for a fact that this particular cartridge the Black Mamba cast terpenes in it the terpenes is what really brings out the benefits of the particular oil or the flour which is made out of flour so guys what I really love about this particular one with that citrus taste in it that's that limiting coming through and I love a terpene limit because for me is the antidepressant and anti stressor so it has that has pine all in it I think it has some lemon linen all in it as well so if you're looking to do Turks that's what you really want to be at to understand what the oil is doing and what is it bringing out of when you're inhaling it so for me um wow that feels really good in my chest this system is really great and this has been on high time magazine's top when our air pro and I love how sleek it is can you see that you can slip it in your pocket it's really adorable and right and it gives off a nice cloud the smell is great idea I'm like truly in love with this one and I feel like because it is a sativa guys I can go on with my day actually we might film doing some more stuff doing my day so you guys can see how a sativa will work doing your day so when you have a sativa this is gonna be great because you can still go to the gym you can still get your grocery shopping all those things that you need to do in your day sativas won't allow you to do so remember if you need it during the day so theses are going to be the way to go and air pro has some excellent sativa cartridges and these are dissident oils so they have already made pure fighted and clear it up so it's very clear on your chest the second pose you see I didn't even have a call back which is great and I still feel like I'm consumed inside kind of thing I know that sounds really weird cuz this is like my new friend like I can actually like in my little pocket and my yoga pants matter of fact let's just go to yoga and I'll just keep it in my yoga pants done nobody knows it's there let's don't get on my nerves boom vibrating in my mouth oh yeah I feel like dancing this right here alright guys I'll be right back and I'm going to show you how my day went on this air pro all right guys as you can see it's been about what about an hour or so and you know I met the guy named Jim on Stairmaster owning every Pro what I've let one that make you work tell you what I'm working up that's what it's this evil dude that he paid to this we're feeling great I just got a great workout in on the Stairmaster [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] it was amazing that gives the clarity and the purity of this I [Music] [Music] because I [Music]", "_dwDGj43WRM": "hey everybody it's Jay again with a brand new video on how to fix a broken vape pen cartridge this is an extension of my previous video which I'll put the link right there for you that I made last year on how to do this exact same thing but in that amount of time I have learned a couple of new things which is going to be number four and number five and in this video I'm gonna go through everything that I explained in the last video but I'm going to do a little faster so hopefully that'll make some of you happy that don't like sitting through very long videos but it is important that I cover all these details so that we know what is going on so without further ado if you like these videos please consider subscribing I'm a stay-at-home dad and if you in these videos helped you out please consider donating to my venmo @j Andres or to my cash app j1 two to zero so without further ado let's start off with number one is the air flow disrupted let's check all four areas so number one is the mouthpiece right so our cartridge our mouthpiece on these particular cartridges these are the kingpin brand the mouthpiece actually comes unscrewed so if we do unscrew the mouthpiece we can see real easily it's not clogged so there's no reason to go any further with that one if you had a severe oil leakage your oil might be clogged up inside of there and then in that case just use a pipe cleaner to get that out of there or a little rolled-up piece of paper towel or something one thing I notice is I just knocked off this little rubber washer so I'm just gonna put that back into place there you go nice and sticky there's also a rubber washer right in there to go up flush against that glass to keep that that oil from leaking out so let's put that back together so area number one is the mouthpiece we just check that it's good area number two is the bottom air hole so the bottom air holes right there is it clogged obviously if it's not obviously clogged then we're just gonna skip that what we don't want to do before I go any further I know we have some different tools up here I got my little paperclip and I got pipe cleaner and all that what we don't want to do is please do not stick anything through the entirety of your cartridge because we have these little wicks that are inside of these two little holes right there and right there which are the same as these two little holes right there and there this cartridge the glass does not screw off I had to break it off for the demo purposes of this display here okay so is your mouthpiece clogged is the bottom air hole clogged number three of this section is the side holes near the bottom of the threading this is the bottom threading there are air holes right there so when we screw on our cartridge to our battery those air holes receive air from the fourth section the air flow slots at the top of the pen which are right there they look like little castle teeth air will flow in through here and then it will enter the side holes near the top of the threading and then also - it will enter through the bottom this is the contact pin that makes contact with this little plate of your battery that sends electricity to this and then this transfers electricity to your wick coils there are two four one two three four this coil is missing the wick because I took it out the wick absorbs the oil from your middle cylinder so all of your oil will be in here and then the oil will go into those holes right there into the wick the wick receives electricity and heat from the coils and it turns your liquid into vapor which you then inhale so hopefully that is a quick understanding of how that works where are those coils you might ask those coils are inside of the rubber gasket so the anatomy here is this center contact pin slides into this rubber gasket and then inside of the rubber gasket there should be two little fine wires which wrap around a wick on the outside of this rubber gasket there will be another set of two so there's two outside the rubber washer there's two wires inside the rubber washer what I believe is happening to a lot of people is that when you purchase these the cartridges unfortunately I think when the robots are putting these together at the factory the robots are putting the center contact pin back in for the final step of assembly and when they put this pin back in what I very firmly believe is this pen when they push it in there it is displacing the coil wires so that's point number two is the enter wick coil displaced and then not touching the contact pin that is the contact then this is the coil wire the coil wire wraps around a wick there should be two wicks which you won't see he should never see because if you see those then they're out of place those wicks again go through these holes they're right in the middle of these holes and this goes straight through you see that and there are two holes one two there should be two wicks inside of there nothing else if those wicks get displaced then you have problem number three so going back to problem number two is the center wick coil displaced and not touching the contact and what you would have to do is you would have to take your contact pin out like I did with my fingernails and then you would check no I don't know if you could see right there there are two little wires let me see if I could bring this closer in focus there are two little wires in there if you don't see your two wires and you only see one that means that one of them got pushed up out of place and now you only have one or maybe you like this better got pushed up out of place and there's only one wire because of the robots the evil robots now if they got displaced you can use a special tool which is use a special tool to recenter one or both of the coil wires what we don't want to do is when we're fishing in there for that wire we don't want to pull it completely out because it is not infinite length it is only this long and that long if you pull that out you're gonna pull the wick with it and then all of your fluid is going to go where into the middle air cylinder and you're gonna get a hard gurgling and you're gonna start losing a bunch of your fluid and there's no recovering that right so this is a tool from a sewing kit if you say we're threading a needle and you put this through the needle you could put your string in through that hole and then you would pull this through and it pulls the thread through the needle that's what this is from a sewing kit also - from my soldering kit I got these very very fine tweezers which are definitely going to be able to get that coil if you can get your tweezers onto them right if your coils are out of place then you're probably going to get a blinking error code when you go to hit this thing when you go to light it instead of it just lighting nice and smooth it might blink three or four times a weird color different colors and that is an error code letting you know that there's something wrong from the inner workings of your cartridge the electricity is not flowing properly do not pull the wires completely out or your oil will leak you might be missing a wire due to a manufacturer defect and if that's the case maybe go back to your local store and then say hey I think that there's a problem here I'm missing my center coil my manye for my bat my cartridge isn't working so hopefully if you live in a legal state you can go back to your store and you can get that replaced otherwise you might be out of luck and if you are out of luck in that instance then you might have to transfer your oil to a working cartridge like an empty one and empty working or non leaking cartridge so I always suggest keep these around when you're done with them when they're empty because if it was where if you had one that was working and you have say a brand new one that isn't working you could transfer the oil from this one to this one by simply unscrewing the cap and then you can actually stack these on top of each other if you have a steady hand and my previous video I did that so you could check that out you could put this part on top of the similar part and they will stack and all the oils transfer down the middle and go into the cylinder of your working cartridge so let's put that back on there before any more oil leaks out so that was number two is the center with coil displaced number three are your wicks out of place and now your oils leaking so you might say well what's the wick again that is the wick right there there should be two of them a wick that is wrapped with a coil and there would be another wick inside of this coil and those are inside of there those wires travel down the bottom of this cartridge and make contact with the center cylinder and with the bottom contact pin which will make contact with your battery contact plate all right so if your Center wick is out of place you're gonna know because you're not going to be able to draw a clean fresh smooth vapor out of your cartridge it's gonna seem to be stuck and you the tell-tale sign the very real sign is you're gonna hear a gurgling a slurping gurgling and that means that inside of the middle cylinder instead of this air and vapor going through you have oil leaking into these holes because your wicks are not in the hole they've been displaced so if they've been displaced oil is gonna go in the hole and you're gonna get a gurgling so if that happens that's number three while your wicks out of place transfer your oil your liquid to a working cartridge you can go to your local smoke shop and get a little ceramic tip we can get one of these not brand specific but you can get a generic one you can transfer your oil there it might take you some time but it might be your only option if you live in a non legal state number four these are the new additions did you try and screen your pen to increase the air flow well what what happens is over time the for air flow areas become clogged and it will disrupt your air flow so all we're gonna do is instead of screwing it on all the way nice and tight I found that sometimes all you got to do is just unscrew it a little bit and that will help increase the air flow into the side holes near the bottom of threading or it may increase the possibility of the airflow is going to go through the bottom air hole right there well minus the pen or a minus the contact pen so try unscrewing and to increase your air flow number five is your cartridge just getting old and clogged this is vapor it's sticky liquid and as you continue to use your product to the point of completion residue is just going to build up in there we all know that from smoking our tobacco pipes screens need to be replaced different cleaning solutions need to be used whatever we need to do to make sure that we can get air flow and these aren't any difference so as your a cartridge getting old and clogs so what I do is I actually inhale some fire lightly through the tip and blow out the melted wax so what do I mean by that is in my with my tip here I will just inhale put my mouth on the mouthpiece there and I will very lightly very lightly just a little mouth drag like you're hitting a cigar like a little give a little kiss and get kissed that the sticky oil in there with some fire and then blow it out below that sticky oil out right let me see if I could demonstrate this so not so much came out but maybe I could do it with already took these off anyway it works just try it out if you're not hearing if you just try it if you have this off and you try to take a mouth drag off it and you don't hear clean air going through it's clogged in there and that is very easily going to be your problem if it's if it's just getting old and clogged it might be new and clogged we don't know but just inhale a little bit of fire through that tip and then below that sticky wax out it will be hard sticky wax also turn to melted sticky wax and then you can blow it out let's see also - we can use the lighter to gently melt the thread wax on the cartridge so this is the thread the threading here that might get some sticky residue so we could just melt that and then just wipe it off and you'll get something same thing - with the inside of your pen just give a little just a little quick melt and then get inside of there and clean it out there's gonna be something and that something the threading if that threading gets all gunked up here and here then you're not going to get any airflow through the bottom hole which I should probably put that back so again one if we since I'm doing this let's talk real quick about is the center quit the Senator wick quill displaced when the robots are putting these back together when they push these in there I believe that this contact pin is pushing the wire is out of place and/or just snapping them on like snapping a heart sorry about the focusing on this camera let me see if I can fix it tada all right so when this is getting pushed in at the factory I think it's snapping these off or just moving them out of place so hopefully this video helps you out I've been I've been noticing when I've been using mine as they get older simply unscrewing them a little bit helps out a lot so just unscrew it a little bit and that should increase crease your air flow and then also to use the lighter trick to get them from being clogged all right so that's that hopefully this video helped you if the previous one didn't again sorry about the focusing issues I was unaware of whatever focusing issues were happening again if you like this video just subscribe they'll help me to get paid so you don't have to donate to me but if you do want to donate that would be super dope because you know I'm a stay-at-home dad so thanks again my name is Jay have an awesome rest of your day", "oHhzsm8OXVE": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy mixed up place you call your local dispensary today we are taking a look at a vape brand that is quite huge and one that has managed to escape our attention for some time here on wheats and that is the fine folks over at legion of bloom legion of bloom yes legion of bloon they make all kinds of different 5 10 um thread vape pot or carts as well as i think they partner with packs and make um different packs pods uh with their under their legion of balloon bloom line as well we are taking a look at their mendo breath indica 1 gram here today on the back we've got their lab testing results uh showing it coming in at if it'll focus uh 78 and thc uh and then as everybody's gonna want to know this comes in at 45 for a 1 gram but it'll never focus terrible at that 45 bucks for the one gram uh cartridge uh at a dispensary in long beach which puts it right smack dab in the average cost range for uh uh vapes at this dispensary mendo breath uh is a a strain that i'm not a huge strained guy but one that i do tend to like um and let's go ahead i'm a big fan of uh and by a big fan i mean i usually hate reading these sort of uh overly flowery uh pros that they these companies include on their packaging to sell you on them so let's let's lead you a little bit of the legion of bloom's story here legion of bloon is a coalition of eco-conscious cultivators with a deep reverence for the cannabis plant we carefully select terpene-rich genetics and capture their essence through solventless extraction methods combined with triple refined cannabis oil the result is a full spectrum experience unmatched in flavor and purity we invite you to join our legion nate let's join so let's go ahead and open this bad boy up uh let me go ahead and mention this packaging really beautiful packaging by the way uh it doesn't look that um crazy opulent either in terms of materials it's just very neat looking i really like the design it's sparkly and gold and i guess i kind of um uh you know um have the uh the sort of uh brain attention of a bird and like the shiny sparkly things gets my attention like this does uh i want to build a nest out of this legion of bloom cartridge packaging so we've pulled the little tab here let us slide open now is easy not too bad more uh marketing materials there and then in here we have got the thing itself wow okay a lot of materials nice thick plastic there and we're finally to the cartridge itself oh that is some nice looking oil guys yum that that oil actually looks incredible uh very thick looking uh incredibly pure oh i'm excited to give this a try this has got me really amped up uh it's got like the ceramic uh tip with that well it might be some kind of plastic it feels like ceramic um but it is a nice material i've seen a lot of uh the newer cartridges using this either higher quality plastic or some kind of ceramic uh it works a lot better than the cheaper acrylic tips so here we go let's finally give this mendo's breath a try hmm uh oh well my battery was showing that it was drying but i'm not getting anything let me try a different battery i have one here on standby let's give another shot well looks like i've got a bum battery sorry beloved um raw gardens battery you look like you're finally gonna have to join the collection in the sky uh but this battery works fine and this cartridge tastes great i forgot to mention they call this the monarch um with a hundred percent cannabis derived terpenes so this is uh triple refined cannabis oil and then all of the terpenes that are added back in are the terpenes from the mendo breath strain itself um it tastes like mendo breath that i don't know it's a very hard to describe taste almost spiced in a way i like it i like it a lot um and the oil itself is uh appears to taste as good as it looks uh quality wise so smooth um wow man that is quality stuff um yeah that just vaguely spiced taste that uh some mendoz mendo breath strain has this has in spades uh quite high already uh after those couple of hits you saw how smooth it was too i didn't really feel it at all going in um but rather big hits off not very hard draws as well um nice cartridge design seemingly as well from uh legion of bloom or they use a nice cartridge so far so good here oh wow guys i i i mean i barely feel it going in uh certainly feel it in the head as it's going out uh strong tasty um and just some really quality quality oil um this is a big old thumbs up so far for legion of bloom i can see why they have are a ten times award-winning company good for them uh great tasting not bad uh affordably priced right in the uh average price range at the dispenser i go to so so far this is a big thumbs up for a legion of bloom uh with their mendo's breath strain uh i am really really looking forward to finishing this one off uh as like all of our weeks reviews i'm gonna review the whole cartridge not just these first couple of hits because these things tend to leak they tend to clog they tend to break down all these things can pop up as you guys know so it'll probably take me about five days or so to finish this gram off uh really looking forward to doing that and as soon as i do i will come right back here let you guys know our wrap-up thoughts of this legion of bloom experience but first half so far so good anyways we'll see you guys right back here for part two in just a bit thanks for watching [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been about five and a half days since we started our journey with the monarch from legion of bloom their mendo breath strain this one gram 45 cartridge five days later my impressions are just as rapturous as they were before i really really really liked this one i like the quality of the oil like the taste of the strain that sort of spiced nutmeg cinnamony vague taste of uh the mendoz breath here was great um that oil as i said quality top to bottom never got that burnt taste never got that never started to burn that uh or get those big cloudy sort of vapor heavy hits nothing like that um just fantastic quality uh cartridge design worked incredibly well no clogs didn't have to get that like big first draw to get it going just a fantastic uh product really happy uh with the legion of bloom system not sure again why it's called the monarch it's got the mendo breath strain and the name the monarch but we'll forgive them we'll forgive legion of bloom we'll forgive the name the monarch because it's so good big old thumbs up here just as i had hoped and anytime we have a thumbs up this big we like to give a little cherry on top a little something extra that you can enjoy that is not necessarily weed related and you don't necessarily need weed to enjoy although this recommendation might want a little weed beforehand because it's going to make that penis all the better that's right we're talking pen 15 on our cherry on top a show that just entered its second season on hulu a phenomenal show hi thank you a phenomenal show that just entered its second season on hbo and by hbo i do mean hulu uh it is a one joke premise it is about two uh 30 something year old women who pretend to be middle schoolers around the era of y2k and they act with a bunch of 12 13 year old kids and say a bunch of foul-mouthed inappropriate things it sounds like it should get boring very quickly but it's actually hysterical and if you are like me in your early to mid 30s you're going to be very very at home in that aesthetic so check out pen 15 or as i prefer to call it penis on hulu and check out legion of bloom the monarch at your local dispensary two things that i enjoy having in my mouth a whole lot well", "6aCL792CdOo": "two News has obtained new evidence photos from a traffic stop in Racine County

fill the transferring a3 cartridge this is a cartridge that features a hidden silica wick heating chamber as well as an all glass and metal exterior construction to begin disassembling this cartridge to prepare for filling it's very simple all you have to do is unscrew the metal mouthpiece with a few twists you'll see that it simply disconnects with a simple pull up from the cartridge itself leaving you with just an empty cartridge and the mouthpiece now to begin filling I suggest that you use a blunt tip syringe and with all transferring USA orders one is included and the reason it's blunt tip is so that it's safe to use it cannot pierce skin and features a 15 gauge needle tip gage refers to the actual thickness of the needle and you don't want to go any bigger than 15 gauge or else it won't fit down inside of this cartridge to begin filling now the one special thing to note with the a3 cartridge is that it does not have a center post to fill through this center post right here is actually the air channel what you want to do is fill to the side it is a side filling cartridge so to begin filling you want to place your needle to the side of the center post but but inside the glass once you have your needle placed correctly to the side of the center post simply begin pushing your material inside don't go too fast cause you don't want it to overfill and as you approach your desired volume simply withdraw the needle and this is very important as with all cartridges you want to make sure that you cap within 30 seconds of filling and to cap simply place the mouthpiece on push it down and begin twisting in a clockwise direction to tighten it once it is completely tightened you now have a filled cartridge and there's only one more step if you have done a hot fill meaning that the material in your syringe is actually hotter or has been heated up hotter than the outside ambient air temperature if you're performing a hot fill what you want to do is immediately after capping and filming flip the cartridge upside down and store it in that position for the next two to three hours what this will do is drive the air bubble that normally would have been on the bottom and you can see this one rising here up to what is now the top which is the bottom of the cartridge here this allows the air bubble to vent to the outside atmosphere and expand and contract without pushing back and forth into the heating chamber again this step is only important if you have done a hot fill if you have done a cold fill or you've injected material that is the same temperature as the outside atmosphere this step is not necessary you can then just place your cartridge right side up and begin using it however if you have performed a hot fill it is very important that you flip your cartridge upside down after filling for two to three hours to let it cool down and that's it [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]", "WA2Z7UUezt4": "[Music] hi guys i'm dan hoff chief operating officer of honeystick and today we are bringing you guys the just batteries twist battery which is a project that honeystick did in collaboration with just cbd one of the leading producers of cbd and hemp products so i was speaking with just cbd management when we had this idea to go in on this endeavor and what we said is we wanted to create an awesome twist battery that works well with cbd carts and to make it really stylish offer some cool color options but what's the key thing is to make it really affordable so you can actually get this twist battery that's a high capacity high powered battery very good quality covered by both of our companies warranties on vapehoneystick.com and also just cbdstore.com and i'll drop those uh those two links into the description you can get them on there for the low price of 9.99 so below 10 bucks is going to get you a super high quality battery from reputable companies that have a warranty on them and this isn't your gas station convenience store battery this is still a good high performance battery now the main thing that i want to focus on because it is a very similar informant function to our honey stick twist battery that we offer so i'm just going to do a real brief run through of the features and the functionality and then the main thing that i want to focus on are the awesome colors and packaging that we put together and now this twist batteries will work great with your um pre-filled tanks 510 tanks that you get from the dispensaries from cbd stores all over anything that's a 510 slim tank is going to work well with this thing it's also going to work well with slim wax and dab applications things like our silencers and wax tanks and definitely be a very good reliable power plant for those so once we do just a real brief preview there of what options we have that you guys are watching now i'm gonna run through the form of functionality and the instructions for this just batteries battery so for the just batteries you're gonna see you have the button right here you're going to have the twister knob right there each one of these kits is going to come with a charger included so for 9.99 you are fully turnkey minus the cartridge that you would pick up at your dispensary or your online cbd store now before you get started you're going to want to make sure this battery is charged if a battery is completely drained it could take you about two hours to charge the battery all you do is take the charge that's provided you're going to screw it in and you are going to make sure to get this onto a charger now i always warn everybody when you're looking for a charger for this stick to desktop computers and non-apple wall adapters stay away from any apple adapters and also stay away from rapid chargers laptop computers or power banks because they won't properly charge a device or might not charge at all so that's a very common troubleshooting question that we get now the first thing that you're going to do is get this on the charger light over here when you plug it in is going to blink while it's charging then it's going to go solid which is the light that's around the led it's going to go solid now to turn the battery on once it's charged so i'd show you the example the led you'll click it five times repeatedly rapidly one two three four five and as you see it blinks up and as you see it is green when i push it now what does that green mean this battery is sophisticated enough to where it has power level indication so when you push on your vaping and the light around there's green that means that you're running basically a full charge once you get down to about a half charge that green is going to turn from green to an amber that's going to mean you're running half a charge or below you probably want to start thinking about charging your battery pretty soon then when your battery is close to being you know needing a charge or dead for that for that word um you are gonna it's gonna turn red now once it turns red that means get this thing on a charger you got a couple hits left so that has a good power indication level so you know when this thing's going to need a charge you're not going to get hit with just a multiple blink no you know surprise power adjustment if we zoom in real close you see you have a little twister knob now you have a little twister knob and you also have numbers going around the battery now this goes all the way up to four volts as you can see there's a little uh divot there in the twister now whatever that little divot thing there number that lines up with means that's the power setting that you're on and you can do that for example right now i'm going to just move it on over to 3.5 so you can see and you can scroll it all the way down to the minimum which is 2 volts now we made the minimum 2 volts it's because we've been getting a lot of demand from people who are now into this low voltage vaping and these ultra low resistance carts that need very very low inputs to vape properly to give you good flavor and activation maintain terpenes and cbd profiles so we want to make sure you have a very nice low starting point from 2 volts but you can bang with the best of them at 4 volts okay which means you can bang out some serious power out of out of these carts to give you guys some monster rips out of standard five-time carts now this battery does have preheat functionality which means especially for cold weather climates you uh you might have a cartridge that's a little seized up needs a little low voltage a little warm up to get it going when the battery is on what you're gonna do is you're gonna go ahead and push this button two times quickly and fast i'll do it right now and what you'll see is you'll see the color light up blue rainbow it's changing colors that means it's preheating at any given point during that time you can push the button one time you're exiting preheat mode once your cartridge is preheated this is mainly for colder climates or cartridges that have gunked up or things like that so since we've gone through this battery the form and the functions let's run through and show you guys a 360 of each one of the colors just so you see what you would be purchasing and what your options are with this amazing battery let's start off all the way over here and check out our slate gray now the slate gray is a matte color very deep gray if you don't look closer it's not under the right light you might even think that it's black i mean this is what this is the same paint that they're putting on those beautiful expensive mercedes and bentleys those amgs those g wagons they are beautiful matte colored slate paint i think this is very stylish battery very clean if you want something more plain we can transition over to the black battery you're gonna have to edit that out how long does that go for you go over to the black battery let's do a nice little 360 of that now this is a matte black it's pretty flat but it does have a really nice pop to it you see of the just batteries insignia there the next color that we have is a matte gold so it's not a sparkly gold it's matte but it has this nice champagne deep champagne finish to it definitely a very nice unique option there on a color then we have a shiny rose gold right here i want to make sure we get it in the right light so you see that it's not like a stainless because it's like a kind of like a copper like if you had an ultra polished you know penny probably want to dim the lights to show so there that is your rose gold and again you guys will have some really nice detailed pictures on both the the just cbd store and the vape honey stick website then you have a matte silver again it's not a metallic or polished it's a nice matte silver no real sparkles but a real nice uh finish on the paint there and then for those who want more of a shiny silver we have the full stainless which is a brushed stainless steel finish nice and reflective the way that they're coated they're not really going to fingerprint up and get dirty so this is really nice clean cut for that metallic look and then we go over to a blue this is a nice aqua that's very similar to our our honey stick blue that's a very popular color that we wanted to uh to emulate here because we have a lot of fans of this blue color and then lastly we have a nice red we wanted to make it shiny to look like your favorite red sports car or fire engine style this is a really nice deep clean red let's do a nice little 360 here you see that just battery insignia the twister so as you guys can see for ten dollar for under ten dollars on these batteries you cannot go wrong at that price with getting a high quality battery that that has really nice finishes and looks for them that'll power up your 510 thread carts you have endless options on the colors here very classy very good functionality reliable and again

"hi my name is ryan and i am the developer and founder of vapejet and today we're going to talk a little bit about our semi-automatic cartridge filling solution the jet fueler some of the things that make this system different than other cartridge filling systems on the market are our fluid dispense path and the extreme care we take for process control temperature so talking about the fluid dispense path we start with a stainless steel one liter reservoir which is connected down into the pump housing which includes a ceramic on ceramic mechanical valve as well as a syringe pump you'll also notice here at the bottom is a needle connected to a lure lock adapter connected to this heater let's talk about process heat real quick because it's vitally important to keep the temperature of the oil as it's pumped consistent throughout the entire process we do that by having three independently controllable pid heaters the first is on the reservoir the second is in this pump housing and the third is the lure lock adapter here at the bottom this first heater is a silicone heater pad connected to the stainless steel reservoir which is controllable through our software to set the temperature and eliminate oscillations in temperature keeping next up is the pump housing this is a forced air heater also hooked up to a pid controller and controllable through the software and that maintains the temperature of this system inside the pump chamber as well as this hose to keep the line nice and warm as the oil flows through it finally we have a heater here at the bottom which heats just the last quarter inch of tubing along with the stainless steel lure lock adapter and what that does is it gives the product a final blast to heat before flowing into the cartridge by keeping this a little bit hotter than the rest of the system you're able to maintain lower oil temperatures while storing it another key feature of the jet fueler system which is enabled by that ceramic on ceramic mechanical valve is our pressurized supply side we pressurize this reservoir using clean food grade nitrogen to about 20 to 40 psi depending on the viscosity of the fluid and what that does is it allows you to keep your fluid at a lower temperature than would otherwise normally be required to pump it through a system like this so let's talk about this reservoir a little bit more and take it apart and look at what's inside again this reservoir holds one liter of oil and is easily accessed by taking off the top clamp removing this plate taking care to set the o-ring aside and you'll notice there's a dip tube in here which once it's installed into the system pulls oil from the bottom corner to ensure you get all the oil from your reservoir let's go ahead and pour in some preheated oil remembering to put the clamp the o-ring back on and now this reservoir is ready to be reinstalled into the system once the oil has been loaded into the reservoir we're ready to reinstall it onto the system simply take the reservoir place it on top connect the electrical and then connect the supply line with the supply line finger tight then take a 9 16 wrench and give it an additional quarter turn once that's complete take your nitrogen quick connect and connect it into the system now we're ready to prime the pump now that the reservoir is loaded and pressurized let's go ahead and turn on all the heaters so from the interface you can simply click toggle all heaters which will turn on the needle chamber and reservoir heaters you'll notice all those heaters are currently heating up which is why the power levels are all at 100 percent as each section comes to temperature you'll see those power levels start to throttle down so that we maintain temperature without a lot of oscillations up or down now at this point we're going to let the system warm up for 10 to 15 minutes before we proceed now that the product is loaded into the system we need to prime our pump the pressurized aspect of the jet fueler makes that incredibly easy so what we're going to do is we're going to take a beaker and place it underneath the needle and then on the front panel of the machine we're going to hit bypass what bypass does is it connects the input port directly to the output port because our reservoir is pressurized that pressure is going to push the oil through the system so i'm going to hit bypass and you can see the oil starting to flow out nice and smooth done that's it now our system is primed and ready to start pumping we're ready to calibrate it and set the fill level for a cartridge we're going to need a few empty cartridges and a scale you're going to tear out one of your cartridges so that it displays zero on your scale and then we're going to use the interface and click the calibration button and walk through this wizard the first thing we want to do is set the initial fill level these are one gram cartridges so i'm going to drag the slider to somewhere around one click the next button and on this screen we're able to set how fast the system pumps so you can change the speed of the charging motion and the dispensing motion independently of one another the reason that's important is with some cartridges you don't want to pump too fast or the oil can overflow and bubble out one side before it's had time to fully flow around the center post so we're going to set this one to one so the fastest charging and a dispensing speed of about 10 which is mid-range click next and on this screen what we're going to do is dispense a couple times and tell the system how it did so we want one gram so take the teared out cartridge put it under the needle and hit cycle pump you can see we dispensed in and we dispensed 1.2 so what we want is 1.05 and we dispensed 1.2 hit the next button and that's all it takes to set up this machine so let's take another cartridge tear it out hit cycle pump and we are at 1.06 so very accurate and very repeatable dispenses let's do it one more time to make sure 1.05 perfect now that the system is set up and calibrated one of the things we can do is save and load those profiles for later so if you click the configuration button and configuration list we can call this a one gram low this and say we'll call this the live demo configuration hit save new and there we go now in the future to come back to this calibration all you have to do is hit the load button now that we have the system calibrated and our configuration saved we're ready to start filling cartridges so you'll notice right here next to the machine is a foot pedal this foot pedal actuates the pumping action so that the operator has both hands to position cartridges i'm going to take this one and just set it down and then let's get some cartridges and start filling so we position so please and that's all it takes to operate a jet fueler system if you have any other technical questions or just want to talk to somebody in sales please don't hesitate to reach out we can set up one-on-one individual remote demonstrations to go over any aspects of the machine you may want to know more about thank you again and i'll talk to you soon", "zGYZkyvEDkI": "hello everybody cheapest vape supplies dot-com here doing a product review on the double concentrate and cartridge bubbler this is one cool product we looked high and low and couldn't find anything

your day Chivas vape supplies that kind of everyday", "YSjmQy42BWk": "[Music] what's up youtube this is shabazz and i'm back with another cbd hemp flower review what's up tomorrow can of sewers welcome back to another shabazz short today i'm reviewing something that i know a lot of y'all are going to be excited about it's another delta 8 product and specifically delta 8 vape cartridges by effects delta 8. now effects offers granddaddy perp strawberry cough and cali orange kush or calio they have one gram cartridges and guess what i have one of each cartridge so i'm gonna try each one let you know the flavor profile and by the end of taste testing all of them the effects should be kicking right in i do have a couple concerns right off the bat in the package i didn't get any paper test results and most importantly i didn't get a notice to law enforcement now when you're dealing with cannabis product and even especially with delta eight products because there's such a thin line between legality with delta eight there's such a thin line of legality with delta eight i feel like anything like this needs to have a letter to law enforcement what i did get in the package though is this absolutely massive effects sticker so here is the cartridges themselves one gram each says effects delta eight savage brand you got the granddaddy perp the cali oh and the strawberry cough they do have percentages on them so granddaddy perp has 82 percent d8 the cali o has 48 and the strawberry cough has 65.5 percent so let's start with uh the lightest and going up to the heaviest which works out for me too because of those terpenes so here goes the cali orange really nice packaging by the way i really like the packaging this packaging it's you know this is premium looking packaging it looks professional here we go pull the cartridge out the rubber caps on each no branding on this cartridge i don't know what brand it is i don't know where it comes from there has been a big issue in cannabis community lately with people using off-brand cheap carts that have lead and other things in them i don't know about this but it's always a plus when you're using good trusted name brand cartridges like c cell anyways so this is the calio i'm gonna get the screw right on here remember these carts fit on any 510 battery so any little battery like this if you're a stoner if you're in the cannabis life i'm sure you have a couple of these laying around [Music] i really like the terpenes on that really has that citrusy orange wow this is really citrusy and really orangey yeah 48 percent we'll take a couple hits of each one really smooth i mean it's a vapor it's it's it's it's a smooth i mean it's the smoothest vapor gas [Music] cali oh all right i like that one that was really cool and right here on the top i didn't even notice it says hybrid so this is going to be your hybrid smoke and i guess the hybrid terpene i probably should have started off with the sativa which i think is going to be the strawberry cough but that was cool now here goes the strawberry cough sativa terpene profile 65 d8 same packaging once again no really nice premium packaging okay now this one is a different cartridges this is one of the clear top cartridges i've had these before from a different vendor all right got that strawberry cough on there it tastes like strawberries [Music] very smooth the great thing about things they are super convenient they leave no smell you don't have to burn anything smoke anything pack anything clear anything out carry around a lighter go somewhere because the smell no vaporizers you could literally if you're at work you can literally go in the bathroom hit your vaporizer and walk back out no lingering smell nothing nobody will ever know so if you enjoy cannabis whether that be hemp or high thc flour and you are in the interest of being discreet definitely check out vape carts i think this is a good time to to warn everybody about delta eight delta h is very potent generally it doesn't come with the anxiety and the rush and the racy heartbeat and everything that delta nine thc does but that is only if you use it within reason do not overindulge on delta a because delta 8 is still thc and it will mess you up if you are thc sensitive and you cannot handle a thc high don't go crazy on the delta a it is far better than delta 9 far less anxiety but still it can get you there i got overzealous one day i was doing tiny little droplets of delta 8 distillate you know every 30 40 minutes and i was like uh you know this is nothing so i took a bowl of hemp flour squeezed a big old glob of d8 on there smoked the whole thing 10 minutes later i felt like i was dying if you've ever had cannabis induced panic attack you know what that feeling is you feel like you're gonna have a heart attack you can't stop breathing fast because if you breathe normal you just feel like you're not breathing enough racy thoughts you're worried you're paranoid that whole terrible thing that happened to me granted i did take a huge amount a very potent delta ate this to it but still don't go crazy with the delta eight take baby steps and just be cautious with it delta eight can be a very great time but if you overdo it it can also be a bad time all right let's move on over to the grand daddy perp which is the indica coming at 82 i'm gonna take a little bit more light on this one because i definitely feel the effects coming out from the other two same packaging this cart is actually branded so interestingly each cart for each different flavor is slightly different i actually like that because it's easy to tell them apart all right here goes the granddaddy perp and i'm gonna go easy on this because i'm already feeling crazy oh that's extremely creepy i think they might have overdid it with the terpenes on the granddaddy purp that tastes like purple kool-aid straight up it's good it's smooth but i'm gonna have to end that there all right vape cartridges d8 it's convenient no smell no odor no smoke i mean with this product i'm gonna definitely give it the shabazzle of approval good vape good terpenes my only concerns is no letter to law enforcement and they didn't appear to be name brand cartridges so i noticed while editing this video i got so faded i didn't even talk about the effects i don't know if you could notice if you go back and rewind my eyes got super duper red this is what i mean delta 8 is super strong a tiny bit goes a long way and it is extremely easy to overdo it needless to say the effects on these cartridges are very good they're very potent they're so good that i think i need to warn everybody that just because it's delta eight if you are prone to paranoia or anxiety intrusive thoughts you've got to take it easy but yes effects are very strong the terpenes definitely do make a difference whether it's a sativa hybrid or indica feeling afterwards a couple puffs go a long way so don't overdo it but within reason with the delta eight yeah i actually really like that that's a much more convenient way of getting the delta eight rather than smoking or dabbing distillate anyway so y'all that's the review make sure you go down in the description check out the merch hit me up on ig here here i appreciate everybody watching my videos if you liked the video hit like hit me up down in the comments subscribe to the channel and turn on post notifications so you can see when i upload new content i hope everybody has an amazing rest of your day or night and please stay tuned for the next video peace you", "iIwabDKM61o": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary today we are taking a look at another vape cartridge traditional 510 threaded uh this is our second look at a company and our first look at their premium line we are taking a look at carvana again uh we reviewed kirana a couple of years ago with they're very very popular here in southern california um k-pen originals i believe is what they call them the uh karana excuse me kirvana originals line a much cheaper more affordable line that i don't see as often anymore as their new ish uh much more recent premium line although this has been around for a couple of years now uh and this routinely ranks among the most expensive weed cartridges that i find uh in southern california the carvana ascend brand that's right uh a s c n d uh this is the ascend line the high fashion strain from carmana ooh la la how fancy uh it's a sativa with uh let's see in terms of thc it's got 87 thc so super high thc percentage uh and then with the whole cannabinoid package uh rocking 92 and a quarter percent really nice lab testing results really nice break down there i still don't like the trend of putting the number of total cannabinoids as a bigger more noticeable thing than thc but you know uh everybody's doing it uh gives you the primary terpenes if you are really into that um and then uh we know that from kirvana's website and the packaging here this is a full spectrum product uh which leads us into a little bit of semantic trickery in terms of what do any of these things mean so this is a full spectrum um a full spectrum vape cartridge uh from kirbana meaning that it is uses all of the spec all of the cannabinoid profile theoretically from the high fashion strain but it does not mean that it is necessarily like live resin or extracted in some different fancy way or some different fancy kind of oil it simply means that it uses the entire cannabinoid profile of the strain um so uh carbon claims on their website they use their proprietary 50-point different extraction uh method that secret whatever yada yada yada i appreciate they're not lying and saying they're you know live resin or whatever when they're not uh this is just good old-fashioned cannabis oil and then added cannabis-derived terpenes so old-school style now as i said this is the most expensive uh these are routinely the most expensive cartridges i see in southern california uh i know this isn't gonna sound like much to a lot of you but believe me uh for where my area or my dispensary this is this half gram cart costs uh 46 bucks which puts it well well well above many of its competitors uh i routinely see you can find one gram cartridges in my area for forty dollars fairly easily uh and this is a half gram cart for more than ten percent more than that so uh not cheap but let's hope it's the premium experience let's go ahead and shut up and get into it uh the most important part of these reviews the actual testing uh let's try to figure out how to open this in the least destructive way possible which i fear may not happen i think i'm gonna just cut this sticker which you know oh i do have my scissors excuse me i did come prepared all right easy desert girl don't and by easy desert girl i guess i mean me don't stab and kill yourself i've got half the sticker oh damn it let's just go for the whole thing so uh take this into account anybody who is uh planning on doing this somewhere at location you've got a pretty gnarly sticker here to contend with before opening this rather uh elaborate packaging uh you are definitely paying for some fancy ass packaging here which to me is a not uh something that i'm very happy to do even though i own a house full of apple products uh okay so there we go there is that oh look at this a little pool tab oh ah so oh a an acrylic tip which is not what i was expecting to see i was thought for sure something nicer material wise there but whatever uh as long as it still works great and the mouth feel is fine so you've got a plastic acrylic tip um otherwise the oil looks nice a little lighter than i am used to um seeing but uh that doesn't necessarily that's no indication of any kind of quality all right well there is what our what is this called again uh this high fashion looks like i've never actually had flour high fashion before anyways uh i've been told that it should have a uh sweet berry like taste let's give it a try whoa wowzer holy [ __ ] [ __ ] what a crazy crazy flavor profile wow uh it immediately comes out tasting like peppermint like a but not a burning awful too much peppermint a very um i don't know uh s gentle subtle pepperminty taste um not overpowering any way shape or form that very quickly turns into something much sort of fruitier and more almost more floral it's delightful wow yeah um in terms of taste uh this is after three or four hits here this is like a top five uh flavor terpene profile for me in terms of just pure taste it is it's it's trippy almost um how how much it changes on you let's get another big one here before we talk about how high it's gonna get us whoa that is amazing tasting wow i rarely find ones that like the taste alone is something that would make me want to um sort of uh try something again exclusively for the way it tastes but this is this is different this is something special and it's not just the taste uh this is strong as [ __ ] holy [ __ ] um that last hit really really did it um 87 thc for sure plus all those other various delightful and tasty cannabinoids for that what was it 92 and a quarter percent uh various cannabinoid profile and what a delicious 92 and a quarter percent it is um holy [ __ ] is it expensive but holy [ __ ] are the initial impressions equally i mean this is uh wow yeah uh i am i did not expect to uh review this this quickly and have such conflicting feelings i i thought for sure i was gonna come here and say like oh you know it's good but it's not worth it but uh with this taste and with this potency man this is really good stuff let's get one more in uh real quick here excuse me holy [ __ ] yes wow um i would put this as oh my god i am quite high um this is the only and this is early in our review because all of our wheats reviews is not we're not just going to review the first little bit we're going to review all of this half gram and boy am i excited to do it but this is the closest i have ever come to finding anything that um competes i'm not gonna say it's better than plug play but this is in conversation with plug play uh and it is not something i was expecting wow this is good stuff um let me get one more before we say goodbye for now uh and i'll see you guys again in a couple of days when i sadly have to say goodbye to our cravana ascend high fashion until then guys stay high stay healthy and i'll see you back here in just a few days goodbye welcome back to wheat skies it has been four whole days uh with the carvana ascend lines high fashion and that 87 thc and here i was pretty effusive in our first half of our review and i am happy to say i am just as pleased here four days later as i was at the beginning this is truly high quality stuff here from carvana this is probably a top five favorite cartridge for me um now it is a premium product again it comes in at 46 bucks for that half gram but this half grim did last me about a day longer than average mostly because it's just that strong and i was able to hit it less more infrequently and it lasted longer as a result but it is more expensive by a decent margin than a lot of products out there um so you should factor that into your buying decisions especially if you are value conscious uh but if you're looking for something a little special a little different um the kurvana ascend line at least the high fashion is going to get a huge huge thumbs up for me um really really enjoyed it uh take a look at your dispensary if you're looking for something a little bit more premium a little bit more [ __ ] i forgot to do and i can't ever think of one while i'm doing it what was my cherry on top why did i do this oh my god i had one in my head and then i just premium premium what's premium [ __ ] welcome back to which guys cherry on top real quick i wanted to uh drop with you guys before we go here a little something extra when we like review this much we like to give a little extra something that isn't weed related but you might want the carvana ascend for this one because it'll be nice and trippy that's an uh year old or so show on amazon prime called undone from the creator of bojack horseman uh it is an animated show starring a couple of different folks including everybody's favorite um uh saul goodman um bob odenkirk himself uh great animated show rotoscope style like a scanner darkly so it looks vaguely real but with this bizarro trippy animation style over top of it and it's a pretty interesting story i think it's like 10 episodes each about 20 minutes it's really worth checking out uh both of these things are the karana ascend high fashion and that is also undone on amazon prime but things i highly highly recommend and that guys is going to do it for our cherry on top and that's going to do it for our review of the cravana ascend until we see you guys on our next review live stream whatever stay high more importantly stay healthy", "Lok3M6al86Y": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoffman ring officer of honey stick and today I am serving up a nice platter of oil pens for you one of the most commonly frequently asked questions that I get personally and the rest of my service staff get is how do I choose my perfect oil pen and based on the successes of our other videos about how to pick your perfect concentrate and dab pen and also how to pick your perfect concealer well we really worked hard on this week was trying to put together a comprehensive checklist and run through our units to see how you can pick out your perfect oil pen so what our team did we put these factors together and then I did a job job of going out into our warehouse and assembling all of the various units that we have as options for oil pens that we felt viable and we're gonna run through them all based on our eight criteria that I've outlined so let's jump into my criteria I outline and I'm gonna rely on the audience of course to drop into the comments if there's a criteria that I forgot so people who are tuned into the video following along watching the comments can really still see and make the best informed decision that's what our videos are about is really presenting our products and just helping you guys to make a better purchasing decision or to just get a little more education awareness so let's jump into my eight factors my first factor when choosing an oil pen I think is based on the availability based on your state now oils are not necessarily accessible everywhere so it might not even be an option for you but in the event that it is some states they're only have it seemed to be available already prefilled into 510 threaded cartridges or they could be placed into so Changez already pre Lord or they can only be available in tincture bottles so based on what kind type of oils you have access to or what type of texture oils you have access to could really be a determining factor of when you when you're trying to select your perfect oil pen the next factor for you is to keep in mind and I think it's a second probably the most pressing factor is budget I know there's a lot of eight ballers out there who price is not a thing but a lot of medical patients and people who are on let's say disability or things like that that are using cannabis for medicinal purposes budget is a very important thing to them so we can't just go crazy on the price spectrum and we should definitely keep a price as a major factor when choosing a vaporizer as an option the next factor that I think is the most important is how stealthy the unit is so stealthiness can play play a factor in a few ways whether you have it on the go and you want to be discreet whether you just want to be small and compact or whether you are really taking your vaporizer places that you shouldn't and you just don't want to get caught or you want it to go incognito which is perfectly cool but that definitely plays a factor when you are choosing your perfect vape pen I think the next next factor number four is the ease of use is how easy is the oil pen to use and really what is your vape level I have a lot of people who have never turned on a vaporizer before who contact us and we have people who call in to educate us on our own vaporizers on how the best way is to use them so there's different places where you can fall in your vape knowledge spectrum and those will definitely have an impact on your buying decision when you are selecting your pur Victor oil pen is how easy is the vaporizer to use where's my current vape skillset or how am I willing to learn now we do try to make educational videos so that you know even if you do pick up one of the more more expert level vaporizers you know you watch our videos will walk you through how to get it up and running and really be able to use it next I think is battery life you know that comes into play when for me personally like when I'm buying a phone because I cannot stay connected to a charger you know certain people have certain lifestyles they take them on that or they can't get to a charger it takes a they want to be able to have a few days charge on it or they're going on a hiking expeditions is something we've gotten to where they want to make sure they can go about a week without having a charger so the battery life really does play into when you're making a decision of how long and how much you can use it in between charges I think that's important factor when choosing an oil pen next I think it is mobility is can you take it around or is it just gonna be something that kind of stays at home because generally you can get more power and performance out of units that are larger and you can get more kind of back to our other point of of being convenient and easy to use or stealthy out of smaller units so I think that really the mobility factor does play into it as to how and where you plan to take the vaporizer can you drop it in your pocket do you put in your backpack can you just you know throw it on a lanyard or keychain and call it a day next I think it comes down to the next factor really we're going into the nitty-gritty here is the power how much power puts out how intense it is I think that makes a big big determining factor to people because some people really thrive to get an intensity and powerful vaporizer that hits hard and to some people that's believe it or not that that can also be a turn-off to her they want a vaporizer to be very smooth and and and not you know be have any type of traits that to some people could lead off as harsh and I think in the last one is flavor everybody loves to taste good flavor when you're buying spending a lot of money buying concentrates or CBDs or whatever it is that you're buying a nateing sure surrender prefilled cartridge everybody wants to taste what they're getting fact is they're not they're not cheap and people want to get a unique and flavorful experience so where they rank on a flavorful level is also very important when choosing a royal pen so now that we've gone through all the factors and again if I miss something a really thought hard to try not to but if we did make sure to drop in the comments below so people can can see exactly what what other factors they should consider is let's jump right into our different assortment of oil vaporizers and start basically ranking them so you guys have a good knowledge and awareness of where these would rank first off we're a gold or honey stick oil disposable pen now I grab this has had some prefilled CBD in it some a gold lined CBD from our warehouse this pen ships empty so in terms of what you have available whether you if you don't have tinctures or syringes available this is not a 5-10 thread cartridge so you cannot unscrew this cartridge and screw your own cartridge in there so if in your state you only have prefilled cartridges this pen might not be for you however if you have tinctures and syringes available in your state you can definitely use this pen in terms of budget wise this pen is very cost effective because it is a disposable it's not recharged I think it's on our website for $15 so it's very convenient however on the same budget side it's not that economical because once you run through the tanks you would have to buy a new one and once you've ran through two three four of these you could have bought a rechargeable pen and price saved a little money in the wrong long run but if you're traveling or you live that certain lifestyle to where you don't want to take care of a pen maintain a pen you just want it to go through the tank or the the tincture or the syringe then this pen does definitely become convenient in terms of stealthy it's not stealthy in the sense of hiding the pan or the cartridge but it is stealthy in the sense that it looks similar to a lot of illiquid units and it can be disguise' belit is relatively small I mean it's basically about four and a half maybe five inches in length you can easily fit it into your pocket each one comes with a plastic tube and we did do a full review on this oil disposable pen it's actually very easy to use you just unscrew the top to fill it and we do have a step-by-step on there and there's no buttons to push no locking mechanisms you just inhale in terms of battery life this battery is good to run through the tank I tell people it is you should only really rely on it to run through the tank once even if the battery is not completely dead you don't want to get caught refilling the tank and then having to try to siphon or salvage oil out of a disposable pen because then you do have wastage and it is expensive so these they generally say are good for 200 puffs or one tank which if you look at the number of puffs on a half a mil which is the capacity of this tank it's between 150 and 200 puffs so that's what the battery life is mobility this thing is very mobile very convenient for traveling running around it's small it is extreme lightweight.you basically you could have a real lanyard and not even feel that it's here in terms of power that this unit doesn't have a high output this is more focused on smoothness and flavor it is auto draw and in general and again I say this is in general push-button units tend to hit harder than auto draw units simply because you're not using the power of your actual draw to activate the unit so this is a very flavorful a ceramic heating core and it it is not super intense it is more of a very smooth rolling and flavorful hits so that's where our disposable oil pan ranks one really select your perfect oil pan it is convenience oriented it is lightweight mobile flavorful but isn't going to deliver those those hard hits it's not rechargeable and it will not work with 510 threaded cartridges so let's move right along to one step up now this is not a unit that we have on our website however a lot of you guys have seen these these are the stylist standard disposable units this one we make exclusively for one of our distributors it's called the honey stick bee buzzin it is a stylus battery that comes with a high quality classic plastic wick cartridge what's cool about this stylus pen is it's basically the next step up from just plain disposable a lot of people do view these pens as disposable even though it is rechargeable in terms of availability this no matter what type of oils you have available whether it's prefilled cartridges or whether it's tinctures or syringes you can if you buy this kit you're able to use it because it does have a 5-10 thread battery that cartridges can screw on to however these auto draw batteries are not the modernized drawers like in the elf so if you're a cartridge is a high-capacity ceramic cartridge or a really wide cartridge battery could be a little underpowered in terms of budget price these pens retail for about twenty to twenty-five dollars they are their simple easy to use there's a very budget kit it's a very budget starter kit it is auto draw you know and with this carry case on our next level it is pretty stealthy because you just have in this little wallet case slip it into your pocket and you're not gonna hear or say anything about but once you have the the actual cartridge and the battery screwed on you know that that stealthiness kind of does go away now this cartridge is very similar to the cartridge that we have stock in our beekeeper unit and we have a detailed video on how to to fill this unit how to fill this year and up and it is actually very easy to fill up and to function there's no buttons there's no clicking there is no unlocking you just simply fill up the cartridge screw it onto the battery and your ready to vape it is an auto draws very easy to use battery life battery life for a rechargeable unit it probably does fall on the lowest end of the spectrum of our comparison it is basically about the same battery life if not less than our disposable unit so this thing it is you are gonna need to charge it more if you're on the go when it is charged up it's definitely gonna give you some good hits you're gonna run good with it but it is it is really the entry-level unit if you're just getting into vaping don't know of vaping z' for you you want to pick up a nice cost-effective kit that is gonna be easy for you to get started with just to see if you like vaping but it's not you know gonna be your daily driver or your long hauler mobility with the carrying case and even without it's a very lightweight it is a mobile we unit so you're gonna be able to run around with it you know it's it's a very small compact it is a little bit taller than our previous unit by about an inch with the cartridge on there and power this is an auto draw unit and it does have a more basic cartridge which has a wick so in terms of power they're not going to be that powerful when you when you draw you're not gonna get monster clouds because first of all it's not push-button second of all is because it's more of a traditional cartridge however it is very reliable of a unit now in terms of flavor again these kits were not knocking them at all we do make them they're very entry level in terms of flavor I don't think that you will get blown away you would have to switch it out to a different cartridge if you have very high quality extracts then I would probably consider upgrading the cartridge or stepping into a different level of a kit but very basic very good way to get started very easy to use lightweight a starter kit on that end all right next up our upgrade from our disposable pen we have our Gold Line vape battery okay which is a push-button variable temperature battery we did a very thorough review of this and it is actually paired up with our cloud tank here what's cool about this batteries it's 510 thread it works with all 510 thread batteries and also if you purchase this cartridge you can definitely take advantage of tinctures and syringes so in terms of what's available in your state if you buy one of these you're basically covered on all your ends in terms of budget this tank goes for I think $12 on our website and the the battery is $20 so it's actually your under $35 for this starter kit the way that it is and for that price you are getting a lot of bang for the buck because you are getting a very good battery it has three different temperatures it has preheat mode you know also chargeable very good we did a full detailed review of this pen if you want to see the features and specs it is actually very easy to use however because it's push-button it adds you know one level over the auto draw units that we just discussed here so you would definitely have to have some very basic vape knowledge but again this knowledge is very basic nothing to get freaked out about battery life this unit has a high-capacity battery it has a 650 mah battery so it is actually a very high capacity battery for a little vaporizer which is actually more than twice the the capacity of this so if you're looking for something more on-the-go and something that is definitely going to go to need less charges this is is a better unit option for that in terms of mobility it is a little bit long but it's still relatively light can still fit into your pocket still very transportable light enough to hold on a lanyard but it is a little bit long in terms of mobility in terms of power it has three intensity settings so you can hone in on what power you feel comfortable with so if you're not sure what you're gonna like it's definitely a good idea to have something that has variable temperatures and on the most intense setting a lot of our customers even have commented on the YouTube channels of of this pen that it hits really solid so for a small pen it definitely delivers the power if you pair this with not somebody else's prefilled tank you're filling your own you pair it with our cloud tank with a ceramic heater you're definitely gonna get good flavor so I really think that where does this pen rank in terms of an oil pen I think if you're looking for a beginner pen on a budget you cannot go wrong with this pen and it is a deftly a solid choice and the first step to get into the big leagues now let's move on to our most popular vaporizer that's being sold as the honey stick beekeeper it is a concealer so it is it's also been ranked by a lot of people as one of the best oil pens and the cartridge it comes with is a thick oil similar to the disposable very basic because most people do utilize 510 threaded cartridges it works on magnet adapter we have a very detailed video about this this this unit so because it does come with a tank you can use it for basically everything from tinctures to syringes and also 510 thread tanks that you could screw the magnet adapter on so no matter what your state has going on if you pick up a beekeeper more than likely you're gonna be able to take advantage of that it's pretty cost effective unit its selling on our website for 39.99 so it really isn't a big high-dollar unit and it delivers a lot stealthiness the concealer unit because it keeps the cartridge concealed it is actually very small as you can see here it definitely ranks very high on the stealth factor nobody really knows what's going on on top of it all it's a matte black looking like a stealth bomber I think it ranks very high in that level ease of use there's no variable temperatures there's one small button that's push button five clicks on five clicks off push and hold while you inhale super easy to use you can see our detailed video on that battery life this unit also has a high capacity battery which is just about twice the capacity of of these standard batteries so you're definitely going to be able to take this on the go more and get more out of it mobility I don't think you have a much more mobile unit to carry around it'll fit into your little jean pocket wherever slide into a little bitty groove into the purse it's not much bigger than a little thing of lipstick so in terms of power the beekeeper definitely does deliver power it doesn't have variable intensity sync so if you don't like a larger volume inhale you know you can't adjust it down real so it has a good power spectrum that delivers nice power if you're looking for flavor I really highly recommend you buy the high-performance beekeeper cartridge which has a wickless ceramic heater in it and it definitely brings out a lot more flavor notes and smoothens it out if you're filling your own cartridge and if you put your Magna dap tour on there it just drops in it even has a very cool stainless steel tip alright so now we're moving right along to our elf unit we just got done going over the beekeeper so the elf has basically a lot of the same characteristics in the sense that it's a very small actually a little bit smaller than the beekeeper concealer that works well with but that's a magnetic that works well with prefilled cartridges tinctures as well as fills a notable differences is the elf already comes with high performance good tasting ceramic cartridge so you can get a little bit more performance out of the stock elf cartridge it's glass then the stock beekeeper cartridge that that one comes with however a notable difference is they have the same battery capacity but this one is actually easier to use because it is buttonless so you don't have to unlock anything it is an auto draw unit now even though a lot of times Auto draw units are less powerful a lot of people have set the elf is actually a very powerful auto draw unit because the sensitivity of the sensor when you start drawing so you're still gonna get good power you're gonna get better flavor the unit is actually very stealthy it's a little bit easier to use if you're just getting started you don't like pushing small buttons a lot of people say they're medical medical condition doesn't let them to to push small buttons so it's very easy to draw the unit is very mobile has good power and because the high performance cartridge you do to a little bit of extra flavor out of it so this is also another good concealer now if you looked at the if you determine that hey I need a concealer based off of you know the characteristics that we went through our eight important factors but you want something that has a little bit more or has a little bit more battery power your next step up is our phantom unit which our phantom unit is basically a concealer as you could see it's very similar in size it's a little bit bigger but the reason it's a little bit bigger is it has two and a half times the battery capacity of the elf and the phantom so you're gonna go a lot more between charges it's also squeeze action so it's you're not pushing any small buttons however were the key differences is that it has four different temperature settings so you can really tune in on that power and flavor level that you want it comes with a high performance cartridge and what's cool is it also comes with I don't have it here on the table actually I do it even comes with a wax adapter cartridge so if the availability of prefilled cartridges oils that you can fill aren't there but waxes are you have the wax adapter as well so it really allows you to be very very versatile when you're using the phantom it's a very cool looking unit feels very good extremely stealthy because you can't see the cartridge still small but it does have more power more capacity and it has a four available temperature settings on here again we have a couple very in-depth videos about this year on the channel so if you're a going concealer this is probably where you're gonna be however it does cost more it is our most expensive concealer that we have over here which on our website think it's about 129 on here but really solid unit just you can feel the quality so if you're not sure if you want something like a stick a battery or concealer and you want something in between and you're really trying to get the vaporizer into places a vaporizer shouldn't be we have our minimax Pro which is a switchblade action key fob battery which will does not come with a cartridge the elf phantom and the beekeeper all come with their cartridges so if your state or your availability doesn't have 510 thread cartridges you will need to buy a cartridge to pair this with in order to get it functioning it is not that expensive of a unit it retails on our website for $40 it is pretty easy to use it does have three temperature settings but it only has one button here that you push so you'd have to unlock it and relock it and cycle through the temperatures through here what is cool about it is that it does have a pretty high capacity battery it has a 650 million power battery so it does actually have more capacity than the elf and the beekeepers so it falls kind of right in between these two units in terms of battery life the thing about it is though is it is extremely stealthy because it was designed like a car key it even fits on your keyring so it's extremely mobile so you can see the cartridge hides over here and you push the button and it flips open so you keep it completely hidden this is where the key would be I mean this thing is gonna fly under the radar basically wherever you have it as long as you pair it with your wallet or have it on your keychain because the three power levels that it has you can wind up the intense and you can get some really good power rips out and I know some people posted reviews on our in-depth video about this product and they said that on the third power level they will have able to get some really good strong power and depending on what cartridge you pair it with if you have it paired with like a cloud tank like our cloud tank on our website that has a good smooth ceramic flow your also get some really good flavor notes out of it so this little unit if you're really stealthiness is super important to you but you still want to have some good features in there and stay keep a pen that's you know under $50 pad your you're looking pretty good with the minimax Pro for your oil needs so we just went over all these regular oil and cartridge devices now I want to take take the next step to jump into a new level of vaporizer which is our sub ohm I have a video that really goes into sub ohm and oil vaping and I really truly do believe it as a future trend a lot of customers do ask me hey what if I just buy the most expensive pen is it the best pen or not well the short answer is generally the most expensive pens are better and more performance but it still might not fit your personal 8 characteristics that we went through as good as some of the other pens but the sub ohms are our favorite they're one of our fastest growing areas and honey stick is really one of the best innovators in this area so let's start off if you like the concealer but you want a sub ohm we have our old unit the Ripper which we actually have the new one here's the shell of it I don't have a finished unit because they are gonna be delivered this week so just a couple more days guys I know a lot of people put in their pre-orders and the new version is actually gonna look just like this really cool shell and it's gonna be a two in one it's actually gonna have a wax adapter as well but the Ripper is your sub ohm concealer so now just really really quickly what a sub ohm unit does is it just brings really low resistance really high power and intensity and what I would say is much greater flavour notes to oils and I put up a video about sub ohm oil vaping and we've reviewed a lot of our sub ohm devices now the Ripper is your sub ohm concealer it does not work with 510 thread cartridges so if you only have 510 thread cartridges in your state this is probably not a vaporizers that you're gonna pick up because you either need tinctures or syringes but it is actually disguised to look as a lighter you flip it open you have your button you know it has it has a telescopic mouthpiece that comes out here and we will have a full review of a ripper when it's in stock it only has one temperature setting which is in tense however this unit is extremely stealthy a lot of people have confused it as a lighter it's very easy to use because it doesn't have any digital settings it's not variable temperature it's just a 5 click lock and because the lock is covered you don't even really have to keep it locked the the cartridges just pop in and out which you do have to fill because they are subohm they just pop in and the top screws on it's a very simple extremely durable mechanism it does have an ultra high-capacity battery which actually has about 20% more capacity than even our phantom so very high-capacity battery it's extremely mobile extremely durable very tough unit and on the power scale it is off the charts in terms of intensity you can YouTube some videos of people using this device in terms of flavor I feel it has better flavor than most cartridges however when we get down into our digital mods and tanks you can really fine-tune the flavor so I think in subohm in the sub own category it has better flavor than a lot of standard units however because of all the power and because you can't really fine-tune it in it's definitely higher on the power and intensity spectrum that is on the flavor spectrum for sub ohm so that's our Ripper check out the full review on that one so moving into the sub ohms we really have two units that a lot of people often compare and contrast we have our our Cannabis Cup winning sub ohm original kit which a lot of people on the YouTube channel refer to as the OG cannabis cup kit really like that name possible name change there and our newest sub ohm Sport kit now both of them have very high capacity batteries both of them have really awesome tanks both of them are in terms of budget wise they're definitely on the higher end of the spectrum there there both under $200 the subohm sport is 169 and the sub-ohm original kit is right around that $200 mark so these aren't your regular budget kits these are your luxury kits but they definitely perform now in terms of availability of what you have available if you have 510 thread cartridges available you're not going to be will unscrew this tank and use a 5-10 thread cartridge on this battery without an ego adapter on our sub ohm og kit you do have an ego adapter that you unscrew right here you just flip this over put it back onto your battery and you're able to use 510 thread cartridges you can fill these with syringes or tinctures I would probably not consider these as stealthy as versatile and versatile even though they do fit into the pocket they are heavier I mean that's a good in terms of a quality standpoint but they do have a little bit of half so in terms of mobility and you know stealthiness you don't really get away with that the subohm sport is slightly stealthier than the OG kit because it has a window covering around the glass so you don't really see what's in there it also offers a little bit more protection now the battery life these things are both ultra high capacity they're way over the 1500 mAh as well so you get a lot of capacity of these you charge these things up a lot of people go days without getting a charge even without having to recharge it even our very heavy daily users both these units you can dial up the power big-time this one goes up to 36 watts which is more than what you will need this one actually goes all the way up to 60 watts which is definitely way more than you're ever really gonna need which which can just really you know melt the whole power spectrum in terms of hits now in terms of flavor they're going to be a little bit different you can use a blender option on here which uses a solid block ceramic heater and then this one uses a ceramic and Kanthal heater in here which has different bottom draw and orifice holes a lot of people say that this kid is really easy to get started with but basically you start off with this kit and then you graduate into kind of this tank with the the taste delivery and the power and how you're actually able to use as a blender and put solid concentrates into there so power these kits are both way up in the spectrum flavor I would say they're both up there and the very high rankings of flavor but once you you know really want to fine-tune your experience there's nothing really like the og cannabis cup kit that's what the judges and socal thought and really that's what a lot of our audience things but these kids are really closely matched now the only other thing that I can say to add to these two that's going to decrease your mobility but increase the power and flavor you're gonna be all have on tap is adding our bumblebee bubbler we did a full review and demo on this with honey girl or another one of our videos is you can pair it with our sub ohm devices and it can because you'll run it through water you can really crank up the power and really smooth out even more flavor to take your vaping experiences to all new levels however what's this gonna do to your oil pen definitely gonna increase you know it's gonna sorry decrease your mobility it's definitely gonna decrease any stealthiness that you had it's gonna increase the power I would say it will definitely increase the flavor notes as well it's gonna tack on another about 20 to 30 bucks to your budget cuz you're watching this video so you're gonna wait for the discount code at the end and it's also what's cool about those availability wise you can actually pair this thing with 510 thread cartridges to still put them on so this is still compatible with 510 thread cartridges so that's the bubbler lastly the only other way that you can improve your oil vaping experience is by having a battery like our speed barrier it has a lot of features but you have to be a really an expert vape level to really use this battery you can set the Watts in just fine but there's features and temperature controls and how you want your power to come on that you're not gonna get in standard batteries it really takes a step above even these two batteries and it has twice the capacity and power availability of both these batteries so you know you can also get one of these batteries to pair with your oil tanks however this battery is too powerful for a lot of little oil tanks so it's not gonna be fully compatible there alright so just to summarize guys thank you so much for tuning in I hope that walking through our old oil devices and showing you guys how we rank them in terms of what's available to you your budget your stealthiness your ease of use - battery life mobility power and flavor

gun that I have here today is our fifty CC gun it'll hold 50 ml and it's capable of doing one milliliter shots it comes attached with a heater controller this one currently I got set to about 110 set it a little bit higher because you know you have the heater on the outside that's wrapping your inside barrel and sometimes a little bit of a heat differential I have some prepared oil here I also have that on a heat pad and then I have some cards right here too so just to start with it you can clean your components and all that kind of stuff but it comes with is a 14 gauge tip it's already pre bent and we also have an extra plunger that goes on in the setting gun in the event that may be soaked in an alcohol and you damaged it you replace it shouldn't need to though it's very easy to disassemble and clean you just unscrew from this end it's very simply product so you install your tip it's a little lock tip Luther locks you know we can buy them all different variations and sizes so you don't have to worry about whatever I give you if it doesn't work for your products you can pick them up and get a bag of 100 of them for 6 bucks the cards I have right here are 1 ml they're also sitting on a heat pad I like to kind of keep my tarts a little bit warm when I'm doing this stuff too so to fill it it's very simple you just make sure you plunge it down into your liquid and you pull back slowly as you're filling it the nice thing is this will stay warm why are you using it ok grab my cards here you want to make sure you depress on the handle entirely sometimes the first shot is a partial shot just because the gun may have not been filled up or backed up all the way but there's my full shot there you just kind of keep moving along pressing the handle all the way there's notches on the inside of the plunger and those notches will ensure that you don't over pull it but if you do under pull it you will get a half shot but it allow them make sure you can fill each cart exactly the same every time we will also have these available in point 5 ml increments those will be coming very soon just gonna finish up this last one all right thanks for watching", "_GXrNZZnloI": "what is up YouTube family boy vaska's here gonna be doing another cartridge review today for you guys I really appreciate you guys watching my videos if you got someone watch the video I posted before this one go ahead and check it out we'd really appreciate that but other than that it's Sunday more Sunday morning actually you know I'm just chillin kicking back bout it hit my dispensary maybe a cup and eight this something you know it's it's about that time you know I really want to smoke it it's kind of different when you have a when you smoke out of a cartridge and you smoke a bloody nut I mean it's way different so but before I go ahead head out you know I want to get this out of the way so here we have this lemon haze from bloom farms you know I've never had a blue farm before actually I have but it was more uh it was one of these darts I'm know if you guys had seen these before these are pretty good so I don't know if they taste exactly like the card just because at the time I didn't see no cartridges I just seen these so I don't know whether they just like I said they just came out with cartridges or whatnot but you guys let me know on that this was like it was like 38 bucks you know I couldn't pass these up they had a lot they had all kinds of flavors you know what I mean so there's those people say there's a lot of fakes and there's real [ __ ] but you know this one's definitely real I got it from the dispensary but I don't know what would be the difference between a fake or real so I cannot tell you like you know on the packaging is [ __ ] so let me know in a comment section what are you guys smoking on I'm about to pop this [ __ ] open you know I have a smoked all day so it's about that time we get the wake-and-bake going so let's go ahead and pop this [ __ ] open so the THC on this is 83 no 88 actually total cannabinoids I got to see on the back and it's pretty cool pretty cool simple packaging so we're just gonna go and take this little alright guys so we finally got the sticker open and I kind of [ __ ] it up you know kind of [ __ ] the box up a little tab ripped out so here it goes hey they got the here you got the the packaging and it looks pretty dope you not never had a bloom cartridge before and here it says today was a good day it's pretty dope packaging I'm starting to really like this we're gonna get that and all you get is like this little I'm hotter burnin like what what not to do you know what your cartridge which I'm pretty sure are you cartridge smokers know what and what not to do what your cartridge is right keep it out of the keep out of the Sun you know what that should amount and [ __ ] so here you have it cool little cab a little oh [ __ ] alright guys so we finally you have to push this and you turn it at the same time so it's kind of where you know you you gotta know what the [ __ ] you're doing with these things because it's not gonna have a hard time trying to open this [ __ ] so BAM guys this looks pretty nice you know the oil looks really really clear nice yellow gold and first of all we're just gonna go ahead and do the bubble test on it this one's a super Lemon Haze I were really big the team fan and the super Lemon Haze is like a really old school strain so I really caught my attention so that's why I kind of wanted to get it the oil is really really thick guys she does not move at all so it's it's not life resin it says triple distillate so it must be some pretty you know clean clean distillate some people say dis list not to move now you know a lot of resins a new wave well it kind of is you know there's a lot of companies coming out with live resin so I don't know I mean this still is still good you know don't get me wrong it's still good just depends what kind of distillate you guys get from so we're gonna try hit this and we're gonna see what it tastes like all right off the bat you can taste those lemons man it is really good wow that's just fire I didn't just let me give you guys a little close-up again before I smoked a [ __ ] out of this cartridge it says bloom on there and this is the SL H for super Lemon Haze on the side and you got your California sticker there which is pretty dub so we headed up connected the little magnet right here for the yoke and battery you guys need to get one of these joke cows and other monsters had it for like almost two years already you know it's still hits like if I just pull it out the Box you know so we're just gonna throw it in there and cheers guys if you got smoke along with me go ahead and do so man we're about a good fake right now Wow I'm gonna be honest with you guys this cartridge does not taste like distillate it tastes more like a it tastes like really cleaned lemons no fresh like it's just fire its [ __ ] guys I didn't really expect it to be that good you know for some distillate bloom bloom Farms are pretty far man I'm going to hit her again I'm see if I can get a bigger bigger cloud oh yeah definitely you get lemons you know Wow so if you guys you guys let me know like what's the price on these bloom cartridges some people told me to have fakes you know so I don't know whether what to tell the difference like I said but you guys have these around where you guys from what's the price on these I got him prepared for like $38 with tax so it's not as bad so you guys don't pass this up man I'm at the [ __ ] again she's pretty good you know it tastes like actual lemons like it'll taste fake or nothing like that tastes like some actual terpene and definitely one of my favorite cartridges so far from bloom farm I haven't tried I haven't tried any other ones besides this one and the GDP one the GDP one was really good as well you know it tastes like actual granddaddy but but this was pretty far guys and if you guys ever see this super Lemon Haze you guys gotta try them out you know for the price $38 well it depends on where you guys from but here where I'm from it's pretty cheating but this is California but yeah guys I'm uh gonna head out good like I said I'm go to my dispensary and picked up some weed and tied to a hot box video or something let me know in the comment section what kind of cartridges and what kind of videos you guys like to see that I mean cuz I do what you guys want to see but you guys just gotta let me know in the comment section and really appreciate you guys watching my videos and don't forget to add the snapchat and just hit me up you know you guys have any questions and you guys have a really good day and you guys stay safe my

this is the v15 the Android gold and so those are the three top airflow cartridges that we have and this is one of the reasons the no leaking is one of the reasons these cartridges are so popular because no matter what type of oil you have it's not going to leak because of the fact I mean it could leak to the top if you turn it upside down and then you you know force it but in general these are no leak so that way if you're not ready to do your testing and don't want to go through the testing and finding yourself the perfect cartridge this is also one of the good starter cartridges - so if you guys making your own oil or if you guys are trying something out for the first time you know these are really great to start off with because you can have different consistencies and it's not going to leak because it's top air flow okay if you guys have any other questions don't forget to subscribe hit the bell to get notified of the new episodes and CHC vapor view when it comes out if you have any questions let us know it's elegant oh we're calm thanks guys [Music] think about it [Music] you", "2ZElSMBrXpo": "hey guys what's up welcome back to my\nchannel so in this video I'm gonna review a couple of products gonna be\ntalking about this vape cartridge from VidaCann which is a newish new\ndispensary here in the state of Florida this teeny tiny little vape battery like\ncompared to the Yocan UNI - I mean I love the Yocan UNI - this is what I\nuse all the time BUT if you want one that's really REALLY small keep watching. And then guys, at the end of the video, we're gonna have a little Q&A moment so\nI can answer some of the questions that I got from you guys recently when I\nasked you if there was anything you wanted to ask me and a lot of you were\nlike yeah well I think like 10 of you really yeah so but we're gonna do a\nlittle Q&A session at the end and I hope you guys like it also really quick I'm\njust gonna give you this disclaimer about the future of my channel I think\nthis is what we're gonna do moving forward feel like I've done a lot of\nproduct reviews ok I've done a lot of reviews like a lot of products a lot of\ncompanies a lot of reviews I'm thinking about going back to basics a little bit\nand not focusing so much on specific products but maybe more so talking about\nlike what it's like being a medical marijuana patient in Florida why do I\nuse medical marijuana how did you get your medical marijuana card in Florida\nthings like that so let me know what you think about that in the comments let me\nknow if you have any input on that let's get into this video ok guys\nso let's talk about this I'm gonna pray that I can say this right tikkun olam\ntikkun olam vape cartridge in the Alaska strain which is a sativa strain from\nvitae can and this is my first time buying from vitae can so let's talk\nabout what I liked about this a cartridge but let's start out with just\na little bit of information about the product from their website that we\nalready know about the product things to note about the vitae can beat cartridges\nthey're made with a co2 extraction method they're without any cutting agent\nso there's no MCT oil in there it's gonna be highly potent this is a 1\nmilliliter cart with 800 milligrams of THC which leads me to think it's about\n80 percent THC approximately I couldn't find an exact percentage for what this\nparticular batch of Bergers was but I think it's gonna be around 80 percents\n800 milligrams THC in a 1 gram or 1 milliliter cartridge can in addition to\nhaving no cutting agent these guys also have cannabis drive to terpenes\neverybody loves cannabis drive terpenes so that is exciting tell your mom tell\nyour friends also tell everyone you know there is a serious first-time deal\nif by it again it's such a good deal $55 off your first purchase as well as first\ntime free delivery can't be that right so let's talk about its taste and the\nfacts in everything like that this is an 80 percent THC cartridge or\napproximately 80 percent THC so it's pretty high it's pretty intense\nexpect euphoric effects you're gonna get lighten it's an 80 percent THC dose so\nbe careful especially preview with this but I found that I really liked this one\nit really does have a true achieve a sort of effect for me anyway it's called\nthe Alaska strain yes tikkun makes their own kind of strains\nwhich is cool but yeah it gave me more of an uplifted effect more of a sativa\nlike clear-headed effect and the taste and smell of this eight cartridge was\nsuper super natural it was it's just natural tasting I was expecting to taste\nmore of like a lemony limonene pine taste or something but it like it was\njust like super mild super super natural very natural it's a really natural taste\nand I love the taste of this thing it tastes very natural it's made with a co2\nextraction nothing like I said before as cannabis drive tripping mortgage a sport\nand you can get this one gram bait cartridge for like fifty five dollars if\nyou use the first time discount with vitae camp\nit's normally $110 I've had mine for about one week actually not exactly a\nweek now and this is where we are this is where we're at\nmy oil comes up to about here and it was fully filled when I got it it was filled\nto the top so now let's talk about this teeny tiny beet battery really quick\nbecause it is something else just tiny little vape battery that is so small and\nit actually looks like a little teddy bear I never liked a polar bear and I\ndon't know how to feel about that part of things it's kind of so cute that it\nfreaks me out so this is the lucky bear vape battery and it is so tiny it's less\nthan two inches long and if you remember the Uni battery I mean there are things\nthat the Uni has that this guy does not have but this thing is a lot smaller\nthan the Uni like look at the difference there I mean this is a battery this is\nthe whole battery so if we put our bait cartridge in here\nthis whole thing is so small so lightweight it's crazy so it only has\none heat setting the thing about this battery and the reason why I reviewed it\nis it has one really cool thing about it the one really cool thing about it is\nthat it is so small so it's the smallest to make battery that I've ever seen in\nthis kind of shape or at all I think it's really tiny if for some reason you\nwant a tiny tiny tiny date battery then I would definitely argue in the atman\nlucky berry it's so small if you don't like this little string thing - you\ncould probably just cut that off and I'll see why not like you just cut it\nreally close to where it attaches to the bear I don't really love it personally\nI'm not crazy about it at the same time I can see how it could be useful mean if\nyou're on the go and you need a really really small video battery and yours on\nthe go or whatever you might like this thing and I honestly think the pink\ncolors really cute there's a pink there's a white I think there's a black\nso check it out I'll put the link in the description definitely works with this\nand any 510 voted cartridge will work with the lucky bear let's get started on this part of video\nwhich is the Q&A section of the video all right guys so let me jump into these\nquestions that you guys had for me when I asked if there's anything that you\nguys wanted to know and if I skip over one of the ones that you asked go back\nto that post and check the by replied because I might reply to some of them on\nthere instead of in the video so someone basically asked if I found that vaping\nherb is faster or more effective for me with finding relief for my symptoms so I\nwould say it's not necessarily faster I don't know see I like to smoke my loose\nflower like I like to smoke my weed when I have it I don't really vape it too\nmuch I do have a little handheld vaporizer that I like but I hardly ever\nuse it it's just more I guess it's more like familiar for me to just smoke out\nof my bong or my pipe or something but that's what I do with my loose flower as\nfar as the question about any recommendations on affordable dry herb\nvaporizers I definitely invite anyone watching to give your two cents in the\ncomments because I don't really have a lot of experience with dry air\nvaporizers but I really liked this one called the high-low from white rhino I\ndo feel like the loose flower affects me differently than any of the bait\ncartridges or vape pens that I've used it's just a different experience smoking\nthan using the marijuana concentrate concentrates are just not the same as\nflower although they can be a lot stronger with THC I definitely say\nsmoking cannabis or using whole flower cannabis different experience from using\nany kind of vaping or cannabis oil I don't want to say it's necessarily\nfaster or more effective but like it's different so it could be more effective\nfor you I would think and someone asked me how hard is it to find how hard is it\nto find a job as a medical marijuana patient well I have trouble finding one\nif I'm using cannabis so it's illicit you can definitely still get a job a job\nif you're using cannabis like it just depends on what that job is and there's\ngonna be a lot of different factors that play into like whether you do or don't\nget a job and you use medical cannabis it all depends on a number of different\nfactors it depends on what kind of job you're trying to get whether or not that\nparticular company drug tests whether or not this company makes exceptions for\npatients that are using medical cannabis like and it's hard to find that out\nsometimes and you don't always want to ask that on the one hand it's a more\ndifficult and mentally difficult emotionally\ndifficult process because you do have to kind of ask yourself do I want to bring\nthis up and the interview do I want to mention it to them it's a good question\nfor me because I am not only a medical marijuana patient but obviously I post\nthese videos on the Internet so that makes me nervous sometimes when\nI go into job interviews right now I'm pursuing a job that is in the cannabis\nfield so more about that later guys if I get this job I'll let you know but we'll\nsee but yeah so it hasn't really hurt me yet\nI guess my short answer for that is it can be harder but it's possible you ever\nused cannabis before becoming a medical marijuana patient that is such a good\nquestion and yes but not really as much as you might think I'm pretty new to it\nin the sense that I dabbled in it when I was in it the first time I ever smoked\njust probably when I was like 16 or so when I was 17 I had like a stoner phase\nI was smoking quite a bit quite often those bored and I just wanted to when I\nwas like 17 I had a big stoner phase kind of gave it up when I was 18 to 19\nand one thing was I started to feel like every time I smoked any time any time I\nsmoked weed it would just make me feel anxious and make me feel uncomfortable\nand make me feel socially awkward so I kind of just stopped because of that I\nthought I just can't smoke weed like I'm just one of these people that just gets\nanxiety and I don't get the chilled out thing that other people get I react\ndifferently I get I get really anxious and I get really stressed out and I get\nself-conscious and I hate it so for a long time I didn't smoke between lines\nbetween the years of like my life that I was 18 and then up until I was like 23 I\ndidn't pick it back up until I became a medical marijuana patient basically so I\nwas starting to be dabble in and again and then I found out that you could\nbecome a medical marijuana patient and I was like that's perfect for me because I\ndon't really want to go and buy it from a dealer I don't really want to get in trouble\nwhy not just do it legally so yeah so that's how we got to this point I might\njust do one more question because there's a couple left I don't want to do\nall of these on cam I have other stuff I need to get done and I need to edit this\none and pose to it so let's just do one more did you have to have a long history\nof medical records to apply um so it I have to have a history of medical\nrecords I'm not sure if I could have gotten it without any medical records\nbut did I have to have a long history of medical records do not really know I\nused my records from my psychiatrist my psychiatrist I've been seeing sense I\nthink 2016 or 2017 so wasn't really that long but that doctor is who I've been\nseeing to move to where I live now and those documents supported the symptoms\nthat I was describing to my medical marijuana doctor and I believe that\nhelped her to allow me to be able to use medical marijuana so I definitely highly\nrecommend trying to get any documentation that you can of any\nanything pointing to your qualifying condition that's gonna allow your\ncannabis recommendation um get any of that documentation together ahead of\ntime before your first medical marijuana doctor appointment bring it with you or\nif you need to you can have your medical marijuana doctor usually or I have mine\nanyway ask for it from your doctor if you give them your doctor's information\nthey can usually do that amongst themselves but it helps and makes it\nfaster if you bring your documents with you so if you have anything bring it\nwith anyway guys I'm gonna finish answering the rest of your questions\nback over on that text post that I made before sorry that I didn't get to all of\nthem but I did have to fit in a couple of you know different things in this\nvideo so I'll catch you guys in the next one and like I said things are gonna get\na little bit different for just a second not a whole lot different but it's gonna\nget more generalized like I don't really want to do too many specific product\nreviews because I feel like we've kind of just done that and we're not it's\njust not really that exciting anymore for me so I wanted to do something else\nit's gonna keep me more interested and challenged and I still want to be able\nto help you guys and give helpful advice to anybody out there who's looking\nfind out more about medical marijuana in Florida so I'll keep you guys posted and\nI'll see you guys in the next video and thanks for watching this one if you\nliked it don't forget to hit the thumbs up thank you bye", "hdQt-Ej-2Ho": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with tokentim420 this is a florida medical marijuana review for those over the age of 18 and medical marijuana patients all right like say hi to everybody out there if you haven't subscribed hit that subscribe button down there leave me a thumbs up thumbs down let me know how you're feeling tonight what you're smoking on token on what you're moved in um so today we got the token tim's mad scientist lab we are going to be making some rosin vape carts on our own save a lot of money um i will like give a shout out real quick um i got some of that girl scout cookie now this stuff was only coming in at 15 it was minnie's i couldn't see that online um and i'm not a fan of girl scouts but this stuff totally changed my mind this stuff's real good um nice flavor to it nice high to it not quite a sativity ah as sativa leaning as the last stuff i've had that was the girl scout cookie so like i said not bad at all all right so we're gonna make our own rosin vape carts now you guys know i've tried true leaves i just went and got another one we got the skunk ape blue river rosin we tried both of them for cure leaf i left the other box in there from the select um some people was asking if this was live resin or not to me it didn't really taste like that tastes more like the terpene like the cannabis infused terpene vape pens exactly like them so if you could find those vape pens cheaper i'd go with them but we're going to show you a way to do it real cheap and i tell you what they taste amazing all right so we squirted a little distillate in there i got i was trying some of them i got a little tore up had to take a break my water cooled off so it didn't work so this is take two on the video honestly um that's that papaya cake rosin from move or from true leave sorry um in there and then the distillate we're using because it's an indica uh the indica uh bubba kush coming at 78 percent so all i did was microwave some water and a shot glass put it in there you don't want to get it up past the stopper there you don't want to get back in there i want to get this part done before it cools off again so there was probably about three left in here on this syringe it's got a little bubble but it was about at three i put a little bit in there already so when it's warmed up it's just gonna go real easy in there yeah i guess we're gonna use all of it all right that's all of it are all that we're gonna mess with getting out at the moment now if you notice the pad i'm using is that five dollar baking sheet which is silicone so it's the same thing as a dab mat that i got on amazon it was like five bucks or two for five i can't remember videos if you go back as while back i just cut a piece off to fit the table so i didn't have to clean the whole table off so now all we're going to do is we're going to take this and we're going to mix it up now i have made a few of these before i did warm the rosin up on the one and then by time i got out here it was just kind of like a hardened back up more like a caramel just letting it sit out at room temperature seems to work better let me pull it off the view for a second and make sure i got it mixed evenly sometimes the distillate wants to stay on the side but as you know the rosin carts are about 60 bucks apiece and they're only half grams so this distillate i believe was 60 bucks from grow healthy which truly has them for 60 most everybody's around the 60 mark for a full gram so this right here will fill two vape carts um and then the rosin's uh 75 gram so you basically for 135 you're getting two grams um which you would only get one gram buying it by the vape cards like i said these are half gram vape carbs these aren't full grams only half grams if you also notice on true leaves the thc is always really low i'm using 80 distillate and 80 um rosin so these are still up in the 80 percent so we're gonna use our um we had some la confidential co2 cart which i got another one of these so we will be reviewing it later then all we're going to do is unscrew the top here now i will say that it helps to have a decent dab tool the dab tool i'm using is the one i got for five dollars uh from banger supply and if you use code token tim you'll save 10 at banger supply they got these for like 5.99 so try to keep it up here in the camera see what we can do so mainly what we're going to do is we're going to take the flatter end um or either end the flatter end kind of works better towards the end and we're just going to get a glob out there like that this stuff's stringy and looking in the camera is a pain in the butt all right we'll hold that there and then what i do is just press it around the stem and then put it down in there so let me go over here and do this where you guys can still see it but yeah you guys can see it there now i'm gonna go ahead and use the flat end just kind of scoop out a big scoop like that and then smooth on that thing and it's easier just to push it right down in there you guys can see that just kind of pushing it down now it doesn't go real good um so there is a trick we'll use here in a second once we get it pretty blobbed up all right trying to it's hard for me to focus i need new glasses so i keep pulling it off the frame to me to be able to see it now i'm just scraping all the gunk out of the jar real good i'm gonna do the same thing i'm gonna go over to a clear spot each time and just wipe it off on that and then take the tool focus there we go and slide it down that thing it's not wanting to focus if it does go on the outside just scoop it back up all right we've got about all of it now the first one i tried to wait for it to go down and it just didn't seem to go down quick enough so i'm gonna take a little torch and i'm gonna heat the glass down in here i'm not gonna heat the concentrate i'm just gonna do it like that without burning my fingers off hopefully so i'm just going to slightly warm the glass going around you can see it's starting to drip there where we warmed it up so just real quick that one bubbled on me and then it starts to it'll just start to run down in there then go ahead and take the tool and access there's a little bubble there we're going to pop that scrape all that off on there try not to get it inside there for sure we've already got it about half full it doesn't take a lot um a lot of concentrate that is you can see i only had about three in that syringe and i only put a couple dabs in there it really wasn't a lot so again we're going to take a little bit sometimes with this i can just scrape it right across the glass or like i said just roll it around that and whatever's left there the mouthpiece fits real tight over that silicone ring and it just pushes everything else down let's get a real good scrape on this jar real quick and then i'll show you the other ones i made and talk about them a little bit now i will say the flavor on this stuff is just amazing it tastes just like just like doing the dab let's scrape this off of there real quick all right now i could play around and get some more out there but i want with you guys i'll just dab that out with my dab straw later so we're going to stick that on see how it just squishes that on through there and we're going to screw that on now i found with some of them you'll have to go back again with your torch and this one's a little thicker you can see it's still thick so i'm just barely going to heat it if it starts to bubble you want to quit so i have to look at this real good and it'll take a second for the heat to transfer through to the glass still a little creamy there's still some up there at the top there we go this one must be a little thicker glass than the other one i had we're just going to hit it a few times now if you notice when we did that it kind of cleared up a little bit not a lot but so you can see the little holes down in there now where the wick is you'll see how that cleared it up some and i didn't bring the battery out i told you i got pretty medicated all right but we have made a few other ones um so i made one yeah this is it i used the move vape pen and this it worked great for about two days and the battery died and if you can see right here at the bottom it's got little um holes i thought i could take it off with a battery i grabbed it with some pliers and apparently i couldn't so i shattered it what i'm going to do is unscrew the lid i'm not going to do it now because i want the glass to fall off and then i'm going to heat the banger up and i'm going to put it in there upside down like that and just let all that wax come out now this was the um i used the skunk ape and the bubba kush um the skunk ache ape was from move or true leave again sorry i don't know i got move on the head now i did put some of the thca powder in that one also and it was really really really tasty tasted just like the skunk ape tastes a lot better than the skunk ape rosin car which we'll get we'll have a video on that later but like i said really really really tasty um and the thc is going to be up there and it's a cheaper cheaper thing so i'll show you the other one i did but first we got to do it sorry it's alive all right so i did make a live resin vape cart um this is with moves rainbow train wreck and you can see how it's cleared up a little bit more i hit it with a little bit more of the torch um but it tastes amazing there's a little clog there that's why heated this one up it was clogging a little bit but man it tastes amazing and the high on there i'm telling you the high is better than any of these vape pens i've had yet and i gotta write what i put on this one so i don't forget that's the rainbow train wreck which we know it's live rosin because that's all there is um but the skunk ape one i'm telling you you know vape card even these i hit these um you know 10 good hits off of them to catch a little buzz um i was only hitting that skunk ape three three little hits and i was blasted i the dying i made that i rolled up a joint um and after my three hits i had like this much left of the joint and i looked at that i'm like hey no way i'm lighting that thing back up so it tore me up pretty good so if you guys want to give it a try like it's not really messy you do have a little bit of residue left in these so you could either take a bud and roll it around in there and then roll in some keep and make your own moon rock or you could just take your dab straw and hit it you could also take a hair dryer and melt it down so it would get it in a corner better to get a little better dab out of it but if i mess around with it with like this one that has that little scoop on the end i can pretty much get everything out of that jar there won't be anything left and especially it's starting to cool off now because it's getting ready to rain here but especially when i'm working in a hot garage and it pretty much stays warm here anyways it makes it easier to work with it's not coming back up so it's easier like i said just to push push it all the way around to the corners i just take this one the longer straighter one and get the sides like that and what i'll do with this is dab it that's what i do with the other stuff that's why i mark the charge but i think it rub keeps rubbing off with my fingers so that one's uh we just made the papaya cake so that was this one we're just gonna put a pea on the jar so i remember but yeah that's what i'll just use when i come out tonight i'll scrape that again you can see like i said i just got that little bit i wiped off on the edge there just by taking it around a little bit and just keep scraping it back on the side and then when you get enough to take a dab you just take it all off of there and dab away and like i said with the other with the rounded one it works a little better getting everything out there real good this one's not bad but the other one's better so like i said it doesn't take long to get you a dab and then just drop the dab tool in the dab rig and you're good so that's my take on making my own vape cards um the live resin i did use the co2 true clear the sherbert so i figured it'd have a nice cleaner flavor but this stuff here wasn't bad um i haven't tried this one i just made yet of course i didn't bring the battery out um but i used it with a skunk 8 but that skunk cape's got such a strong skunky um smell to it it's hard to for anything else to come through so we'll see if anything comes through on this one but like i said the thca powder worked great in there too it didn't clog that one up that one worked you know it was almost all the way full and you can tell see there's not much left in there i smoked over half of it in a couple days it was so tasty and like i said the battery just quit on me so i don't recommend refilling those the reason i refilled this one and like i said we got it filled with just that little bit i didn't use a lot i'll show you how much i used on that um but this one's got the charging port on the bottom so hopefully we can recharge it when it does die now i only use this was a full gram i did lick a little bit and but pretty much i just used two i pushed it from where it was at the one to maybe just past the eight so maybe three milliliters of this stuff but closer to probably the two because it did fill that pin up and it's only 300 milligrams so like i said it didn't take much of this to fill that vape in and i did dab a little bit in my mouth dabbed a little bit in the banger just to try it the flavor wasn't bad the banger wasn't real clean so i couldn't get a good flavor on it so we'll save that for a review hopefully too well that's going to be it guys if you have any questions just leave them down there in the comments like i said this is an easy way you could also just put the distillate straight into the vape pen without the rosin and just make a bait pin that's what pretty much they're using is distillate but like i said with just a little bit of that rosin it makes it a real good flavor so you don't need a lot of that even you could probably just put maybe two little dabs in there mix it around put one in there see how you like it next time add more if you need to but like i said they tore me up good so i definitely recommend those of you who are feeling your own give this a shot let me know what you think of it that's going to be it guys we do got some more videos coming tomorrow we got a delivery coming and then we'll also do what's new in the florida mmj we got some new things

keep on toking my friends", "QHUzBlDY0CQ": "[Music] what's up professor G the hemp man today we got a special treat we're looking at these new CBD distill it be bait cartridges from black tie CBD no terpenes or cutting agents have been added to this at all they're nice jupiter-c sell cartridges and they also offer a really nice battery it's a self-drawn o button and it holds a great charge it's pretty good I don't mind it I generally hate non push buttons but this battery works for me it comes in a full gram cartridge and right now I believe they're 49.99 and we offer an exclusive discount code through the hemp bud form its hemp bud forum and I believe that will save you 10% off your entire order at black ties [Music] so if you've ever tried distill it it's got that distilling flavor but it also has some natural or carring terpenes in it that were present in the hemp that was used to make the distiller just distill it by itself does taste sorta bad so if you're not familiar with what purity to distill it tastes like unflavored sort of like burnt rubber maybe a cache bowl just generally just kind of gross ish this has a nice herbal base a bit of pine hints of lemon citrus notes pie a little bit of distill if not terrible tasting not the best tasting cartridge around the effects are fantastic as it's pure distill it at 60% CBD full-spectrum all the other cannabinoids are present including a small amount of THC I believe the effects for me are just spot-on with what a good full-spectrum CBD does it calms me relaxes me slows the anxiety down that I fail relieves tension generally in my body that's what I use CBD for and these effects come on instantly as do most vaping products for me and I would find this particular cartridge to be a hair on the night time you can't I wouldn't reach for this during the day for whatever reason so that mellows me out nighttime cartridge hit me with the comment below if you've tried these let me know what you think peace [Music] [Music]", "-gdysmn5LEE": "well Aloha brothers and sisters welcome back to the channel it's your man Kimo back to do another review for all you cannabis enthusiasts and connoisseurs out there this time I've got a 5-10 thread of a cartridge coming to you from Palmetto cannabis that's sundial cannabis company it's agent orange it's a sativa hybrid stream it's coming in at 800 milligrams THC and one point two six milligrams of CBD so that's about 80% THC and less than a percent CBD so it's gonna be a high THC heavy-hitting cartridge really excited when I bought this I'm gonna admit I cheated a little bit I did buy it a few days ago and I was excited to try to open it up I've been faking it the last few days stuck it back in the cart in the container here to show you the package I'm gonna hate this packaging it's awful I'll show you on the front it shows to open the package you push it on the sides and you push open the top it's easier said than done like I was pushing pushing pushing I'm glad I didn't record the initial truck time I opened this package because it was real futile effort took me a while but after a while I just find out that usually if you play enough pressure on the sides and push in and pop you can open this packaging is horrible I can't stand the packaging and then when you do open it up you got your car to gene there it's nestled nice and safe away in this foam little cutout but it's straight through for me because you want the orientation of your cartridge to be upright and by having it designed in here you know this is probably gonna sit on the shelf like this or like this and your oils gonna be you know on the side it's gonna potentially clog or plummet your device not a cool design choice Palmetto I don't like that at all you know and strike three for me is this packaging big hard plastic and flung away what do you need all this packaging for this little device I don't like it you know it's it's horrible to me so packaging no good Paul metal so once you open it up though you do get this lovely little cartridge hopefully that's coming in nice and clear you see it says Agent Orange on the bottom and what I think is a really cool retro font I'd it the big bold letters you see the oil in there it is pretty dark doesn't move around a lot as you can see I've aped a lot of this the last few days it's a little dark almost kind of orange I'm wondering if the glass is actually tinted orange to go with the whole Agent Orange vibe I don't know let's get these rubber nubs off here with a mouthpiece condom get the battery put it on we're gonna vape a little bit here I've been vaping a lot of this I got some opinions on it but let's just take a rip right now as you can see is not a lot of vapor production it's not like a lot but it's enough gets the job done it is a little harsh so you can tell you're taking a drag that's one of the downsides to it after about four or five drags it gets a little harsh on the throat and I have coughed a little bit using this over the last few days but the taste you do get you're expecting orange oh you're expecting well Agent Orange gonna be citrusy orange II yeah not so much there's a little bit of a citrusy orange on the inhale and on the exhale it's a little tiny bit is there but it's mostly a kind of spicy peppery flavor cannabis flavor mixed in with the orange so it's a little bit sick you see with kind of spicy on the inhale on the exhale you lose a little of citrus and it's mostly just kind of a spicy peppery flavor it's not bad it's just not orange or really citrusy it's alright but like I said it's a little harsh so if you're going if you're really reefing on it you could COFF a little bit and you might feel a little irritation in your throat that's kind of the negatives the positives are the effects this this hits really good I find it to be a bit of a creeper strain don't really notice the effects for about 10-15 minutes and then all of a sudden you feel a Deadhead band effect come on and it comes down over and your smile comes up and I travels down your body and you feel energized and focused though like it's a really clear high you feel really focused and clear but you feel kind of happy and just like an overall general mood you're not really hi you got a bit of a headband effect but you're really focused and clear and just happy and conversational sociable it's a good get things done strains 50 times training good wakey bait string good any time stream however I will say that if you really refine it it kind of overdo it a bit start getting into you know quite a number of drags when the effects do kind of start to take over they're pretty intense at first and you know they wear off after a few minutes and they they develop into that sort of really focused clear high but you can make this pretty intense high it's kind of fun if you really want a refund get a little stone this is a great anytime babe because like I said it does dissipate into sort of a clear head in it you know certified so you're not all stony all day this this is great anytime Cape I would recommend it it's a good value it's forty five bucks I paid for it and you know it's point five grams it's gonna go about as far as any other 510 0.5 gram cartridge out there it depends on the use depends on your mileage mileage berries with you know how much you use it in your experience so thumbs up I recommend it I really like a good job Palmetto cannabis changing down packaging I can't stand your packaging I really like your cartridge I really like your oil I really like the Agent Orange pick it up if you see it it's a good deal that's the end of the review hope you all liked it leave me a comment let me know what you think that he tried it

510 cartridge for this review we've got phyto extracts fire stick 2.0 it's their pink kush dislip pen i'm really excited to try this out and see how it does y'all let's get into it we'll see on the other side when we're tapping off the little bit of info that's on here before we get into the full on urban scale see on the other side cheers welcome back you guys so as i said in the intro we are tapping into fido extracts pink kush 510 cartridge so this sucker came in with a thc total of 79.1 percent it's got zero cbd in it and it was packaged on the 15th of may 2020 i'm just gonna start pulling it apart while we're chatting through the information so we've got the lift and co website pulled up with this information you guys so we'll uh run all that off before we tap into this beautiful looking car so we've got pink kush 510 cartridge pink kush is an indica dominant hybrid that much like it's close relative og kush delivers a sweet aroma accompanied by a distinct herbal taste these point five gram distillate cartridges are made from food grade all natural terpenes with zero fillers and additives it contains 75 to 85 thc and no cbd we use top of the line c cell cartridges that features a ceramic heating element when filled this heating element absorbs up to 0.15 milliliter of the 0.5 mil of oil contained in the cartridge this can lead to the appearance of a head space at the top of the cartridge each of our cartridges are auto filled by weight to ensure that you receive exactly 0.5 of oil with 100 accuracy we need to get that thc sticker off there so we'll throw that on the torch while we uh rattle off the oh they don't have any more information you guys so uh i'm going to stick this on the torch while we uh do the urban scale intro and then we'll tap into this cartridge y'all cheers and i'll see on the other side of this intro [Music] welcome back you guys so we've got the pink kush cartridge right here we're gonna get rid of all those silicone dude ads screw this into the fireside battery and start a rocking with this sucker we're going to start out on the lowest temp come on there we go white light starting on the lowest temp we're going to take a rip through there we're going to go up to the medium and then the high try it all the way through there i'll give you a little bit of my thoughts and opinions on it after that and then we will go on into the g pen battery before we put our adapter on here and we start ripping it through a couple of glass pieces that we have here as well you guys i'm really looking forward to seeing how this pink kush hits taste i'm just excited to see how fido did their transition from the dark black gray market into this legal market so uh only way we're gonna find out you guys is by tapping in and finding out so uh let's do that cheers i like the elongated tip on this they're similar to what trailblazer had but it's a longer glass tip and i like that okay so it is kind of a sweet herbal flavor nothing overwhelming nothing really that screams excitement for me but it's definitely one of the better tasting pink kush products i've tried so now we're on that medium temp let's uh take a haul at this level and see what it tastes like here you guys cheers okay guys so got a good herbal push on that one got a little bit of a pepper flavor as well which wasn't disappointing it just wasn't expected i'm i'm liking it now it balances out with that kind of sweet herbal it's but it's not a really overpowering flavor it's strong when you have it in your mouth and when you exhale but it really dissipates quickly after that which is a little bit disappointing for me but still not bad so uh we've got it on the highest temp guys let's take a rip through here see how it does uh before we switch it on over to the g pen cheese yes we moved over to the g pen from that fireside battery i'm only going to give it a 7 out of 10. it had a nice flavor to it but it didn't hit hard enough to hold the flavor and it didn't have a really enjoyable enough flavor to make me want to just keep hauling on it so i have it in my mouth it's it's that good for one hit kind of a high and flavor not necessarily high but it's good for like a one hit it's not really that sugary treat that i'm finding my vape cartridges are really more what that's for they're kind of for that dessert of smoking right i'm i'm done having this harder [ __ ] i'm done smoking that i'm like bong rips and dabs and stuff like this i just want something light to sip on with a really sweet flavor and that's definitely where these come in handy but uh seven out of ten is the best i'm gonna give it for the fire side moving on into the g pen we've got it set on the lowest temperature let's see how it does and taste through here you guys before we move on and rock it through the glass i'm expecting a pretty good outcome from this let's see cheers okay guys we're on that medium level let's see how it does i got almost more of a sour cush kind of push with this it was nice it was really unique for uh the changes from that fireside battery and it's one of the biggest reasons why i like using different batteries you guys because you do get a totally different experience with these and i'm really really enjoying this pink kush so far but got on the medium temp let's tap in and try it out cheers so we've got it on the highest temp you guys okay let's get into this i am feeling this pink kush already which is not something i am used to i haven't had a pink cush strain hit hard and have a really good high for me like ever the flower just it's a strain that doesn't really do much so this this this pens got me excited you guys so we've got on the highest temp let's see how it does through here before we uh move on and give it a score on that medium level i still got that kind of sour kush taste which i enjoyed i'm i'm not upset with that kind of sour dank cushy flavor but uh let's see if the high temp does the same thing you guys cheers okay guys so i'm gonna give the g pen made out of a tent it had just a little bit more of that kind of sour cushy flavor that i do really enjoy and definitely look forward to when i'm smoking these kind of these kind of carts this pink kush is definitely uh something that's caught me off guard you guys and i'm really looking forward to seeing how it's gonna taste to the glass but uh we've got we are a mad bell here a little mad hatter bell we've got the fireside battery ready to go we are starting out at the lowest temp again working our way up to the high we do preheat on our high temp only because why not so uh yeah i think that's all the info we need y'all let's start doing this i'll see on the other side of these uh these three rips cheers last two let's preheat it y'all [Music] okay guys we're back on the g pen we've got a 420 rig we're gonna tap into this and uh see how this pen does you guys i'm uh definitely looking forward to um seeing the flavor on it but uh the only way we can find out how it does is by finding out how it is low tam first medium then we preheat on the high just like that last bit get to y'all cheers [Music] last rip y'all cheers preheat it sink okay guys so i'm gonna give it an eight out of a ten from the glass had definitely that sweeter flavor that i was looking for um it did end up being a little bit harsher than i was expecting through the rig so that's why it's not quite the nine like it had the potential for the nine for the intensity of the flavor that was there but there was a harshness to it that just i didn't quite enjoy um and i bumped it down the point for that but all in all very well put together card for the flavor on the glass through the just sucking it straight through the vape it was really really nice and i i'm quite impressed honestly overall with this pig kush because i've been nothing but disappointed by it now moving into the high i'm going to give it a 9 out of a 10. the reason the point is docked is easier to explain it doesn't have any body effects it is strictly mental which is what i'm finding the majority of these cards to be is a head high and that's a little bit disappointing for me just because i've heard some really nice and enjoyable body effects that go with this pink kush but i'm just not finding it right now you guys just doesn't quite have it and that's it's a bit of a disappointment for me but there's there's nothing much i can do about it i'm gonna enjoy what i do get out of it which is that really nice heavy head high and overall i i think they did a pretty good job for the high and the flavor you guys moving to the overall with a 32 out of 40 i think it did overall very well um very sweet flavor definitely strong on that side um especially when we got into the glass or through the g pen but that little bit of a peppery harshness to the end when you bump that the temperature up to the highest levels is a touch of a turn off for me and a big reason why it lost at least one point in most of the taste scales and then just the lack of the sweet to comprom to uh to balance it out is typically the other reason why i would uh dock some points but overall you guys this this this cartridge did pretty well and i uh i'm quite impressed uh if you guys have tried it let me know down below what you think if you've tried any of uh phyto extracts cartridges let me know what you think we've had the super lemon hazel one in stock too and i was intrigued to try that one but uh the pink kush was definitely the one i think i needed to try first just to get a basis of where fido wanted to run with it and they they took a hell of a good run in my opinion you guys but uh let's drop this sucker up

guys clicked on this video makes you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose we do not condone the usage of these products and we do not sell anything on this channel in the cut welcome back everybody to a brand video today yeah again we got actually a brand new brand that I've actually came across on ease before and I've actually you know I've wanted to review it for actually some time now again everybody this is an 18mm educational purpose podcast it's a review I don't condone the usage of these products nor I do not try to boost to sell these products and also we do not sell anything on this channel and again everything here is legal offer 18 and up at cannabis patients you guys are enormous good so today ladies and gentlemen we got a brand new brand to a review it's the old pal brand so I'm not promoting this product or anything like that this is just literally just a review I actually got this full gram $35 crazy huh we got some sativa check this out right here look there's actually some old pal this is actually from 510 which I believe is Oakland I think this is actually a local you know I think this company is actually in the bay keep that out and this is actually the cosmic sativa flavor it's a full sativa you know it has about eighty percent THC which is actually pretty [ __ ] good again everybody this is a $35 gram believe it or not I actually bought this and freaking off off ease and you guys already know man ease sometimes we kind of tax it check the [ __ ] out quick little test want to show you guys that this [ __ ] is look at that stuck for sure no hot water first hit now you lie you guys every time I take the first hit of this cartridge whoa I get laid man I feel this [ __ ] it's a sativa so usually before my morning my morning job you know I wake up take a couple puffs and I go go over to my morning driving [ __ ] you know and 9:00 I'll have one or two puffs literally just leaves me faint like I can already feel it right now I haven't even smoked today today I literally just skipped earlier today I don't really smoke just because I want to make sure I do these reviews with starting with sober but yeah look one thing I really do like about this product again I bought this off ease actually I got to 2 grams for the total price of $70 that includes taxes and delivery so I'm just like dude if this was a $35 full gram imagine if you actually go to like the legit old pal warehouse or whatever they're actually selling these and you buy you buy some stuff so I don't think I've ever seen these you know in the club but sometimes I'm like hmm that's very interesting it's a classic shareable cannabis oil cartridge this is shareable and it definitely is shareable because for the price and again a lot of people are gonna say oh it's fake it's just not no this is not fake this is I legit got this from the east service and they're for sure they're approved they're completely legal and it's not no neighborhood plug this ain't no neighborhood plug [ __ ] so it's crazy if a neighborhood plug [ __ ] is trying to sell you a [ __ ] for gram for like dirty dirty like $30 do that shit's fake as [ __ ] I smoked them before we actually reviewed up a car to do the super Lemon Haze one of my boys got with cool little fake cartridge or whatever and you got it for like pretty expensive but usually if you guys get this from like a a delivery service but it has to be legit though cuz I feel like some there are a couple like delivery services that are just not legit thought a homemade [ __ ] that could might not be healthy for you but please look I don't know if this is true or not I've heard this from a friend that's like a late punch tastes really good too um but I've heard that smoking like I guess fake cartridges or I don't even know if I even talked about but I'm pretty sure it's fake cartridges I guess there was like a youtuber like a weed youtuber some guy that made videos dude I'm pretty sure I don't know where the hell here is this drummer I don't know where it came from or I just don't I don't know but I believe in the obviously you know because it could have been fake cards but I guess like someone passed away from like smoking cartridges and I'm like dude I'm pretty sure it's not gonna be no [ __ ] cannabis you know like legal cartridges had to be some like fake [ __ ] you know I do know someone that bought like four cartridges for like the [ __ ] low and then with fake as [ __ ] dude like there was straight-up hot dog water personally me I know a lot of people that actually do like the old pal they like it because one so I don't think [ __ ] you know proof let's prove it right here look at that that should go it even has a little little sticker we are in California completely illegal dude and this [ __ ] gets you [ __ ] blasted i've only took like what like three four ribs and i'm ready list [ __ ] man but i really do i honestly everybody I appreciate everybody that our clinic everyone that's clicking on these videos man I appreciate you guys so much man because if you guys don't know I do have a main channel and I used to blog and like do pranks and all that [ __ ] back days ago days ago I used to do I gave me videos but that channel is just so mixed up with so much [ __ ] content random content that I got to the point where like I took a break and it just like dinah fell off I'm gonna try to revive it I've been trying for a while now you know but I was like you know what I'm gonna move on to something a little bit more different something a little bit you know like an educational type video if that makes sense so yeah but if you guys want to go check that [ __ ] out go down on my description it's my main channel 120 k subs you know and I actually reached 120 case subs like back like three oh [ __ ] it's gonna be almost four years ago back in like 2016 could've been I got a million right now [ __ ] up but hey [ __ ] have this for a reason right [Music] [Music] like I do appreciate everybody that's clicking on this cuz I know YouTube doesn't like cannabis videos and educational kind of this videos and [ __ ] but I do see that there's a [ __ ] large community there's a lot of people a lot of of age people that want to just watch you know like smoking videos educational cannabis videos type [ __ ] you know and I'm just like doing YouTube should just have its own little like section for that [ __ ] bro you know it's like I don't even wanna tie these videos if you guys see ads okay I'm telling guys this right now if you guys see ads on these videos it's literally [ __ ] YouTube putting videos and [ __ ] cuz first of all I'm not even [ __ ] partnered to me by the time you guys are watching this I don't think I'm ever gonna get this channel partnered honestly I'm definitely gonna be giving away a lot to like I can't really do like [ __ ] weed giveaway since I can't be like pack you know a shitty [ __ ] you know it's a places where like it might not even be like 100 it's legal but it's like you can't like [ __ ] receive it through the mail type [ __ ] you know like on some Canada [ __ ] it's like that legal [ __ ] hear in Caly it's not legal legal like it's get to the point where you just do it you could [ __ ] just smoke a blunt and a smoking area in some places you know people got bitched cuz let me smoke your cigarettes a bunch of tobacco products that [ __ ] [ __ ] kills you dude straight up it literally has a fat ID label that says this shit's gonna give you cancer and it [ __ ] stinks cuz you're [ __ ] smoking like cardboard a [ __ ] you know no offense to everybody that smokes cigarettes if you guys do your thing do what you got to do but I'm telling you right now that is a bad hat bad [ __ ] habit you know and if you guys switch over to vaping and all that vaping [ __ ] quit that [ __ ] brush it's also bad for you too bro and this cartridge probably bad for this too so I do not recommend any type of smoking but again this is for an educational purpose you know my personal review on this [ __ ] but a real [ __ ] though everybody that's watching this man you guys are first James 2nd Janet no matter man everybody like check this out we all got to go to a [ __ ] struggle like it doesn't matter if it's like the struggle is red if the struggle is blue of distress I don't even know I'm saying if the struggle is a triangle a square [ __ ] lid that made no sense that's the path you know that's for your life and [ __ ] but see if you're trying to grind you guys trying to come up be successful in all that [ __ ] I was gonna be a shitload of obstacles so when something's happening in your life that's part of it you know that's an obstacle you gotta face this [ __ ] to get to where you want to be in [ __ ] but damn it have like these crazy eyes like [ __ ] ideas and everything that I want to say on camera every time I say it I'm just look by the way follow me on Instagram I'm crunchy or go down in my description and go I don't check out all my social media I got Twitter snapchat all that stuff I'm gonna try to convince you guys to just chase your [ __ ] dreams take a jade tastes like it takes your passions like it chase your passion you know because in reality if you guys have a talent either if it's [ __ ] drawing you know [ __ ] writing us you're good at writing stories you're gonna like painting you could you're good at something Here I am not knowing how to [ __ ] explain myself but it's like if you guys have a passion or a talent or a hobby you guys are really [ __ ] good I meant pursue that [ __ ] right because I'm telling you guys right now bro you nowadays bro it's the new this is wearing mm about it be 2020 anything is [ __ ] possible that you could monetize absolutely everything bro [ __ ] what's that kid's name [ __ ] Ryan something to bear such the little kid that reviews [ __ ] toys for YouTube dude if he could do that and earn like [ __ ] close to 100 mice where he got like over 50 million dollars a year bro and income or more maybe like 40 to 50 million after taxes because if you got close to a hundred thousand then probably take like half that [ __ ] or even more um holy [ __ ] dude just from revealing choices so if this kid could review toys and become makers it's [ __ ] more more time like millions of dollars then you guys could [ __ ] monetize everything bro it's like you too bro YouTube is like the perfect way to just show off your personality show off you know your talents and [ __ ] there's a lot of people that could take pictures of cars they go they like you know fix cars or all that shade there's car channels shoes - actually I know David got kicks on in person and he has like he's like a sneaker head you know he [ __ ] he reviews sneakers he paints sneakers he customizes sneakers and [ __ ] like that and he's pretty funny he's a funny guy this dude [ __ ] made YouTube videos and then he [ __ ] all of a sudden from just showing off shoes at him making shoes and all this [ __ ] like customizing shoes and [ __ ] painting them all that [ __ ] he got into an eBay commercial true started by the way and I mean that [ __ ] just sounds like what the [ __ ] oven broke YouTube is like a [ __ ] stepping-stone to like this [ __ ] bro crazy like I'm trying to do that bro cuz I know everybody does not want to live that nine-to-five like [ __ ] that [ __ ] you know but if you guys do I'd beid obviously if you guys make like a couple you know small like six figures and [ __ ] and you guys have like a good job with like the benefits and all of the [ __ ] then I understand you know 9 to 5 is for you but exist you know you worked hard you got to where you wanted to be and [ __ ] and that's what's up you know respect honestly but then there's other people like me bro just [ __ ] hate I just don't like that nine-to-five [ __ ] and it's not that I'm lazy you know it's just that

see you there [Music] what is going on people my name is chillady back at you with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy you know it still has a lot of positive benefits as well though and so i'm thinking if you had seven likes on this video if we get seven likes okay you guys have been [ __ ] killing it bro look look you guys been killing it all right i appreciate all y'all for real we're getting more subscribers i'm trying to hit 50 by let's see what is it september i'm trying to hit 50 at least by the end of october hopefully yeah let's try to do that all right let's get 50 subs bro seven likes we will do a positive review because there are positive things about it i know that i've said that the negatives of it but that's from my personal experience from me trying man let's finish this [ __ ] joint holy [ __ ] [Music] so now i've looked and i found a lot of positive things so hit that seven uh hit that seven light goal boy and we will do another review yeah man that's all i got to say about it this joint is pissing me off much love y'all seven likes do it do it all right go to twitch.tv link will be in the description uh go to my twitter man i'm trying to get my twitter up as well like i want y'all to be able to follow me and know what i'm doing you know know when i'm going to make a video knowing i'm going live you know i always want feedback as well you know i want to talk to you guys too that's always awesome so much love you guys let me know what you guys thought about the video i will see you in the next video be safe peace out [Music] you", "fGwzqng9AOI": "[Music] hey guys dr. Shawn Mira VG here and it's time for another cannabis product review today I'm reviewing good Supply Blue Dream and this is a vape cartridge using the 510 system it's got a lot of good information even just on the box it says our oil what's inside cannabis distill a plant-based terpenes and the terpenes are quite nice in this one no additives which is what I like and premium ceramic core that sounds good anti leaked technology perfect don't want that leaking in direct airflow system alright so already I'm liking this product it's really kind of cool funky green color there's some good easy to read information on the box so this retails for $43 ninety five cents on the Ontario cannabis store it's got 75 to 83 percent THC meaning it's a quite a potent cannabis cartridge there's really no CBD in here it's a sativa dominant hybrid so a little bit about blue dream so blue dream is a really classic strain that originated in California it was made using two strains blueberry which is known for its sort of blueberry flavor owing to a sort of fruity terpene profile and a really classic sativa strain called haze it's so blue dream has been pretty much known for its sort of full body relaxing effects without being sedating now the licensed producer behind good supply is \u00e1free\u00e1 they're basically a giant here in Canada a huge licensed producer with a lot of brands under its name but good quality products I know a froyo well they're out of Leamington Ontario if anyone wanted to know and they pride themselves with this 509 step process which is basically just means there's they take five hundred and nine steps in they're sort of quality assurance program so everything's held up to a really big standard I guess 5:09 really doesn't mean much to the average person but I'm guessing if you went to their plant and they went through the whole system you'd be pretty impressed anyway so that's a little bit of the backstory about this so let's open it up I really like this box it's really cool so you open it up using these tabs so there's two tabs here so if you push them both in and then you can push the inside of the box out so really kind of sleek and cool and good child protective mechanism there and so your cartridge is inside here and you can just sort of bring it out and that's what it looks like it's got a nice heavy metal heavy metal alright a metal tip which you know it's got a good mouthfeel to it and of course just like all the other 5-10 oops 510 cartridges it fits into your battery just by turning it like this so there you go and then you're ready to go so about blue dream what really stands out about this particular product is the flavor so the flavor is very fruity notes forward it's very true to the blueberry ancestors of blue dream yeah probably one of the most fruity besides maybe the tangerine dream from San Rafael this would be the second most fruity vape I've tried now the effects pretty typical to a blue dream there's this sort of wave of kind of like hazy it just says the name suggests relaxation so I didn't feel particularly what should I say focused during the effects of this one it kind of makes your thinking a bit hazy and sloppy but at the same time it's very relaxing and other point to mention which I notice with this one is it's not sedating at all so I wouldn't recommend this for nighttime use cuz it might keep you up a bit unless you can augment it with something that's a little bit more sedating so yeah so that's pretty much it in a nutshell I'm gonna give this one hmm this is gonna be a tough one because I do like the flavour a lot I like the effects but I'm not crazy about the effects I'm gonna have to give this a seven and a half out of ten yeah a little bit shy of an eight just because the effects aren't my favorite and you know what it is is if I'm going to be taking a sativa that's not going to be sedating that you know is probably better for daytime use I want like I want to have a lot of focus a lot of energy I want to be able to get things done which is not really what this one brings to the table and maybe it's not what this one's designed for this one's really more about chilling and relaxing like during the daytime because it's not sedating but very relaxing so I think a seven and a half for me is fair some other people who want like a more chilled out experience will probably rate it a bit higher but that's what I'm going to give it all around a great product are really happy with the purchase oh yeah and I bought this from a new dispensary in my area of town called Miss Jones I want to just give them a shout out because the the store looks beautiful first of all and the staff was really friendly and I enjoyed talking with them so shout out to you guys at Miss Jones alright that's it for me I'll be back with another cannabis product review for you guys shortly", "lZ-vfMIuGco": "[Music] welcome to truebuds tv it's your buddy jack talking distillate vapes versus live resin vapes what's going on here what's the difference i've had tons of requests so i'm happy to be fulfilling those requests let's see what we got in the uh little handy dandy true buds pack let's open it up well that's for another video i'm going to be opening up this top shelf pre-roll see what we got inside keep an eye out for that video i have the uh live resin from jetty here the unrefined let's go ahead and open this up we got the little satchel in here tastes so good so live resin upon harvest is instantly frozen this is the way that they're going to get the most terpenes in there the full flower flavor that everybody loves live resin is usually extracted with butane and purged in a vacuum oven i'm not going to go too far into the process let me know if you want to see more videos on the actual process now live resin usually on the scale shows it's a little less potent and a lot of people go shopping i want the highest potency i want this and that that's why distillate cartridges are so popular and that's why i'm making this video to kind of educate people because distillate is the bottom of the barrel if you will it's the leftovers the trim the shake because everything is going to be burnt off essentially it's like making booze it's like making a moonshine or ever clear you're going to put all this [ __ ] in and then you're going to be left with the most potent stuff possible basically tasteless odorless colorless and then this is when the companies add in the terpenes if you're lucky sometimes they're delicious sometimes they're not but a lot of times you can taste the artificialness and that's why i think especially after having this live resin i got a live resin from my uh packs the other day from jetty too i think this is the go to from now on i'm tired of these distillate carts when i hit them they taste fake i'm [ __ ] like sneezing that's another video i've been with people when they're smoking vapes i sneeze all the time after hitting this distillate cart like what kind of terpenes have you put in there is it some [ __ ] random flower that i happen to be allergic to like that is the beauty of the live resin is you are getting the live flower if you will the closest resemblance in a nice form that's right there price point price point this graham cartridge is pretty damn expensive i'm not gonna lie i was a little hesitant it was like 62. i got it from ease i'll put a comment down below if you want to order through there for your first time get 20 off but that's expensive sometimes i have people commenting like dude that's some serious dough you're dropping on some carts and [ __ ] but it's convenient it's legal gives me peace of mind i really don't mind actually you know shoveling that money forward people buy the stuff through ease it all kind of comes back but what i'm saying here is i think this has helped transform me i've had other live resin vapes and i've thought the same thing but i'll still buy distillate ones but i'm sitting there i feel like sometimes these like even the circles one like i'll take [ __ ] like 10 15 [ __ ] poles off it and it feels like just now i had like what four of these like this is better so i guess you got to decide where you want to put your money quantity over quality i'll just compare it to like schwag versus fire ass nog you know what i'm saying i would say this is that good nug and the distillery cartridges are the swag so yeah like that we got the unrefined live resin and then we have a distillate like this was like 15 bucks and you can tell so that's my two cents i wanted to break down the difference for you between the live resin and the distillate vapes like i said the tons of people were asking like yo bro like what's the difference man and i'm like i'm gonna make a video so here it is thank you for hanging out i'm gonna go enjoy this and if you're liking this pack or you want to grab any of the other true buzz merch you know i'll be truly grateful and i got some really cool stuff just dropped the free smoke edition the stone bald eagle i got a whole video coming about that because it represents a lot to me i put a lot of thought in it and i want to thank the artists on that video too so keep an eye out grab some true buds merch if you're feeling this video show some love to me i'll keep making videos showing love to you you know what i'm saying thank you and i'll catch you on the next video here on true buds tv yeah this is true buzz that mary j now we ain't new to this for my stoners and for my cannabis enthusiasts talking edibles ain't bringing comedy let's get it time to pass it to the left and we can have a smoke session yeah true love for my true buzz light it up and i'm on it this vibe take me way back screaming i got five on it in the cut of sativa anything that you need break it down like the weed this is true buzz tv buzz i'm a stoner i'm a smoker it's a hobby it's a lifestyle and a culture yeah this is yeah this is", "qGjvbtb-XO0": "well Aloha brothers and sisters welcome back to the channel I'm so excited to have all you cannabis connoisseurs and enthusiasts with me today I have a classic strain in vape cartridge form for you today pineapple express baby coming at you from the good people a good supply this is a THC heavy vape cartridge coming in at seven hundred sixty four point one milligrams of THC less than five percent milligrams CBD today about seventy six percent THC in less than a percent CBD so as I said heavy-hitting hybrid THC cartridge coming at you from good supply I'm very excited to try this out pineapple Express is one of my favorite strains of all time probably one of yours too it's classic its legendary they make goddamn movie out of this thing one of my favorite movies probably one of your students hilarious I was very excited to see this in my own cannabis shop even more excited when I found out this thing's going for 40 bucks 40 bucks for a 0.5 gram 510 thread vape cartridge that's the best I've seen in the Canadian market personally so far so I snapped it up right away very excited to check you know he's gonna show you here on the side of the package I'll hold it up for the camera hopefully it doesn't bore but it does let me know what is let me let you know what it says it says our oil what's inside cannabis distillate plant-based terpenes no additives our product the cartridge premium ceramic or anti leaked technology direct airflow system you know I appreciate this kind of information being put on the package I like to know that it's plant-based terpenes not artificial I like to know that it's cannabis dislike to know what's in the cartoon you know more information is not a bad thing I would like to see some other companies follow suit on this good job good supply I like that so without further ado I'm gonna break the seal on this bad boy and figure out how to open it again you know it is some kind of heavy little feels thick cardboard packaging here feels a little wasteful but yeah it's a Canadian market let's open it looks like you pinch the sides and push yeah there we go so here comes the reveal for y'all and there we have it um it's nice-looking let's rescue it from this package yes some heavy thick heavy-duty cardboard packaging for a little item this has got to change um yeah this is a nice-looking cartridge let me hold it up for you all there oh it's got a nice metallic finish on it silver I see a THC logo there I know as it said pineapple Express on that green band and good supply I think at the bottom hopefully that's not blurry for you more importantly though I know it looks great check it out that oil is nice and clear it's a good color hopefully it's coming through clear for you because it looks clear and good that looks smokeable I'm excited that mouthpiece condom and rubber nub oh look we dropped it and yeah it's a nice looking cartridge let's get it on the old standard 510 battery here and the excitement grows as intensifies as we screw it on I'm really looking forward to this everybody I talk know it's tasty hmm yeah that's pretty good you know his little plug there but first John just came out of the package tastes really good kind of a citrusy sweet taste on the intake there and kind of held up on the way out mixed with a little bit of a herbalist herbally kind of taste there kind of herbal and citrusy sweet wouldn't necessarily say pineapple but let's check it out again yeah it's yummy man yep so sweet citrusy taste he definitely tastes that on when they first take a drink and then the exhale it definitely holds up and yeah it's kind of horrible I like it kind of tastes like smoking flower you know it's not too bad it's a good taste in the vape cartridge you know a little distracted here because I've noticed you know this is only 1/2 fault here it's kind of a big cartridge it's dawning on me here that this must be a 1 gram cartridge because it's a point 5 gram you know this lid in there they must be making one gram cartridges in the future that got me excited so yeah breaking news one gram cartridge is coming up looks like from a good supply but you know back to the flavor back to the taste this is pretty good to get a pretty good vapor I see it's not harsh pretty smooth yeah very good vapor production and yeah that's a good flavor I'm really good to enjoy vaping this over the next couple days and as always come back but you know what I think then all right so the final verdict on the old pineapple express some good supply here you know I've been vaping the hell out of this thing the last four days I've run a readout and tell you what I like he didn't like about it I liked a lot about it to be honest favorite thing about it was a taste flavor was great out of this world spine Apple Express baby from the first drag to the last flavor holds up never waned and never weak really good really strong you nailed a good supply you did a good job I can't always say that about all cartridges the flavor held up throughout the whole thing we really get and the flavor that was there really loved it I'm big fat it's pineapple Express it's great you're gonna love the taste the effects really nice effects you know it's a little milder than you might think at a 76 percent THC level so it's not a super heavy hitter you're not gonna get blitzed big stoned out of your mind but it's a good all day strain it's a great way can be extreme it's a sociable strain very conversational motivate you get through your day really happy up with the kind of feeling throughout your day that's a good strain you know what I mean I love it it's a good strain of having a pandemic you got to keep your chin up your spirits up there's a little tank of getting your spirits up that's for sure so you know I really enjoyed it's a little milder than some people might like but I thought it was great really good all day straight it's a hybrid strain I find it to be a lot more sativa meaning like I say it's all day long stream it's not going to let you know you're not gonna feel really tired it's not gonna burn you out really good strain three four hits on this thing lasts about an hour hour and a half before you kind of feel like you might want to have another pull fantastic good job good supply I really enjoyed it only downer to this thing oh you know another thing I really like is I like the look of this I mean look at that it's just nice right it's really shiny really metallic nice look I'm a sucker for a good look looks good but let's get into the only negative I have here well I got one small negative this little green band that you got down here kind of blocks how much oil you got left in the cartridge that's a bit of a bombing event it's alright it's not that big a deal the biggest deal that I have with this is it doesn't seem to last too long it's four days later in a mountain you know what I'm saying I mean like I noticed it moved around real easily in there it's kind of a thinner oil and a thinner oil is gonna vape alittle bit quicker so might want to take that into consideration with your value proposition with you know hey it's 40 bucks 4.5 grand cartridge but it doesn't seem to last that long I don't know personally I still recommend it it's alright I mean you know I was vaping it a lot you know not as much as I have other ones that have lasted longer but you know your mileage may vary out there as always but for what you get I recommend it I'd buy it again if I saw it in a store I'd buy it again I really liked it really impressed I enjoy the price enjoy the effects enjoy the taste I enjoy pineapple Express from good supply good job I liked it so hope you like the videos thanks for stopping by and watching I hope you get something out of it fun in Ford of it informative entertaining I don't know thanks for watching brothers and sisters leave me a comment let me know what you think you like the strain you try to before you don't like the strain let me know why you don't like it you think I'm right think I'm wrong I read all your comments I reply to them all I love it while you're here click Subscribe I'm going to be making videos all the time might as well be the first one to see them so till next time I hope you're all taking staying safe taking care of each other and above all everyone keeps smoking", "qnJnuDTWlms": "hello everybody my name is J and I am coming to you with some problems with these vape pen cartridges so specifically these are the world's most awarded brand which is King pen and I've got multiple cartridges here that were given to me or lent to me with the purpose of figuring out why they won't work for whatever reason so I've identified after taking them apart and unscrewing them and messing with them and trying different ones and different contact points and cleaning and watching all the tutorials on youtube I have come up with the most comprehensive video in my opinion not how to fix these so there are three points here one is the air flow disrupted you could pause the video now and figure out so maybe as your air flow disrupted but I would suggest to wait until I start explaining all four areas and how they can get clogged number two is the center with coil displaced and not touching the contact pen so we're gonna use a special tool to recenter one or both coil wires and that is what you see here lastly are your wicks out of place if so you're probably gonna need to transfer the liquid from your cartridge to maybe another cartridge that's empty but still works so first and foremost I just wanna let you know I'm not an ambassador at all for kingpin butts if they want to bring me on board I clearly know what I'm talking about so mmm here's your product disassembled Kington and here are three of them put together you know I'm a thirty on this I've been reading the manual so I didn't read a book I didn't read a zine I didn't read a meme I just very curious about how things work so without further ado let's talk a little bit about point number one is the air flow disrupted all four areas so you might say what are the four areas well let's pick up this empty one I'm going to use this little pin for pointing purposes this is just paperclip and there are also many uses for this obviously specifically with these pens and the cartridges I should say first things first disclaimer do not stick this into here and all the way down do not stick it into the bottom and up and in because in the middle chamber you'll see there are two holes in this middle chamber which is the same as this middle chamber that I just knocked over this middle chamber is what is in sight at a glass tube this is a one-gram pen or one gram cartridge the two holes that you see right here and right here are blocked by a wick this is the wick here and the wick is wrapped around the coil so that's a little bit about the anatomy of what we have here this is the entire cartridge disassembled - the glass because I had to break the glass off once I screwed the top off the top does unscrew and will come off there are rubber washers in the middle there in the middle of the cylinder and there's a rubber washer on the outside so the rubber washer makes contact with the glass and the rubber washers here block any oil from moving up into the mouthpiece as you see it fits flush is the air flow disrupted the four areas are one the mouthpiece is a clogged we don't know the bottom is it clogged we don't know and then number three there are actually four holes next to the thread one two three and then four one area two areas and three areas the fourth area comes from the battery itself where the cartridge meets the pen battery there are four slots this is the use Oh oze pen also not affiliated with but if you guys want to bring me on board clearly I know what I'm talking about here we go this is the 650 pen 650 just tells you how much battery power is in this particular particular pen and there's also a voltage dial on the bottom so you can really dial in how much vapor you may potentially have because of how much heat will be transferred up into the cartridge and into the coil and then into the wick which will be full of your liquid content this is the fourth area if this areas blocks because you're holding it like a noob or some other person who has never handled one of these before you will be blocking the airflow from the two areas where air goes into which again are the four holes next to the threading or the bottom hole you can plug this hole and suck through the top because air will flow through the holes next to the thread you could theoretically plug those holes and then intake air through that bottom hole once you have your mouth on mouthpiece and are attempting to inhale is the airflow disrupted check all four areas you may have to use a flashlight and look inside of there a headlamp something but we suggest that you do not take off the little rubber nipples that they give you to protect your cartridge when you get these keep them on when they are not in use so that nothing does go in there unintentionally do not carry these loosely in your pocket because something could go in the mouth hole something you'd go into that bottom hole there the mouth hole could be clogged because maybe you've been using your pen for a long time you never cleaned it but as we see there there is a hole right down the middle it's nice and clear but we can also clean it I just use a paper towel and I just clean that's twist it up and clean it or you can use a pipe cleaner which is obviously a great tool for pipe like devices you can clean inside here and you can clean there make sure that that's good also too you know when you're opening your cartridge make sure you don't set it flat inside for too long like I just did because the contents might leak out but I had that off-camera nothing happened over here I didn't lose anything thank goodness because this stuff is expensive so what we're gonna do is gonna set that back down so that that liquid goes back down into the container then another area we check is that bottom that hole there a lot of people know that this part slides out and one of the problems the most basic thing that people say is when you just adjust this you pull this part out right here and all that and then inside of the battery the battery there that part has to touch that part right there and then you got to raise that part up and then you gotta raise that part and then they got to touch each other and like that that you know that's that's a thing sure but that's probably not gonna be your problem so you if that's what you're looking to do you could very gently raise this part up and you can very gently raise this part out you can kind of pluck it through the middle or you could just use your nail cuz your nail fits if it is that thin and you can see how it was once recess and is now not and I can even push it in gone flush dunzo doesn't need to be sticking out to make contact and for it to work how do I know it works because when I press my pen oh that's the actually the error code that's the does not work code so if you don't have it doesn't work for some reason that's great that that just happened because that brings you to a point number two so we already checked our air flow just messed up my whole stage here we're gonna check our air flow we did that at point one point two point woops 0.3 which is down here point three in point four which is when it's connected these pens so number two what does it say it says is the center wick coil displaced well I'm gonna cap this back up because that's just good habit good habits are hard to find put that right there this cartridge is relatively empty on purpose because this one wasn't working and I transferred the liquid into that one and on the way during that journey I found a couple of things this is level 2 all of the videos just deal with not even one they just deal with the does this part touch this part do they touch if not adjust that part or just that part that's fine cool but we need 50 people to make that video we need 50 people make this video and then 50 people to make this video in 50 people to make this video but luckily for you kingpin and furrows I am keeping people happy and satisfied so bring me on board because I'm tired of doing what I'm doing for living anyway where were we oh yeah fixing your product for people this cartridge has this and down here again this cartridge that I'm holding is the same as this right here this is the mouthpiece this is the metal middle cylinder which is down the middle of this glass and then you have a wick wrapped by a coil and a wick wrapped by a coil this wick is missing I tore it off intentionally then you have a rubber gasket and then you have a metal contact point this is the point that touches the battery inside of your pen this is this I know I'm over explaining things but a lot of people don't and also too you know a lot of people space out at the 11 minute and 40 second mark so good on you for staying involved moving on if you were to move this piece out of the middle what would happen it would fly out then you would expose the rubber gaskets is this rubber gasket the same as this yes that's what it looks like when you pull it out you pull out that way you look just like this boom so this is this and then that right there is that inside of here is supposed to be two little thin wires which are these two little thin wires and they would be connected to a wick in this case let's get that flashlight in that bad boy you could see one of those right there I'm gonna try to focus and get the flashlight on and just bear with me I know you don't like watching long videos but hey maybe your pen is broken and you're all bummed out and you're just being held hostage mr. informative over here because you know you want the thing to work because you have a desired effect in mind check it out there's one coil right there a one wire there should be two and if I personally look at it which is not gonna be helpful to you um I can see that the other wire is down in there put my flashlight away boom what I used was I went to my sewing kit yes sewing kit and I got this little tool this is for threading this is an assistant this is an assistant for threading go through the needle head go through the eye of the needle jeez Louise go through the eye of the needle and then you would put your thread into that part and then you pull it through that's what this is intended for but today it's for THC vaping products so that is a very thin gauge wire even more thin than that stuff down there how we get that out as we just kind of go fishing you can see that when we go inside of there the metal wire is hooked on the end conveniently and we can see that I have hooked onto that wire there are two of them though you gots to go get yourself another one and I'm very close to getting it I also don't want to waste a bunch of time because you might space out but lucky for you I got it they had two wires so this was the one that wasn't working I'm gonna see if miraculously this which I know this fixes it I just don't know if I can't kind of can't see what I'm doing and I'm just making this tutorial video just to show you what to do so once I put my peace back in and it's gone flush up against those metal coils I try it back again this is against for problem number two and once I put it back on there if those wires are flush this will just stay lit normally it won't give me that weird blink code so let's just see what happens boom it lights up normally just fixed it in your face contracts in my Inbox what do we got moving on don't just love it when you watch a video and everything works accordingly because the person that's teaching you is an expert alright sorry that's the last time I'm gonna do that I'm just really happy you should be happy too because these are the really expensive things and when they don't work you can give you really bummed out I read that in an article because you know I don't do this kind of stuff that's that we'll move on to problem number three now oh and then so that tool that's just like a sewing kit tool we covered that you're not gonna get with tweezers tweezers are big and chunky you know how big they're I'll show you and I'm back here our tweezers you think that's gonna get in there inside that teeny tiny hole you ain't getting in that hole tell you that much right now boom good luck with those big fat tweezers getting inside that little hole it's just not gonna happen and this is probably the only tool you'll have that's even close to what you need and you're gonna say well it's the only tool I have I'm gonna make it work you're gonna mess it up you're gonna mess up something and if you do mess something up well something's gonna happen it's probably going to be step number three are your wicks out of place in that case you're probably going to need to transfer the liquid and that's what happened to me I had to transfer the liquid from this one to this one because those coils that are attached to that wire that we just pulled with this tool got knocked out of place if you look at this sorry right there that is the wick it is wrapped around and around and around by this little wire so wire comes up wrapped around round round round round round round and then it comes back down that wire one set is on the outside of this rubber washer the other set is inside the rubber washer the inside set is the one that we just did on that cartridge with this tool that's one that we just plucked out of that was in the middle this sensor cylinder would have inside of it you see right now that is a clean hole this again would be attached to the mouthpiece on this side and on the bottom this is what would screw into the bottom of the bait pan except for it's missing one thing what is it the glass I had to break the glass off because yes it's open on the one end but on the other end it's molded into place I believe so I broke I broke it off for the demonstration in this video so that you don't have to go injuring yourself or somebody that you love we're at 18 minutes now this is the metal sumela this is a middle cylinder all the airs are staying in I don't care I'm a professional middle cylinder clean hole it wouldn't be a clean hole though because it would be one two wicks blocking the view of the bottom that hole will be occupied by the two wicks if you held it over a flashlight remember a flashlight familiar I'm gonna blind you for a second to demonstration if I cover this hole and just plug this little bad boy right in there we should see Hey look at that we could see through there and there are some obstructions it is not as clean and open and empty is this again we're looking right here if it had fluid inside of that cylinder it wouldn't be a clean light what color would the light be you guessed it it would be this color we would be able to see down the middle if there was fluid leaking into that middle cylinder so the middle cylinder could get clogged because one of the wicks have been moved out of place somehow and that might have been our fault earlier using this little tool or maybe something happened during shipping or maybe this little metal piece went up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down too much or maybe we dropped it or maybe it wasn't a pocket full of pennies or maybe it wasn't a pocket full of posies we don't know what the case might be but for whatever reason fluid is now going into those holes and again what are those holes for those holes have the wicks inside of them they go straight across the fluid goes into the wicks the wicks are wrapped with coil the coil gets heated by an electrical current from the battery the battery makes contact with this metal piece which is this metal piece right here and on the inside of this metal piece are two wires that are attached to a coil which is it wrapped around a wick and on the outside of the rubber washer which is now here is another set of wires if any of those wires are displaced you will get a blinking code which we saw earlier if those wicks are out of place you will have drainage wreckless a drainage into the middle cylinder this fluid will start to fill up this compartment with fluid and it will sound very Slurpee and wet and bubbly when you take a draw from your mouthpiece the oil can leak out of the mouthpiece and the oil can leak out of the bottom and potentially the oil could leak out of the air holes all of which equal a gurgling Slurpee sounds when you draw on the cartridge so if your wicks are out of place you're gonna need to transfer the liquid so what I did was I took the cartridge that was good let's pretend this was the good cartridge it's empty for the most part I put the cap back on why so I could stand it up without a fallin over which it may anyway but if you have a good level surface it's gonna stand up straight but before I did that what I actually did was I unscrew the top to make it open and ready to receive new liquid that is what it looks like again do not get any liquid into this hole that shouldn't it be nice and clean the only thing that we should go in through that hole is the vapor of your oil once it is heated up by your coil heating element there so I've got this open I've gotten a nice flat service it's ready to receive I hope I took the cartridge that I wanted to empty the contents out of let's say this was a cartridge that was broken for some reason and it wasn't lighting properly and the maybe the coils are pushed in maybe I'm getting some other weird blink code maybe I just I did steps 1 & 2 it's not working I'm just going to get this cotton get the content out of here and put it into this other cartridge so what I did was I also unscrewed its top note there's a rubber washer to go flush up against the glass and they're rubber washers here on the middle cylinder that will go flush up against the mouthpiece as you see so that the contents won't leak up into the mouthpiece once I have my two cartridges disassembled I'm gonna show you a side view you would be doing this straight up and down but I'm gonna show you side view so what I did was I touched I waited for all the fluid to go down into one side and then I heated it a little bit with a lighter so it became more more runny and then I ran it down the side let these two tips touch but not inside but just on the outside what enough happening was the fluid ran down touched this middle cylinder and it touched then this middle cylinder and this road right down the side and into the new vial once I got to about the empty point what I did was say it got nice and full like that we're just reversing here it got nice and full what I did was I set it down like that and I took the other cartridge so I can get the last few drippings out of it and I put it right on top and you're gonna say no way that's ridiculous what kind of factory ancient aliens countertops do you have over there and what kind of skills do you have I mean I might be an alien it's okay boom I just stack things on top of each other I can also stack tennis balls on top of each other golf balls you name it again kingpin looking at my inbox still nothing it's okay we get all day these two things go on top of each other then your fluid can leak down into the new cylinder what does that look like from a side view it looks like this they'll be sitting right on top of each other and that fluid will be dripping from this one to this one will go right down the middle we hope and if not I made this I just got this this is look up this is a piece of mail now this was a piece of mail mm-hmm so I took this is the clear part which would have you read it from the outside this is the part that the mailman had been touching I use the inside and then if you were worried about anything spilling but you wanted to contain it and get it back later I put it right on top of there and I done this the first time I I didn't know what to do you know I stacked them on top of each other like that cuz again skills to pay the bills and then any fluid that went down in here like that I was able then to us to just fold my piece of cellophane or whatever this is I fold it in half like that and then I just had my my fluid right there in the middle and then I just cut off the corner and then I just squeezed it out like I was doing them like some pastry design or something you know those like Baker's bag the icing stuff you see how like it beads up and you just move it down can you squeeze it down into the side of your cartridge depending on how much matters and means to you you know maybe $50 or $60 or however much you're paying is a lot or maybe it's not but an either way at either rate at any rate it's not bad to save your time to save your money and these things can be pricey and expensive so hopefully I answered some questions for you I know this video is 28 minutes long at this point so just a recap of everything they have here the sharpies were kind of pointless I was doing something earlier them the tubes for the cartridges the cartridges themself the pen by use Rosie II kingpin cartridges most awarded brands in history thus far these are mouthpieces this is the anatomy of the whole cartridge the mouthpiece the center the center piece their two coils with two wicks one wicked missings I removed it the rubber gasket and then the metal contact point that makes contact with the battery of the pen the battery so that's that I know this is helpful for you hopefully at this point if something else is wrong I'm not aware of it maybe leave some more solutions down in the comments below if you have any questions feel free to ask again my name is jay and i know this was helpful to you have a good day", "90WDhrnrSZA": "what's up airbrush - boy you had them here for how cannabis live and we're back with another review video make sure you like subscribe and watch to the end for a chance to win a free prize also check out my website that be dead without Ohio canvass live.com enjoy the show [Music] what's up everybody employed mastermind here in Valhalla cannabis light and we have a very special review today this is the botanist has now put out products and they actually did a project with you guessed it would word make a fire rock and so now they've created a vape cartridge this basically fire rock or woodward flying cannabis flower or trim and they've used this to make TAC baked cartridges so here's some material that I received when I purchased my product and it says here the botanist babe Carter's art strain specific makes feature complex cannabinoid profile is crafted to unlock the natural benefits of the cannabis plant this is a targeted recipe our craft extraction techniques achieve a uniquely potent and truly flavorful product only one ingredient cannabis the botanist cartridge features a highly refined distillate based enhanced with a complex minor chemin of cannabinoids I can never say that right kind of annoys viana TC unlocking minor cannabinoids our distillate is refined using a proprietary post extraction process that captures beneficial minor cannabinoids that enhance the effect of the TC resulting in a smooth and highly potency product mmm purity no fillers or botanicals our base will never use any harsh fillers like vitamin E acetate or I like this one both technical terpenes I learned a lot about those recently our oil contains one ingredient cannabis okay this is single source terpenes stay true to distrain each botanist vape highlights the natural turf pain profile of its cannabis strengths our small batch extraction process gently recovers her opinions truly reflecting the plants full flavor profile in the finished product traceability know what you're buying our oil is made using ingredients that can be traced from sea to sail to ensure transparency testing results for our products are always available ok botanist and here's a close-up of the card now you can get this at the botanist I'm not sure if in a dispensaries had this yet this product costs fifty four dollars with tax in Columbus Ohio I purchased two products I purchased wedding cake cuz we've all heard of wedding cake right and I purchased the sunset sherbert we've all heard of that too also another great fire rock wood wood product so let's talk about the expects here the specifications the total THC on the wedding cake is three hundred and forty eight milligrams of THC 0 milligrams of CBD and then the other cabin noise it says CBG 11 milligrams this was manufactured on April 24th and packaged on May the fifth so this is literally just hit the market so you know today is May the 6th so this just got put in the box but it was also tested back on April 29 so it was also recently tested on the Box on the front it says 348 milligrams and it also indicates this is sixty nine point six two percent THC these are half gram cartridges so basically for $108 you'd have yourself a whole gram and you can obviously mix and mingle that and get a couple different ones now they also had another strain there which is by Buckeye relief called ninety two cookies I didn't try that one yet because I haven't tried to flour yet so once I tried to flower from Buckeye relief on a 90 cookies then I will try the cartridge so I can give you a review on that also one let you know that there are some other products that botanist will have these are the tinctures and that will be in a different video so we're not going to go too far into it now but I will tease that for you my car got a little wet you know how it be it happens when you're trying to wipe it down with with a wipe so you don't get any germs on it anyway so I have not opened these so imma let you guys get the same unboxing experience then I'm gonna have we're gonna experience this together and like I said I'm gonna hold this back so you get a little bit light on it but like I said I'm gonna turn this here and maybe we can see a little bit better and there's a little wood there on the box so there's a tab here and then there's also a seal there I don't know if you can see that on camera now but there is a seal there and so I'm gonna go ahead and open the one I want to open the one I've been rushing to open is the wedding cake so I'm cracking this seal baby doc at this crack with my nails and then I'm gonna I'm gonna pull out this little brown tab here I'm assuming that's what you're supposed to do so we're going to try this together folks and no-knock whoo-hoo now here's a surprise guys here is the cartridge interesting enough they have put a piece of styrofoam in there not sure I think that's just to stabilize it so that it doesn't get moved around I think that's good to keep it from being disoriented up close I could show you check it out now there is a washer on here which a lot of you familiar what this is for a different type of battery that has a magnetic mechanism on it so I'll show that again and then obviously this just screws off okay now it's just a regular 510 thread many of you asking me about that this is it guys this is a cartridge only product surprise no battery oh my gosh how are we going to hit this thing so we have a couple of different options first thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to try to use a battery that came with the Cure Ohio cartridge for comparison here's a cure Ohio oil half a gram and here is the botanist Woodward oil obviously there is a color difference don't let that concern you oops good thing I didn't break that would be all that so many of you know the cure Ohio battery is reusable so I'm just going to screw this on here and we're gonna find out if the wool it's a work for us so here we go wedding cake by Woodward processed by botanist and here we go it does work impressions this is smooth it is not harsh I can taste a little bit of wedding cake but not a whole lot so I like the packaging I think it's smart to have a little styrofoam in there to keep it stabilized so it doesn't fall around in there and maybe get turned upside down the package is designed to hold it so that it doesn't have anything going on with it as far as its orientation I mean there are a few little bubbles in here but honestly folks that's not uncommon with vape oils especially when they're loading them hot so there could be able to few little bubbles I am but it is a very smooth bait but I'm looking at terpene taste and flavors I'm not really tasting any wedding cake terpenes that I'm familiar with and you know just for reference I currently have some wood wood wedding cake folks so I'm sure I'm not tasting turps on this so we've went through that one and you know I don't smell in terms either but what I could also do is I could put this on an aftermarket battery just to be sure and see if we get any difference because those batteries are pre-configured at a certain voltage and I've learned that sometimes having something at a different voltage will affect your experience in your taste so I have to set at three point five volts it's still very smooth it is a very smooth like this doesn't hurt your throat this is very smooth but I just don't really taste anything so I'm set that aside for right now this is a vision to spin our battery by the ladies man these are like tanks the next one we're gonna go ahead sunset server so I again box is the same same packaging specs comparing it to the Woodward let's see the total TAC for the sunset server is 346 milligram point 95 346 point nine five milligrams and also the CBG is 11 milligrams I will talk more about what CVG is comparing to CBD in a later video so or you can just you know look it up we'll talk about CVG and CBN as well okay this one package exactly the same way the oil quality is the same a nice clear gold color and I'm gonna do the same test I'm gonna put it on the trusty cure Ohio battery but you before I do that OPSEC removed a little magnetic adapter which comes in handy if you have one of those devices that has a magnetic battery and I go guys now lift the sunset server I taste I taste it I can taste a little bit more Terps terpenes with the sunset server it reminds me of the flower so I would say both of them hit smooth I would say there's even maybe a little bit more I mean this again maybe a little bit more of a bite then with the wedding cake feel a tickling my throat a little bit but is it art trying to sit on this and hit this all day probably so yeah I'm gonna do the same thing before I'm gonna swap it with my vision here and I'm gonna see how it tastes with the vision like I said and I've got the vision at the lowest voltage was 3.5 volts if you want to know I have no idea what the state has their batteries and hopefully set could be higher could be less we'll have to find out so here we go okay did we get our malfunction well that's interesting guys it's not working so let me try to turn yourself and this is a fully charged battery so let's see okay there we go interesting I had to turn my battery off and turn it back on all right so it's been a couple minutes and let's talk about effects so what did I notice because I'm familiar with both of both of these strains personally overall I don't have any immediate psychoactive I'm not overwhelmingly getting a head rush type feeling which is good I don't want something that's just gonna take my head off and make me feel like I'm getting ready to have a headache so I want a balanced effect not looking to just be you know out of my comfort zone I want something that makes me feel comfortable when I I'm very picky about fake cards and if you know me and watching other videos how many babe card videos have you seen so I don't do very many so whenever I do do one is because I want to find out if things are improving or if I'm gonna learn something about it and so other bait cars that I've tried I don't quite remember them having the CBG in it and so I need to do some more research about CBG before I start trying to tell you about CPG so I'm gonna do some homework on that and when I come back with a 92 cookies fake card that's when I'm gonna have a little bit more information about the CBT other than what I currently know now which is what it says on Wikipedia so I want to know some more about it and I want to have some more experience with this product that way I can tell you a little bit more details about what I'm feeling overall over time but immediately this definitely helps me with a little bit of my anxiety and this is actually a little bit relaxing to me and that's what I'm starting to feel as this video goes on normally I will take a break and come back but the effects are more immediate with this cartridge so there's no need for me to take a break and come back I'm already feeling some positive effects of the product so what I think the feedback will be is that the packaging is great I'm very satisfied with the packaging I think this is just big enough I like the slide out factor you just have to get used to pulling this brown part out to slide it out I think that was smart I think putting a little piece of styrofoam in there was a smart idea guys so if you guys have the botanist owners of the botanist if you're watching this I think you did a good job with your packaging the only concern I might have is that if we have a lot of these stacked up like this depending on where they are in a dispensary that the oil is gonna lay down and then you know I guess we need to find out it's getting this box stand on its own and I don't think that it can and so what I'm thinking is well let's see yes it can't stand us home so part of with for me I keep all my oil Carter just a nice write up so you know the easiest thing you could do you know is take maybe one of your other containers and just take your battery and set them in there and this is an easy way for people to keep your cartridges from being like you know all weird-looking when you pick them up never let your cartridge be stored laying down sleeping so I think botanist is showing me right here as I'm moving them around on my desk that this cartridge box can stand up on its own and so it's a product good idea when you're not using the cartridge maybe keep it stored in a box standing up near where it's not gonna have a lot of activity you know I'm a bum push it up against my desk I'm hitting my desk and the cartridge does not fall that the box is not falling over and so you you're doing better than I thought bottom this with the box I mean because size and dimension matters when you're trying to have something stored and something convenient so the box is standing on its own even though it's empty I have a good thought that it will probably do the same thing even if we put the cartridge in there so my opinion I think this is a good product for you to try if you're a person that likes bait cartridges if you are someone that is looking for a lot of flavors I think there's still some room to roll I think that they should work on adding a little bit more terpenes I want to really get that cake flavor when I hit the cartridge but at the same time I'm very satisfied with the effects of how I feel the house affecting my middle and I'm glad that is not overwhelming me or causing me to feel like I am just so impaired that I can't speak properly and I'm glad that is helping me with my anxiety and also with a little bit of focus and concentration so with that saying I'm gonna recommend that you do try these products and give them your honest review and your honest opinion and you can also send in your reviews to me at Ohio cannabis live at gmail.com or you can send me your videos through the messenger and I will happily share any videos or be glad to do an interview with you / zoom or Skype or messenger so that we can have an honest discussion about how you feel about this product because that's gonna be the new thing now as we're gonna start doing things together since we're all at home or on limited restrictions in some cases we have to start doing more stuff to interact with each other instead of just watching videos on videos are great but just the one sided video can get kind of boring so going forward we're gonna try to have some interaction and have some more people in these videos besides just me and I want to hear what other people's feedback is it's not all about just my feedback but your feedback matters too and that's why I added the feedback section on my website wlky.com and you can go there and give some growers some feedback and let them know how you really feel and I think that's important for the companies to grow so make sure that that like subscribe button I'm gonna go ahead and wrap this video and we'll see you again next time [Music] [Music]", "eDn3wTnbsE8": "how's everybody doing this is John with C&C connoisseurs and we've got a much requested one for you today so do you have a cartridge and you're having a hard time refilling it well this also applies if you happen to purchase one of these questionable cartridges and it fails how do you remove the mouthpiece to extract the oil I'm going to show you how to remove the mouthpiece from these cartridges in a way that they can then be reused or the oil can be recovered from them now the tools that I'm going to be utilizing are simply a common pair of vise grips and these are going to be csail 1 mil or 1 gram disposable one-time use ceramic coil cartridges that being said let's take this to the deck ok well here we are once again these are one-time use non removable sea cells as you can see right here this is a sea sail brand that is a batch code on the bottom alright this is another one this one here does not state sea sell across the bottom but on the base it does say sea sell m07 9 this is also a Jupiter distributed cartridge so the first things first we're going to take a pair of vice grips common write scripts and we're going to adjust them so when we apply them we apply them just at the base of that metal see how it's just barely barely at the base of that metal right there and we want to close it so it closed it just a little bit it pinches down just ever so slightly nothing cracks it barely bows and then you rock it back and forth rather firmly now there you have it you will get some flyer marks on the mouthpiece but if you look this collar right here which is what you want to preserve is undamaged completely undamaged okay now well there's the silicone ring right there that will seal around this shaft so you don't worry about that now in this outer sheath you can see that it is also undamaged that one was a little bit difficult I'll apply it to this just to stand it up and they'll have a go at one of these other ones all right I will show you again on this one here I said this is a C cell you take the pliers right at the base of the metal hinge it lock it back and forth pulling the cartridge off of the mouthpiece just like that [Applause] very simple easy there you have it alright now I'm gonna apply this cartridge to this battery just for a stable base and I'm going to open up this gelato right here and warm it up to dispense it into this cartridge okay now here is the cartridge we are going to refill all right here is the mouthpiece for the cartridge perfectly fine a couple of scratches on but that shouldn't affect it in the least here's the distillate we will be applying to it I have warmed this up substantially just to ensure that it does flow rather well into the system you simply place the applicator tip on the syringe twisting it to ensure that it has a good seal you put the syringe tip down into the cartridge and then just begin to apply the fluid all right there you have it as you can see the original line of the older oil right there at the bottom of the new oil coming down to meet it okay take that off the bottom there and see it's sinking down there very nice we didn't get a protective silicon cap for these threads right here apply it to the threads take the mouthpiece that came off of the cartridge put it over the top and it will it will not go on all the way that's a good thing that means that the seal still works it will not go on at this point you want to take a precision device and apply pressure now as you do that you will see this seal disappears and there you have it let's take this back up top and see how she does all right and here we are back on top with the csail refill that we have here now as you can see the oil has got down to the coil has mixed with that heather oil bubbles are rising to the top let's take this protective cover off the bottom of this hook it up to a battery let's see what we got shall we well there you have it that's working like a champ looking that of oil through there I can get that a little bit of gelato flavor from that distillate that I put in there it's very nice well there you have it that is how you can remove and refill one of these cartridges to extract the oil from it what you're going to want is a slightly longer blunt syringe tip and I have a few of those a slightly longer blunt syringe tip such as this one right here as you can see how long that is that would definitely get all the way down to the base of that and you would be able to extract any additional oil that happens to be in a cartridge where this this cell has failed this one no it's not failing all it's working great well thank you so much for tuning in this has been John with TMZ connoisseurs you be sure to remember to subscribe and give this a thumbs up if you liked it and tune in to some of our other videos to see if you like those as well thank you so much this has been great you have a nice

so the first you want to go ahead and do is take off your actual seal on the syringe remove that and I wouldn't want to go ahead and use this right away until I have my plastic needle point only because it actually helps manage the portion of your dab actually helps manage the portion of whatever cartridge you're actually using to refill and it helps you from preventing them making a mess because the last thing you want to do is spill your liquid gold all over the floor or all over your hand one messy situation so not only can you refill just the liquid gold cartridges just by putting the plastic insert along the sides I want to go ahead and recommend to let the wick soak I mean that's pretty much the component that actually keeps igniting so the more drenched your wicks are better taste you will actually consistently have on every plus that tends to be the number one part that drives up I didn't use my whole half randomized liquid ghost range so what I would do is pull back we tracked my oil back into the syringe take off my plastic needle point and put back my actual seal this is the number one part you do not want to throw this away you plan to reseal your liquid goats are in good to go how could you tell if you have a good quality co2 syringe well the lighter and the thicker the better more water down your oil is the more there is a possible chance that it's cut with poly glycol any vegetable glycerin and the artificial terpene that are turns your oil from quality to quantity now when it comes to strain-specific syringes or strain-specific concentrates it's kind of tricky to go ahead and commercialize those actual strains because you do need a lot of plant material to actually run on a consistent basis so if you have a major farm with that one string to go ahead and commercialize our power to you until then I'm yet to see that let me just go ahead and show you that not only can you refill most co2 510 cartridges with liquid gold vapor oil but you could definitely go ahead and use it on different things such as put it on your flower taking a dive out of it different alternatives that you actually medicate with and you just want to go ahead and intensify or increase the actual THC no matter what way helps you out to go ahead and medicate with liquid gold vape boy there's different alternatives I like to go ahead and choose a safe discreet way when I'm on the go so I keep my pen in handy go ahead and get liquid gold go to gene farmer labs calm and don't forget to subscribe to our G farmer TV YouTube channel", "_Zl3JFrkz2Q": "[Music] hi my name is Peter I'm with air vapor systems and we help businesses select source fill and ultimately find packaging for plant-based essential oil vaporizer pans so today we're gonna address a question that has been coming up for one of our new product lines what is C cell C cell very simply put is probably one of the most disruptive technologies to hit the vaporizer pen space in quite a while what C cell is is actually ceramic coil technology it is based around a ceramic coil that has been specially designed to absorb and vaporize plant-based essential oils at a high rate producing large clouds of vapor a lot of flavor and a really intensified user experience now how does C cell do this how does what makes C cells so special makes it so important and how exactly does it accomplish this kind of disruptive performance well C cell has a ceramic corn rather than a fabric wick based core what that means is that it's able to vaporize much higher viscosity essential oils without any problems and what it does is it pairs this coil with a high performance battery this is a high discharge lithium-ion battery that allows the coil to heat up quicker then most other coils do thus producing much bigger clouds of vapor upon exhale what this does is this provides two huge benefits for businesses who are looking to engage the C cell platform for their own use number one it provides a very standout user experience meaning that when you place your essential oils into a C cell your users are gonna notice they're gonna notice that the vapor clouds that they're producing are much bigger the hits they're taking is much bigger and to follow on the heels of that the second huge benefit for businesses looking to engage the C cell platform is the rate of consumption of the oil meaning that once you put your oil into a C cell cartridge it's gonna get consumed by the user at one point five to two times quicker than in a normal vaporizer pen this is because C cell has designed their entire pen for optimum performance I really like to compare C cell to a Ferrari and most other normal vaporizer pens to a Honda there's nothing wrong with a Honda I have a Honda love Honda but Honda is meant to be efficient and it's meant to be friendly to the normal everyday consumer but if you're looking for performance if you're looking for really high performance you're not gonna buy a Honda you're more than likely gonna buy a Ferrari right if you have the money for it Wow what makes a Ferrari special well a Ferrari is built from the ground up to be for for performance right everything from the tires to the suspension to the chassis to even the seat that the driver sits in is all made for performance that is what makes C self special everything on the C cell platform is designed for performance it basically allows you to vaporize your oils evenly without burning them while also pairing that with a high discharged battery that delivers more power thus allowing you to have larger hits so C cell from the ground up is designed for performance in a way that normal vaporizer pens cannot match so let's begin by taking a look at the entire C cell lineup before we drill down into the individual components of this lineup so that you as a user or as a brand are familiar with the C cell platform as you engage in it now it's worth noting that C cell likes to keep its lineup very sleek and minimalist there's only about five different C sell products however with a combination of different material finishes as well as branding options there's really a lot of ways that you can begin to express your brand through C cell now to start here on the cartridge side of things Cecil offers two different cartridges their first cartridge is called the th2 cartridge it is we refer to it internally as the c2 cartridge so when you call us and ask for this cartridge you can refer to it as either the th 2 or the C 2 cartridge however it is a glass cartridge with a ceramic tip onto it and this is really CISOs flagship cartridge when the user puts their lip on the their lips on the ceramic tip they instantly notice the quality and how this is a much heavier as well as better built cartridge than they may have be used to engaging with and what it does is it really makes any plant-based essential oil that's placed into this cartridge stand out from the pack now if you want to have that same sort of performance in a more cost effective packaging Cecil offer also offers the m60 which we refer to internally as the c6 but also available in a half gram as well as a 1 gram size but the entire body is made of plastic so that is a plastic body as well as a plastic mouthpiece even though this provides a slower price you still get a hundred percent of the performance because it has the patented C sell coil technology on the inside so there is no difference in performance between the glass cartridge or the plastic cartridge just a difference in material finish as well as cost now let's move on to the batteries very quickly you have two types of batteries for C so both of which are Auto and Hale batteries it means that they are not button activated see cell likes to have a user interface again very Apple like that is very easy to use and easy for a customer to learn to you so with both of these batteries once you put your cartridge on it you simply inhale in it that battery will automatically activate now first is the m3 battery which we refer to as just the C cell battery internally when you take this battery and you connect it to AC cell cartridge you end up with a very ecig like appearance that allows for a lot of description of discretion without any loss in performance this is a 350 mAh battery which means that it will last the typical user about a week before they have to recharge it now the newest battery to the C cell lineup is actually the palm battery here and this is a very interesting battery this actually has a drop-in design with a magnetic connector which means that you can drop in your cartridge and it won't fall out even though you don't have to screw anything in it allows the user to then also place it in the palm of their hand for maximum discretion while they're using it so that no one can see really what they're inhaling and this is a great option if you are really trying to express maximum discretion through your brand or for your users now lastly here we have the C cell disposable pen this is really the penultimate in terms of ease of use there's nothing to recharge there's nothing to refill you simply place your oil inside this disposable pen use it until it doesn't work anymore and then you throw it away and buy another so if either you as a user or as a brand you're choosing to engage this platform just know that if you really want to be able to convert users or provide an experience that it's extremely easy the disposal pen is the way to go because there's just no it's it's basically a proof there's no way to mess this up there's no way to not recharge it correctly or not fill it correctly so that is the entire C cell lineup let's drill down into each of these products individually so that you can learn a little bit more about the finishing and custom branding options available [Music] you", "3qqP7SXaAVE": "hi tim here i just wanted to talk about one of the new cartridge products that we got called core pods this is the core pod hawaiian haze is the flavor of this one these are a little different than all the other cartridges that we carry and that they're not actually a cartridge they're a pod system so it's going to use a different type of battery than the standard c cell that the rest of our our cartridges use but i really like these they hit really well they have really good strains this one is hawaiian haze it has like a really nice smooth coconutty flavor really smooth hits really strong and it's from the brand core which if you tried any of our tiara grow flower it's the same same company that's making these core pods really high quality i just really like them be sure to make sure you have the right battery to go with them if you do get them but it's definitely worth the investment to get the battery because they're great great price great effect i really like", "BOUWQvtjvTs": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to weights the marijuana review show where we help you find folks make sense of your dispensary today we are taking a look at a cartridge here on wheats a good old-fashioned 510 cartridge i've got my trusty battery here nice and plain and then the product we're actually reviewing which is napalm we are reviewing uh our first cartridge anything from the folks at napalm uh and this happens to be their napalm o g um strain so both the company is napalm and the strain is napalm og that we are taking a look at uh so i picked this up at a dispensary in long beach it is 43 dollars for a gram uh which is um about average maybe a little bit cheaper than average uh at this dispensary that i um pick up from um so uh you know keep that in mind with the review 43 bucks uh for a lot of people i know is very cheap for a one gram cartridge but not so much here in long beach um as i said standard 510 so this is no special pod nothing different or weird your normal twisty battery is going to work here uh so i don't know a lot about napalm i know this dispensaries had them for a while i couldn't really find a whole lot of online presence for them outside of listings didn't see a lot but let's go ahead and get this open um and on the back before we really get started here let's go ahead and take a look at the lab testing results if it'll focus up there um there we go uh looks like it's coming in at about 75 thc or so uh which is about average for a cartridge maybe on the slightly lower end but um which is you know maybe commiserate with the price so uh now we know our laptop results we got about our 75 thc let's figure out how we open this somewhat elaborate looking packaging here there are a lot of flaps on it that's glued pretty tight oh we've got a little um authentic holographic sticker here i'm not really sure what they think that putting a sticker that just says authentic on it is going to try to solve but you know i assume anybody can buy that sticker but maybe some psychological assurance uh let's rip that effing sticker off there we go pull it out voila here we are here is our one gram napalm cartridge ooh that is a very different design uh this is not uh this is totally unique never seen anything quite like this i'm not even sure what material this is maybe aluminum some kind of metal here on the tip the oil actually looks pretty good there gold rich um yeah it looks way better than i thought and i'm curious about this cartridge design it's just got the one big intake hole there better than that pretty standard looking heating element all that stuff so let's go ahead and plug it into our 510 thread here and give our napalm og from napalm a try here we go oh wow okay um that is a very different tasting uh strain than i am used to uh it is very extremely piney piney a little slightly bitter earthy um not bad just um a lot more uh aromatic than i guess i was expecting it's quite tasteful uh there's there's a lot going on there um and even pretty robust like bittery aftertaste i'm not usually a huge fan of bitter uh it's not terrible here it's that very earthy kind of bitter taste not sure i love the cartridge design kind of hard to get your like mouth around it it's very short little mouthpiece here uh you know most cartridges have a much longer sorry for the juvenile humor or uh images uh you know much larger place to put your lips and all that uh this is very small it's it's can make it tough to draw from it is unique wow yeah that is just extremely um terpeney there is just a lot of piney earthy bittery taste to it uh i usually like a lot of flavor this one uh i'm not gonna necessarily say it's bad i don't i actually don't think that it is it's just not the kind of strains that i normally go for um and this one is just heavy on the terpenes wow um the cartridge design again a little weird uh the draws are fine i'm getting draws okay but it's hard to sort of get a good seal but in terms of potency no problem saying this is 75 i've taken quite a few draws here feeling the effects quite strong um in terms of the that being the most important aspect is it really going to get you high uh that seems to definitely be true i think this is pretty good oil it's just um you're gonna if you're gonna go for this napalm og you better like the piney earthy tastes of the strains um because this one has it in spades yeah i'm just uh uh so far i would say i have mixed feelings about my napalm og experience let's get another one in here nice hit smooth um you saw i drew for a while excelled for a while and i'm not hacking a lung up which is a good sign um but again that taste is very strong wow uh so uh right now i'm kind of um up in the air about our napalm og experience uh i would say if you really like the napalm as a strain maybe give this a consideration me i'm gonna uh finish off this gram i'm uh looking forward to it actually it's it's a bit of a different strain for me but a bit of a different experience can lead to some fun new uh experiences let's hope maybe who knows um it is different napalm og um let's give it a little bit of a wait and see i'm gonna finish off this gram and then like all our wheat's reviews i'll come back to you guys in the i don't know five days or so it'll take to get through this and i'll let you know exactly what i think of this whole experience i am a little worried about this cartridge design it seems like it might get clogged really easily with this very shallow hole um and there's not like a lot of plastic or anything sort of protecting stuff going in so uh i could imagine this novel cart design having some issues but we shall see it'll take me a couple days to get through it i'll be right back here to let you guys know exactly what i think when we finish this napalm og in just a few days until then stay high stay healthy see you right back here bye guys [Music] welcome back to wheats guys it has been about four days a little over four days since we started our journey with napalm and their strain napalm og uh just a little bit left there so i could have one or two more hits to share with you guys like this one here and well i gotta tell you my thoughts experiences really haven't changed much in four days um i didn't hate it there's nothing fundamentally wrong with it it's just not my favorite cartridge not what i'm gonna go back to um primarily what i found distasteful was the taste um that sort of acrid vaguely burnty piney earthy taste of the napalm uh it just wore on me i never sort of grew accustomed to it as a matter of fact the more i did it the more i kind of didn't want to do it um kind of even had to make myself get to this point to finish this one off i would have moved on to something else um it's not that the oil is bad it feels like the 75 percent as listed it's just not the highest quality the cart design is also so top-heavy i mean most cards are top-heavy by design but this one with this like heavy aluminum tip it's just so hard to keep it balanced um and also if you keep it in your pocket it's guaranteed it's going to turn upside down on itself and it's got that shallow intake hole which got clogged on me more than once had to clean it out it's just not the best experience it's certainly not the worst experience uh you know it's somewhere in that middle of the road and at 43 dollars it's cheap but it isn't the cheapest um and i have had even cheaper cartridges that i have had that i've enjoyed more so i can't give this one a big thumbs up i'm not even sure i can give this one a tepid recommendation uh i do think that there is better stuff out there for you um i may in the future try to review one of napalm's other strains they're not napalm og itself and see if maybe i have better luck uh but that's only if you guys are really curious otherwise there's plenty out there to review we'll take a look at those and we'll take a look at those on our next review whenever that is sometime in our near future i hope you guys will join us for that one until then stay high stay healthy and we'll see you then docs", "BL60ox4I_Kw": "[Music] ladies and gentlemen it is time it is time that you found out if the new cartridge brand that you purchased is a real company or just a package supplier [Music] so this information comes to us through DAP connection comm none of these are of my own investigation unfortunately so thanks to those guys who have no idea I'm doing this so forgive me and I thought it would have been a good idea it was too good of information and just kind of let go and doing my research on these guys that seems like it's pretty legit info but before we get started consider subscribing and punch that like button in the face if you end up staying or half of the video at least so that a deal deal okay so I'm not sure exactly how to do this [Music] you know what I'm just gonna the bran heads roll well I do a little ranting stay hydrated look I'll tell you right now that I've tried spotting faked packaging and it's always like the Mandela effect sometimes you're just like one comma away from being right and one comma is too big to risk a dead cart so I'm happy that these social medias are getting ahold of testing and sharing the information that we need plus a lot of companies are putting QR codes on packaging as well so you can see that they're legit also most legit dispensaries are posting QR codes of their license so you can check to see if those legit yourself as well the bottom line here is that anyone can make counterfeit carts anyone can make counterfeit packaging it's our moral compass that's the problem why are we gonna be lured in to buy something just because there's like a cute 4/20 nurse in front of us and we don't want to look poor there needs to be a change in the system to help professionals and everyday users identify and trust the brands no one seems to own these packaging companies like Mario karts or dank vapes the trail always seems to end somewhere in China it's too bad because there's a lot of great growers out there who make top-quality stuff if you want to feel safe and you want to be able to trust your purchase then I wouldn't buy from anywhere that isn't regulated I'm seeing way too many people unaware of information that's out there I seen the comes below that people just want to learn and grow and then comes another person it makes fun of them for how little they know this is a time for justice a time for parler everyone should be on the same level of information when it comes to legitimacy so as a bonus I'm gonna show you a few brands that pass testing now I'm not here to say that any of these are safe but they did pass phase 3 testing so do your research and what I mean by research is you know go to the brands website they should have authorized retailer on there and is that place that you got your cart from is it on their authorized retailer list and if not email them or message them on IG you know that's what I did with this cart you know this is a the Jade cart and you know I asked them if you know I got it from ie twin palms and the Inland Empire it's it's definitely a little cheap place to go but you know I mean I'm just that places license you know Jade Jade is licensed too so it's just like I mean everything's everything smells like like like a legit brand you know so plus these insights that display test results helps as well but what if research on your particular brand hasn't been posted yet just because it's a new brand doesn't mean that it's not legit you're gonna start seeing new brands popping up in the next few years a lot of older dealers are gonna start going legit with newly formulated newly tested and labeled content I want to make a video on what to look for when you visit these regulated dispensaries I'll have one coming soon but until then I hope this video was helpful things seem to be getting bitter and more ways for anti counterfeiting is on its way like share subscribe for more videos like this and as always stay safe do research and never babe underage peace", "f-DP35X6LaY": "so I'm curious how long does the oil within your cartridge actually last well for our 500 milligram cartridges we'd like to think of it as around 4 to 5 grams of cannabis okay for me it'll last a little less than a week but for my wife it can go a couple weeks okay and for some others it might last a month or two correct right right and - what's the shelf-life of an oil cartridge if I if I happen not to use it right away how long will it last work well with the oil there's not really a shelf-life but sometimes the cannabinoids will degrade over time whether it's with light or heat THC can turn to CBN a CBC can turn to CDL through too much light and that's not harmful but that's not exactly what people might want to have happen correct right so if you have a sativa oil that is high in CBN the CBN is going to make you sleepy which kind of goes against the sativa right and how long would that degradation take to occur it takes a good while at least a year okay so you've got you've got some time yeah it's gonna be gone before that happens and so tell me if I have a oil cartridge and/or it's on the pan or in the package how should I store it storage is probably best at room temperature and you don't want to leave it in your car you don't want to put it in the freezer or the refrigerator just a normal room temperature would be fine and if you live in a hot climate about that if you live in a hot climate it's good to be in air-conditioning if I wouldn't leave it in a car sometimes if if it's too hot in a car the oil will get so thin you're risking possibilities of it leaking got it okay well thank you so much for that answer", "JFpLUTbWBw8": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive what's up guys back here for another [ __ ] video and today you guys already know you can tell from the title today i'm gonna do another informative informative video um if you guys clicked on this video it's probably because you guys have bought a select card and you guys are wondering is that thing real or is it fake because select had a lot of fake cards going on back in the day but that's back when that's back before they had live resin guys back in those days they only had distillate but now guys man they faking they faking the live resin now guys so today your boy is about to put them on blast because um i recently got a select from flower co and um my friend he recently got a select off the streets and he came up to me with it and it was pretty much the same box but totally different and you could just tell it was fake and i felt so bad for him so he let me borrow the he let me borrow it i got the cards and i'm going to show you guys the difference between the real and the fake you probably could kind of tell already from the box which one's real and which one's fake but um before we get into this guys hopefully you guys can hear me it's kind of windy today actually but um let's take a freaking bong ring boys all right guys so to start off off the back we're going to do a little close-up you feel me so you won't see my face for a little bit we're going to do a little close-up talking right quick so check it out all right off the back this is the real one and this is the fake one and let me tell you guys why this is real and this is fake off the bat you can tell it's fake by the colors all hybrids are in the orange box and it's a dark orange it's not this light orange you see the lettering the lettering it's in light orange um the name of the strain the thc content and the amount in there is a lighter orange as you can see also let me get a little closer this color scheme thing right here the yellow orange red pink purple the color scheme is lighter than the one on the rail box those are off jump ways that i knew as well as you could tell by the print they're using different fonts as you can see it's more bold up here is more popping on the real one more plain it's more pop it gives it more of a pop like it's coming out at you you'll see the difference okay and then another way you could tell guys is the real one off jump a real one's gonna have a bar code there you go barcode fake no barcode no nothing sealed up nicely it almost looks almost looks real another way you can figure out that this is fake guys is when you push it out to open see at the bottom you could see that it just pushes straight out when you push this button in on the side guys that i have my finger on right here that i'm tapping you can just push it down and then push the cart straight out you can see from the bottom the box comes straight out on a fake cart it's just a flat bottom you just pop that off this is a flat bottom this has no use maybe after you pop it off you can slide it but it has pretty much no use as you can see the difference the actual box pops out from the bottom when you rip this tape off another way i could tell guys is also from the bottom it's a hybrid and it says indica on the bottom it could obviously be an indica hybrid but it just says hybrid on there and if it doesn't end like a hybrid it will say indica hybrid like this one says sativa hybrid it's a dominant sativa because most you know strains you get these days they're hybrids so um usually they're either sativa dominant or indica dominant this one's a sativa dominant as you can see but this one it just says indica on the bottom and just lemon hash diesel so that kind of threw me off that new that that's what made me know that it was fake basically a lot of things did but also you could tell by the font the font is different as you can see it's a light orange color just the real one's dark orange feel me and the font is way different guys this is a fake just look at the font you know give it a couple seconds make sure it's hd now look at this font you could see that it's much different font but it's very similar they did a good job on it but some of the font stuff is different like the warning sign should be yellow there's no yellow and you can see that the font is different boom boom all right guys those are the ways you can see just by looking at the box this is the real one the tropicana and this is the fake one it's too light like you can tell it's fake guys come on now um another way you could tell is um by the actual oil you see the lemon hash diesel it's a little too light you feel me you can see how light it is i'll take it out the package later but your oil is going to want to be dark like this like the tropicana cookies you see that dark consistency you don't want that you don't or no you want that sorry guys you want that dark consistent you don't want the light consistency you see that it's too light you want that dark because live resin is usually darker but yeah let's pop this open but yeah guys you know there's a lot of you know fake carts out there that are easy for you to you know realize that they're fake because they're mario karts they they got fruity pebbles on it they're named after some kind of cereal brand you know different brands that are trying to entice younger people to buy it basically but you know select it's a little harder to um just drop the box it's a little harder to tell because you know they try to make it look as legit as possible and select is actually a real brand mario karts and those luigi's and all those other carts that are out there the skittles and stuff like that those aren't real brands nintendo is not gonna let you put theirs name on a car guys let's be real so we're gonna open up these boxes real quick there we go so it pops right out guys the real ones you can actually use the button and it pops right out there's no cardboard on top it's just like a plastic thing you have to cut off and then boom you got a cart the fake one as you can see you have to actually peel back a box you feel me you have to peel that back and actually open up the box [Music] then you can slide it out after you already open the box [Applause] the real one it's already out you can already push it out the fake one you have to rip open the actual box bam so like i said guys look at the oil the real one is going to be much darker than the fake one as you can see the fake ones are super light it looks like fake wax usually fake wax looks like this looks like this or clear this is real it's a live resin this looks like a distillate this looks like this joy with this live resin baby so make sure you know what you're getting guys the last test honestly the last test to know if your cart is real or fake is to taste it but i know for a fact that this one's fake as hell so i'm not gonna be hitting it let's inspect the cart see the fake one the fake one sorry guys i'm not even done yet the fake one as you can see has no stickers or nothing a real one is going to have a ca sticker on it my guys as you can see let's see what kind of cartridges they use the c cells look a little different too hopefully i can zoom it in good enough the c cells look different [Music] way different but they're both cell i guess but the writing on this c cell looks more bolder as you can see the writing on the real season looks way smaller but either way we know we know that yellow stuff is fake in that dark stuff this is the real this is the real deal guys fake real you can just look at it and see the difference ca dark color no ca light color looks like a disc joy all right so thank you guys for watching the video though guys more content to come i had to get you guys another fake card review and i felt like select one of the biggest like companies out there other than raw gardeners dizzy so i had to do one of them and my friend came through with a fake one so i had to make sure he ain't smoking that fake [ __ ] but um guys i found my battery with my cart on it so let's hit this card quick little blinker hit for you guys and then let's put this real one on just a real live resin i was gonna do a review on this maybe i'll still do a review guys if you guys want to see a review on this cart comment down below but right now i'm just gonna hit it smoke it i'm not gonna talk much about it and i'm gonna end the vlog [Music] i would hit this but it's it's so blatantly fake so thank you guys for watching this video don't forget to like comment subscribe more videos to come thank you for always being here shout out to everyone who saw my um ounce hot box in the bathroom man that [ __ ] was [ __ ] had me loading man thank you guys for um being in my premiere because i premiered and i was in the chat talking to a bunch of people that were watching my video so shout out to all you guys that were in there one more last rip and i'm out peace [Music] you", "EH4lQsdp6aI": "welcome back to the cannabis packaging show we are contempo specialty packaging episode 4 of the 12 episode saga talking about bakes and carts today Dan in particular wants to be on this show we're about to bring Nick on the show dan was like I got a lot to say here so we got a bunch of options we want to show you some creative options Dan anything before we kick this off let's jump right into it I love it alright and good so take it away okay original a sliding box kit you've seen that at the trade shows some people go up to make the traitors like I would never use that that is so different from my branding yes we customized things it's not for you it's all about what you're about this is another one that is very popular it's our that was one of our first products that people really fell in love with they're like wow I see how this is different I see how this is better that's out there it's a nice texture paper on the bottom and a soft touch paper with a black hot stamp on the top all right they're board insert in this one let's keep it let's keep it rolling rapid fire because we get a lot to go through this is a less expensive option it's our blister fold or I don't have one that's open but this is one long piece and the blister pops in and you fold it tapes together and you can customize it any way you want we can use all of our foils spot UV any kind of coloration you want or a nice textured paper if you want to go that route less expensive way that you could still make very customizable and look great so it's going to say is you have adhesive on that so you don't need any heat sealing equipment and that's something that a lot of people have liked about that concept all right customizable blisters is another two piece box it just has a nice angle to it so it has the colorful feel there and inside we have an Eevee a foam insert which is a dense foam it's a soft touch of varnish on it as well that's just a wood pattern that we printed it still has that you know luxe natural look folding box but it's on a foil printed on foil board so it has a nice shimmer to it a little more bling a lot of people they're looking at the cosmetic market as what their cannabis brands are about and I think it's good but I want to make a point that I think people should still because a lot of people are thinking that way make sure you still maintain your unique angle so don't go cookie cutter try to think of how you're going to be separate from other people who are thinking in this cosmetic mindset a lot of people are using the vault box for their cartridges this one doesn't have an insert the vault box exclusive to contempo specialty packaging yes patent pending patent pending child resistant certified trademark trademark the two began which we shown in our pre-roll show pr\u00e9val show but also another option so the dates this is a non contempo product but we want to show it because it looks great we have a pattern on the outside which matches the products on the inside I think that would be awesome with the disposable pen where you match the pattern on the pen custom pen match the pattern to the box like the Kate Spade pen so sometimes you can get inspired from other industries and do the same thing and get the same advantages that those people did but this is another paper product through peaceful signing box the feedback has been and I quote outstanding on that box and the texture in the field this is not a contempo product but we think it looks really nice it's a textured paper on the bottom on the top and it's a very simple on folding box good job it's not super sturdy but it still looks really nice and they have a folding board insert inside really cool of that contrasting look so you can have you know one look where everything's really uniform everything's really clean or you can have really nice contrasting you can see the color contrast the craft versus the board and then you can see the embossing contrast that they've done here really really cool look and again they've done it well so you can go with either of those and I think they've done a nice job on that and the reveal of this icon as you open it is also a really nice touch yeah so bloom farms has outstanding branding outstanding packaging this is a good example of how you can make something as simple as a folding box and still be able to charge a premium price for it and compete in that premium market so this is a $70 product here so this is a reusable vape pen along with the charger so again really good job here and using some nice craft board materials dressing it up a bit with your branding the branding does in fact match the pen that was included in the Box done a good job I think of also matching this story that they're telling like we talked about the Instagram feeds the social media campaign that the provide they live and really having that match up with the packaging of the story they're telling in the stores good company good things and just a couple of different options that you can use to put the actual product in this is a vac form in here which is molded plastic that we would mold specifically around your product for a perfect fit and this is a board insert much like that Bloomfield box the board just folds in to create the cavity and then of course we have the EBA foam these are not see our boxes nor was the bloom farmer one so it states that demand CR on the primary packaging that's not going to work in many states the exit bag is still sufficient until a certain point in time that's been marked so just keep that in mind that we're well aware of all the CR laws and we're showing you options because it's currently available and once the primary packaging is required to be CR probably won't be seeing these things from us but the wallbox is still a perfect option solves all the problems all the world's problems are next looking sharp in that suit you're coming on the next episode of hope you know that oh yeah of course all right good all right anything else you guys want to add live studio audience Manny you gotta need to say guys thanks for watching see on the next episode", "zNw380j9ctY": "hey again everybody this is Ken eccentric films back at you with another strain review this will be my second recreational cartridge review of Illinois cartridges if you recall in my first video I reviewed the Cresco kosher tangi liquid live resin cartridge so for my second video I thought I would explore a different company another one of the more prominent companies that I've seen here especially in the Chicagoland area but in Illinois in general Verano and the strain I went with was mag landrace I don't know too much about the strain other than the fact that I was drawn to it because of the word landrace in there because I am a big plant enthusiast so whenever I see the word landrace it grabs my attention but the mag landrace is an iranian landrace that was originally propagated in Illinois according to verrano's website so this is a 0.5 gram oil cartridge compared to the Cresco cartridge which was also a point 5 gram that that one cost $85 and this cartridge was $77 both of those figures are after-tax so a little bit cheaper since the Cresco Koecher tangi is the only other recreational cartridge i've tried here Illinois I'll sort of use that as my frame of reference and reviewing this cart so with that said in comparing those two I would say that Cresco Koecher tangi had a more vibrant profile in its flavor however I wouldn't say this was flavorless by any means it just didn't sort of linger in your mouth as long which i think is sort of a pleasurable thing from certain carts the flavor for this one was sort of a piney spicy cookies sort of taste and it was sort of creamy in that regard but it wasn't anything super potent in terms of flavor but on the other side of the coin this mag landrace cartridge to me was infinitely more potent than the last one which was not you know a weak heart by any means in terms of its effect but this was just super couch lock inducing really good for relaxation I would advise people that have had sort of like too much of a body high before to be a little cautious with how much you use this cartridge because the the pure indica label is very accurate I would say it's very sedating so you don't get panicked thoughts but you can get a very strong body high which I know for some people can cause them to feel more panicked but yeah that's about it with respect to the price I think this one was a little cheaper but the effect was much stronger the only difference was that it wasn't quite as volatile in its flavor but that's just a matter of perhaps different strains and different processes and the other one is liquid live resin and this one's just labeled as an oil cart so I don't exactly know what it is if it's BHO or you know any other kind of concentrate but that's about it overall I'd say Verano did a great job with these carts and I'm definitely gonna try out more of their strains they have some great looking ones let me know if you've tried Verano let me know what other carts you're trying right now and which ones I should check out but thanks everyone hope you have a great day", "2y5F430CS2A": "hey guys as that picture we're checking out the rhythm cartridge and about a third of the way through this thing and let's take a look at the light too you know it's it's okay it's not really great and it's not really strong this is the energy one and it's about 70 to 73 percent THC and you know it's it's not terrible it's just not strong as the other cars and considering that it's $45 which is the same price as other cards that makes it not that great of a value because I right before this I was eating this the serene heart and the serene cart kind of blows us away and then I was also hitting the can of eight if I got at the same time as this and that blows it away so comparing to the other Nevada brands there's just a lot stronger out there for the same price now if someone wants something it's not super blow you away this might be it the one thing I do notice about this this is the energy one and it really doesn't make you slow it doesn't really make you that tired and that is a good thing however if I was looking for an energy one the city trees energy disposable that I tried I don't know a few months ago I thought was more energetic than this and this will still get you there you just got to hit it more so essentially the value is not as good because I got hit this five times you get the same effect is hitting you know like the city trees or roots like twice then that's means I'm paying more than twice as much for to get the same effect so for someone that's not like a hit at all the all the time kind of person like most of you put it right for our site are you know and this might be a good cartridge for you if you want somethin weaker or you want something like you know for your dad who's smoked in the 70s this might be a really good option I think it's I think they'll come back with something stronger and we'll be testing with them again and it'll be better this is usually how how it goes you know we try some of these brands well these smaller bands when they come out it seems like they got something like sixty some seventy seven percent and then come back and it's way better you know and I would say that happen with lucid oils the lucid oils original I tried their syringes like 68 percent I was like it's really good oil but that's strong then they come back with the new one it's 86 and it blows you away so I think rhythm will come back with something stronger and I'll definitely trying them again other thing I didn't like that much about this was the taste this has more of a co2 ish taste than a distill it tastes I prefer that nice distill it taste that one of the cleanest tasting distill 'ti kind of taste was that can of a taupe cartridge I really like that one so this on straight not so hot on taste not so hot room for improvement totally and I bet you will be reviewing this again and will be much better at some point but for now the rythm cartridge is probably something I would not get again when there's other cartridges available but it may be a good option for someone who does want to get too tired and you know isn't you smoking stuff that's as strong as how strong some of these really strong cards are at this point so we'll take a hit you can see how it hits good thing about it real Cecil hardware I believe let's just triple check that pretty sure Tyrell so you saw let's see yep you got the Jupiter it's real see so so we'll go ahead and take a hit on this and you guys can see how it hit so hold on one sec so now we'll give it a head you guys can see how this thing hints it's good yeah I mean I'm down in my absolute best C cell battery let someone borrow my vessel so this is still a pretty good battery that's king cloud mini I think it works really good clones but still gives it a good hit and yeah it's just not as strong as the other ones but it's alright so not gonna get this one too thumbs up but not giving exactly two thumbs down either it's just something I wouldn't get at this point and I think in the future they'll make it stronger and then the rhythm cartridge something I'll probably try again definitely thanks for watching guys this dab connection and have a great week", "qzeEWxC1UQc": "smoking man growin and watch it fall down [Music] what is up DTC's got it real hanging out super psyched to have a new friend Julian from Bab logic over hey thank you for having me really yes yes hey I appreciate you guys blew it up at the deconcentration celebration yeah yeah yeah no it was a fun time yeah you took home you took home I think was third place in there boys what was this again you brought some with you yeah we can each owns the HT batter it's like really high terpene high potency yeah this is oops this is one to remember right here you brought two of them I like yeah I brought a couple kami I brought a truck Korean or trap cookies and so what's your specialty if you guys were dab logic what are y'all known for um we create high quality you know highly purified high terpene solving with hash oils solvent less overall solvent list so we specialize in ninety micronized soil we also specialize in the different types of bras in all the way from our newest product which is like the HT batter's all the way through like the HT show weight HT what's that mean hide your bathing yeah basically anything you know reaching on the 15% you know mark we consider pretty high tech 15 yeah 15% terpenes just pretty freakin high yeah especially for solving lists you know most concentrates are around six to eight percent on the standard market really a lot even less than that most most standard solvent less concentrates that you'll find on the market are probably about four to five even all right so help me out there help me evaluate concentrates what makes a good concert we're going to the dispensary together what we looking for yeah so when I go in and I look for a good concentrate first thing I do is you know you don't get to smoke the product in the dispensaries know you got to evaluate yeah you have to evaluate it either you know through your nose through sight you know right and then through prior you know prior time smoking either something that like that or but they could think about the colors beautiful on that yeah color colors is that you know is that to live or die by totally a giveaway you know I mean if you're looking at something and it's green or it has like you know a really dark amber to it you know it might be dagger dated it might have had heat stress you know something like that or it could be just the nature of the plant you know something like the truck the truck cookies that's always gonna have at least on the phenotype that's being passed around right a lot of the hash and being created from it right now yes it has that orange you know you cue to it yeah it's almost purple in the hue you know and when you press that and refine it it becomes like this orange almost amber like but that's beautiful orange I got a glowing orange I got no problem yeah yes smoked something that's glowing or it's the earth tones that I have a problem with yeah what does it are that's a sign that chlorophyll it's Asano's beat up too much yeah so when a plants cut if it's cut fresh you know a lot of these plans a lot of people are making fresh frozen and for plants cuts cut fresh it's gonna release Greenleaf volatiles which are different esters Josh aldehydes and you know alcohols that are released by the plant those end up actually soluble eyes in chlorophyll chlorophyll has a few different colors chlorophyll can be anywhere from purple all the way to you know the green that we know about well like purple is that like when plants purple up at the end is that chlorophyll that's so yes there's something to do with the chlorophyll and in the biosynthetic pathway that it actually takes right it's either heated or as it's you know matures or ages but a lot of times that's antioxidants is well produced by the plant such as anthocyanin or something similar to that those antioxidants even have somewhat of a smell to them even they're found in a lot of berries they're found in God and things like that so that's you kind of you know start to realize okay the purple plans have this berry-like or grape-like kind of smell to it it's kind of through that anti oxidant pathway and the enzymes that produce those right so and that's all based on the genetic makeup of the plant I have a very natural next question how the hell did you learn all this stuff man you go to school for this are you just a Googler so there's not much information out there there's a lot of there's a lot of people who are pursuing to find the actual chemistry the actual science behind a lot of this stuff right some of that has been published what has been published you know you can find Ethan Rousseau dr. moosh dr. Musallam alright people like that okay they are pioneering a lot of this stuff and you're just reading their white papers and you read then read their work and then we also you know we work with scientists on our team as well we have a scientist from the University of Boulder who worked in the Caine lab and we're so he's an extra he's a expert in genomics so okay bioinformatics and things like that Wow it's so crazy that in the cannabis company have to have a genomics expert yeah you learn how to hire them I mean yeah it's starting to evolve to the point where now if we want to really you know pursue this we have to understand it more solving this hash is something that's kind of coming back from where it was you know in the past that's all there was there were thousands of years ago if you were to look at you know what cannabis crasher from you know it was charas and you know things on the hands it was the right amount of heat and pressure under pressure that you're able to even remove it from your hand or even able to change the right the chemistry of it because they didn't start smoking it you know it hated to be decarboxylated in order for that to happen it had to be left out in the Sun for a certain amount of time or it had to be heated to a specific temperature for a certain amount of time right you know and through this alchemy that you know has evolved I mean they found plants that were more beneficial for those processes you know that's why what we know of today as the hash varieties come from a very small group of plants because those came out of you know Afghanistan and Grammy Hall and you know places like that that we're actually using hash as a resource for a long time yeah makes sense that's pretty cool I'm just trying to think like everybody's got a different art you know growing can be an art shift photography can be an art what's your what you ought man yeah the art so the art really is involved with just uncovering mechana bees resin you know there's so much there that we don't really know about there's so your the extract artists I don't even know what's your title at that company I don't have one I founded dialogic founder - ice that's a great title because you're gonna have to do anything after what you already did your work no I still I still work with hash you know every day I'm still with the plants and every charge in my fingernail exactly no you just don't think yeah but uh yeah I'm still with the resin every day you know I who I started creating who I created that logic with right was some close friends that also still to this day are are doing different uh different extracts and working with the resin so it's a big industry man yeah so I wait how many people is we just laughing but you came to my studio and saw my work yeah about five guys yeah they all stopped and took a break to take it does take a couple dabs from you totally yeah yeah what's your work scene like what's it like to work at dab logic how many people to start with so I have five people on the the actual extraction team my California team is now expanding I have one guy out there right now but we're in the process of getting expanding that team our lab is just getting the CEO so we're just getting we're just able to move in your building out we had to you know gut the whole place and redo it all for insulation and you guys to talk of something logical you know the whole nine moved in a huge walk-in freezers you know cuz we have to we're taking a lot off you know off these mountains and in Humboldt so yeah can we talk about that for a second just said I was asking about your like I was in Cali for the I don't know can I call it Cali I heard that don't live in California called Cali yeah I mean it's humble it's where it's at right here you know Northern California yeah so you were there we're supposed to hang out last week and you're like dude its I'm out here still harvesting yeah and then I'm like alright so you tell me about what you got a 120,000 square foot indoor there is that right so no no no not that quite that big we got 20,000 square feet makes you like a computer we have hundred acres up off the grid and other 600 acres that's being built built out still isn't fully that 600 acres and fully permitted or license yet I'm not pulling anything off it yet but that's a beautiful property that property goes from the top of a mountain all the way down to the valley there's a river there should be good water oh and I make important water as important mazing water there's huge ponds and the property and streams and so that and that's your your founder that's your baby right there so that I'm partnered with the company Verde Verde natural they're out of they were started here in Denver by guy Chuck and he eventually partnered with who now is the main owner of the company Jeff he has expanded this company you know dramatically he's who took on dialogic and we got and flew it up and I mean you gotta have balls or night ball if you have to know what you're doing to first off do a hundred acres some people have success enough with your 100 acres to do 600 acres yeah yeah service schedule for that has to be amazing totally and I mean you know we don't grow on the whole hundred you know there's a lot that goes into actually running these this big of a farms and you're talking you know huge you know ponds and huge almost irrigation lines that are actually sure culvert it into the into the ground I run a 20 acre bamboo farm yeah yeah purty I was like yeah I was like yeah you need water you need a well you need huge yeah you need a water cleaning system yeah yeah yeah and we're trying to you know be all organic and you know the whole soil all that come on let's get into the growth first off how the hell do you do living I okay I got it you find a place with good soil if you're gonna do living soil on 100 or 600 acres I mean we bring in we do a mixture of local humble Mendocino County dirt and then we bring in some Canadian soil as well yeah yeah that just sound great water that stuff's yeah it's amazing that already is microbial active when it when it gets there you know it already has a nice you know uh humic body to share sure it's not ain't nothing sterile yeah yeah you know if it's and I think they do inoculate that would mycorrhizae don't they I know that they pull out of that out of some plots that they have along the old-growth and that God is definitely as major fungal and bacterial actually seen a peat mine or a peat bog I don't even mind yeah back near uh an old growers to have I Drive by it and it was like whoa what is that thing it's just cutting into the earth yeah I know yeah the pits interesting there that's a finite resource in there you know yeah it is yeah yeah I will say Florida peat not as good as a reason they imported from Canada so that's actually really cool that's alright so as long as we're talking grow how do you give quality and quality outs yeah how do you have first off indoor grows got to be tremendously different than an outdoor grow right yeah completely different different processing then on your end here that your the extract you noticed I mean definitely I was talking to somebody I was talking to it was loving in her eyes yesterday and she was talking about how to be I was asking her how to be a you know a really top quality extract artist she goes get to know your resin I think it was friend she can always that originally said it her for get to know your resin you know everything's different you know your room and your resin is gonna be different absolutely yeah when you move from grow to grow or you're starting a new grow and it's new growers its new people it's a new soil mix it's a new everything sure you know it is scary you know you're coming in with varieties you know it's not like we can really transfer varieties from state to state ads so it's like we're having to find and source varieties in California wait really that we haven't ran yet but I mean you can't or you can't uh so I mean a wedding cake can find its way over an account we have wedding cake we have like all you know I know you would never talk about other people no there is there is ways to definitely get them over they audit and through in through tissue culture and things like that we can actually legally do this stuff if we're sending over callous and undifferentiated cells we can actually send that across state lines and technically it's a gray area sure it's not a cannabis plant so they can't call you out on it you know I'm just sitting here being like oh it's so silly you should be able to smuggle stuff anywhere you want but I think about all I'm from South Florida you've got people from South America and all over the place that are smuggling little plants in because it's tropical these plants from their home they are bringing so many diseases literally Jersey palm decline they have straight-up palm decline there because people are bringing palm seeds and growing palm seeds that were laminated yeah it's a huge deal yeah it's scary I mean you know we truly we want to find varieties that we know are gonna work right but we also want to be able to work with as many things as we can so it's really just finding the lineage and delving into where are these plants coming from can i source plans of that lineage from whoever you know in the area that's mainly what we look into do you have any other growers in your area cannabis or hemp because that would be a freakin nightmare if you had people growing hemp for biomass no it's okay in Humboldt County there is a lot of cannabis growing you know there's tea farm everywhere you look is there pollen I'm in there saying if there's pollen in the air and your she gets pollen there could potentially be pollen there could potentially be molds from other Wright farms and things like that so we have to be very careful you know a with who we let on the property be with you know how we filter and maintain the air quality and our property is this completely outdoor these are greenhouses what are we doing with the the big properties are outdoor they're full season that's just right in the Sun you know exposed to as many you know anything that happens yes there's a greenhouse you see matter space in that even there there will be greenhouses there will be all sorts of stuff that I put on those properties it's still gonna have full Sun and greenhouse or full Sun depending on how you grow depending on you know what varieties you're doing you could have very good full Sun that goes well depending you know how your season is out there really it's seasonal you know you could have a fall that's extremely rainy and damages your whole crop in the six-day period you know you could have a fall season that's sunny amazing and warm and there's no rain in sight all through flower and everything was beautiful she kept your dust down and you maintained your property and you did well enough to be able to like oh yeah I can you know harvest these plants that are gonna be very well do very well for you know some of those extracts yeah I mean you're talking about hmm having some problems you know if the weather is wrong mm-hmm or doesn't cooperate you know that basically catastrophic crop failure totally yeah we're doing all sorts of stuff that we can to mitigate that as the season progresses you know we're watching weather we're watching humidity we're watching as things are moving up the coast and into the mountains it's what you do though well we can prepare you know like if if a heavy rains coming you know that's gonna be very damaging the other show if you if things aren't stake properly your trellis properly not like that it's gonna just destroy your field you know just based on that alone so that's um you can do not even though huge raindrops or hail hitting those bus cream yeah yeah and I mean we we're trying to develop different rain protection systems that we will put up once the plans get more in the flour and it'll just be short little lean-to type frames that basically go over and they'll be big but they're only gonna be able to protect a few of the chosen plans right one it's not gonna be the whole thing you know so we'll start going through the that whole property was done from seed so that is also we're doing Fino hunting there so you need that yeah some special ones over there yes I mean there's we pop 2,000 seeds you know so it's a big female hunt we got the varieties from a guy Jesse his company as bio vortex they do amazing stuff at Humboldt Wow he's in another leaf Trinidad area not actually I think his farm is actually really cool know him I think I have run into him before yeah he's a great guy he I could probably swing it his way too but uh he does so many talks and writing and get a home but sure absolutely in a cannabis and absolutely gonna get your culture you know my beef is with everybody that's that's putting their their lives on the line their livelihoods on the line for cannabis is that in Florida if I were to have you know 600 acres of palm trees and they got a disease or they got wiped out by a hurricane you know what happens I get to buy myself a Mercedes man the government comes in it gives me 50 70 90 percent of what the hell that entire crop was worth and I had a check for three million you know I'm sorry if it's that many acres yeah yeah tens or twenties a million oh yeah I just sold my entire inventory before before it was even mature yeah if we get hit with you know as I guess outdoor cannabis growers there's no catastrophic insurance for us I'm sure there will be once event organization happens but kind of gotta be hard to get people to throw their life savings into you know or I should even say it's just an investor and that's and that's the thing and that's why you know we do what we do you know that logic is like we need the best material we you know that when you're getting something from us it's going to be the best because we can't take some thing that failed you know write anything that failed it's it's it's either has to be compost or its you know if if if it can be you know saved in any way from hydrocarbon extraction but that's you know what's scary about that is right people you know lose a crop or something like that and they pull it to that and it's who knows what mycotoxins heavy metals things like that are contained within that yeah how do you feel about BHO you solvent list newt or what I typically only smoke solving this hash um just because you want to solve this company yeah and I'm you know I'm in the industry I see what happens you know with I do carbon extractions and don't get me wrong there are some amazing right carbon extractions out there and it's important that you know that that side of the industry exists in Georgia they're you know keeping the earth clean and they're you know doing what it takes you know I could see one be one type you know blast rooms and things like that and I think it's fine the exist bad promotion for the cannabis industry for extracts of if they're blowing up with Dirk scanning themselves we don't we don't want that and you know a lot of times people don't know the difference between distillate or solvent lives or something like that you know found someone like us someone like us would know because it's its second nature whatever by now but it's like you know when I talked to somebody from Wisconsin or I talked to someone sharing Oklahoma or Alabama or you know somewhere like it's all good there even people out in California you know northern Northern California you know they're there's so much distillate there's so much hydrocarbon extraction everybody's running to ashes big freakin farms up there okay there's nobody that can press come close to processing that size of farms yet which is you know I mean so it's like look like a factory over there Shh I mean they are a lot of the hydrocarbon facilities around 24/7 and yeah I can take on a thousand pounds a day Jesus mm-hmm Wow what do you think you guys's capacity is gonna be in California I mean you're gonna need to have some see you've got hundreds of acres yeah it's an it's not quite that big in again we're selective for solve unless gotta take the best out of these fields we take only the best so it's it's something that when we're doing and we do about a hundred pounds fresh per per wash is what will got we what we do got um so that only happens two to three times a week typically it's something that takes a lot more effort you know through the whole process it's something that we can't really just throw it in the tube blasts it out throw write purge oven and let it sit for three weeks it's like there's a lot of processing and there's a lot of maintaining and being very careful and being you know quick but also you know taking your time yeah what how do you get the young quality and quality out when it comes to when it comes to you know Roz and I guess how do you get it to where what if you have a problem I guess is what I'm trying to say in the grow yeah soil so it's kind of tough to correct that yeah it's some things off balance if there's you know some something that may have been watered wrong or you know fed improperly yeah that a B word what about bugs bugs I mean bugs are definitely a problem you know if you're if you're dealing with large scale cultivation but you know if you're maintaining cleanliness you're maintaining rigorous integrated pest management systems leaving meaning predatory insects very cool in vegetative state never in flower it's also using you know specific essential oil sprays or oil sprays that could be used in vegetative state never in flower beautiful you know one thing that we do is we make sure that our products aren't sprayed if it's coming to me cannot even come close to being sprayed it can't and that's why if a farmer that's why we have to be so selective that's why we have to grow and we have to inspect product you know even if like our own farmers are out there there they might be doing something to save their own crop so we have to go out there and inspect that and make sure that's either not happening or if it is happening we need to move on and get to the plants that you know or part of the crop or even move through the crop altogether you know and only take you know something from yang on their farm I had tasted and by no means a connoisseur I like extracts don't get me wrong but I'm not a connoisseur and I tasted something that I was like this tastes like sulfur like it looks good he's like sulfur like obey me use the sulfur burner and you know a little bit too late that could be you know there's especially you know if you're an old-school farmer right and you're doing things you're trying to be organic you know you could use a sulfur burn you know but that nowadays most people are aware that that comes through a in the cannabis smoke would be way more in the concentrates you know so but there are varieties you can lineage you know coach lineage that could the diesel lineage that could lean towards like that skunky sulfuric almost type smell got a stir so you know if it's important that know your grower it's important to know you're know where your weeds coming from grow your own most importantly I mean that's why we you know it's why we do what we do is so that we can grow something that you can be certain is going to actually be something that you would drove you ain't smoke you know we don't we would never put something something in our products that you wouldn't I wouldn't personally use myself there's so many people that I just let like b-grade stuff pass through just because they're like oh nobody will know what he can tell showing in extracts it's this or that or it's going to this dispensary they'll buy I've been dispensaries and I'm like oh you buy the shift exactly yeah so it's important for us you know to sharing you know relationship with the growers and maintain the relationship with people that were selling to you know yeah what's up with the dispensaries on the other end because you kind of middleman as far you can't go in and actually rep your product during no I mean some dispensaries allow us to come in and you know frame help market help train route kind of create awareness yeah if you come in you don't know what's sitting on the Shelf right why are you gonna buy it you know well like you got this pen people are in the cartridges it's kind of going away from that you know putting your extract in a pen and having to reload it these things are super low-profile super convenient what's the first off go into a dispensary you know be like hey what kind of good cartridges do you have and sometimes they'll go none don't buy them here they're all mix of propylene glycol and stuff like that what's the secret first just cuz I'm in the cartridges because I'm picked this one up so cuz I'm gonna hit it so something like this out what's the secret to make them something a good cart what's the difference in a good part of a shitty cart this has no cut this has none of the propylene glycol MCT oil any bogus food grade this or that else is 100% from cannabis and it's also and lessly made so it's it's a high terpene extract put into a vape cart is what it is it's not something that somebody made to get rich quick it's yeah this is real hash I remember they made more convenient yes something you could melt your hash into and then you could put it in your vape pens yeah and I mean it's terrible there's a little bit of post-process like you you if you just stick show into a cart it's gonna crystallize it's gonna kind of coagulate and it'll be hard to smoke lawyers you know so creating the proper terpene ratio and things like that is very important you know and that's is that strain dependent or that's very strained dependent with us it's a hundred percent strain depending because we can't really manipulate the terpenes too much or the constant we can somewhat manipulate concentration right can't we can't change what's there you know it's like if what's there is there so we're just kind of working with what we have to kind of make this yeah makes sense if you guys make carts you guys make it what does he cause batters yeah the the carts something we've been doing for the past two years year and a half something to make it more convenient sitting so that also somebody who doesn't have a rig and doesn't typically dab right can actually use our product this is super this never really happened before the vape car it was not quality was yeah yeah so it's like being able to formulate you know the get it from this to that was huge yeah it was the game for us and really has made it so that my mom my grandma my aunts and uncle rate of have able to have been able to try my product whereas before they can I get a really good order yeah even though what it was you know couldn't couldn't even wrap their head around it yeah but we we you know what with most hash makers you know the the goal isn't I need my car nice oil you know a lot of times we're taking now because so many people love the rosin and things like that we're taking our ninety micron pressing that right having specified batches that are ninety might come or 90 120 mixtures sure like that the higher grade microns and that's what's getting some that's more often than not that's what we're pressing now because it's just what people are after and water hash is also good side of the market but it's it probably accounts for twenty twenty percent of the actual solving with sales and those riding the whole grand scheme of things seems to go quick do no otter hash yeah it's expensive yeah you know the high grades there's unless you're doing you know extremely large batches there's not a crazy amount of it you know maybe a couple hundred grams you know something like that so it's something that's very limited something that's not you can't take something low grade and make it into ninety micron ISIL it has to be grown perfectly it has to be done perfectly actually washed perfectly so we presented and given you the consumer perfectly as well you know so we have to keep it maintained you know from start to finish you know a cold environment on it you know we have to make sure the people who are selling our product right the consumer are also keeping in the right environment and then we have to let our consumer know and they have to have the education to be able to know to put this in the fridge or to keep it cold they asked something that maintains that you know environment we have a kegerator and we never use it having a kegerator in the house is actually a bad idea so why I started hiding my dad's in there man they you just don't have enough refrigerators once people know you keep them in the fridge yeah they figure it out me yeah every fridge in the house yeah bad hey we're talking about these cartridges you obviously if you were in for a year and a half ago you were getting in the days you were a little bit ahead of the trend ahead look her how they how do you keep a head into curve and what's coming up next around the next curve for cannabis yeah we're always trying to keep ahead next big curb you know we're looking at I see a lot of people are like pushing for you know really like colored high flavor hi hi flavor profile resins like 710 it's white yeah yep yep so it's really it's shooting for that shooting for the holler proper color high terpene me but also still maintaining you know the right you know potency you know because if you're pulling too early on some of this stuff you're just getting something that tastes like cucumbers and like wait up just doesn't even get you that high it's like if you want something that has the full body flavor like you have to take it to its prime maturity you know we we have to get out of the kind of mentality that ambered trichomes like when it starts to amber that's starting to show my maturity cuz that's like that's already overly matured you know like yes we're trying to pull a little bit before that ever even happens before the first amber trichome happens like the day before that would be the perfect you know yeah I'm just saying and this is I mean cuz you're trying to bring something great to your customer something extraordinary so when they try all of them they like to dab logic that's that's the one I like yeah how educated is the customer did they get it a shopping price do you have to it's just like cmed you're gonna we can educate them on that stuff or they end up buying hemp seed oil for you know eight dollars on Amazon and thinking oh everything is good ya know I mean education is huge most people they don't know the difference between like quality organic solvent list and some low-grade hydrocarbon I straight up they don't eighteen dollar shadow yeah and with CRC tech like the color mediation for like hydrocarbons and things like that I heard something about what the hell is color remediation they're pulling chlorophyll and you know oxidants out of out of the hash you know which is great because that leads to a higher grade hash but it's also like discern or both from like something that is high grade you know it's like okay this this just is high grade because I grew it right I maintain it I took care of it I processed it right you know this came from any run of a mill place with who-knows-who doing them whatever and it's coming out looking the same you know that's the that's the thing yeah plastic surgeries you know a couple yeah so it's gonna be then you know now going back through the customer finding you know the nose the trained eye things like that being able to actually understand what what you're getting you know yeah and that's hard you know if we're we're still in the phases of trying to teach people what good genetics are you know and you more if they're not even understanding the Terp why those genetics are good the terpenes that they're producing the cannabinoid profiles that they're producing them we're gonna be like then they're gonna just be sitting there clueless when anybody can call anything whatever they were you know I mean most of the country thinks independence atiba there's two varieties of cannabis one gets you up let me get you down exactly yeah and it's who's that well who's your I've heard I was actually at the dispensary one time it must be right after Social Security checks were issued hmm to what everybody was 55 60 years old so you know I mean they were older yeah I was just kind of wondering like where the growth is I actually was talking to somebody and they were telling me look the people that are smoking weed are already smoking weed you know what we're really after now is the people that aren't smoking weed the other 85% of population we're looking for you guys say you know ever think in that that way or is that why you got stuff like these pens yeah they really make it I think what the vape is designed for its to give it to anyone who can basically take a hit you know if you can take a hit you can try this pen there isn't even a button on it right it's magnetic it's just you know it just slides right in yeah it's so easy to use it's nothing like heating up a nail and take your day about measuring a dose all that kind of stuff this you just measure with the pup knows how hard you're drawing you know so it's it's per a buddy of mine called me I've been talking about this guy because I feel terrible about it a guy knew back in Florida had a stroke and you just case just told me he goes my body's hanging off me you know it's my hair and my leg of my arm and he's like it starts hurting and I was met recommended that he grabbed one of these pens and check him out it's not a cannabis user and magically he got one and he's like dude I like it and it's really cool cuz in the beginning you could take like a couple of one hit and you're like wow yeah I have a friend that has psoriatic arthritis shoutout to Paul and yeah it's really bad man where sometimes he just can't move his hands and it sucks cuz he's uh has like a technical job as well he will take one hit of the right strain and he just goes like immediately he goes I'm all better I'm all better mm-hmm David it's amazing and I was absolutely I don't know if you got any medical cannabis stories or not I mean like that is so inspirational to me totally my yellow rooftops you know my grandma actually has went through cancer twice she has you know used cannabis to help her right through different chemo treatments and things like that she's fully off chemo now and she's only using cannabis and CBD you try to help and you know so that's kind of where she's at sure the whole world would change their mind on cannabis if somebody handed them a joint when they had a stomachache okay know what I mean that's all they would have to do is when he had a snowman somebody joint they got I instantly feel better I can actually empathize with the psoriatic arthritis guy cuz think about having a horrible stomach game taking one hit of weed and being like I can get up off the floor I can get out of bed you know terrible state your intestines I've never been ashamed of cannabis always been me Oh doing what I can to let people know that this legit shouldn't be considered deal with all the other drugs while the other armful drugs know it's a medicine I agree 100% yeah and that's kind of what we do - it's a logic is the reason we're organic the reason we choose solvent less is because we want to give you the purest truest medicine you know we don't want anything getting in the way between you and nature in this plant you know we're just presenting you with as close as you can get to it you know so it's it's then up to you you know to use this medicine however you choose you know whether it's dope and your consciousness or whether it's to heal your ailments or just a plain old you know relax you know like all of those things are so important you know to de-stress and to unwind like it's part of why we all use cannabis and it's so so important you know and that's why I think cannabis users as a whole have that mentality in that mindset of for lack of a better word we're chill you know sure it affects you I think I think it affects your brain you smoke enough weed it shows you out of it that's actually a generalization know some crazy [ __ ] just smoke weed all day they're not the least bit chill oh well yeah no I mean thinking of one that was a pink shirt you know just knows how much weed they use but let me ask you a question so we're talking about the expansion we're talking - everyone should smoke weed all right they everyone should consider it a medicine anyhow so do you want federal legalization that's a super double-edged sword they're super sharp one I mean I don't look at medicine as pharmaceutical in any way you know I hate do it yeah they do they do they think you know put it into a pill or make it something that's completely controllable something that we can maintain and control reacts down to the milligrams same way oxycontin is a molecule that they can control exactly you know and by doing that they take away the whole plan the full spectrum you know aspect of it and using THC on its own I mean all the studies show that it's way way way less beneficial than using in conjunction with Kurt beanies and other cannabinoids that are found actually within those plants so no to federal legalization just cuz just gonna commoditize I mean federal legalization I think will be the last thing that happens what I think will end up happening is states will end up partnering with one another we'll be like we'll see California Oregon Washington State interstate they'll partner what's going in there yeah all of a sudden you know it'll open up other other avenues for other states and it'll be able to follow a trail through our country one way or another you know and as long as that money files which follows a trail the federal government somehow will probably be ok yeah exactly I mean it's everybody knew it was coming you know it was like the Jack Herer initiative of 2012 it was his whole thing you know it's prophecy it's good there's no way you're super you can't win an election by saying that you're against cannabis there's no way yeah once cuz we've been fighting for so long brother kids yelling it yeah I love it I love it worriers boom and we're back and magically we're taking - yo so where can people get this stuff anyway so you can grab it at vert and verts and Fort Collins if you're in this area otherwise if you're in Denver you can always get it at Verde if you're in Boulder you can get it at Verde nice that Verde carries the largest selection of dialogic products overall so deal deal I appreciate it man yeah there you go there you go thanks for bringing such thanks for bringing samples absolutely it is gorgeous this is absolutely growing always glad to be over there [Music] [Music] [Music]", "hnnaYoVUoZM": "roll roll roll your blood full of cbd break it down roll it up light it up hit it no more anxiety hey roll roll roll your blood full of cbd break it down roll it up

shoe so let's try this again and then you can just respond in the comments what up cut up welcome to smoking legal or welcome back to smoking legal if you've been here before if you're one of my subscribers um salute to you i really really appreciate you if you are in the notification gang gang gang gang you got that notification build it up then i salute you um with both hands get it i appreciate you now what we do here is oh i'm sorry how rude am i not to introduce myself i go by the name taz and i review [ __ ] mainly hemp um and today we have a product coming from one of my favorite companies i saw this little team i saw this little team it's really a two-part review i saw this little team uh and i've used it in one of my lives and i had to crack it open for you guys in this review it's coming from one of my favorite companies which is called black tie cbd uh you may have heard of them oh oh something that doesn't mean a lot to you can mean a lot to someone else like one right there and hitting that subscribe button so what we have here today is the jupiter c cell palm power supply that was a lot and that is my rosary hitting my whiskey decanter that little ting ting bell you heard um this is the palm uh power supply it's like let's just open it up let's slide it open it doesn't make a magnify magnificent noise when you slide it open and here is what you have they put their logo on it black tie now what this is let me show you what all you get in here i'll turn it around so you can see the back side see that see that now what you have here is uh this is something that you can use for your cartridges um what i've learned about this thing is also that the battery on this when you charge it up last a lot longer than the uh your average pin you know how you usually just put it on top of your little pin uh but the battery on these last a lot longer in fact let me show you how to use it i'm gonna put that right there and i'm gonna try to open up this right here what we have here now what we have here is a little something special a little something this also comes from black tie this is the cbd delta eight vape cartridge so this is not just straight delta eight by itself it has cbd mixed with it which is my favorite way to consume my delta eight uh some people say that delta a kind of gives them a little bit of anxiety you know similar to delta nine uh but i've noticed that when it's mixed with the cbd it's tends to be a little bit smoother and less anxiety causing so this is one milligram and this is not the kid so it's just going to be the cartridge by itself and black tie again they gonna they gonna put a logo on there i do like that um it's child proof so you gotta push this little button and pull now i will say this i've never hold on oh this is the first time this is the first time that i was actually able to push that button down which makes it child proof and slide this out now this is the pineapple say it with me pineapple did that pineapple this is that pineapple this is what your cartridge looks like when you take it out see that voila good and thick good and thick lightly golden lightly golden now what you do is first you take off this little part down here at the bottom wow voila and see this right here oh [ __ ] okay so your palm power cell comes with these two little screw devices so let's get one of those out they give you two in case you lose one so what you're going to want to do is you take that put that down you screw that onto the bottom of your cartridge like so screw that onto the bottom of your cartridge like that now now you're ready to insert it into your palm which it'll just go like this see that little slot made perfect for it you put that down in there like that and it has a little bit of magnetization to it i don't even know if that's a word but it's magnetized so you put that down in there look watch this again and now it's in there will not come out or anything the next thing you got to do is just simply pull on it you just pull on it so um before i take my first pull let me say this salute to health wealth and self self love is the best love if you haven't heard the words i love you today then please please get to the closest man tell yourself self i love yourself because you can't love anyone else or expect anyone else to love you if you don't love yourself that's some serious [ __ ] my brother would say that deep little bro and i like it when they do that salute okay and this little thing is tight it's tiny and comfortable i don't know why i like this more than the pen i don't know if it's because i can grip it like that and it's wrong it's gone you know i can be you know at work stepping out on breakfast like huh what today no no no i'm listening nothing rather what's in my hand nothing i have nothing in my hand nothing at all i let the smoke out on the side like so the pineapple flavor is amazing i feel like spongebob squarepants oh my god the pineapple i thought i loved the banana excuse me yeah i thought i love the banana and i do i do love the banana don't get it twisted i do love the banana but the pineapple oh my god it tastes beautiful this is beautiful this is gorgeous i like this a lot i promise i don't know why i like this so much better than the pen but i really do and i feel like it gets more airflow excuse me what i really like about is just this little square design it's easy to just slide down in the pocket i'm good to go and like i said the battery lasts longer in these than in your average pen now when you pull on it there's a little light let me see if you can see that no you can't but anyway oh i'll show it did you see that little light that lit up when you pull that's how you know you're good to go oh my god oh huh okay now to me the effects of the delta eight for me oh if i get my breath from coffin it is a focus type feel um you i feel focused when i'm using delta a creative um i don't have that frontal lobe like blurry feeling like delta nine gives me it just gives me that focus feel and then i get the from the cbd i get the relaxation the drop in the shoulders i get the i can feel the anxiety begin to leave and then i just i it just genuinely makes me happy one million trillion percent gives me the money though i can tell you that right now uh but genuinely just a relaxed feel relaxed and focused feel and in the little palm palette i said the palm palette they used to be a phone i'm showing my age uh but in the palm power supply i really really like it now the pen gives me that feel you know it goes between the fingers so i can but it's a little heavy i don't know why because this forces you to grab it like this or like this it's just like second nature and it's just easy right i'm i've been literally going back and forth in my mind trying to decide if i like the banana or if i like the pineapple better i was so so so impressed with that banana the first time i had it i'm still impressed with it but this pineapple is so on point like i don't know how they're getting these flavors to be so on point the way they are but this pineapple it really does not taste like some artificial fake pineapple type candy type thing it literally tastes like a fresh slice of pineapple it tastes boozy like pineapple not pineapple pineapple that's what it tastes like listen uh black time i gotta give you two thumbs up again man i gotta give you two thumbs up i've tried the banana delta eight i've tried the delta eight card that just had um it was not flavored at all it was just mixed with cbd and it was not flavored and now i'm trying the pineapple and you guys have not let me down yet man and i'm just i i'm sold on the on the palm power supply it's a must so far black tie is my favorite place to get my delta eight and i'm gonna tell you why it's the only place i've gotten delta eight and i trust them as a company that's why i go to them i know it's not gonna be no bs product and sometimes things can you know you get let down so when i want certain things i go to specific companies because i know i'm not going to be let down and this is one of man shout out to aka mr copius i appreciate you and shout out to you guys the pineapple is definitely worth checking out this little contraption this pawn power supply it's definitely definitely a win for me um thank you guys for stopping through as i like to say on smoking legal keep it positive we'll keep it pushing get it keep it positive or keep it pushing if you have any questions for me uh ask them

comments when i get in the bed i go through the comments and answer questions and just respond to people because yeah my people it is so salute to health wealth and self i like you", "MeVzVvDGnOI": "[Music] hey guys today we're going to take a look at the number one most common problem that you'll have with your vape pen and cartridge and how to quickly fix it so what you want to do to start is unscrew your cartridge from your pen and take a look at the two connectors there sometimes they can become too recessed of whether its packaging or being screwed down too tight and it's really easy to fix to bring it out so you'll want to grab a paper clip and just gently catch underneath the edge of the connector and tug on it very gently to make sure you don't pull it up too hard you can damage the cartridge that way so be careful and once you catch an edge you can work around the entire lip there so that it's in a nice proper position for it to emotion correctly with the battery next we're going to move on to the battery and repeat the same process we're gonna work underneath the connector here and ring it up nice and gently you don't need to apply much pressure again and once you catch that same edge just work around nice and slow so that you don't have an uneven space for the connectors that you're touching [Music] so it should be all ready to go here and we're gonna grab our cartridge and screw it back in the cartridges don't need to be screwed down too tightly for it to work once it's there you should have a green light ready to go all right guys thanks for watching [Music]", "zHAhDfnIECY": "[Music] hey everyone welcome back to my channel it's your girl Mariah if you were new to this channel welcome if you were returning subscriber welcome back um before we get into this video I want to you guys to subscribe like comment and share this video um this video is going to be a video that um kind of gives you guys how about like an idea of what I use to help me deal with my anxiety back in January I suffered my very first like severe anxiety attack which also led to a panic at hot um which I had to be rushed to the hospital I couldn't breathe I really didn't know what was happening in like guys I was talking to the nurses and you know everybody they kind of you know knew the symptoms and you it was so they didn't want to medicate me but to you know speak to a group in one so before that happened I was taking a product called just CBD they were gummies they were featuring gummies I think there were about like 250 milligrams for CVD I believe I don't have the continuous with a lot of them um so I was using those those helped me a lot with like sleeping just getting through the day I'm I normally take one in the morning and then take one at night from what I was going to bed um and then I switched over to the vape CBD I know in some areas um vaping is banned I'm in my state it's the e-cigarettes um when choosing you brand for vaping and I know like I said everyone's gonna be like oh baby it's dangerous I think this um being able to find a brain that you trust um with their products and you know what's in it they're transparent about it with something big going into it um I have a smoke shop in my area in downtown Boston in the cold smoke city shop I will link them down below they also sell just CBD products they sell the gummies but they don't so be the they being or the cartridges um so I wanted to show you guys a little haul of items that I got now do you also want to clarify in this video this is not a sponsored video by just CBD these are thought of my own products just brought my own money and so nothing you know was sent there's no sponsorship in the city I'm not being paid for this this is my own opinion my own thoughts on the brands as a whole so without further ado we're gonna jump right into it and we're gonna open these little bad boys I did split it to make sure everything was any in make sure I had everything that I got in it so we're just gonna jump right into it so the first item we are going to pull out is a date juice I got this in the flavor mango mango ice is the flavor and it's a hundred and it's a hundred milligrams and we're gonna open it and see what it looks like on the inside so this is the big bottle that it comes with and this is like set for a pretty good decent price for it I believe it wasn't check step inside so these were $15.99 each so I have this flavor like I said it's the mango mango ice in that flavor and I spend on the side of the box um it does give you the where it's talks about it being um tobacco free conveniently need for your e cigarette vaping devices for intense sources and like I said CBD does not replace going to your doctor if you do take medication continue to consult your doctors on that me I just don't want to be medicated so like I said I do the gummies and now I'm like I said I'm switching over to the the oils I can so take it with me so I'm not carrying on this big bike like jock of gummy so it's kind of like another convenient for me I'm gonna see what other goodies I'm having here we also have the pineapple Express and this one comes based off of the Navy find out for sports if you have not seen it so it comes like this as well the same jar just different flavor you see it looks like a fair way to open it there we go you can smell it too so that that was also $15.99 I got three different flavors on this one is watermelon og time I want to get like flavors um if you do follow me on instagram you would have saw that I posted in a story I'm all plus the story in this video somewhere on the screen um I've gotten a pen from Busey so I have an Uzi pen the cartridge on top comes from panda sticks I believe that's how you pronounce it I will also link that pen in the cartridge down below if you want to go purchase those too I got that ez pen in that cartridge first because I knew this was coming and with everything going on I did not know if I was going to receive anything I'm via the mail but everything was still running normal and I got it within a good decent time frame so this is what the I said watermelon og looks like in this big bottle and I love the fact that the bottles are big like these are very big bottles for the price that I got them before like I've seen like I said in the smoke shop I go to they have like bottles smaller than this for the same price so I love the fact that these are big bottles they'll last me a while and I'm glad I got the three different flavors that they did I love the that I have so I'm really glad I got those and then I have a disposable cartridge it's like this is the watermelon so the Sigma C of OG 1 for it so this one is a disposable one this one is 200 milligrams for these cartridge let me open it so it looks like and then from boozy I did I do have an order coming from them my main include them in this video but it's this is more of a just EEE video because this is the main products that I'm going to be using like I'm not gonna go back to the Panda stick cartridge Luzi I'll keep the pen just cuz I have so I'll have the pen so I had two different pens so I also gun pen from just CBD but I'm just sticking to just CBD I'm not switching I'm not doing anything like I said I enjoyed the brain as a whole their response to customer service is really good like things like it's not like you're not waiting a whole entire day to hear back from somebody if you have an issue on a product I mean you can get a response right away so this is the and I may switch over to this one today this is what the pen looks like if I can get ever get it out hopefully by the end of this video I can get it out for you guys and show you guys what it looks like and put it on the pen so we're gonna sit this off to the side real quick so what they're also like I said I did order a battery so this is what the battery looks like um theirs is a 5-10 VV twist battery um the Uzi stick I have is also a 5-10 battery so I can also use the cartridges from just see beating on that pen in the future but like I said I did order 3 of the cartridges from Louise because I did order an Uzi pen so like I have three pens now so I have the first uz one be just CBD one I just showed you and then there's another one coming from Uzi so they each have their own cartridge and I can grab the Izzi pen and she goes it looks like I want to get this pout oh yeah my Lu Zhi ping it's like a little metallic like rainbow fish color the other one is a Rastafari so it has a Jamaican colors and this is the cartridge up top so the cartridge up top is from panda stick and like I said I will link it below and the stick is from and the battery is so easy so that is that one so I'm ordering so I ordered another battery in three of the cartridges to be able to fill because the only thing with just CBD I did not see and even I missed it but it's okay that they don't have like the cartridges sold on their own like he does like it was he has the ones which we can be filled with liquid so just CBD didn't have those and less like I said I missed it and I didn't see it hopefully in the future they do release some like that so we're like individually in the art empties like this one is if I don't think I can get the cap off for this one I can try but I so this is what this one looks like is the like I said the watermelon flavor we're gonna do a test to see how it tastes and like I said as I know people's concerns are she like be safe and I am like I said I'm not walking around like every hour gaping I'm I normally do it in the more like in the morning when I wake up I do about two to pups that's it um and then that night same thing two puffs that's it so I'm not like so because the guy was like oh this cartridge should last you you know only a couple of days like this has lasted me like almost a week and I guess I can show you what it looks like when everything goes down but has lasted me I pretty decent amount of time because I'm not pulling on it and I keep it my pen stays on 3.3 v so it does not leave that area so it does not leave you can see it on the bottom it does not leave that smart so like it's on the lowest of the low so I'm not puffing so much so this is what the pen looks like and I love that piece and these have a lower voltage so these this one starts at two point two point zero B this one starts at three point three in the highs that it goes to is four point zero which I love so I can definitely put that on a smaller voltage I'm sold it like I said so and then this is my charging port that will go into it like I said I also have another the same thing came with this one that was e1 mix and I love effect you just twist and it comes on so these are the two that I have like I said this one is just CBD which is labeled is label sorry about that my camera dies I'm gonna make this really quick so these are the two that I have and then the last item I don't know like there was a certain thing going on but they sent me a free a free item I don't know if I mean it's like I never tried this so this is there just and it's a body soap I'm so I'm down there to really try this in the flavour of cherry pie and it smells really good I open the box I like what I'd like smells really good I didn't know this was even in there so I'm kind of a little free treat to try it so you guys so I'm definitely I'm going to try this come to night and see how I like it and see how it worked like fields and they said it's created for all faces and all skin types to enjoy to him him Ronnie so so it's handcrafted body so label and sing it with it I'm not the lighting looks different in the camera looks flipped in a different way please excuse me I kind of switch over to my phone to film the remainder of it so yeah so this is the soap duck I said that came with it um this one I did not purchase on my own um this one was sent in the box I don't know if it was like a free gift and he spent so much I said I opened it it was in there so thank you just see beauty for this one um but like I said I'm so proud of everything that I had like I said the stick the bat the flavors and I definitely would have you guys posted on how you know I'm doing with them and like I said I love them all to death like the company in itself is all is a good brand um I hope they do come out with more flavours um I hope that they do come out with just the cartridges on their own I'm not pre filled with anything so you can just order it all together as weight on one but

anything um like I said they clearly say on their site that they do not none of their products continue vitamin E which should be all do by me II was what was in a cigarette that was killing people and causing lung issues with their products like I said the Panda stick I checked on their site too as well they have listed that they do not use vitamin E in their CBD oils I'm CBD everyone's like Oh CBD you should high it sweet no CBD does not get you high CBD is part of my marijuana plant but it's not the part that gets you high so you're safe if you are worried about being drug tested you can definitely lecture they definitely recommend you to let your employer know beforehand that you do take CBD or CBD so then you know exactly what's going on and you're not going off by any weird surprises that come your way like I said I thank you guys for watching this video hope you guys enjoyed and like I said let me know down below if you cop any products that I have and thank you for watching hope see you guys in my next one you", "6cmI6BwLog8": "hey guys Logan here from o2 V gonna show you today how to fix a connection plate we get a lot of calls coming in with customers who think that their battery is broken when they go to draw on the cartridge it appears the battery's working but they're not getting a vapor from the cartridge generally when this happens it tends to be the connection plate so what I have here is one of our push-button 510 thread batteries if you look down in between the threads with the cartridge off in the middle you see the circular connection plate so what happens is that generally gets pushed down when either a you screw the cartridge on too tight or be when you go to screw the battery on to the charger and screw that on too tight so a very simple fix what we often tell people to use is just a paper clip and if you stick the paper clip in between the connection plate and the threads and you just pry towards the middle it starts to raise that connection plate up be very careful because it comes up extremely easy you don't think of it a lot of pressure what you're gonna do is you're just gonna walk around the battery and bring that whole plate up to about the middle of the threads once you go to put the cartridge back on after this you should have a good connection and your bad we should be working in it thank you guys for choosing o to vape and have a vape filled day", "A2k1Q7rTNJg": "hey everybody its cannon Joe we are checking in today at Stinson Beach California one of our last days out in California and today we are very excited to review a Willys reserve distillate cartridge this is Mountain mist this is the flavor and we were super lucky enough to be introduced to a woman that basically gave us these and donated these products here to us from Flo Canada and we are very very excited to try this Willy's reserve as a Willie Nelson brand and of course everybody hears about that and they want to try it out and here today we are about to so let's just go ahead and get in on it so we've got our warnings of course this is awesome packaging I really like it local farmers you can check it out online recyclable packaging that's cool yeah this is nice packaging everything's nice I like the colors really stands out they did a good job they're got Willie Nelson in the background right there that's cool 81 percent THC again this is a distillate and then you've got 0.33% of CBD so oh I like that big packaging there I've never seen one like this now okay but you take that out like that wow this is this is a heavy-duty case right here [Music] okay that was an extremely long horn blow again we are at a beach so it's probably the get in or get out of the water call so here we go this cartridge is very high-quality we've got like a stainless steel feel here on the mouth tip it's a very large hole this is uh it's heavy too it's got the WR right there on the right there on the logo and so we're gonna just go ahead and try it out here see what happens okay here we go mmm that's good lemony hmm Wow mmm that's got everything you're looking for I mean it's got the Terp tic it's got the back of the throat choke it's got the whole tickle in the nose it's got pretty much everything but it's not bad in any way shape or form because a lot of the times that all those things can go into a bad you know they can be too much term tech too much choke throughout all them things that you don't want but this is pretty much all that you do let's try this again just get one more try see what really happens excuse me I didn't expect that okay who's that my friends excuse me all right so you want to be careful with this this is no joke this is not a joke this is the lowest temp a lot of times with your vape pens you know you can take the whole hit sometimes maybe even two you can time out the pin to really get the flavor saver going but this one here no this is a one I mean you can barely get through one time out with this and yeah I feel I feel a little on the road again so yeah I definitely appreciate this this is an awesome pin I give it pretty much a 10 let's give it a 10", "37IFacV_D50": "what's going on youtube family triple baskets we're gonna be doing another video today for you guys i really appreciate all the supports you know all the comments and stuff you know i go through that all the time so really appreciate you guys man and if you guys haven't added the snapchat or the instagram go ahead and do so i will leave all the information down in the description box below but other than that guys i've been pretty good myself um just got back from my dispensaries so so today i ended up picking up a platinum vape guys this is like one of the one that stands it out um it's the first time i've seen them in my dispensaries so i really you know i definitely had to try it out so i've never seen these around before um so if you guys ever had one of these let me know what you guys think about it it's like i said the packaging really caught my attention how it has a little cali you know little logo cut out right there and uh it's pretty dope so i ended up getting the gelato this one's around this cartridge is around 90 so it's one of the reasons i got it and gelato strain is always good you know they're always good they taste good and um so this cartridge was made like about last month or two the good thing about the boxes um it shows you the flavor on it it says it's earthy it's citrusy and it's sweet and it's known for relaxed happy creative uplifted energetic that's pretty dope you know shows the details on the box and stuff like that not that many boxes show that so that's pretty dope so i haven't smoked all day so like i'm just like trying to get high man it's like it's like 12 in the afternoon so it's kind of my waking break you know for my first time so there's ways to open it in the box but you know some some people just like to show the [ __ ] box open i'm always shredding my boxes open man they're supposed to be child proof and sometimes i can't open them by themselves so here we have a tube guys if like i said if you guys ever had the platinum vapes before let me know if you guys enjoyed it you know the price is pretty good on these cartridges honestly i paid like 31 it was 30 dollars flat but with like a dollar tax i think so that's pretty that's pretty cheap for a cartridge no i i don't i don't mind whether it's live resin or distillate you know before all this live resin it was just this is like cartridges and you know i don't mind smoking distillate it gets you high as [ __ ] and it's just it tastes good some people are like ah this list not good but you know i'll smoke this a little i smoke like resin it doesn't matter as long as it's good it tastes good that's all that that shouldn't matter so so this one's a gelato cartridge um i'm gonna go ahead and dry it just see if there's like some flavors in there or some [ __ ] honestly you don't you just get like a little taste to it flip ultra honestly this battery is hella good right now i've been using this um flip ultra for like the past couple weeks and it's been really good you know i had gone this better like a couple months ago and it's a pretty good battery you know it's a flip battery you know you can put it in your pocket and it has a lock on it so it won't [ __ ] flip open in your pocket and break so that's pretty good you know so here we have like so here we have the cartridge guys give you guys a close-up on that as you guys can see the little sticker the california logo sticker it's legit i'm just gonna go ahead and flip it over just to show you guys the quality on it gotta be thick you know i can't be running you guys know that and uh so here we have the battery i'm just gonna screw it on here try and get baked right now man i'm gonna hit the [ __ ] out of this pen so here we have the pan guys and um that's pretty dope though like once you connect it it shows you like the little posts so far on this battery i have 575 puffs so far that's like five cartridges ran to that [ __ ] so other than that guys hopefully you guys are smoking along with me i'm about to get hot as [ __ ] right now so cheers guys i'm gonna let you know i'm gonna let you guys know what this tastes like these batteries hit oh [ __ ] honestly these cartridges are pretty good you know they taste really really clean you know i didn't think they were gonna be as good just the simple fact that they were like 30 bucks you know i thought they're gonna be like 40 so that's crazy it tastes really really clean you know like on the packaging it says it tastes so on the packaging it says it tastes earthy citrus and sweet it's what it says back there i don't know if you guys can see but honestly that's what it tastes like it does taste really sweet and it does taste earthy so to be honest you don't really get like a citrusy flavor it just tastes really clean like an earthy flavor to it so it's pretty good you know i'm gonna go ahead and rip it some more big clouds right i don't know i don't know about you guys but the tip on these cartridges i really love those tips you know those round tips it just makes the cartridge more appealing and they hit way better i don't know that's just my opinion let me know what you guys think about that but i'm trying not to cough right now this cartridge is like 90 you know i'm just trying to hold my coffin i want to start coughing and [ __ ] off my bed on the videos you know it's just my schedule's kind of [ __ ] up right now but i'm still trying my best to bring out some more videos for you guys and uh like i said if you guys have it out of the snapchat go ahead and do so i'm more active on instagram and snapchat but if you guys would like to add both go ahead and do so but just has me going you know she has me high as [ __ ] already and i just took two hits it's around 12 in the afternoon so you know it got me feeling pretty good so and the reason i really like [ __ ] with distiller is just that some distillery cartridges have more thc in them than what a live resin would have like i was looking at cartridges right now my dispensary and most discs to the cartridges they range from like 80 to the high 90s you know compared to a light resin which which ranges from like the low 70s to high 80s you know it's kind of hard to find the live resin with like 90 in it you know i'm still on the lookout for those but other than that yeah there's like a [ __ ] little dish of the cartridges at my shop there's a lot of live resin but i never knock off distally you know there's people that say uh distill is bad but you know it's pretty good you know it depends on the cartridge you guys get and you know there's some cartridge to be honest there's there is some distilled cartridges that are not good i just give you a headache and it tastes like [ __ ] like fake this or like cheap you know but there's just some distillates that you know some companies really do spend their time to make them a little better and they are pretty good so you just got to go ahead and you just got to go ahead and you know start trying new brands that's what i do so like this was my first time trying the platinum vapes and i'm really enjoying it you know it gots me going cheers guys and this battery also if you guys would like to if you guys would like to purchase this battery i'm gonna go ahead and leave the information down in the description box so you guys go ahead and check it out it's pretty dope you know it's a flip battery and also comes with the little lock so you can't open it so like if it's in your pocket you're up and down at work it's not going to open and break up on you which has happened to me before and it's not good so it's dope it turns on automatically as you guys can see so that's one of my favorite cartridge batteries that i'm using right now selenius but other than that guys um i'm gonna be having some more hotbox videos soon for you guys i know i've been lacking on those two so oh [ __ ] i got the ac pumping right now this thing has me sweating man and as you guys can see it says 90 thc hopefully you guys can see that cartridge is really good so if you guys ever see these in this in the store go ahead and purchase one you know they're really good and for the price i paid 30 dollars flat for this [ __ ] guys and that's that's a good thing about living in california you know right here where i'm from in modesto california everything's cheap like a top shelf eighth is like 25 bucks if you want like an exotic uh if you want like an exotic eighth it's like 30 to 40 dollars max you know you know it's pretty dope

day thanks for watching", "5i3k1qBtUZ4": "[Music] hey everyone dr. Shawn here I hope everyone is well and staying safe amid this whole Cove at nineteen pandemic hope everyone's doing their part practicing social distancing we're trying to flatten this curve and anyone who's using cannabis to just get them through these unsettling times or medicinally I hope you've got plenty of stock today I'm reviewing the Aurora drift vape cartridge and that's for the 510 thread system so this is a THC indica blend it retails for thirty four ninety five on the ontario canada store so a good price that's a lower on the lower end of price points for vape cartridges it has seventy six point nine two seventy s sorry let me correct that sixty seven point nine two seventy six point five percent THC so this is a strong two very strong THC level and there's zero to one percent CVD so negligible CBD in this one it's an indica dominant strain and the terpene profile includes Mersin pining and this one I have trouble pronouncing it's spelled GU a IOL GU al if anyone knows how to properly pronounce that please leave that in the comment section so my experience with this vape cartridge is first of all I like the price because it's relatively cheap the vape itself like the vape quality is smooth it's not harsh and flavor-wise you know nothing outstanding about the flavor it kind of just tastes like most of the other oils that you would find out there there's nothing you know specific I could pinpoint about the flavor of this one the effects come pretty soon after vaping and the effects are very one-dimensional like definitely doesn't have the full-body effect that I have experienced with the Zen Berry cartridge that I reviewed previously it's more just kind of a it's a little it's relaxing but it's very sort of stays in one place like it's really just in the head I don't really feel this throughout my body and it doesn't have like a very it doesn't pack a big punch it's kind of just in the background if that makes any sense so you know you're gonna get a little bit of a relaxing comma feck from this one but in terms of like a multi-dimensional type of effect you're really not going to get it from this this oil so that being said you know taking into consideration the price the experience the flavor I'm going to give this one a 5 out of 10 price is right you will get you know a bit of a relaxing response to this but it's in no way close to some of the other more encompassing oils that I've tried so that's the Aurora drift vape cartridge if you like these reviews please subscribe leave comments and I'll be back with another review shortly", "ZzuxwwTKk5c": "oh this is not a plush toy to make me change I become like a castaway you know your page that you bought the color today game is goodie to get your voice mpg back at it with another fire waiting for you guys man so for today's review man I got a Corolla right here man yeah you heard it right kirova the comfy that makes I think they started off making edibles and then just the transition into making marijuana you know actual bud and then cartridges and things like that so they're branching out into the cartridge game I got myself right here it is a mimosa it is a Clement Lucie if I can go ahead and get that a little focused in for you guys one time so this right here is the momo mimosa it is a clement i'm / purple punch and men you know but most is is obviously one of the better sativas out there that i that i feel like you know they just the sativa that just gets you extremely baked but also lets you do your thing without making you feel like super super like your mind is running if you get what i mean which is something that a lot of sativas do so you got to be careful what you choose so yeah I got the memo so right here this one's sitting actually at a 78 point 81 percent THC so that's not too bad actually I was expecting a little bit a little bit more but honestly what can we can do right so open this up right away men it comes in this nifty ISO container I haven't seen any cartridges come in containers like these as of late so I uh yeah all you do is just unscrew this unscrew it all the way throw that to the side cuz you're only gonna need this cartridge so right here boys I got the mimosa from Corolla this is a full gram I think they do have it in half grams also I'm not too sure about that but I have seen full grams all over the place men on the bottom it says Korova unrivaled alright so we're gonna go ahead and test it out man see if it actually isn't rebel because I feel like with a lot of a let me mind you this is a distillate cartridge this isn't a librarian cartridge this isn't anything too special man so I'm not my hopes aren't too high I'm kind of hoping it tastes good I like my mosula it's one of the few teams that I like but you know when it comes to distillate not a lot of distillate companies can do good the only distillate companies I personally feel like I've been doing a great job with their product is dizzy and plug play those two distillate company - probably the only ones and wrong garden - just remember they're additionally company not a lot rather company so I want to take a ghost hit but I got the fan point I mean go ahead and turn off real quick boys here we go we got the Korova mimosa sitting on the raw garden battery I currently don't have any variable wattage batteries man I lost my favorite battery which was whose if you guys in a little slim twist one I'm trying to look for it I'm hoping I can find it soon but as soon as I find it you guys are getting Ben your video out of it man so before we take a hit demands go ahead and try to hit 500 likes on this video I appreciate everyone who's been tuning in lately man during this whole quarantine I've been getting a lot more subscribers and I just want to welcome you all to the GFN man so if you guys are over the age of 18 to 21 let's let's get to smoking boys chewed so right off the bat that first initial hit man I'm not gonna lie it wasn't to like like tasty I don't know if it's just the first hit that was like that let's go ahead and try to get the other wing quipped up and then because that's one thing that I wanna let you guys know to win and whenever tasting out a new code don't ever base off the first hit just for the simple fact that you know the coil takes a while to get whipped up and things like that you gotta burn through the oil and you gotta just absolutely taste the flavor so we're gonna be taking a couple hits and I'm gonna take a couple hits until we get into the flavor until we had super big so cheers guys mmm it doesn't all right after that second dish okay I did get a little bit more flavor I'm gonna go ahead and switch it to the dr. zodiac battery because I think that this one is a little bit stronger because for distillate cartridges the other ones for live resin so for that second hit though I did get a better flavor profile I tasted a little bit of a like a Clementine like a little sweetness sourness so not too bad not too shabby not too shadows go ahead and just keep going though [Music] the taste that I'm getting though is it is it isn't like a oh wow do you like you know just astonishing taste that you would like to get from a cartridge Billie like I feel like I'm getting more of like a dis elyda taste then I'm getting of terpenes like I I think this is lacking a lot intervenes as of now man after the first initial hits a man you should at least taste something you know you should at least provide a consumer with something that the first hit the first two to three hits man and you should just smack you in your face and want to keep want you to keep hitting it more and more right with this one I don't even feel like hitting it anymore just because off of those two three hits like I kind of don't even feel like I don't get that taste that I like you know I don't get that oh gee earthy goodness or I don't get that that fruity berry nasur I don't get anything it's just very very dissolute eat like if you know how desolate cartridges they just taste like like THC oil like just straight-up oil like and I mean that's that's one of my big issues with distillate companies you know you feel like for the most part you know desolate companies just don't get the the mixtures right when it comes to their disel is slash terpene mixtures it is just disgusting because you could either end up with a really really good dissolute like cartridge or pod like plug and play and dizzy where they kind of balance it out with the perfect amount of THC and the perfect amount of terpene and it also depends on what what you know dis lit you're using in the first place how refined it is how well process it is and what buddy used to produce that desolate and there's just so many steps and I feel like with this like they're not there yet they're definitely not there I'm sorry Korova but you're definitely not there yet I would probably just stick to edibles as of now man but I'm gonna go ahead and keep hitting it maybe it'll get better as we get along then so cheers guys like I am getting a little bit more of the mimosa now a little bit more yeah you like kind of more of the Clementine than the purple punch but like I said man just the ratio of dis Allah to Turkey mixture it's just like you want something and that's gonna be in your face you know you want to be able to taste it right here I feel like I'm just smoking straight of disel it like yeah I do get the little hints of Clementine in the back but it's just very very subtle like at this point I might as well just be smoking oil I just straight up this little oil with no terpenes because the terpenes then dilute it to making it less cheap see and then um damn a mother will just give us that you straight-up hardcore og dissolute man but I have nothing good to say about this I'm not gonna lie I have nothing good at all like these all right let's just break it down let me break it down for you guys so right off the bat I would say though I would say here's the upside of it they're packaging their presentation skills are phenomenal they post on weed maps they pose the pictures that they post the things that they post is just like oh [ __ ] that's the main reason why I got it in the first place this is the main reason why I got interested service because the presentation was outstanding just likes dizzy just like politically just like any other company that's doing big right now you know the packaging is on point that's something that I say is key in every single product because when you're looking at something you want to buy something that's visually it's visually appealing first then it is anything else you know because you're not gonna be able to taste the based off of a look so I'll based off of that that is another reason why I got it but opening it up like when I first saw this I liked I looked at the tip and it seems to be like not even a normal tip like some plastic [ __ ] so I touched it not even not a ceramic just a very very low grade and it's very very light though very very light compared to other cartridges not like I can I can barely feel like it's in my hand and then other than that man they that the oil quality it's thick it's thick I'm not gonna lie it's thick I've been hitting it this whole entire time and it's been it's been hitting it's been think it hasn't been moving at all definitely some good distillate but at the end of the day it all matters on how it tastes on how it gets you high it hasn't even gotten me high dude where are you going to take some fat-ass head see if it gets me home we go ahead and take a blinker for you guys if that boy here doesn't get me high I don't know what to say man so cheers guys go ahead and take a blinker with me [Music] he no longer expand me I got a little bit of lung stretch and just B's due to all this smoke go ahead but it wasn't like like crazy do you like with the plug play like I know I bring up other brands but it because it's comparisons you know you want to compare distillate brands with the distillate brands you want to because other other people who have tried who want to try kirova for example the chances are they already tried still Z plug play you know all the big names on marquee right now and this this is my job man this is what I'm here it's to tell you you guys you know what's good what's not that way yes don't go out wasting your money like I [ __ ] did pretty by the way that or cheat cart that I bought they didn't work at all guys so that's it down yeah nothing at all for that blinker I I feel a slight head change just off of that blinker but it's nothing like hot [ __ ] like I'm faded off my ass it's nothing like that at all and I'm kind of disappointed man like I feel like like people are just taking advantage of like the [ __ ] that they have you know the money that they have in trying to produce stuff that isn't good quality at all like I'm sorry but this these cartridge companies have to be stopped like these cartridge companies have to be stopped now because I'm tired of wasting my damn money on cartridges that look good look like they're gonna taste good but they're ass I'm [ __ ] tired of they do it alright so I'm from now on man I think I'm starting people I'm sorry calling companies out on the [ __ ] that they make because it's so disturbing man the amounts of money that I spend on cartridges and [ __ ] and still I am not satisfied with what people produce it's kind of like I thought that's just how it's gonna be man you know especially now with the inflation in the cannabis community if you were gonna be taking advantage of it but like it just sucks man so Korova you go F yourself I don't want anything to do ever with your product again you're trash get out of mind getting out of the stores anything don't ever caught this company and yeah I'm gonna go ahead and out the video here guys if you guys enjoyed today's review go ahead and leave a like go ahead and leave a comment so I could talk to you guys like calm me back to everybody by the way and most importantly though leave a subscribe it helps your boy out more than you know so gfm we'll catch you guys in the next one then we practice fifty shades of gray function on the ground buddy no goes obviously good money I'm some to the runaround are you sending me are you coming now cuz I'm post on I mean", "ikgVjiLBMHo": "dabbe connection here with the Cresco Dreamwalker cartridge is a sativa cartridge as you can tell live resin not co2 oil see the test batch information here inside the box it comes packaged in this little plastic tube works pretty well simple but effective packaging the cartridge itself is a pretty standard C cell cartridge with a clear plastic mouthpiece the color banding on the cartridge itself does not denote the specific strain though the strains themselves are color coded so you can tell at least whether it is sativa hybrid or indica depending on the color the color band of course it's got their little logo printed on here and I'll show you guys how it hits it's a pretty good cartridge it has a pretty decent long-lasting high however it's almost entirely flavorless to be entirely honest there's a little subtle hint of flavor but it's so little you hardly even notice it I also picked up another of their carts of a different strain and the flare was honestly indistinguishable anyways here's a hit as you can tell it it's pretty heavy as one expects from the Cecil tarts anyways they all tend to hit pretty heavy there's definitely no off flavors with it or anything like that so it's not like it has any kind of chemical aftertaste it really just doesn't taste like much of anything but the high is great and it's on the pricier end but you get a pretty large number it pops out of each cartridge so I would say overall it evens out on the price side of things this cartridge itself put me back about 50 bucks but which does put it on the pricier side of the spectrum but I've had other pricier cartridges that honestly didn't hit this well and didn't have as long-lasting a high and it was just generally one is good so overall I'd say it's a pretty well above average current so long as you're willing to spend money to get it maybe gonna find a good deal for it then I'd say jump on it and I think that about does it there in show you guys what it looks like in the big battery before we go see yeah pretty good stuff it's some pretty light distillate it's not super dark which in my experience tends to mean a cleaner hit as far as like the flavor and whether or not it really gets to your lungs but that's all I've got to say here hopefully that helps inform your decision hope you all have a great day out there", "p-p6t4rN_og": "Hey career threaded leaf and today is Thursday so that means we've got a vape cartridge that we're gonna be tapping into this week we've got the figure citrus craft vape cartridge again we are rockin through the stuff that came in from BC guys I'm really excited to tap into this and try it out we're gonna get the intro running and through here for you guys first and then we're gonna tap into this vape so see you guys on the other side of the intro when we got a little bit more information and we actually start being able to try this babe you'll see on the other side [Music] welcome back you guys so start things off we've got the citrus craft vape cartridge from figure I only picked up the 0.25 grammar because that's all they have in stock at the store I definitely would have preferred half gram cartridge but the quarter gram is all we've got for today so this little sucker came in at 70 percent THC with 0.1 percent CBD and the one cool thing on here that I know it's right at the bottom it gives you the option to trace like to track your packaging with a lot number so I did do that I went into the figure website and pulled it up you can actually enter the number in there and it'll pull up all of the information and the certificate of analysis on the but it'll give you the pesticides amount like it figure gives you a huge amount of transparent information that I have not seen from any other company so huge shadow to figure for that I got a couple of packs of their pre girls that are in my golf bag as well thinking about doing a little bit of a review on those with this I definitely think I might be pulling those payrolls up and out set you guys can see what what the the tracer products looks like with those cuz I think it'd be better to do a separate video there cuz today we're gonna be reviewing this vape cartridge gel so let's go back and read off a little bit of information that they do have about the cartridges so they're in a glass chamber with a ceramic heating element to deliver a high quality vape every time the best of figure made flexible our craft cartridges are compatible with any standard 510 thread vape battery figure quality without vitamin E acetate it's available in three all-natural flavors so that being the citrus natural terpene and then the mixed berry so overall they don't have anything else for the for the citrus faith yeah and actually so we're gonna crack open this container and see what these point to five cartridges look like so let's break that seal pull this open and take our first looks of this cartridge II guess so squeezy oh that bottom ones giving me trouble today there we go just like that this is a container you have a little bit excessive but it is better than some of the other ones so first it'll look at this I really do like that mouthpiece on there that that color as well it alternates you guys can take a little bit of a better look let's see if this ooh the t-shi sticker comes off nice and easy it looks like you guys might to get you really there we go do something we'll pull a THC sticker off and give you guys a better look at the actual concentrate in the cartridge later it's got a really nice sharp orange color to it I'm really interested in trying this out so figure does use 1/2 gram cartridges but when you got a quarter of a gram in there that sucker looks half-full already huh we're gonna start off with the fire side battery I'm pretty sure yep we've got our set on the white marker so we're gonna pull this little plastic stopper off slide this on and we'll take our first looks and taste that actually looks pretty nice with that gold battery on there the gold and silver match up really well but enough talking let's actually take this skirt for it first rip see how it tastes you guys we start out on the light temp we're gonna move up to medium temperature and then the high before you slide over and do the same thing through a G pen and then I got a couple of rigs here and the hemp ER adapter we're gonna be taking a couple of rips through the rig's as well and I'll be able to give you guys an overall and just an honest opinion what I think of how this bud did their concentrate their vape whatever you want to call it but we've done enough talking you guys let's actually get into this and try it out Cheers really easy to draw through okay guys so I guess said it was really surprisingly easy to draw through this is honestly one of the best drawing cartridges that I've experienced yet Wow I was not expecting that through the first one but I'm getting a almost kind of fruit loop flavor with this with this tip and it's surprisingly it's catching me a little off-guard but all in all I'm really enjoying it you guys so we're gonna go ahead and take another taste of this at the blue temperature that medium voltage and see if it changes it at all but if it's that fruit loop flavor all the way through you guys this one's gonna do quite well I suspect Cheers so I'm not medium you get less of the citrus more of the type of cereal flavor that you get almost more of like a honey kind of flavor it's not bad by any means it's not turning me away but the lower temperatures definitely had the more citrus flavor that I was enjoying and expecting but we got the sucker cranked all the way up to the red the high temp we're gonna try it out there and see how it does at that temperature you guys Cheers does have a really nice flavor on that high temp but it definitely leans more towards that honey flavor it's got a little bit more citrus in the medium but not by much at all actually it's um definitely the low temp is the more enjoyable temp on that fire side battery but I've got the cookie G pen here we're gonna take it through there see how it tastes on this cuz I have a feeling that this G pen they're gonna push her a little bit better flavor you guys but only way to know is if we actually try it out and let's go ahead and do that Cheers definitely different flavor less of that kind of weedy cereal experience with the G pen I'm finding a lot more like gummy kind of flavor and it's it's enjoyable it's nice and light but still very enjoyable so we've bumped it up to the second temperature I want to see if it keep pushes through that way or if it ends up going more that honey route like it did through the fireside pan you guys see on the other side so it doesn't go more honey but it does subtle the citrus flavor down quite a bit it's definitely one of those baits that you want to keep tapping through on the lower temperature I'm thinking these higher temps I find you're just burning through the terpenes a lot quicker than you'd actually be able to enjoy them and that's that's a big disappointment you guys so we've got a bumped up to the highest side we're gonna take one last rip through just the Pens and see how it does on here but honestly I'm not I'm not expecting much at the higher temp you guys the lower seem to be the better flavor saver but let's go ahead and take it through its last trip from the pen Cheers yeah it definitely just goes relatively bland and it's very disappointing that way so next step is to take this sucker through some rips from the bomb so let's hope that this adapter is gonna want to work with us today get it into the rig so it stays there but well uh we'll have to see I got a bump down to the lowest temperature we're gonna start out through this little mini rig here very little water and then we'll pick it through our 420 cata box rig because that one just allows a little bit more of the perk the percolation with the showerhead perk in there or this one's just a straight down stem right into the water so let's see how this vape does on the lowest tap through here th ow okay so it had not really much flavor there I found it was really mild and a little bit disappointing but we've got the second level on the battery just taken through a rip through here and see see if it improves the taste at all you guys Cheers hmm it does get more of that wheat you taste wheat he tastes not weedy tastes but wheat he tastes and it's not bad it's still enjoyable but it's it's missing something I think but we've got to bumped up to the highest level it's taken taste through there and see see the extra temperature helps at all I don't know I guess let's uh let's try it out Cheers no nobody more we'ii taste wheat taste hey guys so we've got the other rig we're gonna go ahead and preheat the G pen this time and give it a little chance so we can really take a fat rip let's try it out y'all Cheers back at the lowest tab definitely more citrus I I'm gonna recommend this lowest temperature you guys definitely the best okay so we bump this up to the second temperature we're gonna try it out through there you guys and see see how it does but honestly I'm not expecting very much Cheers okay yes so it did have that weedy taste again that wheat II taste but we got this pen pre-charge with the hottest temp to take for a rip and see how it does you're here cheers y'all honestly my biggest fan of this cartridge you guys that was actually disappointing it it really is only one of those ones that you can set bond once or twice doesn't really hit that hard kind of lead you in a citrus direction but by no means takes a strong flavour and like hit you with it it is very disappointing that way I definitely wish it had more flavor you guys that's just gonna be honest review them I wish this had more flavor but going into the high it does have a nice light mental drift to it where lay the the back your mind is kind of loosely swinging in the wind where you can be focused on something but you've got that little voice in the back your head kind of thing and that's really what I'm finding with this where it's I'm like oh I need to get this done but [ __ ] like that right like just don't enjoy yourself kind of a kind of a high and it's it's nice I definitely do like that it's something that would be very helpful if I am golfing or am doing something that has that that focus but if something that the frustration because of the focus is there that's the better way to describe it the frustration because of the focus on the game such as golf because if you make a mistake it is frustrating especially when I'm at the point where I'm kind of that verge of a beginner intermediate I'm right on that bubble once I can roll over into the intermediate I've got more consistency that's and that's where the biggest thing now is consistency and the frustration that comes with that being inconsistent that is and that's the thing with this cartridge kind of circles back the flavor was very inconsistent it's frustrating I'm wholly gonna give it a 6 out of a 10 you guys just because the high has that enjoyment but it's not strong enough to really blow me away and give make me want to smoke that over some of the other sativa strains that I have that have that mental drift in effect and I'd rather just smoke a lighter amount of that because I enjoyed the flavor more and that's really gonna be the difference between this this cartridge getting a six or anything higher that six marker is you've got some good qualities but I've got lots of [ __ ] that I'd smoke above you and I've got lots of cartridges actually that I would smoke above this one to get this type of effects you guys but we're gonna wrap this one up I I wish it did better I really did I thought it would have citrus strains usually hit home with me I'm a big citrus that uplift I really do like that kind of flavor I just thought it would do better but it didn't end up doing that I'm a little bit disappointed we're are gonna do one more riff through this little rig because I feel like we should give it another big rip to give it a chance to try and bump it up but I really don't think I will YouTube stick around cuz after this last trip it'll be your guy's end card but for everyone else I really do hope you guys enjoyed I'll be back tomorrow with some orange cookies review from gage cannabis we got the last BC bud of the week from our take me home 2022 uh a trip but if you got some orange cookie sativa dominant hybrid here that

was going pretty hard need a week to just chill but anyways i got a special review today we're going to be going over a 10 cartridge versus a 50 cartridge i know a lot of people they just want to they just want to get high they just want to get high really quick discreetly um and for cheap which is understandable that's why these 10 cards used to be really popular back in the day i was even hooked on these 10 cards for a while just because it's it's it's cheap it's cheap cheap to get high but that has changed now i don't cheaply intoxicate myself i smoke the very [ __ ] best best that i can find so first off let's give it a look it has this um kind of like iron type titanium look to it some ridges um looks cool distal it's flat not moving let's get a little puffer nothing to really complain about i mean ooh this is something to complain about cannabis extracted with butane so i don't know how many uh ppms is in here i don't know how many parts per million uh is left over of butane in this in this cartridge but that would turn me away and that's probably one of the reasons i don't buy these i didn't actually know it was extracted with butane but now i do but yeah now we got uh some dab logic um that tasted okay there wasn't really too many complaints about it it's not like i full on tasted butane dab logic nice little uh laser laser print around this um it looks like it's natives or aztecs or something has dab logic written across the bottom take this off and snap this on now right off the bat i can it can automatically taste a more it's a more natural taste uh you're not gonna be really be able to tell maybe if you're like you know not used to knowing what quality tastes like if i were just a noob coming in here these would both taste very very similar it's not like you can taste heavy butane in that or anything it's just me knowing that this was processed with butane what turns me away but that's you know it's ten dollars worth of butane now what makes these so different why is this ten dollars why is this fifty dollars a big part of this is gonna be extraction these guys oil they're in the market for wholesale they make most of their money off distributing large quantities to dispensaries they're targeting the market that you know is wanting to and toxic intoxicate themselves for a lot cheaper now these guys these guys are marketing more towards the connoisseurs uh this extraction this was not extracted with butane uh there's a process i'm not too sure how it goes down or how they get it into cartridges but i know there's lots of ways to uh extract and get solventless you can do a fresh chop wash that in a bucket of ice water extract those tricoms in a ice hash then press that and then here comes your rosin i don't know how they liquefy it or what consistency and uh temperatures they do to get it to this consistency in this cartridge but they do and it works so what you're mainly paying for right here and why this is so so much more expensive is that is that when people are washing this and uh when they're extracting uh from this method you yield also a lot less from just blasting a can of butane through a whole bunch of weed this process you actually your yield is a lot smaller um but you have a higher quality so that's where the 50 dollar price mark come from but you know a lot of people really don't care but a lot of people do care and this is this is the main differences sorry you can't see the table the camera's up a little too high uh but yeah anyways uh i hope you like this video i hope i covered everything um and there's like a lot more there's like a lot more there's a lot more labeled on this solvent-less solvent-less vape and for those of you that don't know solventless i had a friend ask me i've explained rosin to them but sometimes people don't remember solventless is processed without solvents like butane co2 what else do they use um that's all i can think of out of my head those are the main ways that people use to extract those are solvents this is solvent less solvent less is the way to go your lungs are going to be a lot happier your high is going to be a lot better and you might say well [ __ ] i don't want to spend 50 on a cart i'm going to stick to 10 that's ok but also you have to keep in mind this is going to pack a harder punch because it's way more purity in this than that other cartridge i didn't mean to be a dick i shouldn't do that i'll [ __ ] it uh but anyways i don't even know where it went it wasn't too far anyways it doesn't matter but yeah those are the main differences a 50 card versus a 10 card i know a lot of people see it in dispensaries and they're like why the [ __ ] is that cart fifty dollars well now you know uh glad i got to do this video a lot about to see you guys uh subscribe uh i'm gonna be doing some merch drop soon so you know stay tuned turn on those notifications uh and i'll see you guys soon uh probably my next video i'm gonna be comparing some of the weed i grew and some of the weed my friend grew and we're gonna put it up against some dispensary weed and show you why potentially home growing could be better than commercial growing that's not always the case but for 99 of industry it is um peace out guys take care let me know in the comments what other videos you want i love uh i love getting suggested new ideas because sometimes i don't know what are good ideas and i just go off top but thanks guys for watching peace out", "gqGxit_NiQ4": "what's up guys be green 91 and today we're checking out one of the first legal vaporizer cartridges in the Canadian recreational cannabis market we got this from City cannabis Cove in Vancouver they're legal recreational dispensary this vapour cartridge cost about $80 $70 and about $10 and taxes but after January 1st taxes on vaporizer products are going up to 20% these are new products and they were just introduced but the price point on them right now is just not making any sense this is a point three gram cartridge it cost $80 I could get a full spectrum extract saw scar on the black market for 25 bucks these are brand new they were just released as a part of the next wave of legalization known as legalization 2.0 the introduction of extracts and edibles these are the first offerings they came out around Christmas box has a strained name on their says one 510 indica cartridge net weight point three zero gravel THC is seven hundred and thirty three point eight milligrams so seventy three point 38 percent THC point seven milligrams CVD got the government required warning label on there says frequent and prolonged use of cannabis containing THC can contribute to mental health problems over time daily or near daily use increases the risk of dependence and may bring on or worsen disorders related to anxiety and depression back it says cannabis extract intended for inhalation contact information do not freeze or in a dry place or stored to keep upright no expiry date has been determined key vote of reach of children contains the equivalent of 1.2 grams of dried cannabis and has a packaging date on your tenth month of 2019 on the 21st day as you can see four point three cartridge it comes in quite a big package childproof to open it you're gonna break the tax stamp on the side you're gonna open the top flap of the box you're gonna press the two buttons in on the side pull it oh and there's your cartridge right out of the box it's a small cartridge 0.3 car it's got stickers on it this isn't a custom car it looks like a cheap car nazi so no particular brand i can see these being mimicked on the black market nothing to indicate that this actually came from a licensed producer lastik mouthpiece cut a glass body which is good ceramic coils 510 threading so it will fit on most standard vaporizer batteries the oil looks pretty clear which is good kind of hard to [ __ ] up cannabis oil about the oil is nice and clear golden which is a good sign seen some darker oils on the website but a smooth vapor very bland taste there's a bit of flavor but it's very bland time to get the hint of Kush smooth on the throw pretty underwhelming but I buy these for my personal use no I absolutely prefer my full-spectrum extract cards from the black market over these and really no comparison $80 for 0.3 gram cartridge $25 for 0.5 full-spectrum soft card for these legal products and dispensaries were brought in to try to eliminate the black market prices like $80 per point 3 gram cartridge I don't think that's gonna work to eliminate the black market I don't know if the recreational market will ever be able to catch up to the black market with prices and products like these the products are 100% inferior to what's available on the black market prior to legalization a product like this would cost you about 35 the pros of this product its legal the oil tastes clean it's a co2 oil so there's no additives or dilute and it's not a ceramic coil blast body which is good oils nice and clear and golden pecans it's expensive I'll go through one of these bow every 2 or 3 days I would never be able to afford to use these it's a cheap generic car super easy to mimic they only have stickers on there nobody wouldn't be able to tell the difference between this and a cart from the black market it's a point three milligram very small I didn't see any one gram cartridges available yet only 1/2 milligrams of 0.3 milligram the only way I would be able to recommend this product to somebody is if they absolutely refuse to purchase off the black mark like an old granny or something like that if they were looking for a vaporizer pen die I could recommend this product to them it's not great but it's not horrible it's not dirty it's actually probably the best product I have tried on the legal market I've tried the pre-rolls I've tried some of the buds and they were horrible this product is actually tolerable I was to give it a rating out of 10 I would give it a 4.5 absolutely underwhelming it's not amazing by any means better than I expected me personally I'll be sticking to what I know but for you guys I'll be continuing to do some reviews on legal cannabis products so stay tuned like share subscribe my name's be green thanks for watching peace", "IRG8BwYMnPo": "[Music] nothing fun to say this time welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help all of you wonderful pretty and some of you damaged and some of you wounded but all of your fine folks you're all beautiful on the inside even well maybe not you but you know you you definitely beautiful on the inside the outside mmm inside though smoking I don't know what I'm talking about welcome the weeds guys we are here to review some cannabis today we are gonna be doing another cartridge review we're gonna take a look at Humboldt uh choose kindly live give and grow this is Humboldt farms brand cannabis oil disposable 510 while this section disposable they're all five tens are disposable this isn't the sort of all-in-one this is just a 5-10 thread goes on your standard battery I've got mine here this is a half gram cartridge indica grape soda is the strain I don't really care um well we'll see if it's any good I hope it's mostly terpenes uh and then we have this nice little package here it's kind of adorable in a way it's a little tin metal package of some kind it's not a lot of material pretty easy to recycle this you know everybody's looking I don't know if it's aluminum I think it might be aluminum aluminum is always good to recycle so you know um in terms of packaging I quite dig it price point was pretty fair for the half gram cartridge I picked it up for $24 which is you know a little bit on the low end for a legal cartridge sorry that was pretext so this you know more than 30 after-tax for half gram cards which is still on the lower end for Southern California for four license cartridges so half gram 24 bucks pre-tax here in Southern California I've never reviewed anything from Humboldt farms before I'm surprised there aren't a trillion companies with that name there probably are but so far again packaging is pretty cool I have no idea what to expect on the inside but that's what we'll get to right now so I ripped off a little connecting piece of paper there and then it says squeeze and slide I'll try squeeze and slide squeeze slide it slides doesn't come on okay would you look at this Oh perfect here we go this is pretty cool on the inside we have our little ingredients list manufactured packaged date also it looks like maybe manufactured by loud pack a big giant company I think they make their own cartridges and have their own farms but I think they also do a lot of I guess bottling is what you'd call it they do the making of the cartridges for some farms so that looks like that might be the case here uh and then also it says not for world consumption I don't quite understand what that means because I'm going to be consuming this definitely orally alright well let's take a look at the cartridge itself which is pretty interesting it looks like this is the only the second cartridge that I have come across so far that has a wooden tip that's right the mouthpiece is it's wood it's some kind of it's some kind of wood not some plastic Enoch up it's really wood which is a really interesting material - you know to wrap your mouth around I guess I don't dislike it it's you know it's not as pleasant I guess as a good piece of glass or a good piece of aluminum but the materialist is as super sustainable you know what is it's no big deal so I don't fault it for that but well give it a whole try here screw it in our grape soda oil is looking very very handsome yellow there again doesn't really matter the color you know any color can be in any consistency or quality but who doesn't like to see a nice bright yellow alright well for the most important part let's give it a test and turn my battery on here there she goes would put this woody in my mouth hmm after sucking on that woody for a little bit I was surprised how much came out uh Jesus Christ what am I talking about sorry Wow okay um that is incredibly fruity very very very fruity not really grape but certainly fruity it does say that um this all comes from cannabis derived and natural terpenes so theoretically nothing artificial in it it is just has a lot of flavor in here I'll say that I kind of like it though I actually like the fruity flavors and I like I like a lot of flavor if it if it's a flavor I enjoy and I'm a sucker for the you know I've got the sweet tooth I'm sucker for the beyond the more sweet tasting strains and this one has it in spades other than the taste um it's great actually um it's just fine loud pack seems to know what they're doing making these cartridges actually it's really smooth too very pleasant to hit and while the packaging I forgot to mention this says that it comes in at a pretty high 81 and a quarter percent THC I'm gonna give it another couple puffs here and see if I you know if that sounds reasonable oh yeah I mean it's this is quality oil yeah I have no complaints about the potency and quality of what we've got going on in here - my first - my tongue into my brain these first couple of hits been super enjoyable um Wow yeah this has been a pretty big thumbs up from me at this point for the Humboldt Farms grape soda I've been forgetting to get down you guys are gonna kill me the comes through there [ __ ] I owe you a whole five-second draw before I go here guys um design kart design is really nice the wood is interesting the wood tip is interesting I mean if it's sustainable and it you know doesn't cost them a lot of money go for it it's just it's just odd it I can't really explain why alright I'm gonna do one more hit and then I'm gonna bounce but as you guys all know I'm not leaving you forever no no no I'm gonna enjoy all half grand I've got here probably over the next 48 to 60 hours or so and then once I've gotten through this humble Farms grape soda once I got the last drop out I'll come right back here to you guys and let you know exactly what I thought of the whole experience I say it every time but only because it's true we all know that these carts are prone to malfunctioning they can break the atomizer can burn out they can start leaking any number of problems I've seen them all and that's why I do the whole review to let you know to make sure the whole product was good from the top to the very bottom so I'm really looking forward to smoking on this one and I look forward to telling you guys all about it right back here in just a bit thanks for watching hi guys welcome back to wheats as predicted it has been 48 hours of moderate enjoyment with Humboldt Farms grape soda here let's see if I can get that zoomed in you can see they're still actually a little bit of wax there in the cartridge um I'm altum Utley coming away pretty mixed with maybe sort of leaning towards disappointment I like the oil inside quite a bit no oil was good it was the cartridge that let me down the wood tip I don't know if it was a function of the wood tip or what but the cartridge was routinely getting clogged meaning I would have to you know you would try to inhale and nothing you would get no vapor let alone air flow on and I would sort of it cleaning out or just really really keep inhaling until eventually I don't know whether the oil heated up and again I'm not even sure what was causing the headache there whether it was the atomizer not properly working or whether the oil just didn't heat right I'm not sure what mechanic wasn't working at a hundred percent but I do know that I had some trouble on more than some trouble with this cartridge which which is a bit of a bummer um taste you know III don't think grape soda is gonna be for everybody I I found it pretty enjoyable um but again the problems you know you don't you certainly don't want your twenty five thirty dollar cartridge having to go in the trash nothing this one had to go in the trash but you know the problems could have been greater also it did have that problem with the oil getting really hot at the bottom as you're getting closer and closer to completing you get that sort of almost burnt taste I know it's I can't quite describe it where you get this sort of harsher clouds this one definitely experienced that as well so ultimately I'm gonna say there are better options out there for you then humbled farms again this is just our first review of anything from this company if you guys tell me no man keep trying I know these guys are great I'll take another look at him but for now you know um I'd saying there there are plenty of other options plenty of other fish in the sea then Humboldt Farms take some you leave some you win some you lose some and that guys is gonna do it for this review here on wheats a bit of a mixed bag today but they're always sunnier skies ahead and that's gonna do it guys thank you so much for watching wheats and we will see all you find folks on the next review ciao", "fSq1_D4kzvk": "hey what's going on guys welcome to that connection here i got hometown hero delta a so check this out man check this out halfway with it i [ __ ] love it i'm not gonna lie so it doesn't say the strain but when i looked into the website this strawberry cough i [ __ ] love that strand it tastes so smooth so sweet so tasteful it's one of the smoothest delta i've ever tried to be honest with you and you could um personally i love sweet tasting uh cartridges either that or likes ones that taste like strict flour you know like a [ __ ] um what's a good brand that's a good strain [Music] anyways uh this tastes a lot like strawberry coffee if you tried it it doesn't taste exactly like strawberries but it'll give a nice sweet like you can still taste a little bit but i taste more just sweet overall sweet taste smooth like i said and it's only 600 milligrams of delta eight so i'll be assuming the rest would be terpenes so if you like terpene tasting cartridges you're going to love this cartridge because i'm telling you man it's smooth it's clean it's tasteful doesn't potency is delta so if you guys ever tried delta 8 then you know what i'm talking about if you don't don't be expecting to get high as a [ __ ] dispensary grade thc cartridge dabs weed bud nug anything anything at all like thc full thc spectrum even if it's from the street or from your homie even unless it's like a sketchy uh you know one of those sketchy sus cards then that's how i compare the height to this too not the high but like you know the experience so to say but hi it's uh i view this as like a [ __ ] i don't know overall delta eight i never get baked off i never get too stoned off it i just get a nice close a nice slight high not strong enough to last hours not strong enough to make you feel like couch potato kind of vibe but just like a mellow and it doesn't give you a fog like high you know when you're just like i'm telling you like slouched and like oh i don't want to [ __ ] kind of high nah it'll give you a nice buzz just for a little bit but the potency for this it's a pretty good just like every most delta eights i've tried oil quality good nice dense slight yellow color some are either light yellow slight yellow like the gold color like this or like straight water clear like color you know they're sometimes i don't know which ones are better i thought the water clear ones were good but i like this one a lot but you know what let me just hit you guys for you guys all right i got the yolk and armor the biggest down uh before i hit this i just want to say the biggest down i found about this cartridge is because i put it on the vessel battery that's always my go-to when i go to battery when i have a cartridge and it didn't hit that well you know i like that the the vessel that everything goes to four volts or four point two this still yo this is what you can do this still goes to four four point two but i don't know this one hit a lot better with the vessel battery it just hit life for me but anyways cheers give me a second this shit's [ __ ] it's another thing hold on because i don't know this thing it doesn't get clogged frequently but you'll have that problem now just hit set [ __ ] it it's nice smooth smooth smooth deltoid i've tried to be honest i'm telling you this right now and i've tried to shut down the deltoids i'm the one doing all these reviews too so i'm getting used to the taste but you know in general delta eight it will always always always be harsh if you take consistent or long hits it doesn't matter how much of a pothead you are it doesn't matter how many times you smoke cards a day trust me it's uh it gets you you'll he'll you'll definitely feel it in your throat if you take consistent and long hits but take short hits like this like don't be cheaping on it don't just like take smooth hits you won't be coughing that much with with hometown hero especially i like that that's what i love about this car and it's so tasteful man nice smooth slight sweet taste good terpene mixture i'm telling you if this is a gram this 600 milligram for delta there has got to be terpenes right because it just terpenes and they'll take this lit so this shit's good this is good i've seen the there i've seen other cards the one i'm about to review right now i forgot the name of it but i'm in the process of reading another delta a few other actually some of them are only like 200 or like 800 milligram delta so they have less terpenes in it but they're probably stronger well in general they'll take i don't really feel much strength right i see it as a good supplement or maybe you want to get off vaping or cbd something different other than that maybe you haven't smoked it all you just want to test it if you're like that take small hits please trust me you don't want to take big ass hits trust me trust me you're going to learn the hard way video but with this one if you're like that you want something smooth for and you're looking for something smooth they'll take highly recommend hometown hero and i'm telling you supporting the veterans bro the full gram cartridge does go for like 40 grand 40 grams 40 dollars for 30 40 i think some [ __ ] like that but honestly if you've tried i like the three shy a lot that one's really good i like the dimension a dash it was fire but this out i don't know they both are unique in their own way with the taste of their strings but this shit's good this is the only string they have right now hopefully they make more because i mean no man i would like the other ones see what else they would got i don't know but strawberry cough they'll say let me take one more here for you guys i mean other than that this shit's good yeah but that is hometown hero delta eight is that connection thank you thank you for watching guys peace", "Y9c1e221R0I": "[Music] hi guys welcome back today we are gonna discuss the 1937 brand cartridges these are a really good brand than I discovered a few months ago this is the second cartridge that I have bought the first one was a King Louie absolutely loved the flavor on it got every single last bit out of it there was no waste with this one it tasted so good this one that I recently purchased is the purple blue dream equally tasty equally tasty supposed to be a hybrid I kind of feel like it's more of a like an indica based hybrid I don't know if that's just me or if that's really the way it is but that's kind of I I like this for the afternoons for the evenings before bed anyways there the packaging is pretty interesting it's got a little bit of a mission statement on the inside a little bit of history the packaging is pretty cool I don't know you can't see much on the back because they put the THC info sticker on the back but it does give you the basic information it is manufactured by us CP which is also the manufacturer of the Oklahoma tonic which I absolutely adore this dust really good it's good for trying to relax it helps me relax it it actually affects you a little different than it edible does I don't know if it's because this is a liquid and the way your body processes that I don't know I just know it's good I have bought three of these now really good stuff but let's get back to the 1937 brand cartridges the cartridges are always completely full when I buy them there is no little gap like there is in some brands I've been smoking on this for a week and that is how much it's gone down I like the I'm sorry I like the packaging the mouthpiece is around only thing I don't like is there's never a mouthpiece guard I kind of want a garden like a little rubber thing that goes over the top of it but still a good a good a good design I guess this is magnetic this is the excess snap I really like it it fits in the palm of my hand it's kind of just straight if you ever you know just just discreet nobody can really see it except for maybe the mouthpiece and still yet it can be very discreet I love this thing because you can look in through there it protects I really like this because it protects but yet you can look through there and see exactly how much juice you know is left and there is nothing that makes me happier than looking in there and seeing it completely yellow I mean completely full one of the best feelings in the world so anyway skies it's about 4:20 in the afternoon so cheers cheers Cheers hmm he's taste really good they have a different taste to them something unique I'm not I'm not sure how to describe it other than it's a lovely flavor I have tried the helix brand I have tried the Arcadia brand and I have tried the Oklahoma pure brand so far 19:37 has them beat pretty good I mean the helix was good but they're not readily available in this area these are available they're affordable and I really like them the oil in them is clearly I mean it just it does not move and that's something I like I have seen them like the Arcadia brand and was I mean it was terrible it do this and it just instantly air bubbles and it was moving I don't like that I want it to be really thick it lets me know that it's not being cut of course you know the packaging kind of tells you a little bit about it it says the product is derived from THC distillate and cannabinoids or cannabis derived terpenes THC content is 85% terpene content is 5% it also says the product has been tested for can't a minute keep out of reach of children contains THC now say for kids or pet manufactured by us CP LLC and then on the back of course you've just got like I said the THC sticker that they put on everything here in Obama so yeah cheers guys so what's everybody doing for the 4th of July comment down below I love the fourth of July if you're still watching I would love I would love to see who's still watching at this point you okay guys I'm sorry that cut out earlier yeah I'm sitting out here in

happy fourth of July like and subscribe down below leave me a comment let me know if you think there's anything that I need to do to fret here alright guys bye", "uv2qrTaKd3o": "hi it's mattad Rafal studios and welcome to our review of the heavy hitters prefilled cannabis concentrate vaporizer pens [Music] we're going to be reviewing three different products from heavy hitters today we're gonna be reviewing the 2.2 gram cartridge the one gram cartridge and we're also going to be reviewing the actual vaporizer battery pen itself so let's go ahead and unbox these things and see what we have here first off is do we have the actual vaporizer pen and this is the pen that's actually provided by heavy hitters that you can purchase that's branded by heavy hitters it includes a little USB charger plug as well as the pen itself and that's a 5-10 thread pin okay and now we're gonna unbox the 1 gram cartridge this is an OG Kush cartridge which is a hybrid but it's in indica dominant and that's the one gram cartridge and now we're gonna unbox the 2.2 gram cartridge this is the ha static cartridge and this is a new flavor it's the blue dream ok so now let's take a closer look at these individual items first we're going to look at the battery itself now the heavy-hitters battery that is available through heavy hitters and which is recommended for the device is just the right wattage at 4 watts it also has no buttons or anything on it the only thing that you can see is the logo on the side for heavy hitters and then the 510 threaded end that actually plugs into the USB charger that's the simple kind of USB charger that plugs directly into USB and you could charge that with other kind of chargers as well ok now we're going to look at the 1 gram pen and this is the cartridge pin for the 1 gram that's the og cush I'm a big AG fan so I'm really looking forward to trying this out in a minute and it's really simple it's just a one piece I know there was a little rubber cap that goes over the 510 thread there on one end but you just could discard the little rubber cap and then you see it's just a simple cartridge that threads directly onto the pin and these are sort of low wattage it's a 3.7 watts recommend it there so you could try these on other pins but you wouldn't want to try these on a modern of high wattage device okay now we're going to take a closer look at the big 2.2 grand pen and these are monsters I really like this the concept here of just making a tank that's gonna last you for a couple of weeks and also a big fan of blue dreams so looking also for it to trying this out and you can see this pin is so big that it's actually the cartridge is a little bit longer than the pen itself but it's very similar to the other pen other than the length of it it has screws right on to the end of the battery and it's the same battery that you can use on both size cartridges look at that at this like a it's like a rifle or something they're just not rifle you can see the comparing the two you can also see that the two oils look different as these are strange specific and you can also see out of the quality of the oil is very good how thick it is that takes that bubbles so long to roll up but one thing to be cautioned with and this is a lot of vaporizer pens they will roll off the table and break so be careful you don't want to break your heavy head or you'll cry okay so it now comes the favorite part the part of that we've been waiting for here at Roth house studios and this is amazing a pen if you've tried any kind of these cartridges you just can't equal the taste I really like the little light-up end there when you you don't have to do anything when you draw through the pen it lights it up and also ignites the the vaporizer atomizers so you don't have to press any buttons or anything like that it's just air controlled and then I had a little fun here to try both flavors at once that OG Kush was delicious by the way very piney a little bit of lemon but very piney and delicious and the same goes for the Blue Dream it wasn't as pioneer but it was a much more lemony citrusy flavor and just awesome the flavor on these is incredible and heavy-hitters is the correct name you can get major puffs especially for the low wattage coils you can still get major big puffs and like I said we've tried these on multiple batteries and they work good with most of your low wattage batteries but you do need to be careful not to use too high of a wattage of a battery because you get burnt out the coil in the atomizer and it won't work another thing to be cautious with about using these heavy headers or any kind of the cartridges or a lot of these cartridges especially the high-end strong ones like this is that you can find yourself overmedicating very easily because it's such a pleasant experience it tastes so good and it doesn't make you cough and choke that after a few hits you may just find yourself staring out into the window aimlessly and forgetting what you're doing so be careful not to over Medicaid and don't drive or operate machinery obviously anytime but especially in the case with with these heavy headers because they are appropriately named-- you will definitely get very very high off of these all right very easily super high quality very premium premium oil right here [Music] so that comes to my review or my rating for the heavy hitters and I'm gonna give it five stars I really can't find any problems with it the only problem that I have is you're gonna be upset if you let it roll off the table and break it which is only a testament to the product itself just top-notch product so I would like to say thank you to heavy hitters who sent out these pens for us to review if you'd like to learn more about heavy hitters you can check them out online and you could also ask for them at your local dispensary I hope you enjoyed this review of the heavy hitters solvent free concentrated cannabis wax pens if you did please hit the like button and subscribe to roughhouse Studios for more cannabis culture videos made just for you this is mad at roughhouse studios thanks for watching [Music]", "fSNDZ9HQnQk": "[Music] all right guys what's up simplistic here back with another video i'd like to mention that randy is filming this whole entire video on his camera so the video quality is going to be a lot better but if you didn't see from the b-roll all that good stuff i do have three buddies i mean you've already seen it but uh basically i bought a distillate one and a live resin one but the distillate has live resin terps and uh it is a form of live resin to me so for those of you who say it's not realized to me it is all right but uh one of these are actually ben's and we're gonna give him right here thank you but he's also gonna be in the video shout out to be legit also subscribe to rj eats and i'm saying the link will be in the bottom description below all that good stuff but for this video we have two batteries we have a stick battery from the chill and we have your typical box battery uh from the brand das vape so we're definitely gonna try both of these these are both sativas as well one's clementine one is train wreck and uh for those of you who want to see the differences this one the green one is actual live resin this one's distilled with live resin terps and as you can see this one has ten percent more terps or ten percent terps while this one only has uh four but what this lacks inter uh percentage they actually have a lot more not a lot more but more thc see as you can see right here total cannabinoids like 80 something this one's like 70. that's the difference between distillate and live resin live resins generally 70s maybe 80s if you're lucky with distillate being 80 to 90. so um i'm going to open these and uh i'm just going to take some hits i don't know i'm going to title this video maybe buddies live resin and distill it live resin terps i don't know what i would call it but something along those lines and uh just let me know in the comments how you liking this video quality you know what i'm saying i appreciate mandy for uh filming this whole episode with this stuff i don't say but right off the bat opening this smells very lemony i believe the prominent oh wait i thought it was there right so put that in you can see the color of this the color of this distillate with the live resin terps is generally going to be a lighter more green or yellowish color i mean it even says in the box right look at the colors compared to them the live resin right here is uh generally going to be darker but distill it with live resin terps gonna be a a yellowish greenish color yeah got it got it so yeah did you take the first hit well this is an action i don't know autofocus is pretty [ __ ] fire okay yeah standing still is a little harder but moving around like it's i'm wondering that's how it's gonna work with the app too because the aperture you can lower the aperture a lot further down on that on the 22 millimeter that i have yeah so this one's the captain kush this was what ben chose as you can see let's just mix them up and [ __ ] damn that's fine let me see oh [ __ ] yeah very good that one's a live resin on the right no these are both the distally with the live resin terms [Applause] but you'll see the difference sorry about that broke this box this is the [ __ ] that [ __ ] all right right here get that see you can see the colors oh yeah yeah the one in the middle yeah this one has 10 turfs these ones have four percent but these have a higher percentage in thc or cannabinoids so uh this one's yours before i forget and we're gonna just take it take a hit off all three i'm saying who's calling me cheers [Music] hello no gotta give one to the camera man um yeah i got it um it's auto focus yeah i'll do it for you oh [ __ ] that's dope go no wonder you're far back yeah i was like what the heck that bigger crop it's it's uh uh just randy oh my god it looks dope uh yeah damn you can feel this glance working when the it's shaking so we have to switch the spot real quick guys because the kitchen is being occupied but randy just took a hit off the train wreck cartridge how'd you like it it definitely hit right definitely hit yeah honestly you're paying 28 for a gram of this right yeah that's why i bought two more i mean uh this is like my third one that i bought of the white one because some i don't know why i i seem to like the distillate live resin turps better than the live resin one and i don't know if it's just me it's a lot cheaper too maybe that's uh it tastes good to me i don't know but ben hasn't taken a hit off this this is the clementine i mean trainer okay what's up alexis oh i still got a pretty good angle of it because i got in there in time i was still uh like last time i thought it would turn out i was like so no we got the live resin one of the clementine so if you're not awake all right so i'm gonna take a hit of this off this battery you guys know this battery hits okay oh this is a good shot holy [ __ ] this one's a lot smoother the the library is a lot smoother this one uh i feel like it hits a lot harder maybe that's what adds on to the harshness to it you get a fatter hit off the distillate one because maybe distillate is a thinner oil even though it's still thick it's a lot thinner i gotta get out the shot that was kind of weird there you go i love the cart whose was this one this is the the clementine with 10 turks one was wet last one was i need to try it again this one's good though i don't know i like the this this one tastes good though yeah it tastes more like natural yeah okay and then we're going to try tastes like actual dab now so since this is his he's going to try it first and it's going to be a winker cbs can you bring his calling no yeah [Laughter] this is actually ben's so when we went to authentic today i i came with the idea of buying a liquid live resin or a live resin one and a distance live resin turf one and then ben also came along and purchased one as well because he tries he tried my buddy's car before and he liked it you know and it's 28 you really can't beat that but yeah i'm gonna try this now um the total for all three of these was only 86.50 that's pretty good that's hella good usually that's like almost grabbing a half maybe that ground and 20 quarters i mean a quarter that 20 that 20 quarters [Music] and you can see his pores and [ __ ] oh [ __ ] dog though all right so [Music] so oh this one's a lip do you change the brightness yeah did you die it still look nice change it oh go hold on we got to fix that though no it's cool it's cool looks good it's not too bright no it's better now but the other one wasn't wasn't that bad it was still bright but you guys hear that joe rogan in the background you feed me that's the biggest [Music] all right so um uh all three you guys like the live rest one better uh probably the what was the first one that was the train wreck i like that one better yeah but the close that the second one is going to be the live resin one that's my birthday um but to end off the video guys i am going to take a hit off both at the same time and uh i don't know i'm going to title this video maybe somewhere along the lines blinking both buddies parts i don't know something like that um but yeah look at both legs clicking both buttons so cheers [Laughter] [Music] that's for you guys we're gonna end it off with uh randy

an educational purpose in the cut welcome back everybody to a brand new video today I got yet again another select wax cartridge I got you guys man you guys been doing these like wax cartridges I went for the hybrid I went for the cherry pie and so a little bit about this it's a hybrid I believe it's more than a sativa science I'm pretty sure because sometimes when it's yellow it's kind of like a sativa hybrid you know so it is cherry pie and I've tried this only like once or twice just because I throw this and I I bought this and all we're having at me and some of the guys were having a sesh so we just kind of threw this some rode oh and man like this man I only have it just a little bit enough just to kind of show you guys look at that all right right there so like always everybody we got to select you guys see that right there we like it that I just like that 83% zero six eighty three point zero six percent THC and it's some cherry pie you guys know was good I'm completely sober right now so we're gonna see how many hits it takes for us to get lit so cherry pie everybody again welcome to another podcast I hope you guys are enjoying these also everybody makes you guys drop a like the comment subscribe 18 another educational purposes like always everybody make sure you guys once again actually let's take let's take the first shrimp so on there's if we got a brand new pen this pen is actually a little bit different the red is actually the lowest setting the blue is like the medium and the green is like the highest so I'm just like wait what cheers everybody see if I could get like a taste okay so it does kind of become like a bit like a little cherry like a little cherry aftertaste like a little punch like a little cherry punch hmm see the cool thing that I like about select cartridges and regarding cartridges is they don't really be adding a lot of flavor sometimes when they be adding flavor that shit's kind of like a bad chemical you know I mean I'm pretty sure it's a pretty bad chemical you know if they were to add some flavor on it might be not too harmful but I mean if you guys are damn [ __ ] you guys are heinous [ __ ] all day you know it's just definitely bad for you but these happens man these are coming these be coming and going like crazy so look at that we got the little select logo um I think there is a couple pink ones bro like that strip tap fake select I feel like nowadays man they could probably make anything bro literally anything for example like again you guys know this I already tried on fake brass not though I seen fake King pens I've seen what other fake it's mainly brass knuckle I've seen a couple fake heavy hitters and it's just like damn people are thinking like man I'm getting the jug but in reality you guys are just can that custom that home that custom made oil could be a little bit cheap who knows some plugs can potentially make some good fire stuff so who knows but let's take another first hit select does not disappoint I mean out of all of them out of all of them I feel like select is top 3 I gotta admit top 3 when it comes to like actually getting lit again select does have like a little meaning like a point 3 cartridge which is like an ax it's in high 90 percent THC and oh my god roll you take a rip of that 1 or 2 a deer man but it's not around like 40 50 bucks just for that little piece of like super concentrated THC it's crazy but a cheers OH I think now I feel like I can probably tell the difference from a lot of wax cartridges like this definitely has select I'll written all over like all of them have like different tastes if it's crazy the raw garden one you can tell right away like bro if I were to close my and I woulda hit a wrong garden and if I were to know if I were to hit a rock garden I'd be able to tell it's like you know chewing out a piece of leaf you know piece of tree piece of bush and that's the leg type I got that it's so weird I'm not I'm horrible at explaining especially explaining a taste but it has like this let me see if let me see if I can explain to you guys definitely I think select cartridge is a lot better than a Moxie but the Moxie does have a really great flavor but again you know that's what a lot of people say you know when it has a good it has like a good candy type flavor and yeah it's definitely not good for you you know because they'd be adding stuff for the flavors because in reality it's like okay if they were to press a certain tree huh you know what there's just so much to it man I there's so much learning to this to this industry you know like I just I just keep thinking about it like it doesn't make sense because sometimes when you don't taste something I'm just like okay cool it's legitly the concentration you know it's literally the oil from the flower you know it's nothing else added to it which makes it just taste like like literally just one single taste which is kind of dough same with raw garden that's what I figured you know Rob garden it always has like the same flavor that same strong flavor with like maybe a little hint of something and you can tell but it depends on the flower like the natural flower you know but sometimes we have like for example I'm not saying heavy hitters brass knuckles and all that stuff sucks or anything like that I'm still gonna cop some here and there but I'm saying like the flavor is too artificial like it's not artificial but it definitely for me I feel like they could potentially add some something to it just so I could get that flavor you know but I could be wrong you know I could be wrong that's just my thought but again everybody I'm not saying to not buy those brands you know because in reality they are you know proved as long as you guys are like like legitly getting them from like the club or the you know the dispensary and stuff you guys aren't really getting them from your local drug dealer cuz your local drug dealer listen to this you guys I talk about this in all pretty much all my wax cartridge videos because sometimes you know these guys they could probably make the wax you know the oil pretty good and you know what hey you got yourself a good cartridge homemade wax you know but at least it's like nothing crazy you know but then there's also other cartridges you know for example like in my experience what I had is like you know I poked out in a couple times and they just turned brown and I'm just like yo this does not look normal yeah it was like a thirty dollar brass knuckle you know like it was definitely fake it was not it was not the real brass knuckles of faith it was a fake brass knuckle but that's one way you guys could see and sometimes let's chop the other sensitivities 1 2 3 I think it's just good 3 oh wait a minute green as the middle one look at that that green is definitely the better wood yeah green is definitely the middle one tastes a lot more made-up fatter cloud and I do see a couple people sometimes like there was this um I had a friend that they came to visit me during my lunch yeah my old job right and they were like eh like you smug and I was just like well I mean sometimes you know not all crazy she's like they're like oh I got a I got a wax pen right I'm not gonna call them out or anything but like yeah I got a wax Maran I was like yeah that's good so they took it out right and I looked at it don't like have a halfway smoke and I was like what is this it was like some off-brand you know wax cartridge right and I was like I like bro you're selling your smug on some fake ass [ __ ] didn't it was just like so black the oil will you see this right here the oil it's like halfway through maybe like they smoked it like right here no no maybe like right there like literally get halfway and I guess what they said was that it just started turning black and I was like dude you know that's like when that's when it's fake and I was like what kind of car is it was like some designer brand not a designer brand I come it was some type of brand where I'm just like - right off the bed I'm just like yeah man you got to turn me little your local drug dealer huh you know my head I'm like why you know 1 2 3 all right let's try it off in the in the max um setting well I have your cloud the taste it's not too gay Don the highest win oh not too good this pen is to spit it's $50 pen don't get me wrong it's a nice pen but definitely not for Lake we tried a couple well we tried a couple um we tried a couple of these select cartridges already I liked select so it was literally like the first one to go to like this is the one that I wouldn't always like gay you know it's really good brand you know but right now the brand that I've kind of uh have been buying lately there's a lot of regarding rocker and is really nice rock garden is a good one but don't get me wrong rock garden and select are way different and they're both good so you know you could either go this router this round or you know cop one of each but definitely switch off you know mine I'm definitely gonna cop another Moxie cart I really like the flavor I mean it's some light resident in a wax cartridge you know and it's it's only $25 1/2 gram this one was about $35 1/2 gram I believe or 25 no no no I think this was 20 bucks I think $20 a minute there look at the thing dude half gram was like 25 I believe 25 um so it's not that bad whatsoever you know I like it it's a hybrid it doesn't have me all slump or like super awake I mean I like that super awake feeling you know the sativa that way I could be very productive but right now it's almost gonna be 9 p.m. so might as well you know just hit some in because and stuff like they're you know such it's pretty good oh one thing that a lot of people do not know and then my dumb ass just remembered especially here right here let's check this out so the directions or suggested serving a suggested serving which is one serving is three seconds so this is one serving I think I went a little overboard at three four seconds but three to four seconds is one serving and there is a hundred and twenty five servings so it's so let's see so let's start off it says right here look one three second draw and close cartridge contains 125 servings so what one three second draw is a so three times 125 so if we were to drag this it would take 375 seconds and if we were to do that and be around six or seven minutes so wait a minute so six or seven minutes of you pump that makes sense because if you're just gonna go sir like four minutes you'll smoke the whole thing hmm six eight minutes of hitting and that's why I love having baby hits - oh okay now that - that was just like a little fact that I just like read from the back a lot of people don't really know but yeah usually it's like a three to four second scene and I'm different once I'm pretty sure it's for all of them it's for the 510 thread the the pens or whatever but um um so three to four three to four seconds is one hit yeah but you have around 125 settings so if you were to take at least one serving a day that's literally a 125 1/2 gram of this but that means you have to be like super lightweight you never had any type of th in your blood whatsoever you know oh and another thing too that I'm just spacing out at this point what at this point pretty much what you want to do is I guess one of my boys put me on actually shot up oil yeah shout out chicken but pretty much when you hate when you have a pen you want to hit it right you hit it and then you have to wait I think maybe like 30 second I believe I freaking forgot but he said 30 seconds or more you have to you want to wait like 30 seconds in between that way it kind of cools down you know because if it's too hot the coils it might not burn right you know you might not get the best like the full potential of the hit you know so you want to make sure that you wait at least 30 seconds let it kind of cool down is that way so you can get like the best you know now I'm gonna try to tell everybody that because he told me that I'm just like dude I see people just rip this [ __ ] blow it out rip this [ __ ] blow it out rip this [ __ ] blow it out past I see a little person rip it blow it out and I'm just like damn maybe that's all the wax is being over burnt and it's not even like I mean at the same time it's it's gonna get burned you know it's gonna file but if you want to have like a perfect hit that's when you have to wait at least like over 30 seconds that's what he told me you know and in my head I'm just like yeah it makes kind of sense but let me know in the comments down below what do you guys think crazy stuff man but I just said bad but man but if you say man isn't but right out it just sounds like Pampa that's crazy so there we have it everybody we have some elite select cherry pie hybrid wax cartridge I hope you guys enjoyed this video make sure you guys drop a

leave a comment down below let's get into this [Music] yo yo what's good youtube this is two stone for you and today we're back with another 510 cartridge today we're going to be smoking on some fire og so yeah let's get into this review so this fire og 510 cartridge is by the brand hex go i picked this up on the ocs website for 3150 for a half gram of this shatter dislike whatever you want to call it and that's honestly not a bad price at all for this strain it's clocking in at 75 to 85 percent thc as you can see here our batch is 81 percent so that is actually relatively high the plant type is a hybrid you can pause the screen right here and read all the information you like this product is a co2 extraction but enough of that and let's actually get into the review when i did buy this actually i took off the duty stamp because i did intend on smoking it but then i was like wait wait wait let's make a video on this because uh you know i'm sure everyone wants to know what this cartridge is like so on the back here we have some really weird instructions on how to open it you have to put your two fingers in here like this apparently and slide this one up like that and then apparently you get your vape cartridge to come out and uh yeah holy they can even come out so there's our vape cartridge and this cardboard piece let's uh pop this out here i don't even know what i was saying there but we have those two rubber pieces here to protect the mouthpiece and the thread piece i kind of have it nice and zoomed up here right now but as you can see we have our thc logo and that nice blue hexo logo unfortunately there is nowhere on this cartridge that is saying there's fire og which is not a bad thing but i tend to mix up my cartridges a little bit when they're not labeled as you can see we have that nice golden distillate inside of this and i honestly can't wait to smoke on this and try it oh so i will say the stuff i was smoking on before was super sour diesel by daily special if you haven't seen that review i'll leave it in the description below and you can also check the video right here let's take this empty cartridge off let's put on this new bad boy all right so now we got our new cartridge on the pen you can see this one looks pretty cool compared to this one because we have a black tip and this one's like all clear and i've never seen one like this yet i'll bring it up a little closer so you guys can get a better look hopefully with a little close-up you're able to see what i was talking about and get a better look at everything inside the pen not that there's much to look at but you know what i'm talking about i guess the main part everyone wants to know is how does this smoke so make sure you go grab your pen you have your pipe your bong whatever you're smoking and let's try this today because we're about to give this a whip fire og by hexo let's go [Music] the smell from this fire og gives off that nice i don't even know how to describe it spicy aroma i don't i don't even know how to describe this one's like yeah it gives off that like spicy aroma like i don't know how to describe that smell and that taste is a classic fire og taste to fully review this cartridge i will definitely have to give this a 7 out of 10 not only for its price but for the flavor and the high that it gives off this fire og cartridge by hexo is definitely going to be up there on one of my top 10 favorite cartridges that i've ever tried this to me is definitely if you see it in your dispenser or even on the site i would go and pick it up shout out to hexo for a really great cartridge in my opinion definitely a really great cartridge make sure you guys don't forget to give this video a like and hit that subscribe button down below and let me know if you guys have tried this cartridge or any other by the extra brand because i'd like to know and if you guys have any suggestions for the next video please let me know in the comments down below that's it for this 510 cartridge review make sure you come back here on thursday to see a brand new video thank you all for watching and stay stoned", "PxL8RgmvK3I": "hey what's up guys what did do is you boy mr. bling see I'm coming back at you with another video I think I just cringed after I said that but uh anyway today I wanted to just talk about some carts uh in specific fake carts because like I've been watching a lot of other people's videos on like your views of carts and [ __ ] and anytime they review something that's like a dank vape or a dab wood or like a cereal cart all I see in the comments are over you smoking home to fake cards oh you've got no food carts oh that car doesn't have the holo graphics on it so I think that fake um I would like to just say shut the [ __ ] up cuz like I'm pretty sure everyone who smokes carts knows that all of these aren't real carts because I mean it's pretty obvious if you smoke them yourself you can get different packaging which are like fake our carts from a fake cart in general but just starting off this video all of these carts are fake these two are real though I'm just gonna show you the packaging on these real quick so first off they have the California label and that's something only some of these fake car companies can write or copy onto their packaging but uh anyway you have a sticker that clearly labels your total THC and CBD content your strain how many milligrams you're getting and what type of weed it is you have this sticker label on the top that seals the box you have this sticker label on the back that lists your THC and CBD again and a government warning all of this information is on this legit kingpin packaging even the way the packaging it comes in obviously I mean like these are long since weak but uh you get a nice little kingpin cart it looks very nice it's all high quality you can open it in case you want to take the wax out it's a legit kingpin cart it even has the like the label a you can't scratch off I just hit my camera mess up my then I think it was a shame all right so you have all of these other companies that are making black-market cards all of these are black-market cards the thing is it's just some companies do it better than others and I don't know why some companies decide to lie about what they're putting in the curt's like trap house they put a rough percentage of your THC content they put all natural high percent organic no PG VG or PE d and they even copy the California sticker the thing is trap house is an alleged company and so these aren't real cards they're fake cards but they're high-quality fake cards if I would say so myself I just finished their Venice og one and like the waxen this was just as good if not better than the wax and these kingpin cards don't hate to kingpin though these were nice um but yeah so like just because it's a car is fake doesn't mean that it's not gonna work the thing is these are full of harmful chemicals not full of them but like Oh some more but these are pure wax they're not gonna harm you these though even though they say they don't have PG or VG they do they're mixed with that it's real wax but it's mixed to dilute it in therefore you get more use out of it the way you can tell if it's a higher quality fake wax is if it moves slowly and if it's like a deep golden color or like yeah a deep golden brown um I think out of all of these carts the worst one I've had was this chronomaly skittles cart obviously the packaging is fake I never seen Khurana play anywhere else it doesn't even have like the fake California label on it oh yeah it does but it's like an even weirder one they always say lab tested on percent organic but they're not like it's very obvious when you're hitting these cards that they are mixed with something some of them here really harsh dank babes as you can see his had to change sorry about that I had to fix my camera back because I'm sort of hit it while I was trying to talk about these dang babes packaging um what I was trying to say was dank babes has had to change their packaging three times since January because other people are now taking their packaging and putting fake tarts inside of already fake cart packages which is such an insane thought to me but it's kind of good that dank vapes likes to like at least change up the way that they're selling theirs think their stuff so that people are at least getting somewhat higher quality wax under thinning that I like another thing that I like about dang vapes is that you can't open these see cell atomizers that they use for their wax they're stuck closed and that's a good thing because the fact that all of these companies mix actual THC like weed wax with VG and PG it makes it harmful for you if you take it out of the cart when you're smoking it in the car it'll make you coffee cuz it's kind of harsh it might taste really good but it's still not that great for you imagine that but worse if you take and open these car packages and then you try to actually dab the wax from them Auto break some of these companies make it so that you can unscrew the top of their carts you can refill them obviously but then you can also take the wax out and that's where you can run into problems once you burn the wax that's mixed with VG and PG on a rig it can be super harmful for you because we're not supposed to be combusting those chemicals they're used in actual vape juice that you would mix with nicotine for people to stop smoking they're not meant to be used for THC cartridges obviously you can use them and people are but I feel like people should just put out the information that yes these are fake yes they do work but you have to at least also be careful with them and know what you're getting yourself into before you start trying to like just smoke cards out of the blue and thinking that all of these these are legit I'm pretty sure even exotic like their wax is around the same quality as dank vapes I'm not sure if they're super legit but I know that their wax is not like an amazing quality wax it's decent but it's not great these trap house cards they are pretty good I would suggest them just as highly as I would suggest at King pen but only with the information that these are mixed with VG and that they can harm you and I think like my basic opinion is that these cards while they are fake are just as good as legit carts as long as you know hey I'm sort of damaging my body by using these and you just continue with the information in mind if you can get legit carts I would highly suggest doing that because while they may not like get you as high as these like immediately you might take me need to take a few more hits but these also last longer they're more healthy for you and I mean the smoke is super smooth so it doesn't feel like I was harming myself at all when I was using these cards these carts are probably cheaper and more available to you so if that's your like only choice try some of them out but like try to figure out what brands you prefer over the ones that are like sort of harmful um I feel like this video ended up being a bit of a ramble I'm sorry about that but I also hope that if you did watch you enjoyed and um yeah I'll just catch you all next time see you", "ySpyC6mDLAg": "yo what's good everybody jay

with a full body relaxation so what to check and see about the full full relaxation uh full body relaxation aspect of the high read the full review on respectmyregion.com i'll let you all know about the results for that but when it comes to baking spices definitely got this woody cinnamon uh spices there's this definitely this like earthy soil flavor let me see if i get here real quick yeah and then you get like an earthy earthy oh genius so i guess that's pretty accurate um nice work carvana definitely high potency is burning the nostrils 91.77 percent total cannabinoids their ascend line from cravana is very good y'all i reviewed the dutch tree very piney very sweet uh potent and this is right up there as well earthy sweet rich cinnamon kind of uh what they describe with baking spices wonderful when i think of a when i think of a score out of 10 um the only thing that's really missing for me is maybe the genetics uh otherwise it's got a perfect score on the terpenes and the more information on the back um packaging is cool the brown for the earth og makes a lot of sense it's very potent you know anything that's higher than 85 on the thc for a distillate is considered high potency generally speaking um especially with the total cannabinoids up there in that 91 to 92 range that's a high potency product you know i'm gonna give this a nine point um 9.5 for me that the baking cinnamon spiciness tastes a little bit fake i don't know if that's a true cannabis like from a true cannabis strain it just doesn't taste like it is but you know if it is i'm still up there uh very high score i think um 9.5 9.75 for me i mean it is a really good distillate product there is no yeah there's no inconsistencies on this very very very solid um i'll let you all know how the high is we'll let the high as it kind of gradually hits here uh over the next like hour we'll let that kind of dictate read the full review on youtube respect my region.com for the article uh please of

do i look like i've been like i'm high do i look high what's going on guys and welcome back to the channel so this is another three chive delta eight vape cartridge review the last one that i did did so well that i just well i had to do another one if i release a video and it gets 800 hits or 800 views in a for like a week oh yeah i'm definitely doing another video so the one that i got is blue dream and it's a one milliliter container brand new sealed and that's how i like it and you can see right there it contains 95 percent eight delta eight th oil and then five percent of [ __ ] which you know whatever i guess you gotta i guess it can't be a hundred percent or it would probably just knock you on your ass and stuff uh the directions remove the silicone cover and screw into the battery do not over tighten take one puff and wait 20 minutes wow wait 20 minutes um usage is between one and two puffs let's see here i'm trying to focus it for you guys i can't focus it whatever uh says do not operate any machinery while using this product do not use if pregnant nursing or under the age of 21 this may cause a positive drug test well no [ __ ] oh my god uh let's see here if you need more typical usage it's one or two puffs do not operate wait a minute where's that one part at wait 20 minutes before determining if you need more oh okay 5 10 battery 100 percent hint driving contains 0.3 is that a 9 thc batch 6 out of 15 2021 batch id three chives fishery blah blah blah blah all right blue dream sweet so i have a couple other ones over here these are the fx these are delta eight fx cartridges um and i designed this little thing to keep them in the upright for me because sometimes i'll run out and these right here will be enough to get you by for a few days especially if you leave them in the upright these are this was like orange crush and like granddaddy purple if i remember correctly i didn't really care um for the granddaddy purple i do want to say one thing though there is a big difference between the ethics cartridge and the delta eight cartridges i feel like the delta eight cartridges these are put together better they just seem to be i don't know i don't have any leakage they hardly ever clog they just seem to be a better cartridge than the fx the fx are also a lot cheaper too these are like 30 something dollars and these are like 60 something dollars okay now the effects of this all right let's say you're sitting on the couch smoking a blunt there you go you're going to get high but this is great because you can be out public you could be in a mall walking around hitting this and people are just going to think that you're vaping and that's the beautiful part about it and it delivers i mean just one one good hit delivers like a serious bond grip i mean it's depending on your tolerance and how much you smoke it can get you really really really really really high um like for instance i got friends that do not smoke like me i consider myself to be a pothead meaning that i i blaze it up every day we smoke it down okay that's just me i've been like that for 20 years um but we're not talking about me this i hit it one time and i'm like whoo all right if i get somebody that doesn't smoke like me and they hit it they gotta sit down and sometimes they're out for the count like uh like i actually had one friend hit it and it ruined her whole night she felt like [ __ ] it just messed her up and then i had another buddy uh i mean it put his ass on the couch so i guess the effects is just different depending on who you are and how much you smoke but let me tell you what it's definitely worth it it's discreet nobody knows that you have it plus there's no smell like you blaze that [ __ ] up man you hit it pow pow pow you get a big old dragon's breath cloud and it don't smell like weed it's awesome you can take it to work that's the best part about it man is that there's no paraphernalia there's no weed nobody knows you have it on you the only way somebody's gonna know you have it is if they physically see it no smells man i i've been pulled over by the police and i had this on me he didn't even ask me not clean as a whistle goodbye give me my ticket leave awesome these things definitely have their benefits definitely and if you're going to have this you got to have a 510 battery okay this is an e-leaf very simple 510 battery plugs into the bottom i don't know an hour charge you're good to go all you do is you hold the button wait for it to get to about there and then you start hitting it hit it slow you're not trying to rip on it you're just trying to take a slow even deep breath and even that might be too much for you three child blue dream now one thing i did like about it was all they had so many selections for these and then they told you about what they did like this is a sativa brand um this is supposed to give you clarity um it's not supposed to make you foggy it's supposed to give you energy and make you awake and whatever whatever whatever like it claims what it is it's a um a sativa synthetic it's a blend of you know indica and this brand i mean like it tells you what they are and what they're mixed with their strands and everything so you really can't go wrong so it's not like you don't know what you're buying you know what i mean sorry if there's a little bit of an echo i'm trying to do this privately this is illegal in my state you know so you really don't want to be advertising what you're doing that's the other thing like a cop a cop knows what this is because this does not look like a typical vape that's the other thing that you need to be aware of this is very identifiable if they're a cop and they deal with this [ __ ] they've seen this before they will know exactly what you have in your hand so be aware of that uh your average person not so much you know i mean you go out for a cigarette break you hit it once or twice nobody's going to even say it or even notice it but be careful because police they they probably will know what the hell that is i mean because all vape cartridges come the same basically the same look you know all right we're actually starting to get to the meat and potatoes oh come on [ __ ] come on out now here's another thing i like is that they come with these uh get out damn it [ __ ] it's pressure treated uh is that they come with these plastic things right to keep them covered now when i transport mine for instance see like these these even have it on them when i transport them because sometimes i'll take this with me and then i'll take another flavor with me it's very important that you keep that cap on there all right because if you don't keep that cap on there lint and trash and garbage and other things that are in your pocket will get into these little holes and ports and you don't want that because that's going to mess everything up for you so it's very important that you keep these little plastic covers and if you want to even keep the mouthpiece because you know see like this mouthpiece see all the stuff that's in there that's from it being in my pocket like lint and trash and other things get up inside of that you know what i mean yeah you don't want that that's bad so definitely keep your plastic covers man you got to keep those and try to store it upright because if you laying it down you can take a good chance of it leaking and it'll this [ __ ] takes forever it's like molasses to go back in the upright um but let's let's plug it in and check it out not only that check out the quality this is the end cap that came off of the uh the new delta eight cartridge see it see how thick it is all right and then this is the end cap that comes now i ain't trying to knock the the fx vapes i'm just trying to justify the 30 something dollars more that they want for the vape you know [Music] all right and then here's theirs see what i'm saying see the difference look at the difference in the caps big difference this one's nice and meaty and this one's real thin and kind of cheesy looking but uh you know i guess that's part of the difference is that you get better coverage with it also when i bought these these just come in like kind of like this thing here uh but it doesn't have anything covering the mouthpiece the mouthpiece is wide open so but with these you get a mouthpiece covered which is nice because like i said i transport these in my pocket and stuff so yeah you know what that um this this right here it kind of it kind of sneaks up on you god damn oh my god i'm sweating look i'm sweating can you see my head look at my head look that was one hit one hit how do i look do i look like i've been like i'm high do i look high yeah one hit y'all one hit damn yeah see i can go in there right now smoke a few bowls that [ __ ] won't get me like how i am right now good god oh [ __ ] all right yes um forgot what i was saying yep don't remember now okay so back to what i don't remember i was talking about y'all need to get this i don't know what else to tell y'all three chive delta eight vapes leave me a comment subscribe to my channel check out my other videos i build computers and do all kinds of custom water cooling and technology stuff so you all need to come and check that out check out my channel i appreciate y'all for watching", "yrn54Bbg1Lg": "today we're smoking lemon train wreck from full spec full spec is a cannabis company out of washington state this is their live resin cartridge lemon train rack is a cross of golden lemons and train wreck it's an indica dominant hybrid one of my favorite things about the packaging was that it provided that necessary information it told me the cross told me whether there's indica sativa or hybrid of the two which is great things for a cannabis consumer regardless of your experience to have on the packaging it keeps me from having to look that information up and figuring out what's in it it tells me sort of an idea on what i can expect maybe not the entirety of the high but it gives me a baseline to go off of their live resin cartridges taste really good when i exhale this it tastes just like a bunch of lemons i really enjoy that flavor and that's not something that you get from like an indica hybrid typically like the lemons lean more towards the sativa but in this case i think the flavor combination is excellent one of the things i like about the cartridges i'm gonna take it out of my pen here is the tips i don't know these tips are way more comfortable to hit than like the flat ones so like this one you can see a difference in like the size of the mouthpiece these i don't feel like get as clogged as the other style um the other style i tend to have end up clogged in my pocket a lot i'm smoking this out of my vessel battery vessel makes really good high quality batteries for your c-cell cartridges this one is more like a tube like the normal c cell and then they have a palm one that fits in your hand as well the effects of this were really good i smoked it like during a corn maze that i just did following directions got kind of complicated after a while but we were able to get out thanks to some great navigation um the flavor's excellent that super lemon flavor is really good full spec uses single source cannabis so they source their cannabis from themselves um they can have control of the entire process so they know exactly when when that cannabis from the time that it was a seedling to the time that they like freeze it and package it to turn it into live res so they control the whole process and i really like it when companies have the entire process under one roof so that they are allowed to have more control over what goes into their products anyways be sure to check out vessel the batteries be sure to check out full spec online at fullspec710.com be sure to check out respect my region online at respectfunregion.com you can

I'm not going anywhere who should I keep grinding this out first things first again thank you guys we had a thousand four hundred and something subscribers or something like that so I'm crazy still working out sponsorship stuff like that some dumb stuff but uh ya know it's all in the works it's all the works uh yeah other than that I just want to say thank you guys you guys are awesome but yeah so it's for today's car I have two different ones I don't know which one I wanna give to you guys or review for you guys this one cuz it's late at night so we'll do the end because so we could sleep on right so this one right here there's a sticker on it but it says key relief um there's a couple states that actually have this dispensary Arizona I think Wisconsin somewhere back east I think they're pretty popular back east yeah there's like four or five in Arizona for cure leaves and this is their in-house carts so I think they think normally they run 25 or $30 a piece no I'm sorry they're $30 a piece for these parts they're half gram $30 right and today they were running a deal not gonna show you this one oh no that's this one I want to show you that one so I got two of them for the price of one so I got two for 30 years or one for 15 basically that being said let's go ahead and I mean let me read this out real quick oh I didn't even tell you guys the strain this one the strain is called rainbow Jones I've never heard of that scream if you guys have let me know this is coming at d 9 t HC % is eighty two point five six so not super high the THC percent isn't posted on here or THC a percent I'm sorry well other than that I guess let's pop or open and start reviewing it mmm comes without you know your standard little boxes with your little corner in them she can keep the carton it comes in this little tube too I've noticed that a lot more courts are coming in Dube to do basically for whatever reason I don't mind it though it's nice it's never bad to have a couple extra Dube tube saying you know I mean so my first impression it's kind of sticky on the outside so I don't know if it's leaking or not I hope not could just be the metal and stuff just like the finishes but sup it's actually really nice looking card guys right here so on the front there you got the little leaf logo right that's the airs and then you got that key relief writing frame wow that's it this is a really gorgeous looking card not even gonna lie I don't think I've ever been turned on by a car but this one comes with your standard little rubber stopper on the bottom I don't have any nails tell my nails so it's just dancing alright so you guys go see the wax like like a good weed to be reviewing it's not focusing of course cuz I have a phone but you know no bubble though not the biggest fan of it not the biggest fan the other one has that too all half-korean cards have them usually full grams are a little bit better but yeah this oil looks gorgeous though super thick it's not running no bubbles except for that one gorgeous like gold color to it so it's go ahead and pop it on the good old booze battery I don't know where my only one is and it won't charge for some reasons so we're just gonna stick it with this one alright guys first hit of the night guys Cheers okay well okay okay so the only flavor you get out of that excuse me hydration break wow man I don't really get yourself going man well that was a great hit um oh so first impressions off that first one big fan I highly recommend it already but we'll keep going with the review you know if you want to stick it out and you know keep looking hmm then he said hydration brakeman oh well some yeah this car is pretty dang nice this is an indica so hopefully slumped me out a little bit I'm gonna go watch a horror movie or something after this chill relax that's distress that trip hi his funky some toasty nose you already muggy let me gonna let me know what you guys favorite uh like food or snack and beverage so give me like one food item edible item and one beverage right to eat and drink when you're stoned or just smoking or hot boxing or just any situation what your high right what are your go to edible items that are non marijuana you [ __ ] drug addicts yeah I was talking about edibles no no so now marijuana have food or drinks not marijuana world there's THC drinks you know yeah a little zoink you guys let's do it all Cheers it's a great hit from the thin by the way that is a solid asset real well for $30 for two of them I'm not usually guys $30 for two of them is not a bad deal at oh wow I think okay except for like first time patient deals and like that that one video I did were it was like I got four cards for like 24 dollars or something like that besides those like really crazy deals like the wild wild ones like that one for for 424 so it came out six bucks a card this is the cheapest I've ever got a card like a real dispensary card because $15 for a half gram some of you guys live it up in like Michigan and [ __ ] isn't Michigan I don't remember who just legalize weed for the like me I cannot figure it out at all but um I heard somebody told me like half gram carts there we're going for like 60 55 $60 or some [ __ ] like that dude I love marijuana but I cannot spend that much on weed so getting carts that are 15 dollars for a half gram so probably like 30 $40 for a full gram would be insane and so many people would have some more access to it and hopefully one day we can get that figured out maybe I mean concentrate like dabs and stuff that's not that bad I mean flour is pretty pricey you can get yeah it depends depends on your tears but you know there's a lot of variables of course but I don't know I hope one day they forgot a way to maybe if it becomes federally legal they'll be able to lower the prices because they're a little high yeah um I also want to know if you're still here what is your favorite brand of Kart or like if you don't have like a favorite brand like what's your favorite strain like across across the board for all the brands um I don't have favorite strain to be honest I make these reviews and I review these cards just to tell you how they are and then I just completely forget so that's something alright let's do number three oh that reminded me of my girlfriend Leslie you should kept doing this to me I don't know why anyway guys I am I'm really I um if you live in any state that has a key relief dispensary that's uh oh so that's these guys right here hey they're key relief I'm just so [ __ ] stupid that's your logo that doesn't even say their name I am so sorry and I gotta grab my iPod so rate purely great store they're running pretty great deals um you get 20 area for every twenty dollars you spend you had a dollar back so that's pretty cool so I got eight dollars off for these things I spent like [ __ ] 26 bucks for two close what's can't go wrong all right well fair shot ask you your [ __ ] dope you're better than all the other people Logan see you on the next one deuces", "FGTP8FVp00c": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another buddy's cartridge video you know i'm saying but this one's special this one's a bit special because if you can see from the title it is the highest percentage of thc that i've seen on a buddies well uh that i've seen i don't know if it's the highest but it's 90 thc as you can see right here 90.42 and yes this is the distillate one so that's why it's high in thc but as far as like other buddies distillates or other live resins that i've had from them this is probably the the highest in range that i've had and uh the other two percent is some other stuff other than cbd but as you can see from the back right here it is 6.5 or 6.45 percent terpenes so pretty decent you know i've had some which were like 2 before so i'm happy that this one has ninety percent thc and six percent terpenes i can only imagine how it's going to taste um but i do have my tronian with me where's that and also the little adapter piece so let's just uh get to it and let's see i haven't had a buddies in a while actually i haven't had a cart in like a week or two because it's just they run out pretty fast for me but i've seen uh at authentic that they had buddies again like new strains so i was like okay [ __ ] it this 27 out the door the green box which is the live resin is 32 out the door so one of the best prices in town is going to be authentic for buddies so let's just open this i don't really care too much about the box and with this it's going to be a a very raw raw garden color yeah you see right here yeah very very nice let's just uh since uh since i do have my camera let me just take a picture real quick for the thumbnail you know that right off the bat it's very sweet very lemony is the most prominent yet lemony [Music] let's try this i'm excited i haven't had a buddy's car in a while so i can barely keep the excitement contain it you know what i'm saying so boys [Music] [Music] for some reason i taste the peanuts like the initial taste is the peanut and then it gets sweet pretty weird oh there's the lemonade there's the lemony taste okay it's a lemony slash orangey slash very [Music] so like i said the initial taste was like a peanut and then it gets sweet like a lemon sweetness maybe it's just the cart or something or maybe it's just 20 years a very different taste that i've had from previous buddies uh i wouldn't say i would compare it to a raw garden cannabis derived terpenes with this lid it's it's its own taste it kind of tastes like the cure company um tropicana cookies towards the end a very orangey very strong orangey taste but nonetheless very very enjoyable i didn't know gorilla glue terpenes tasted this lemony or this citrusy but not bad for 90 thc it's definitely gonna smack me but with gorilla glue it's a hybrid sativa or sativa dominant hybrid so it's definitely recommended to use you know during the day afternoon you know i'm saying but i would probably not use this as much towards the end of the night because for me at least when i smoke too much sativas at night it's very hard for me to sleep i don't know if it's for you guys as well but nonetheless a very very great part from buddies i like to address them some stuff people say about me always reviewing buddies or something but i spend my own money on buddies and that says something i i don't like when a person spends their money consistently on a product that means that that product is good just because you haven't seen buddies lately doesn't mean that i don't like them anymore i just bought all the strains that they had available to my dispensary when i drove monty and blake to the dispensary yesterday we went to authentic as well and i saw that they had cartridges at least new strains from buddies and uh you know i had to come back the next day and here we are making this video right now so like i said it's a very good cartridge very very different from what i'm used to tasting from buddies but nonetheless still enjoyable high percentage of thc and there's six percent terpene so you really can't go wrong with that i'm gonna take one more hit for you guys and we're probably just gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed it you know what i'm saying um but yeah cheers three blinkers i barely move you do see a bubble in here though i don't know if that's peanut exactly but it's like if a peanut and orange mixed that's the taste no i like peanuts and i like oranges i just don't like them together but this is enjoyable i'm not saying it's battery it's just you know it's a weird taste but like i said uh if you get past the peanut taste it's a very enjoyable citrusy flavor towards the end but other than that hopefully you enjoyed the video peace out [Music] way back in the days", "i2lcDMOfKwI": "hey you guys I noticed it's been a long time since I've made any videos but I wanted to show you guys what I've been smoking quite a lot of which is the brass knuckles cartridges right here I did buy one of these vaporizer pens while I let go for these little wax cartridges they're very portable they don't leave like a smell and a resin and they're the flavors are amazing they're really strong too this one says a lab tested contaminant free no polyethylene glycol or glycerin it's a gram you guys and this one says blueberry of course so they've been the other flavors that I've tried like Girl Scout cookie and or rather cookie and what was the other one gelato were amazing so I have really high expectations for this all right you guys so I guess it was stuck so I did get it unstuck so now what I did was I grabbed my like a pin and pushed it down into the side right over there and now I can just push down on both sides and go ahead and pull it apart so there we go again this is the brass knuckles blueberry indica and it's pretty big cartridge you can see the brass knuckles logo on there that's pretty cool just opening the package the whole thing just reeks of blueberry so I'm really excited to try this given that it's almost Halloween I did wear a mass but let's see how this hits and how it tastes please remember to please remember to Like comment share and subscribe let me know what you guys want to see and give me a thumbs up and here's that brass knuckles Wow that flavor is amazing Wow so going that's really big hit still boy I don't smoke I don't know if the camera is picking up picking that up at G's the flavor is amazing it literally tastes like like a very smoothie like or maybe berry ice cream as you can see it hits really really smooth that didn't cough or anything at all or need to and that was a really big hit so I'm gonna go ahead and let's turn the heat down and then I'm gonna set this is my absolute extracts pen by the way it's really nice it's got the three different heat settings so I'm changing that by pressing down on that three times and that indicates or the color indicates the temperature settings so I'm gonna go ahead and press it twice which is gonna keep it on for a pretty good amount of time without having to hold the button and I'm gonna take a really big rip I'm gonna be really actually already really baked again like comment give me a thumbs up subscribe hopefully I should be making more videos soon and doing a giveaway it's been way too long so I'll get something cool for you guys and one or two lucky winners will get something so the flavors like overwhelming it's it's not over well I mean given that I'm already high it's already it's yet it's overwhelming this is definitely strong and really I hate already it's just you like breathing it out through your nose and just breathing it you know at all or you can taste it like even on your like lips and stuff that the blueberry and that like it tastes like berry ice cream like I said still blowing out smoke all in all I would give this a thumbs up five stars just like the other brassknuckles cartridges I've tried so far their flavor on them is really amazing they're always consistent they always burn all the or they always go all the way down to the bottom and you can use all the wax and you never get a burning taste through them and they're always consistent always delicious so I'm really excited to try their other strains they've got like seven or eight others that I know of that I'm really excited to try so I've tried the gelato the blue blueberry which is what this was and then also the cookies so their packaging is really pretty interesting I don't know if I quite show that it's got their branding and stuff all over it it's pretty cool I like it so I'm taking another really big ooh another really big rip and it's pretty much it like I said comment let me know what you guys want to see I'm over here and I have a lot of access to dispensary so I can get like cookies edibles waxes cartridges stuff that even you know but and show you guys and you know just try it out so have a great day you guys and here it goes a long space [Music] [Music]", "O-oShgS1Xy4": "hey what's going on guys welcome to deaf connection in this review I got the vessel batteries so the vessel battery is intended to use four cartridges only and primarily only four cartridges and honestly I love this battery beckham this is out of all the pens i've ever tried an experience this is honestly my favorite one this one is the smoothest the cleanest and um i can't find any con about it other than its price it is pricey compared to a lot of other batteries like cecil or like she saw Siler she saw palm and all that but and some of them even cost ten bucks but this one's really worth it you really do get what you're worth when you buy the vessel battery so there you let me tell you all the features this pen really is a is a really sleek pen and it really is that smooth and simple to use it's just three different modes um the lowest one being like being 2.8 volts right here and that's another thing too it's pretty cool do you need it's unique in the colors that it has I thought that was pretty nice but the last mode is a 3 point 6 volts I believe yeah pretty sure that's right at 3.6 so it's not as powerful as other pens as well but another thing is the batteries really efficient it lasted me a couple of days and it charges fairly fast charges it wasn't like one two three hours that will last me anywhere he's pursuing like I smoked consistently so I do it does last meeting between 2 to 2 to 4 maybe even 5 6 days so I think that was pretty awesome now with the battery with the battery itself like what I said honestly there really isn't a whole lot to it other than it's a sleekness how the feel of it this one this one's really nice actually I love this one will op up the only thing to the battery is um right here oh and there's another feature that I love about it it's the air flow this is what makes it amazing you see all this right here this thing you can actually take off but the purpose of that is for airflow is for to optimize and enhance their flow the taste and all that and it really does difference there are some carts so you could see in the post off if you read further below but there are actually some quests that don't even fit this but that's what the person is for so you could just take it off if the car is too why you're just too big to fit that's another cool thing you know something other this very has that you could take off is the bottom part but first I had no idea where to what to do with it but it was a little confused at first um but I didn't realize didn't tell you about more about it that the bottom part is actually for the purpose if you were to drop it because I've dropped my vessel battery a couple of times and it's actually I know what nothing came off no paint came off not really like major scratches anything at all but this pen can withstand like impact if you drop it or something like that so that's pretty cool it's this thing but this battery falls and like bends or something like that right here this will be the first of that just to take it off this is where you charge it really simply just connect it's a magnetic charge port but yeah that is a that's a that's pretty much all there is to it yep I forgot to mention so I what I said this is um this pen is really for carts only and um it fits any sort of 510 thread and another cool thing is these are actually meant for it it's enhanced Cecil cartridge it's so see so these Cecil cartridges are better cause supposedly for Cecil silo and Cecil palm battery but we personally believe it the vessel better hits a lot better than the Cecil batteries itself so that's another really cool feature and it looks just like if it's really smoothly guys it's like that thing too is pretty much as convenience and it's sleekness its discreteness and how it hits uh how it just enhances every hit it really you really get the taste of every single hit with the vessel battery I know I'm hated I'm gonna smoking right guys just see how you can see how its Cheers all right smoke isn't fairly thick it's kind of thin but it's still it's still kind of rip so doesn't rip as much as I'd like it to but it's pretty much it's pretty much all deficient semen so it does less like what I said it just lasts a long time in every hit you really do it it really just tastes a lot better like actually with this cartridge itself to some of the carts I tried it with my other batteries um I tried it with the G pen and stuff like that and it was the only actually really harsh this actually gives this really smooth hit so that's another really cool thing so that's the that is a vessel better you guys if um another thing is I forgot to tell you the price yet it is worth a hundred bucks so I mean it honestly like what I said you usually do get what you what you pay for this thing is really worth it if you've got smoke cartridges a lot and consistently if you're more of a wax kind of person or just like prefer smoking and smoking weed or anything like that then yet I wouldn't recommend this pen but I do recommend is battery for everyone who small carts on a consistent basis so that's the vessel battery um if you guys have any questions or comments and experience with it posted them post them down below and I'll see you guys soon peace out guys", "qhSRUwzR3Ko": "[Music] smoking what's good guys stony rob here back for another youtube video i hope you guys are having an amazing day because mine is going amazing like every other day in today's video i have a reddit can ready cartridge this is uh a cannabis extract this goes on my good supply vape and we're gonna be trying this out [Music] it's a og kush cannabis train today i've tried out the og kush i've reviewed it on this channel you can check it out i'll put a link in the description down below but today we're going to be checking out the ready cartridge by the company ready can og kush so without further ado let's get started so like i said here we have the ready can and the ready cartridge 510 uh thread it's it has a net weight of 0.5 kilograms the net volume of the contents inside of it is .45 milliliters it has 790 milligrams of thc and has a total of 79 percent thc 0.03 cbd ingredients cannabis extract terpenes this is what i guess gives it the og kush flavor and yeah here we have the og kush and i can give you the back specifications here we have the warning symbol uh it says warning the smoke from cannabis is harmful toxic and carcinogenic chemicals found in tobacco smoke such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons aromatic ammons and an air tube and n heterocyclics are also found in cannabis smoke i don't know what the hell that means but yeah this is the warning sign there you have it uh so without further ado let's open it up um like this bang and here we have the cartridge the og kush cartridge and yeah let's pop it out yeah here it is with the cartridge let's pop out the seal bang wow and let's whip on cartridge and here we have it oh yeah perfect great success here we are thc logo the r logo i'm gonna be trying it out i'm not gonna be doing a blinker that's obvious ha ha [ __ ] a blinker and i'm turning this on and yeah cheers guys i'm gonna take a nice fat rip off this dab pan and yeah i'm gonna see if it tastes good doesn't taste good i don't know does it taste like og kush i'm gonna find out in like a few seconds so let's get it cheers i'ma let it preheat first my bad let's get it not bad not bad at all hold up yep get a little sip of my timmy here i'm not even gonna lie this actually tastes good i can kind of feel the taste of the og cushion it that og kush taste but yeah cheers let's take another hit yeah this is hitting pretty well i'm enjoying it as for now i'ma let the the high settle in oh no it's making me feel good good og kush i honestly i'm just curious to see if it's gonna give me that nice ogeekush mellow high yeah it's settling in what i like about wax the distillate that goes in this is that it's almost the insta buzz it doesn't take some time for it to settle in so yeah do you guys enjoy dab pens i don't know i'm smoking this right now because i just did my wisdom teeth and i'm trying to find the alternative as to like smoking harsh tobacco backwood smoke and yeah i'm trying out distillate for now well i guess wax dabs that pen and yeah it's doing the job right it's not hurting me too much i have a little bit of pain right now but yeah whatever i'm uh medicating myself with this you know what i mean yeah but it it tastes pretty good it's not too harsh um i mean i guess it has that og kush taste but like it's not as strong or prominent as smoking the bud itself like obviously there's some sort of difference in the taste of the distillate like i'm pretty sure if you'd give me like og kush distill it and like i don't know another strain and i'd be like yeah i mix them up right yeah but like if you give me og kush bud and you'd give me like rock star bud and compare the two i'd be like this one's oj kush this one's rockstar kush you know like i'd be able to taste it smell it and feel that this one's oj kush this one's a rock star you know i mean and this nah i can't really taste the difference mostly it tastes like distillate wax you know it tastes like concentrate um i'm gonna take another hit yeah i want to give you guys a close-up yeah so i'd recommend this pretty good i give it like a seven out of ten i'm no way shape or form also encouraging buying this product i'm not encouraging the consumption just saying it is a good distillate good taste in it's by itself is very good you know i mean the product itself is good um not gonna hate it too much i'll probably finish this like fairly quickly because my other 0.5 pod like finish in like a day or a day or two right i'm not complaining too much it tastes good it's just fun to puff it's smooth it goes in quickly it gets the job done it gets me high has thick smoke thick enough smoke for me right now because i can barely puff i'm not supposed to like suck in air you know but it's getting the job done that wax high you know i'm out here i'm elevated i'm stoned feeling good i hope you guys are feeling good too so yeah this was the og kush by reddit can here's the box oj kush recommend it if you have the time to go get a car or whatever try it out oj kush 18 plus never go wrong with og kush the high's mellow it's kicking in right and i kind of feel the same way kind of sedated that nice indica uh sensation but anyways this was oj kush if you guys enjoyed this video then drop a like and hit that subscribe button this is tony robb you guys know the drill um out", "60H-rAHWXWA": "yo what is going on everybody welcome back to another video with your boy sebby g man ding literally before i turned on my camera i was sitting on my desk and i looked at the date and i was like yo literally the year is going to come to an end already bro and i feel like this year i i feel like i could speak for everybody but this year has been super super super crazy i feel like me personally i had a lot of ups i had a lot of downs but you guys know man this year 2020 was definitely a crazy turn for i feel like of the majority of us all right guys so without further ado guys we're hopping into today's topic which is i'm gonna be i'm going to be presenting to you what i believe to be the best cartridge battery out in 2020 okay so as a cartridge viewer you really do end up trying so many different products in terms of batteries and stuff like that and me personally in the year 2020 i feel like i've tried literally over 50 batteries and in my videos i don't choose to show every single one of those products i like to minimalize it and really show you guys the only ones that i feel are worth it so the one that i felt like was more worth it this year the one that really caught my attention the most that really saved me when it came to cartridges was this battery right here all right guys so this one right here is called the toki 510 thread cartridge battery and it's one of my favorite batteries man it has so many features from wireless charging all that good stuff but the main feature that i like the most is the fact that it saves your oil so much more than any other batteries guys just because of the fact that it has a five to six um second draw limit i believe and i don't know what they do in that drop but literally you still get those super fat milky clouds so you're really not missing out on anything right so i'm gonna go ahead and take a hit for you guys i got myself a little live resin cartridge sitting nice and pretty on here so without further ado cheers guys like i said you still get those super fat clouds that you need in order to get super super big this battery right here literally has saved me from having to buy so many cartridges guys like literally i did the math and let me show you guys for an example right so this one right here is the alpine live resin cartridge the last time that you guys saw this on a video was i believe two to three weeks ago maybe a little bit more and guys i've only been using it on this battery after that video so every single time that i take a hit it's off of this toki battery and i must say that after three to four weeks of having this cartridge look at the oil look at the oil literally one of the things that they pride themselves in is being able to conserve the consumer's oil and i think that's super amazing because they actually did it man they actually found a way to adjust the battery so it's not overheating your oil and it still gives you the perfect hit but with that being said man i think literally they probably saved me at least a couple hundred to a thousand dollars this year just off of their battery alone and the fact that i could literally just still be using these cartridges on the daily without having to waste them within a day or two using that on the blue setting now we're gonna go ahead and hit it on the purple setting me personally i feel like the purple setting on this battery is the best setting to get the perfect super nice milky clouds and it brings out the terpene profiles out the most because it's a higher voltage but for me i like the hotter hits that way i could get baked a little bit more easier alright so without a doubt cheers [Music] oh my gosh dude one of the best things this year has to be the fact that a lot of companies came out with live resin cartridges and i must say man live resin really is a game changer from going to disney to live resident is super super phenomenal man just because i feel like live resin has such a better taste than dislike does and aside from the battery itself guys they also provide you with literally just about everything that you can possibly need when having a cartridge session all right so first off i'm gonna i'm gonna show you guys what the first products were when they launched the battery but they have the portable charger right here usually you could use this with your phone but i think the better way to use it is whenever your cartridge is dead on the go you can always keep this portable charger in your car and literally just use it and never have to worry about a dead battery again the next product is going to be something that literally no one no one has done and turkey was the first one in this game from what i've seen to be the first to introduce this right here this right here is a wireless portable charger all right guys so pretty much all you have to do with this is you just have to line it up with the toki symbol and then it's going to start charging for you which is phenomenal man because i don't know how many times i have i i personally hate having to plug in chargers sometimes i can't even find my charger so being able to just leave this as at your desk with the convenience of just boom plopping it on top and it instantly starts to charge that's super super super satisfying for me super minimalistic not having to carry around a charging cable with me everywhere i go and um yeah man i love this this probably has to be one of my favorite things that they've released all right guys and last up on the list guys we have the most newest addition to the toki family which is this bad boy right here this is the toki 510 wax cartridge and you're thinking like whoa they sell wax cartridges too yes they sell wax cartridges but it's not your normal wax cartridge this one right here is a super high grade material wax cartridge it doesn't have any distillate or wax already in it basically you attach it to your toki battery and then inside it has its own little coils right there i think i still have some wax in there from the last video i made on it has some coils right there on the bottom and literally you could just be taking dabs or you could be hitting your cartridge right guys so the fact that they came out with this attachment in the year 2020 was super super phenomenal man because i feel like the year 2020 was the year that a lot a lot a lot of tech for the cannabis community came out and i was super super happy to get my hands on this one right here because i feel like like i said this is the best battery of the year 2020. it saved so many cartridges for me they brought so much more diversity with these wax cartridges right here with the portable chargers definitely my favorite brand of the year 2020 all right guys so now that i told you my favorite battery of the year 2020 i want you guys to tell me what your favorite battery is right so i'm going to be replying to everybody down in the comments below guys if you enjoyed today's video do me one last favor smash the like hit those comments and most importantly hit that subscribe button alright guys i'm going to take one more hit for you guys i hope you guys i'm not really too sure when this is

you guys have an amazing new year and we'll catch you guys on the next video", "Sitq2um1_7s": "toriel on how to use a cannabis vaporizer alright so with these products it's really nice you don't put a lot of soot or anything like that into your lungs it's much lighter feeling than if you're smoking it all the time and a lot of people don't know how to use these they're very simple so when you go to the store you're looking to spend about you know thirty to fifty eighty dollars always what we call a base of your vaporizer unit they're going to come packaged like this alright so depending on what brand you buy they all look a little different but from the same function you get your base and a charger in the box you're going to screw your charger into the base just like that and these Chargers just slide into simple USB ports you could charge them on your computer you can charge them to where you would plug your you know your phone cable right in there and then this this adapter will just go right into the wall then your vapor ends charging or you plug this right into your computer and now the base is charging okay so very very simple and the charges will last you you know weeks or more so once you get a cartridge once you get a base you're also going to need a vape cartridge which is a extract of cannabis oil and you can again get these in sativa indica hybrid or all CBD oils for example this is all CBD and this is a sativa product so again very simple simply screw the vape cartridge right into your base alright just like that and you're literally ready to go alright so then to use this product you simply depress the button hold it there inhale on the device take one puff see how you feel about five or ten minutes later and then repeat until you are at the level of Medicaid you've reached the level of medication that you wanted to consume and are feeling comfortable just don't use it before you drive besides that that's really how the vaporizers work it couldn't be simpler again if you want to detach this you can detach it be careful to not let the oil leak out if you're going to just rely on this allow around I usually try and set it upright or put the kite of the cap back on and that's really truly it with the vaporizers we that they're incredibly efficient and convenient way to medicate", "yQcwdQ8NSjQ": "hey folks it's eric here with whatever guy because it really is whatever with me here to talk to you about the chill brand delta eight thc bait cartridge uh apple fritter flavor um and if you will do me a favor and like and subscribe and stick around to the end of the video i will tell you how you can win yourself a brand new uh vape cartridge from delta farms i'll order that from vapeful supply on christmas day for a winter you got a really good chance of winning this because i don't have a thousand followers um you can check that out if you stick around if you like and subscribe stick around in the video i'll tell you how you can get on there okay so today we're doing a uh review on chill brand's apple fritter vape cartridge delta at sea based cartridge and i had um talked to you guys about them yesterday i did a banana kush yesterday um previous to that my girl had ordered from them um uh last thursday night which would have been thanksgiving night she ordered at nine o'clock um and they advertised two days shipping on their um on their site and so the cars were 70 off and somebody put me on something they were really good brands so i said you know go ahead and do that so thinking that i you know that they would be back into work friday you know friday morning saturday get my order you know run and then you know i possibly have my order monday or tuesday and i would have you know two three days to do vape cars because um they advertised the two days shipping for orders over a hundred dollars and i obviously got over 100 um point of fact was that i actually didn't get my order until thursday night at nine o'clock i was at ups fault um it's just the fault of diamond cbd not having a skeleton crew on friday and saturday or not uh you know loving their employees enough to go around and ask somebody you know they need the money and maybe work some overtime i mean that's that's the way i was when i was uh you know in charge of things you know where i was running and maybe maybe i'm wrong y'all tell me uh regardless of all that um i would have liked to have got my water monday or tuesday like the advertising alluded to um i didn't get that and so i ended up doing some other reviews uh so i've got a bunch of stuff from chill uh from from diamond cbd but i i just i'm not gonna have time to do them because what's gonna happen is i'm going to get another order in and they're going to take a back door step or a back step you know and then i'll just have to get to them when i get time and it's a shame because they have a really really good product so i like i said yesterday i did oh i'm banana kush about an hour after i got the package in and i told you that the banana kush was um a really intriguing card because it was like when you hit the vape card it was the very first time every time um a lot of times when you hit these vape cards what will happen is like two or three four hits into it you just won't get that taste anymore until you put it down and then maybe pick it back up and you get it again on that first hit with banana cushion i was getting the same hit every single time and that was really crazy to me and it was a really good high and i ended up vaping that throughout the night and into the day um and now what i'm on is this apple fritter excuse me okay and this apple fritter is a really intriguing flavor also it took me a second when i hit this to realize that i was easy on a high because it eased me in so slow um this is something that you can hit throughout the day again the flavor is there man i don't know what they're doing with their carts that are different than the other ones like i said i love vapor supply they have a really premium car they've got good flavor on theirs and their card design i'd have to give chill brand a heads up or a thumbs up simply because their flavor lasts throughout the cart um i don't you know throughout the hit and i'm obviously not to the end of it but i've hit this thing probably 15 20 times and it's extremely uh apple fritter it's got like a cinnamon um kind of cinnamon hits down in your throat and you get like a almost like an apple pie type of thing going on and it's a really good flavor man i'm really intrigued about these carts man simply because they're easing me into a good high it's something that i can work with all day long and they got good flavor too man and that's crazy so for a lot i would imagine this would appeal to a lot of the women out there because you know they love the fruity flavors and stuff like that this apple fritter and that banana kush yesterday with a bomb um they're really good flavors uh really light high no anxiety no paranoia and i'm really where i want to be hey folks y'all check it out man uh like i said if you'll stick around to the end and this is the end so i'm giving away one of these vape cards on christmas day uh to one of my viewers um if you'll look down in the bottom there'll be a little thing for giveaway if you'll get on that on

marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary classic 510 cartridge review today everybody's favorite kind of cartridge your traditional screw thread uh and a cartridge brand that's been around for a very long time if i remember correctly i think it's actually the first cartridge i ever consumed here in uh california upon moving here nearly five years ago and that is jetty extracts jetty extracts gold uh today we're gonna be taking a look at their grand daddy purp strain with a whopping 86 percent thc in there it's a pretty high thc percent and i picked this up at a dispensary in long beach for uh 47 which puts it right about in the middle uh for price the price spectrum uh for this area so 47.1 gram 86 thc cart pretty good deal um jetty uh we've got all our stuff we want to see on here as well we've got our manufactured dates our lab testing results so all the good stuff there as well um as i said granddaddy perp is our strain to try today uh in terms of packaging looks pretty basic nothing too ostentatious got a little sticker to remove first which we shall do sticker gone i guess we just pull maybe i hope ah there we go they still have the little bags i remember these there was a little bag that i had when i first ordered it nearly five years ago these strange little extra pieces of cloth don't know why you need them oh it's a big old woody tip my favorite way for tips to be are woodies um and this one does not disappoint you don't see the you don't see the hardwood tip very often um even as much as you might look to see a nice wooden tip it doesn't happen as frequently as any of us should hope for all right so we've got our 510 cart screwed on here i'll figure out what to do with this bag at some point nice little dime bag maybe uh and here is our oil nice looking rich uh yellow oil no problems on that part um standard looking cartridge design nothing special there standard intake holes although i like the little yellow jetty uh band there that's pretty tasteful all right but let's get to the most important part where's this 47 dollar 86 percent jetty golden thc cartridge gonna feel like [Music] oh yum [Music] very smooth um not a heavy tasting strain um granddaddy perp isn't one of my the strings i'm too familiar with in terms of what i'm tasting here is like there's a little bit of spice to it almost um uh earthy and spicy not bad not bad at all but subtle uh it is not one of the strongest most terpene enriched strains i've ever tasted that's not a bad thing but the oil itself is really nice very smooth it's really nice not burning at all doesn't leave a nasty aftertaste really pretty smooth good stuff here first impressions from jetty and their granddaddy perps [Music] a slightly fruity taste just slightly [Music] but i enjoy it earthy tastes aren't traditionally my favorites but this one's nice and smooth subtle this is a good package so far from jetty uh it's a shame it took us so long to review them uh initial impressions very good very positive but like all our wheats reviews guys we're gonna review the whole cartridge not just these first couple of hits here i'm gonna do these whole experience uh it's gonna take us about you know four five six days to get through the whole thing and then after we do that we'll come back to you guys at the very end and give you all our final wrap-up thoughts all that good stuff uh let you know if this thing make sure it doesn't start to burn hot or uh doesn't leak or doesn't go dead any of those things that you know can definitely happen with these things we'll test the whole thing but for right now big thumbs up for jetty extracts and their granddaddy perps well i look forward to finishing this off and i will see you guys back here in just a bit until then stay high stay healthy see ya welcome back to weeks guys it has been five days as predicted since we first checked in with jetty extracts his gold line with their grand daddy perps that's that 47 cartridge picked up here in long beach and this one guys is thankfully going to be short and sweet because i have nothing but great things to say about it have just a little bit of oil left in there to share with you guys as we talk our wrap up thoughts which are pretty similar to our initial thoughts so these last couple of hits here it tastes just as good hit just as hard uh that 87 thc i believe um as they did at the very beginning which is always a good sign the wooden tip not my favorite but it's not bad work never got clogged um as i said cart design works fine oil always totally great quality top to bottom this is a big old thumbs up for jetty extracts um not a lot extra to say about it other than it's good if you see it and it's at a fair price i don't think you need to uh hesitate this one big old thumbs up for me no hesitations no qualifications jenny makes a solid solid product so guys before i bounce though i'm going to share with you a little cherry on top anytime we get one of these reviews that we like this much that we have something we like so much we want to share with you a little something extra a little cherry on top that you can have that's you know some not not necessarily weed related and something you don't necessarily have to use weed to enjoy but um this time you know maybe you want to get a little bit high put on the youtube and check out one of my favorite channels introduced to me by a friend a couple years ago uh this channel is called game makers toolkit with mark brown british guy who talks about game development game design a very competent very academic way it's great um i suggest a little granddaddy purpose from jetty extracts sit back if you like games you like thinking about games in a more um abstract way check out game maker's toolkit i think you're gonna like both of these two big thumbs up for me guys jetty xrx with their granddaddy per game makers tool kit here on youtube that's going to do it for everything guys that's going to do it for this review it's going to do it for the cherry on top thank you so much for watching and we'll see you guys on a future review peace", "TRE1KhNV06s": "hold on guys it's angel from discount vape pen today we're going to be taking a look at the card is in black box this is going to be a vape for your cartridge 510 cartridges we're going to go up close and show you what you get in the box [Music] alright guys up close we're gonna open up the Cardassian black box show you what comes inside up top you're gonna have a little card which is pretty much going to give you all of the functions of it and talk a little bit about it very intuitive it's going to show you exactly what you need to get started using it also gonna have the black box itself really nice really nicely made this box here I'm going to show you a little bit around it got your charge port on the bottom there you're also gonna have your three lights for your battery life your button up here three clips is gonna shoot your due to different voltages and then like I said just using it cartridge in here just to show you guys see there your battery indicator on the bottom which is nice for a concealed unit like this because most of them don't have that as you can see this is a 1 mil cartridge with a small magnet that's perfectly in there and as you can see that opening is huge so it's gonna fit some of the bigger 510 cartridges out on the market show you everything else you get get a nice little goodie bag here it's gonna have your basic USB charger you're gonna have a small magnet for 1 mil cartridges and you're gonna have a bigger magnet for your point 5 cartridges which would just allow the cartridge itself to sit a little bit higher so as I said this is the smaller magnet and the bigger one is gonna be for your shorter cartridges that way when you drop it in this part right here will stick out enough to where it's actually functional nice little juice window there on the side so you could see what's in the cartridge and overall just a nice little solid construction of the device this does have a 900 mAh battery so one of the biggest batteries for a concealed unit like this the 3 settings it's gonna start at 3 point 4 volts go to 3.7 and then it's gonna go to 4.0 on the highest setting and then as I said before probably one of the bigger batteries and it does have that indicator which is nice on the bottom and that's our first look at the car tusen black box alright guys so that was our first look at the carson black box as you can see the features just make it overall a really good device to use for your 5-10 cartridges right now I just have a cartridge in here I'm gonna show you how it functions right now it's on the blue setting which is the medium so as you can see it functions just like a regular 510 cartridge battery but it does have its benefits the adjustable settings on there the battery life on this thing is amazing as I said before it's gonna take any cartridge on the market as you can see that huge opening in there and you're gonna be able to fit some of the wider longer cartridges in there and then the fact that it does come with the two magnets doesn't matter if it's a 0.5 or a 1 mil it's gonna fit in there no problem nice button the settings are easy to navigate and overall just a really nice solid 510 cartridge battery then take another little vape on it here so as you can see it does exactly what it's supposed to just gives you a little bit more option if you guys are using some of the bigger 510 cartridges they're gonna slide in there no problem and this is gonna work for you and again this is probably one of the bigger per concealed unit this is gonna be one of the bigger batteries to get on the market sir less charging you're gonna be able to go most of the day with it without having to charge it overall just a really nice box guys if you like we just saw in the video is give us a thumbs up it's a subscribe button if you're interested in a Carter's and black box they're available for purchase at discountjuicers.com [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "kQmL3zc2sOk": "hey YouTube how are you I hope you guys are having a good day and if you're not I hope by clicking on this video you're feeling a little bit better today's Monday okay and I'm back again with another cart review oh I picked up another cart that I have not tried okay I did take a couple of puffs off of it but I didn't like actually like experience everything so this is gonna be pretty exciting oh garden sky doggy and this I don't know um but this is an indica named live resin okay now I was like what is the difference between all the other cards and then the live resin like what's different about it well I looked it up online and I wrote my little notes down so I guess live resin an onion flower rather than a dried cured flower so I guess the other types of cards which are called dis lint or I don't know I don't know if I said that right but basically those I guess are made of flowers that's already been cured you know it's chilling and it's already dry so that's how they make their you know chemistry happened with those kinds and I guess what's live resin it's fresh frozen flower if that makes sense so I thought that was an interesting found the raw garden site because on the packaging you guys it has your little warning it has the manufacturer date the batch number and all that it tells me like the percentage right here on top of the sticker but yeah on here it doesn't say much it just says ingredients 100 percent frozen fresh frozen whole flower Turpin's and cannabis oil so those are the ingredients in this wax well card it says no trim no additives ever and that's all it really says and then it tells you like how to use it and the dosage you should take or whatever once you open it up so this is the inside of the box it just has like a little container where your cart sit so it's all box name inside of the box so that's cool and then in here is where it's all at and you push down and you open it sometimes I'm having trouble okay got it open yay okay so um in the thing that's what the color looks like okay this is beautiful it's so light it's just attractive you know it looks cleaner to me it feels more natural but that's just the color that's just me talking on the card of course it has a California sticker and then it has the raw garden and then it has their little symbol so on a symbol uh logo logo yes yes yes and then on the card screw on thing that you just take off once you're ready to use it and then it has a little top it this is what the mouthpiece is looking like okay that is the opening hole and then sort of those say is just you know regular white little tips screw her on and let's start this smoke stash I have not smoked today yet it's my first time yesterday I got really okay story time I got a little drunk okay and then I think I had three beers and I have well three beers and a half is too much for me I don't drink often at all rip and oh my god I was so sick you guys it's like I just started feeling really like woozy and like just tired and I was just not having fun anymore like I didn't want to be drunk anymore and I threw up like I was sitting in my car and I was just chilling first I went outside to catch some air you know I was with a couple of friends so I went outside to get some air all feeling better and you know you [ __ ] up even after you go outside and you don't feel better like the fresh air isn't helping it's not doing anything so I already knew what I was going into so I was just kind of walking around kind of like chillin then I just then I sat in my car and I was [ __ ] sick I just was like okay you know when you feel like you're about to throw up like it's coming you can't stop it it's coming it's exactly how I felt you guys I threw up I didn't throw up all over me you know I threw up outside of the car I have not smoked since then because I got so sick I came home I think I don't even think I took a shower but I laid down I slept I woke up at 12 I ate so I don't know how I survived but here I am okay it's website and I wanted to focus on some of the little facts that they have on there what they claim cuz like I said on the packaging it isn't much so I wanted to kind of tell you guys and also with the live resident another fact if focuses on maintaining is strong and pure flavor and honey I can totally agree with that because the first hit I took of this when I was leaving the dispensary oh my god like I was so freakin late I was coughing my ass off it was really pure like as far as the flavor it literally tastes like you got some like dab or like wax and you took an actual dab you know out of it Raik that's what it feels like it feels [ __ ] well now feels it tastes really good and the flavor is definitely very like weedy you know and another few few facts from raw garden so they claim they are a hundred percent natural farm-fresh cannabis so they only grow fresh cannabis they're not using stuff that's been sitting somewhere really grown plants so all of their flower you know that's extracted for their cards or their wax or their diamond saws there's so many different stuff from them it's all California cannabis grown in California valleys so if you guys you know support that I definitely do because it's like if it's a closed source it's more of it's not past past past no fillers and their product no added flavors and no additives and I [ __ ] with the no added flavors part because I don't really like the extra stuff just for it to taste better or something like I can care less but anyways I'm gonna stop rambling and we're gonna get lit and I'm gonna and I didn't bring a water what is she thinking amra all Gardens definitely gotta take little hits with this oh my god yeah yeah you guys I'm warning you okay if you guys are I'm telling you guys take little hits off of this when you first get it if you haven't tried one of these already because I have not tried this so I'm a whole new person to this you know it's a very it has like a wax taste okay like this is an indica sky doggy so do not expect a no type of light you know fruity stuff from guys like this is the flavor is like like I said I'm gonna tell you the flavor okay very very wax like that's exactly how I describe it I don't think it tastes like any type of fruit or any type of like you took a DAB and that tastes you have in your mouth but a good damn you know not a nasty not on whatever something you just whatever no a good clean wax tab out of a clean break that's how I would describe it okay had a terrible night yesterday though I [ __ ] fell asleep like my whole [ __ ] like it was turning out to be cool and I did a lot of stuff yesterday but as far as like I went to the grocery store then I went to the dispensary and then I think I ran like two more errands and that's after that is when you know somebody when I first went there I had positive thoughts I was like I'm gonna have two three beers and I'm just gonna drink I'm not gonna smoke and at first I didn't even smell them they were smoking at first okay and then you know it was fine I got drunk I got confident so but I did throw up it was fun being drunk I felt really faded but then I just pushed it pushed my own limit I knew I should have stopped when I should have stopped but yeah I mean other than that you know as far as what other flavors have you guys tried if you guys are watching this and because this should spider like I love it okay like oh and let's do that bubble test y'all like I don't think it's fake so if it comes up fast is it's it's a full gram so I feel like this should last me a while because I mean I barely take few hits and I'm high so like I said it's good it is an indica so I mean they probably have other flavors where you guys are at so it might be different stuff I don't know but as you can tell my voice is like recipe now because I'm a little high and you know this did it [ __ ] it did it [ __ ] nothing I don't know what else to really say about it but I definitely recommend it it was I think where I got it from 55 before tax and then would tax a little bit more so you know you do what you do as soon as I'm done filming this video I'm gonna go edit smoke some more you know is honestly let's do a rating one to ten what am I gonna give it once and for all it's a good 9 okay I'll even give it a 10 I just haven't smoked all of it yet and then I'll definitely tell you with an empty car to be like yeah what do I really think about it this [ __ ] hits but yeah let me know what you guys are smoking on what is your other flavor that you have tried that you recommended me trying let me know you know let me know but I'm gonna go because it is getting a little darker and I'm pretty much [ __ ] I don't know talk about hang out of 10 it it tastes like what it claims you know the no fillers no added flavors no additives it definitely feels like that it feels really like pure just Tacey [ __ ] pounds in your face baby hits baby hits you guys oh my god but I'm gonna go I'm gonna edit this video maybe smoke a bowl or whatever you know the huge the user dues but I hope you guys are having a good day and I hope this video made you feel a little bit better because it definitely makes me feel better making them and yeah let me know let me know well I'll see you in the next videos so you don't know anyways have a good day have a brighter day and have blessed day", "KurpY8TmkNE": "hi there welcome to select films I'm really excited to show you our most potent and flavorful vaporizer cartridge the select elite

to select oil calm for more information and let us know what you think about the elite", "jSJPxDOiEtY": "hey everybody fat here from humanity health we want to give a quick little tutorial on how to use our batteries and our cartridges all of our cartridges that we carry have a 510 threading so that's the part where it goes into the battery they're all 510 so say if you don't have one of our batteries or you have your own battery or you want to use a different battery as long as it's a 510 it will work the voltage is I believe a certain voltage you have to have it in order for it to work so if you have a very low voltage battery it may not burn the cartridges hot enough to get the vape out of but I wanted to give you a quick little tutorial on our COI max batteries they look like this this is the battery part of it this is the cart if you unscrew it it's really easy the 510 threading like I was talking about when you want to charge it if it's out of battery you actually get one of these in the packaging and that also is a 5-10 threading so it goes into the same spot where the cartridge goes so you will have to take the cartridge off and order to charge it and then it's the USB Drive so you can plug it straight into your laptop or if you have an adapter to plug into the adapter plug it into the wall very easy doesn't take super long to charge and the battery lasts for a pretty long time so that was just a simple little breakdown of how our batteries work if you wanted to actually use it the way you turn it on is the button right there you click it five times so one two three four five and it will blink on if you saw that or not I believe right now it's on the red setting so if you want set the red setting is the highest setting first-time users will probably want to start off on the white setting because it's just for some people it can hit a little harsh in the lungs if you're not used to vaping so the way you change the voltage is three clicks so one two three you'll see it blinks and now it is on green actually as the green is the lowest voltage not why our old batteries used to be white so if you have an old battery why it's the lowest new battery in Green's the lowest so green if you want to hit it you hold it down and you hit it a little bit of eight nothing much because the lower voltage won't burn as much so if you want more vape you change it to the higher voltages so one two three now it's blue so blue is the second highest voltage one two three now it's red so you hit down red a little bit more you can't really tell at the camera but it was a little bit more for sure yeah so that's a quick little break down on our koi max batteries with our different cartridges that we carry let us know if you like the video comments below if you have any questions banks have a good day", "W68Up_cSIco": "hello hello what what oh there you guys are welcome back to my channel it's your boy naughty smokes and today we got a new car

video and yeah alright guys I'll see you guys soon okay okay yeah yeah bye", "3ZgJBoZwj-A": "hey guys is dabbe connection and we are taking a look at the eureka vapor syringe and doing a review and i've been hitting on this for a little while this is actually the second one of these got two of these and about one and a half way through and let's take a look at the oil actually first so nice clear oil this is from colorado you can see a little eureka logo on there this is the ATF coming a 96 percent THC very strong very high I'm out actually tried some of this on the Hermes 3 and I tried it on seeso because I was actually I like to whenever doing a hardware review we like to do a comparison of kind of what the baseline is and a cartridge we're familiar with so see so we know it's kind of like the standard and let me compare to that so this oil very good if the 96% really mean anything not really because there's oils that have been in 80s that have been just as strong in fact I would say the AMA oils from Nevada are just as strong as this there's actually been a couple am am I've been been a little bit stronger but this is still awesome oil this is great it's really Rica and here's what it looks like all I'm saying is it seems like when stuff gets to the 80s and above I don't think that the THC helps that much more I mean I've I've had stuff that was 80% that has been better stuff that was 92% so that that's happened quite a bit actually but still whatever the percentages on this 96 it is strong it is good it tastes good and another thing I like about Eureka is it doesn't have that co2 II taste like some of the co2 cards might have like I think the the rhythm cartridge kinda had like a co2 much taste this they've gotten rid of the co2 is taste and it reminds me of w Bates because w of apes also has co2 oil but it doesn't have that co2 II kind of odd taste to it it tastes more like a distillate kind of thing so let's take a hit of it so you can see what it looks like I've been hitting on this battery it hits nice and yeah the oil stays consistent seems to vape pretty slow absolutely nothing to complain about it was 60 for a full gram which you know compared to Nevada prices that's a very good deal compared to Colorado prices it's probably about normal and compared to California prices may be a little bit expensive but overall Eureka ATF definitely we get it again I think it's a quality product and I can't wait to try more Eureka stuff definitely we'll probably just keep getting eureka stuff when I'm in Colorado so there's nab connection two thumbs up for eureka vapor atf syringe thanks for watching and have a great week", "agukEpErewM": "hey what's going on everyone my name is josh also is wade funnies in today's video

of the way everyone let's go ahead get into the phone like i said this is a move pure cartridge this is the black mamba strain we're smoking on today got some nice golden black oil in there golden uh yellow oil in there nice uh translucent this particular strain is a half gram cartridge over there from move florida like i've said 50 for the half gram black mamba is a indica the lineage of this parent of this strain the parents are unknown but thought to be uh gdp or granddaddy purple crossed with black domina or black domina and i think both those strains uh accurately represent this at least the uh granite purple of course it's very similar to that granddaddy perp uh with effects as well as uh taste particular thc in this batch is 430 milligrams per half gram cartridge or 86 percent and uh 1.8 cbd in this particular batch i'm glad move actually put the uh stuff there on the package i know it's backwards but black mamba they're up top 430 milligrams 0.9 and that's it's half grams 1.8 but yeah you got your vape pure there this particular batch was harvested and packaged uh this was june 8th 2020. now that we got that out of the way guys let's go ahead and get another rip in before we get some more information and uh go ahead get that out of the way we got your blunts your bongs your joints your vape pens whatever you do to get it nice and right get nice and medicated with me let's go ahead and get this cheers everyone the particular blood structure of this strain is said to be very dark green hard dense buds with purple and dark green leaves uh sugar leaves on those i definitely agree with that i've never seen the buds of this particular strain but from what i i can taste in the pictures i've seen online i definitely agree with that according to leafly it helps patients with stress insomnia and pain definitely agree with the insomnia uh the couple times i have medicated on this i've only done it a couple so far but um very sleepy definitely had it definitely holds true to those uh og uh what's it called og uh what am i saying og gdp genetics there they say this strain had me feeling clear-headed mellow i would definitely say it's a nice indica to have a conversation on or uh listen to some great music you definitely enjoy it we're gonna go ahead and get another room here guys cheers make sure you check me out over there on instagram on that platform the weed funnies all one word uh definitely check me out if you like stoner uh memes education as well as florida medical marijuana products zooms uh zoom in and pictures if you definitely uh

mellow over here i feel it here the cerebral but that's mostly uh most pens but it's also the body high i'm definitely feeling here in my chest as well as melt it into this chair definitely it'll give me a nice nap or perhaps watch some uh some tv clutch up on some tv i don't know yet for fifty dollars can't beat it i like this a little better than that blueberry one i previously reviewed if you haven't checked out that blueberry cartridge review definitely go check that one out like just like this pure i believe i did that last week and for fifty dollars for the half gram here on that medical market that's not very not very bad competitive wise i should say for the price i mean i think the cheapest distance cartridge we have right now is either the 30 ones over there from one plant which i don't like or the 35 dollar ones pop azure cartridges over there from liberty health sciences i believe i believe those are the two cheapest but um yeah i think it's worth more to pay for those better terps as well as i think it's a little better quality distillate as well go ahead and get one more rip here cheers everyone i don't know if i said the smell and the taste on the strain um i would say it's sweet fruity and peppery in my opinion and that would be for the smell and the taste uh the taste the fruit in there i can't decide if it's citrus or grape in my opinion maybe a little bit of both but it reminds me of that granddaddy purple in uh no contest i would say i would whoever guessed that on the genetics i would say is pretty damn close i want to say this is named after that basketball basketball player kobe bryant that passed away i'm not sure though because they did call him black mamba don't quote me on that though this is a little bit stronger of a cartridge over there distance-wise 86 percent i'm liking that as well i think that last one i reviewed was i want to say 75 i'm not mistaken really good i've been enjoying this uh truly battery as well i've been only had to charge it a couple times i think i've charged it i wanna say twice now in the three weeks i've had it maybe four weeks the only thing i do hate about it is that magnet there on the bottom that metal piece is very strong with the mechanism there inside i think you can see that you gotta pull pretty hard i can't get a grip on it with my fingers i mean look how big that is i can't i can't get a grip on that i gotta use my shirt or some kind of cloth but besides that i like it all the same especially the little window here you can see how much product you have left it works out a lot you got just over just over half there all right in conclusion definitely enjoy this uh pure black mamba cartridge over there from move florida and uh definitely recommend it to indica lovers as well as people that enjoy i guess granddaddy purple you know or moved products moves dislike in general it definitely holds up to uh products and the consistency of uh what moves putting out over there go ahead and get one more rip here everyone and get out of your hair this is weed funny signing off spoke with me so good for your mama have a great rest of your day everyone cheers have a great day everyone sweet 27 now peace", "eC4XsUNW2_I": "[Music] what's up everybody welcome back to a TC spot Here I am bringing you a half gram cartridge Himalaya life resin sauce cart yeah you heard

it's gonna be dope so see you guys soon and stay loaded", "Yi3i4F-DBlo": "[Music] what's a bad simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this is the interesting video this is obviously a cartridge video but this is surprising I've never seen like a cartridge come in this measurement before and that measurement is 0.75 this was only like 25 or something like 25 to 28 dollars I'm not too sure I forgot but you can see right here it says 0.75 milliliters or grams or whatever we want to call it and it is white Walker ology by cruise I've never tried cruise cartridge but I've tried they're there but and it was good you know very very decent flour for decent prices but I believe this is also this is going to be distantly I believe so you know which is still pretty good you know I'm not I like distillate but as you like I really prefer like sauce cards or live raising card some more you know but this split is it bad it's just sometimes it's just like a artificial flavor so we're gonna see what this is and this is white Walker og you see all the specifications right there everything on the back you can pause if I'm going too fast hopefully it's focusing so just like in the other previous videos I like to mention that my merch is available right now I'll post the link in the bond description below this is just one of the sweaters and they have various colors I think I have like twelve twelve designs on there so like if you don't like one maybe you'll like on another one you know so there's one things to choose from and there's a lot of colors on all of them so I got you there and if you guys are interested I'll post a link people been telling me to make merch for a while and these are all designs I've made myself and I feel like it's more genuine that way because I wouldn't want to paste to design something for me I feel like it should come from the content creator you know and not to knock on any of like other content creators but some of their stuff is a little bit lacking I really wanted to like make it known that I made these and also you know I I understand that most people don't really want cannabis on their shirts so that's why I have some shirts that's just it's more about my life you know like how I was actually born in San Francisco I have a San Francisco shirt the bridge is a conic bridge I think we all know even people that don't live in California fall you know about the Bay Bridge and there's a story behind that because like I named that shirt the bridge to the Spencer eeeh and it's because back when Modesto didn't have too much we had to go to the bay and get all their [ __ ] you know and we had to cross that bridge and it's a play on to that one movie I didn't even see that movie Bridge to Terabithia there's some [ __ ] so I thought it was pretty cool but yes you were not inclined to buy any of these things if you want to support me and buy one of these you're more than welcome to but you're also more than welcome to just not buy it and just chilled me still so let's get on with this [ __ ] review what are you doing but link will be in the book down below so this is white Walker og syndicate as you can see right here really really good stuff it looks pretty nice no no way cartridge so far it's a [ __ ] plastic radiator Calvin your sticker our caution sticker whatever you want to call it I'm not gonna lie this looks pretty [ __ ] nice this thing the oil test or whatever this is dumb as hell I mean I've seen some that's very liquidy and you know what that's just it but very thick I mean this just proves how thick the oil is I mean other than it's [ __ ] legit cuz it's not moving no it could still be sure you know trash off the bed notice that there's some like weird like thing on here that I definitely gotta wash off be using it in my as a beauty which reminds me I still need to do that giveaway for this I'm waiting on light so I can do a live on YouTube in choose a winner but guys [Music] Cheers [Music] very small - not too tasty at all of you is that some sort of taste but I'm not really sure how to describe it I mean it's definitely alright I definitely wouldn't prefer other cartridges I mean what enticed me though was that it was 0.75 for twenty-something dollars which is pretty weird for a cartridge like they usually never come in 2075 so I had to get it never tried cruise cartridges soul paper production is there though it's a very like the sensation to cough afterwards is minimal the taste can't really describe the taste but it's minimal as well other than that pretty decent cartridge if you don't really care about taste you're trying to forget about value out of what you buy because it is 80 percent THC cartridge and I believe it as some sort of amount of CBD in it other than that very good cartridge for what it is not a very tasty one in my opinion but that's just me maybe it's just because I brush my teeth no but woman playing an end the video here hopefully you guys enjoyed it [Music] [Music] [Music]", "GlxbV8OprWU": "hey you too Alex here back again with another quick video this time I got some rhythm it is Gorilla Glue number four by rhythm check out the stats let's get this bad boy open I'll let you know what I think this is a hybrid it is coming in I don't know if you see that at 70 the THC is seventy nine point four one eight and the THC a is one point two two for one or one to one for really small but it's like eighty percent THC Gorilla Glue is one of my favorite hybrids you guys probably

rhythm gorilla glue hybrid see a chart ridge very nice cartridge nice-looking co2 oil gorilla glue number four you guys know it's the real deal no we don't smoke Street carts around here gorilla glue number four by rhythm this one's got the little peach I noticed that the sativas have a little yellow swiftly line right there these does hybrid has a little peach color sweetly lime can you see the little squiggly line you can see it right there it's very nice on the pen let's give it a rip Gorilla Glue the number for co2 oil very nice nice flavor real earthy kind of tastes almost like the flower would taste if you smoked it with sweetness to it very nice I like that a lot that taste see so cartridge a little plastic mouthpiece though I don't like to really care for the plastic I do like the ceramic ones that Prime has in vero has a ceramic piece by than that $55 I paid for the half gram of the Gorilla Glue as a mouthpiece there's a little swig Li line and cartridge it says the C cell its co2 oil cheers let's get another rip mm-hmm I like that a lot nice tasting hybrid let's hope that pit does the trick I think it will I'll let me know a little bit more about what I thought

section have a great weekend happy Saturday here in Erie peace", "Th0pOeN9_fs": "hey guys his definition we're checking out la con from select elite and one thing I noticed that's well I had like a little bit more of a a greenish kind of color almost like a almost like a greenish hint to the way it looks that is not what I've seen in most the other select cards they seem to have the more orangish color seems pretty consistent across the carts this is la con this came in LA Confidential came in at 85% and it is an indica and I haven't hit it yet and as always with the select elite carts they come with the plastic tops e-cell leave its the m60 and I like these only thing I don't like about them is you cannot refill them and if something goes wrong which is rare but if it does they're very difficult to open but take some hits and see how the effects are painted on vessel battery yeah and the taste is whatever not really the best tasting cart not terrible though either it's a decent taste it does taste a little bit different than the other select cards I would say the other ones do taste a little better than this one I gotta say though in the effects yeah it's it's strong it's a strong cart and it doesn't really feel super energetic but you can feel the effects and it doesn't make you too tired but yeah yeah it's potent definitely potent so overall on this select elite LA Confidential review I would give it two thumbs up I'd say it's a good cart if you're really looking for taste though I would say this one doesn't taste that great and select in general doesn't taste that great I like because it's strong but this doesn't even taste as good as most the other select carts that are out there but overall on the strength it's great so I'd still give it two thumbs up thanks for watching guys is DAP connection and have a great week", "Vw8rT3YPzdM": "what up YouTube what up youtube welcome back welcome back King look 420 here coming at you with another

about the gushers candy tastes really good um this true berry it's amazing if I was to give it a rating out of 10 well let's go through the high first true berry it's a hybrid but me it doesn't really put me in the couch it was more of an upper I'm more of ready to do stuff when I smoke this one compared to like Mandarin dream it's more of like a downer I'd be going into couch for that mothertrucker if you're looking for a good daytime hybrid I would definitely choose true berry over a lot of the other ones and if I was to give it a rating out of 10 I'd probably go for like a 88.2 just because I have tasted better but I have tasted a lot worse so I mean it's pretty good remember guys it's King Luke 4:20 if you like the channel man just please consider subscribing if you made it
