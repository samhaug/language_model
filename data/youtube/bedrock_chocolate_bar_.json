can infinite efficiency and infinite haste break bedrock it's a very simple question if you watched ant venom's video you would know the answer to this already which is no can't but with this amazing graphic that they drew up i did not want to forego this opportunity so i wanted to tackle this a little bit differently if i removed the unbreakable tag from bedrock will i be able to break it so if i just set it to a very high value basically infinity hardness will i be able to break it now this command block will be the one that will give me infinity haste you can see it's set to 1 but the code will give me infinity haste i won't give myself infinite efficiency because it actually won't change anything infinity plus infinity is infinity the dick speed uses the same float value so it doesn't actually change anything with efficiency and haste so there's no points we shall see what happens if you think infinity haste will break the bedrock block let me know in the comments with yes and let me know if you think it's not going to work so i'm going to set it to infinity haste and as you can see i am breaking every block as if i'm holding shears on a tree i can break two blocks with like a single tap if i yeah there you go if i really wanted to but it's very sensitive so i have to really tap it to make it work it says haste 2 but clearly any sane person would realize this is not haste 2. so i've simply set the hardness value to a very high value right now it's not infinity at the moment but as you can see it breaks this command block is simply setting block a bedrock block uh all the time so this is what happens and i'm depleting my pickaxe so quickly right now so i can easily break bedrock it doesn't matter what positive integer or float valley are put for the hardness of bedrock it's going to break instantly so the question remains if it's infinite hardness what will happen and here we go nothing's working yes infinite hardness beats infinite mining efficiency the reason being mining efficiency has nothing to do with the player's ability to mine a block it only determines the speed of it so there is no check for the ability to mine a block because it either is and isn't um being unbreakable means you just can't do it so infinity hardness is an actual deterministic value but the mining speed is just how fast you're going to do it so if you can't even do it anyway it doesn't matter how fast you mine it and also there's probably some sort of mathematical issue there so infinity divided by can't break command blocks either because that's also unbreakable but there's something different about this if you wanted to mine bedrock you have to get rid of the unbreakable tag bottom line you can't do it thank you for asking and thank you for watching leave a

that you guys perfectly made 400 milligram chocolate bar recently i've really gotten into making my own edibles from concentrates i've gotten from the dispensary you guys have been asking me to make youtube videos about some of the recipes i've made so today i'm going to show you the easiest one i've learned so far today we're going to be making medicated chocolate bars it's extremely simple and that's why i wanted to show you this method first all you're going to need is a chocolate of your choice mct oil or coconut oil and either distillate or rso today i'm going to be using distillate but both will work the same for this recipe you can use any form of extract as long as it's been decarb some equipment you'll need is a heat safe bowl a pot a rubber spatula a pyrex measuring cup some measuring utensils a plastic syringe you can find these in most pharmacies and then you'll need a mold for the chocolates if you don't want to do bars you can do molds that look like anything you want there's stars there's bears you can really get creative now the amount of chocolate you use depends on how potent you want your chocolate bars to be the more chocolate you use the less potent your edible will be today i'm using a granite distillate that has about 830 milligrams of thc in it and i'm going to be making two chocolate bars so each chocolate bar is going to have about 400 milligrams of thc i'll explain how to calculate how potent your edibles are a little bit later on in the video but for now let's get started making our edibles first thing to do is fill your pyrex measuring cup with water and put it in the microwave for about two minutes after that two minutes is done take out your now hot water and drop your syringe of distillate in that water this is to make the distillate more of a liquidy consistency so it's easier to mix in with the chocolate you do not want to skip this step distillate is very thick if it's just been sitting in room temperature but now we're going to set up our double boiler by getting a pot with a little bit of water not too much you don't want the water to be above where the bottom of the bowl is going to be sitting on top of it bring that pot to a boil then turn it to low while topping it with your heat safe bowl the heat from the steam is going to be our heat source and now we're going to add just under a teaspoon of mct oil mct oil or coconut oil supposedly helps speed up the digestion process of an edible allowing you to feel the full effects quicker you let the mct oil sit for about a minute let it get nice and warm before you add your distillate and now we're going to take that distillate out of the water and pour it into the bowl just look how easy it is to squeeze out of the syringe it's going to mix perfectly now stir the distillate with the mct oil let it all get mixed together and now we're gonna add our chocolate i'm using just under two and a half ounces of milk chocolate here it melts easier if you break it up a little bit mix it while it's melting and make sure your stove is on the lowest possible temperature you do not want to burn the chocolate keep stirring until it's liquidy and now we're going to fill our syringe and transfer the chocolate into the molds you don't need the syringe but the syringe makes it a much cleaner process and since the chocolate is medicated i want to waste as little of it as possible so i feel like the syringe really helps with that this process takes a minute but the result is worth it i put a little cutting board under the mold to help them keep flat this especially helps when you're transferring them into the fridge and make sure the molds are filled completely nobody wants airy chocolate you can bag and shake the molds a little bit to help everything even out once the molds are filled you want to put them in the fridge for 30 minutes after that 30 minutes you want to transfer them to the freezer for about another hour and now it's time to enjoy got my molds fresh out of the freezer right here you guys gonna show you how good these look don't want to break it it's nice and frozen so typically they're not going to break on you oh yeah look at that you guys perfectly made 400 milligram chocolate bar bust out the second one oh yeah holy crap you guys that looks like a professional chocolate bar my plan is to cut these in half to their 200 milligram squares i feel like that's a little bit more of a realistic dose i've done this before and gotten a little bit more creative this is like a cookies and cream bar i used white chocolate and oreos since i used oreos i had to use a little bit less chocolate so i used about two ounces of chocolate to get two chocolate bars here's another one i've done where i added marshmallow and graham crackers to it so it's like a medicated s'mores bar all of these chocolate parts were made from the same strain with the same batch of distillate and the same amount so in theory each chocolate bar should have the same amount of potency and that's kind of what i was shooting for here i just wanted a bunch of different chocolate bars that i all knew were the same potency if you use two different types of distillate or rso and another one one might hit you a little bit harder than the other but since these were all made with the same amount the same strain from the same batch they should be a very consistent high and the reason why i like these little squares is i feel like it makes it easier to dose out a lower dose if a chocolate square like this has nine little chocolate squares in it and has 215 milligrams it should be somewhere between 20 to 23 milligrams per chocolate so i can either have like nine doses of 23 milligrams or an entire dose of about 200. it's super easy to find out how many milligrams of thc is in your edibles it just takes a little bit of math and a little bit of knowledge all you need to know is the amount of product you put in it and the total thc of that product if you're using a gram of distillate that has 80 thc it has 800 milligrams of thc in that gram if you're using 2 grams of distillate that has 80 thc there's 1600 milligrams in that batch so once you find the total thc in your batch just divide that number by the amount of treats you made so if you use 800 milligrams of thc in that batch and you got 20 candies each candy is going to be roughly 40 milligrams of thc this concentrate i was using had 83 percent thc in it so it has about 830 milligrams of thc in the gram personally i like to take a couple milligrams off my dose because i feel like not all of it makes it from the bowl into the edible so that's why i consider these bars 400 milligrams instead of i hope you learned something about edibles and i hope this maybe even inspired you to make your own it's super simple and all edible recipes are pretty easy if you can bake or cook you can probably make edibles and let me know if you guys want to see more edible videos in the future and if so what kind of videos you want to see do you want me to make tutorials do you want me to just consume some edibles here and film my reaction do you want me to make super easy edibles do you want me to make super potent edibles you want me to make super challenging edibles let me know because i want to make videos that you guys want to watch so please give me any input if there's something that you guys want to see on my channel let me know in the comments down below i was thinking about doing some reclaim edibles i don't know if you guys have even heard of that before but you can actually use the reclaim from the rig shoe dab to make edibles and i've been collecting that for a couple weeks now and i was thinking about just making some comically strong edibles with them but that's the video you guys thank you so much for watching make sure you click like if you enjoyed this video and subscribe for more videos i got a bunch more on the way leave a comment let me know what edible related videos you want to see in the future and let me know which chocolate bar you think looks the best between the s'mores bar the milk chocolate or the cookies and cream and don't forget if you haven't already check out my online website pponlineshop.com it's the number one online head shop on the internet and it's only getting doper every day i'm adding new products so make sure you check it out and if you need more popcorn in your life you can basically follow me everywhere else on the internet i'm pot underscore porn on snapchat i'm pop porn on instagram on popcorntv

watching my name is jeff peace oh my god that's more fire oh yeah ma'am", "PM6nZxgJWe0": "welcome back to another video and this one i'm going to be showing you how to break bedrock and i am using the end as an example on these and gateways um but it can be any red rock you can get to the another roof potentially you could get to the void um yeah but the end gateways are definitely the most uh useful one and so there you used to be able to break bedrock by placing a sign on the slab and it would literally break any block but that no longer works so you now need a new way and so yeah everything that you need for it is in my inventory here you're going to need some dirt some darker saplings so first you want to find a piece of bedrock that you want to break and in my case it is this top block right here so you want to go up block and then wait no nope and go up two blocks build a four by four like this break those blocks and place those blocks right there then leave a one block outside it looks like that place some more blocks above it and build up at least 10 blocks but i would recommend going more just so that this works more often so at a certain time so you should have something that looks something like this with this one being right here this bedrock block right here being the block that you want to break so then place four dark oak saplings there and bone meal them so you'll see that it did not work this time and so i have my random tick speed set up really high and so since it didn't work this time you just want to get rid of all these get rid of honeywood and you want to try it again so bone meal okay so this time it didn't work the tree grew the wrong way it grew up and so this will happen sometimes but you just need to get rid of the wood and sometimes it'll grow into the dirt and you'll have to replace it so bring some spare dirt when you do this okay so hopefully this time we'll get lucky so if i bone mail that yep and you'll see there it has grown into the bedrock block and it is completely gone it is it's just missing you don't get better at block but i may showcase a glitch in which you are able to get the bedrock clock because the last one that was used has broken as of 1.16 just like the old bedrock breaking glitch so if i look here where's the wood okay so the logs are right here so i have now broken the bedrock block that i want to break and so now let's say i want the vines are seriously growing on the bedrock okay so now let's say i want to break this block so i build up two blocks build a 4x4 platform break those blocks go down here place more get rid of this so [Applause] it's good enough and then one block gap and build up at least 10 blocks and this is to prevent the tree from growing on top of here as much as we can but it's still going to happen sometimes so that one [Music] okay so now we have broken all of these blocks so we are trying to break this bedrock block right there so replacing your four saplings bone meal and did we get it no so we destroy the wood and plant another tree to try and break that bedrock block and again i have my random take speed set up really high so that i can destroy the trees much faster so okay there's still another piece that's right here okay there we go so now our tree is gone oh my god look at the vines okay so saplings again foamy of them okay the tree didn't even go in the right spot this time so i get rid of the wood let's see it grew through some of the dirt a lot of the dirt okay there we go so that tree is now gone and so let me just like another tree okay it didn't work again let me get rid of these vines so game roll random tick speed and i will set it to zero so that these vines stop growing entirely so i can just get rid of all of these by and that should be all of them so now if i just destroy the wood here and this looks very strange so you could potentially like showcase this so that it looks that it's like a strange bug in minecraft nobody really expects to happen because you don't see a tree growing through dirt breaking bedrock every day so i mean yeah i'd say it'd be a pretty strange looking thing but of course you'd have to get it to fit and so that could be a little hard to do oh my god so let's try this again oh my god the tree won't go in the right spot what is wrong with this thing so sometimes you get very unlucky and this keeps happening and it takes a very long time so you can't control exactly what piece of bedrock you break so sometimes you will end up breaking a piece of bedrock that you didn't mean to break um so this could potentially be problematic um but most of the time it'll break the piece of bedrock that you're trying to break it's not going to break yes okay did we break it of course so yep you just want to keep breaking [Music] breaking trees and getting them to grow and so this is going to take a lot of meal um saplings you can get back so it's just going to take a lot of dirt and oatmeal both of which are fairly easy to protein so not too bad and you can get food okay and we have broken it finally that that took a very long time so we can now destroy the tree and so yeah that's this is a really cool bug useful bug and can be used in a variety of different ways to your advantage or disadvantage for creating a trap that lets you fall into the void so now you see you have this really cool looking thing and you can just have an electron see so sometimes you can glitch through head blocks and it uh really is quite annoying so like i'm literally standing in bedrock yep see look i'm in the bedrock so um if i get rid of like this start over here and it's kind of tiny bit if you get it right if you get it right oh my god i don't i don't i can't get it i can't get it right so let me just take this piece of bed back here so let's get rid of this so you could get rid of all the bedrock and you so there is a use for this and this is the ability to get any block in the game in survival and then you could use a duplicating glitch and get as many of it as you want so this is the glitch that requires you to break the bedrock allows you to get literally any block in the game some i haven't even heard of like you can get of course the barrier block command block on survival but you can get blocked like the jigsaw block which i still can't figure out what they do and so i just get myself one of at these jigsaw it's looking pretty cold but i'm not really sure what it does so targeted pool name targeted name and turns into rollable oh my i don't know i don't know what it does and you can get blocks like the structure block structure void and so yeah so i thought we broke it on the first try that would have been amazing but we didn't so you see that in um i mean you could probably be able to break half a piece to the bedrock however much you need in probably about 10 minutes depending on how much it is i'm not 10 minutes like less than 30 probably um but depending on how much break it could take longer or shorter so one piece won't take long okay so here's an example of that we broke a piece of bedrock that i was not trying to break we go this piece right here of course now i go through it um so yeah 0 100 0. there we go okay so if i head on back over to here so you'll see we broke that piece of bedrock that we didn't mean to break but if you managed to write the piece of bedrock to allow you to do this glitch that i may showcase um i did not discover it i don't know who discovered it um but i may showcase it and it allows you to get bedrock and then you could just throw in the bedrock box so you didn't mean to break so yeah rich man's problem so now you can freely get into the end portal which is not a good thing for me because i'm trying to not go to the end portal right now um so yeah so you could of course break this black now and you just have that and you could of course i'm gonna wither and break that but you know yeah again not i don't really know what you want to do so just to show you this i'm not going to showcase another because this video is going to be very long but if so let's say i want to break that bad rock bar i go up two blocks place a block right there break those two blocks more dirt and then filled up with four hard holes of dirt take out all this that didn't that red rock block was always a piece of grass this is probably the most important part so do not forget to do this so then you need to place your saplings down here and you can bone mail them and it didn't work um let's see let's try that again once i destroyed this tree so destroy the logs those logs those logs and trees gone okay so now if we go back down here let's plant our dark chocolate again okay so we try this one last time but if it doesn't work you're just gonna have to trust me um because remember that in the end we failed to break the bedrock quite a few times so it's really up to luck but if we find the last logs right here okay so if we try this one last time okay so the tree grew down there break through into here and we look we broke the bedrock block right there and so now you have access to the void and survival and we also broke five bedrock blocks with that one tree which is pretty impressive so you can just break out the tree and you will see that we have bedrock blocks missing from the world all from using a tree and we've got two in a row right here so so yeah that is going to be it for this video thank you for watching and good bye", "khBSyU9rC5c": "hello it's me james and welcome back to the channel so minecraft has two major platforms we have the java edition and we have the bedrock edition believe it or not both of these have major differences between each other one of those differences on the java edition anyway you can easily go back between updates so for example if i was curious to see what the first ever edition of minecraft looked like on java i could simply do that there would be no nether pretty much no nothing but still i have the option to do it on java whereas bedrock if you're in bedford right now you'll be stuck on the 1.16.201 update again you may want to go back updates to check out what it was like before however the reason i'd want to go back updates is simply for speed running now in the recent updates of the bedrock edition they have added some things aka the piglet brew and also they have nerf piggling trades which means you have a 50 percent less chance of getting ender pearls and when you do get into pearls you get fifty percent less in the pulse before you used to get four to six now you only get two to four now you can see how this could massively impact your speed run time also my friend el triago is a minecraft speedrunner he does all kinds of categories of minecraft speedrun including the glitched speedrun okay so if you follow my channel you will know that recently bedrock are doing a really good job of patching glitches like there are no decent duplication glitches now with this method of going back updates you can actually use the old duplication glitches el triago actually did this method and managed to get a world record again i want to say a huge shout out to el triago for showing me this method let's jump straight on into the video alright so here i am on the just the home page before i quit and show you exactly what we need to do i'm on the 1.16.201 update okay that's the version i am on so before i show you the method i just want to say this could get incredibly glitchy for you however it does work i i tried it and tested this morning i had a little bit of an issue re-uploading my original minecraft but i just restarted my pc and then um i was able to do it although like i said it got a little bit glitchy it couldn't uh like if for whatever reason i couldn't um i couldn't reinstall minecraft but um eventually it just let me do it so like i said it's pretty good to be fair okay so the first step that you're going to want to do is download the link in the description as soon as you've done that you will have a folder that looks a little bit like this what you're gonna need to do after this is simply extract all once you've extracted all you should have something that looks a little bit like this you will have a minecraft launcher folder we can then open this little thing here called the minecraft launcher ignore all this you won't have this at the moment you will just have the minecraft launcher so what we're going to do is hit the minecraft launcher and of course it will want to make changes to uh the desktop so that's exactly what i'm gonna allow it to do and then once we've done that we're just gonna close that and as you can see we've got all of these we've got the betas we've got literally if we go all the way down as well you can see we've got really far back updates and all we have to do is hit download and do that so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go to an update before the nether update uh to actually show you uh this working so if we for example go on this update just here i mean i have no idea if this is the the greatest one to go on or this one we'll go on this one is that the right one yeah we'll do that we'll download it and we're gonna wait for it to download of course this could take um a reasonably long time depending on how fast your internet is once it's downloaded you'll get this extracting bar and then it will were installed so all we got to do um if you go to click here launch it won't launch you'll get this screen i mean it might for you but it doesn't for me so what we're gonna do is go off this right about now and we're gonna go into minecraft launcher again and you can see we've got these two right so this is one before they added piglet brutes and this one here should be before they added the nether update so if we go ahead and click that we're gonna go ahead and click re-install like so and of course we're gonna have to wait for this once again but of course once it has loaded i mean we're very very close uh we're gonna get rid of that uh and yeah we've click reinstall we're gonna go launch now as soon as we've hit launch again it might not launch for you so what you might wanna do is you know just close these down and then simply open minecraft okay as soon as you've opened minecraft you should actually get the older update as you can see i mean this is kind of glitchy as you can see i did say it was going to be a little bit glitchy but um for the most part this is the older update as you can see we've got the aquatic background i'm going to go ahead and create a new world now another thing i should have said i really should have said this at the beginning i'm gonna say right now make sure you've got these backed up you wanna make sure you've got copies of your world i'm gonna go ahead and you know just do this right about now i'm gonna export this world um just because i don't want to lose it right uh make sure you do that because of course when you uh reinstall the new version you're gonna lose all your world realms are gonna be okay you when you update again it'll be on the latest update your worlds will completely be gone uh so yeah make sure you get yourself a little backup now what i am going to do is create a new world and of course um we don't oh god no my skin damn it um we'll just have to i can't believe it my skin we would go into one i can't use my skin so we're just gonna go on easy we're just gonna go on a random seed um you know it doesn't really matter uh or apparently i can't join friends but it doesn't matter we're gonna jump on i'm gonna very quickly build myself a obsidian portal wow looks a little bit weird as well wow some of these was that how it looked back in the day i don't know if i believe this damn it's changed so much no surely not that was not how it looked i don't know i i i can't remember that far back i mean so much has gone on that was not how it looked i don't know either way let's make a nether portal because uh yeah you know what happens when you make a nether portal you go into the nether and of course now we should no longer have the um do i have a texture pack on like i don't know i'm very convinced i could have a texture pack on right now no i i think we're okay wow see what i mean it's changed a little bit maybe it's a little bit glitchy but yeah we're gonna go through to the nether wow all right wow see i don't even remember they're never looking this bad i think for whatever reason it's like some of the textures have changed a little bit but you can see we're in a a really far back version and the nether looks awful no more nether update so yeah that does mean in older updates we can actually do the older duplication glitches remember this one this one was so op boom uh hopefully we can do this very soon boom we got two of them and all we had to do was simply move inventory slot and if we go over here we're gonna make a red chocolate box right about now we're gonna go onto that one and place it down boom we got ourselves a duplicated box i mean we could totally use that one as well i miss that so much and then what i would do uh to get the normal update back is just uninstall and then reinstall again again it may go a little bit glitchy for you but for the most part i mean it took me about five or ten minutes to do it but yeah it worked after i had to restart my pc as well like i said it does get a little bit glitchy but it's all right for the most part another good idea what i'd probably do uh which i'm gonna do is i'm gonna delete these two purely for the fact i'm not using them and i'm just gonna like upload them and get them if and when i need them so right now i'm just gonna delete those because like i said i just don't need them and i'll use them if and when okay so this time it worked straight away perfectly fine i clicked it and it worked although this thing here um came up uh this is a complete lie why are you lying to me microsoft just yeah i have no idea i've never had that before maybe that's something to do with this process i'm not quite sure once you've re-downloaded it of course all your like settings your button layout and stuff you'll have to redo that again but for the most part you should be on the latest update again uh of course if you uh do what i did again i've got this device outdated a little bit glitchy because i know that's a complete lie uh we're gonna go ahead and just go like this and you can see we're on the latest update again you can see my settings are completely changed again gonna have to go uh through there throw full screen on and also let's go and turn that music right off um also my skin you'll have to upload your skins and emotes again but that is exactly how you go back updates in the bedrock edition again i do hope that this video has helped you out i will catch you on the next one", "F4o2L9f2e54": "Fast food items have the ability to become major hits like the Big Mac or the Baconator however sometimes the choices fast-food restaurants make are more flopper than whopper what did you get that gave it to me here are some of those very epic fails the 10 biggest fast-food failures of all time long john silver's big catch meal welcome aboard the ship of this seafood monstrosity was added to the Long John Silver's menu in 2013 it contained a 7.5 ounce piece of haddock served with a pile of onion rings and a side of hush puppies Long John Silver's described the meal as the largest fish we have ever offered and claimed it was a game-changer the big catch meal was launched in May and was discontinued by August of that same year due to a significant backlash it turns out that Long John Silver's was also serving up a shockingly unhealthy amount of calories and fat the big catch meal contained more trans fats and the average person should eat in two weeks a lot of this was attributed to the fact that these items were cooked up in a big vat of partially hydrogenated frying oil by the end of 2013 Long John Silver's agreed to look into new oil for their fryers that would replace hydrogenated oil in their restaurants this meal was actually panned as the worst restaurant meal in America by the Center for Science and the public interest well that's hardly the image we want for Long John Silver's Pizza Hut's gourmet rebrand gourmet cooking for you Pizza Hut is basically known for serving greasy cheesy pizza but in 2014 after declining sales they decided they wanted to appeal to foodie Millennials and updated their menu to include new artisan options they dubbed this rebrand flavor of now some of these artisan toppings included honey sriracha sauce Peruvian cherry peppers and Asiago crust the company even reached out to some of the more trendy food trucks in New York City to help suggests many flavors and items that would appeal to the hip foodies out there expecting someone with some sort of vehicle though not this however at the end of May 2014 the CEO of Pizza Hut's parent company Yum Brands incorporated admitted at a conference in New York City that the rebrand was not working that's a terrible call what was once referred to as the biggest rebrand in the company's history was now the biggest flaw they'd seen at least in a long time it turns out that they neglected one major thing their target audience just wanted cheap greasy pizza within a year Pizza Hut ended up making a complete reversal back to their original menu McDonald's Pizza big jaws has lots stuff for dinner like you family size pizzas with the rise of pizza chains at this time the company decided it wanted to tap into this corner of the dinner food market and introduced their own pizza by the early 1990s McDonald's implemented it in a portion of their Canadian and American locations Pizza time however there were a lot of complications that came with this decision first there was an equipment issue the McDonald's Pizza required a new oven to cook which was designed to quickly cook pizza dough from frozen within six minutes [Music] it meant that every single restaurant location would have to obtain a new oven and find room for it in their kitchen next there was a drive-thru issue the box is designed for the pizza didn't fit through the window which meant that they had to be expanded that called for more renovations the pizza also took a total of 11 minutes to cook and prepare which is way too long to keep up with drive-through times people frequently had to pull over and wait a long time for their pizzas not only was this a flop but it a girder pizza chains and prompted them to create smear campaign style ads against McDonald's that was like watching Ronald not on eat a cheeseburger off the grimace Burger Kings Halloween whopper gene Suzie flavorful with just a hint oh wow in 2015 Burger King was consumed by the Halloween spirit it resulted in the Halloween whopper being added to the menu it was your average whopper but it was served on a spooky black bun to achieve the dark hue the buns were infused with a1 steak sauce the burger itself also came in a cute mummy themed wrapper as an added bonus it turns out that the burger was more nightmare-inducing than anticipated welcome to my world customers began to report that the black whopper was turning their poop green and not just any green neon green the reason for this was the dye in the sauce however according to some nutritionists a typical serving of a1 steak sauce doesn't contain enough dye to have this effect the consensus was that Burger King was clearly using a concentrated version in their buns now the green poop wasn't really a health hazard it just came as more of a shock to people who were not mentally prepared for the experience Domino's Oreo dessert pizza cookies the best 2007 was an interesting year I phone for 399 you could order a giant Pizza sized cookie from Domino's it was served as an Edition with any purchase the Oreo dessert pizza consisted of a warm giant chocolate chip cookie slathered in Oreos and super sweet sticky vanilla syrup most people agreed that this concoction was way too sweet and also too chewy according to some reviews the cookie portion was also pretty bland it's that signature creamy filling that we really care about so when you take it out of the equation it's not the same overall it was unappealing and didn't last very long on the menu while Domino's has developed a substantial reputation for affordable pizza delivery over the years it has never really been known for its deserts it seems as though they've taken the hint after trying to launch other types of dessert pizzas over the years the company has seemingly decided to stick with brownies Cinna Stix and lava cake for the time being eat a pizza once in a while McDonald's spaghetti McDonald's new pasta dinners with your favorite meatballs in the 1970s McDonald's decided to develop mix spaghetti the dish was long spaghetti noodles covered in marinara sauce topped with shredded cheese and served in a cardboard container in the late 1980s and early 1990s McDonald's decided to give it another try they launched mix spaghetti in some locations across the United States mostly the south don't you like spaghetti and meatballs huh this time they tried a few varieties including lasagna and fettuccine alfredo these products were launched in those locations to be tested over the course of a year but like the mick pizza people do not go to McDonald's for Italian food this item was taken off the menu pretty quickly still McDonald's did try to bring back their mix spaghetti in other locations around the world you can try it yourself but you have to go to the Philippines to get it out of you Burger Kings satis fries it's time to get satisfied in 2013 Burger King decided they needed to cater to a more health-conscious audience in North America and decided that the best way to do this was to release healthier fries hmm this organic the Burger King saddest fries were made with a type of batter that was designed to absorb less of the frying oil this way they wouldn't contain as much fat as regular fries the results were fries that were only four grams less in fat than the regular fries and still contained 270 calories in a small serving only about 70 calories less than regular fries according to some reports many customers started calling them saddest fries let's face it when you're hungry for french fries you don't care about calorie content I want high cholesterol I would and butter and buckets of cheese okay because you know you're not making a healthy choice to begin with for example even though McDonald's has released a lot of healthier options their biggest sellers are still french fries and burgers Burger King's top seller is still the whopper within a year Burger King started discontinuing these satis fries from their menu and went back to the good old greasy fries people know and love Dairy Queen's Brie's come on I'll treat you to a Dairy Queen just like Burger King Dairy Queen also decided to try to appeal to more health-conscious customers in 1990 Dairy Queen launched the breeze it was basically a blizzard made from frozen yogurt instead of ice cream it lasted about a decade before the company finally pulled the plug and discontinued it not like this the problem was that it just didn't sell some employees actually stated that the frozen yogurt supply in the store would often go bad or expire before they could sell any of it one of the issues could be that a frozen yogurt based blizzard still isn't actually healthy especially when you mix in a bunch of candies and chocolates that completely defeat the purpose of a healthier base it was technically lower in calories than a regular blizzard but still had a ton of them when the mix-ins were added or perhaps the problem is that Dairy Queen was too early and they're thinking I really want to sort of make a healthy low-fat or nonfat now frozen yogurt chains are incredibly popular and people enjoy turning to this alternative as a healthier way to enjoy a cool dessert cannot come to Robbie I only have enough money for me and Joe Taco Bell's seafood salad during the 1980s the restaurant chain best associated with stoners and post bar runs decided to try to invent a healthy seafood item to compete with these successful fillet a fish at McDonald's in this vintage commercial for the concoction you can clearly see that they are trashing the competition by implying that ordering fish at a fast food chain isn't real fish ironic pretty good coming from a chain that is constantly under scrutiny for the quality of its beef now the more logical solution to compete with the seafood market would have just been to introduce fish tacos however Taco Bell decided they were going to do something completely different and decided on a salad instead Ron would you like some salad the Taco Bell seafood salad contained a mixture of typical salad vegetables topped with shrimp white fish and snow crab extra toppings also included cheese and olives and in taco bell style the whole thing was served inside an edible taco shell Bowl does anyone really want seafood when they go to Taco Bell it turns out the answer is no because this item was discontinued Wendy's super bar you eat all that I won't when you think of a salad bar and buffet style experience you don't typically think about Wendy's but back in the 80s and 90s they gave it a go with their super bar basically this was a big self-serve buffet bar that featured salads fruit Mexican food and pasta the pasta section included two types of pasta with sauce options and garlic bread made from hamburger buns in the Mexican section where nachos refried beans and a build-your-own taco bar then dessert was a choice between chocolate or vanilla pudding the super bar cost about $2.99 per person about 540 today after inflation which if you ask us is a steal and a lot of other people thought so too in fact so many people loved the idea that Wendy's really couldn't keep up with running a buffet and still preparing their regular orders they now had to do their usual job with the added responsibilities of cleaning restocking and preparing foods for the super bar not to mention it's probably not very profitable to be charging that little when you know that people are going back for as many helpings as they can face deep and abusing that free refill policy by 1998 the super bar was discontinued although some locations still carried it until 2006 this is the gentleman help

"5qkp9e-7FVY": "hey guys it's phoenix i saw this reddit post by 39 cookies i'll leave it in the description of this video i thought nausea 2 it's not achievable but what if i actually went into the code and changed it to allow that to happen for instance if you give yourself nausea 100 in the game nothing actually changes because the integer has to be changed in the code i'm going to show you the code just for a split second because i want to share with you what i can actually do so the integer i in this case actually modifies how fast you want the screen to flip around there are a couple of other things i can change in this case i can change the rotation of the screen and i can change the scaling i'm not going to change the scaling because the screen will actually disappear so the speed is now set to 20 and let's see what happens so the immediate thing you'll notice is that it is a little bit faster than the original speed and with the effect peaks it just reaches the maximum rotation the maximum scale doesn't change anything else so now it's at 10 000 and let's see what happens the screen begins to shake it's as if the entire world is shaking and it's like an earthquake now i do want to mention that i have seen someone try this before on the bedrock platform this is definitely impossible to achieve in java but if it is possible in bedrock please let me know by the way just a quick aside this is what happens when speed is zero the screen slowly stretches out but that's it it does not return back to whatever and start waving the screen around this is what it's like to play with nausea zero kind of so now this is the bit of the video where it may make you feel a little bit nauseous so i've allowed the nausea effect to completely distort the entire screen at an amplification of one million now i haven't changed the speed so you can actually see the entire extent of what's about to happen so effect at s nausea and now here we go take a look at what happens at 1 million so the entire screen can rotate so it's pushing you back pushing you forward it's not even just rotating from left to right it's bringing the camera back and forth now this isn't possible in vanilla at all because it doesn't allow any sort of distortion in that way it's just from left to right kind of the slowest level it's the default level actually but imagine what happens when i make even the speed one million so the scaling is the same i will change it a little bit just before i change the speed but this is what it feels like to play and i can actually move around a little bit um the position of the player stays the same so you can look down the waviness is not changing the position of the player it's completely visual but um just imagine playing it like this completely impossible uh it's kind of fun it's like you're swimming uh in land well look at the villager very skinny but still normal just try and like hit the slide i hit the slime okay so here it is with a little bit of scaling but as you can see the screen just begins to wipe itself off the map so not exactly playable like this it's almost as if the the render distance has been cut to zero or even in half scaling doesn't really do anything for this effect so i'm gonna turn it off so to put it all together one million speed one million rotation on all axes this is what it's like i don't know why i have oh because i killed the slime complete chaos oh no the slime get out of it get out of the screen okay so now it's like the earthquake effect but this is what it's like and um you can still play you can kind of make out what's happening and where you are like i'm walking right in between the two farms but this does not like it at all and uh even with no kind of detail on the screen you can see the horizon just shaking back and forth so um nausea 1 million so minecraft in a way you've never seen it before thank you for watching leave a like subscribe for more creative content if you have any suggestions for things like this let me know in the comments it seems there are so many things in this game that i haven't even looked at with all this code in front of me so point me in that direction take care [Music] [Music] you", "vQIuGSf0Fwc": "[Music] welcome back everyone my name is echo and I hope you're having a great day we're back a Minecraft Pocket Edition the bedrock version because today in this video we're gonna be seeing how realistic we can make this version now there's a lot of talk at the moment in the community with like shaders and making minecraft a beautiful we know the super duper graphics pack has now been cancelled our IP in the comments and recently they announced ray-tracing coming to minecraft the bedrock version or TX on so I thought let's do a little bit venturing and see how realistic we can make this current version of Minecraft at this moment now a big shout out to adventure gaming HQ because he did something very similar to this and I checked it out and I was like at what point is minecraft too realistic and starting to look absolutely terrible now everything you need to download is down below in the description there's three things in today's video you are going to need I'm doing this on iOS today this is a version 1.12 have not tried this in beta have not tried this on Windows 10 and have not tried this on Android or Xbox feel free to try it for yourself and if you do it it works or it doesn't let me know down below in the comment section so we go to play we have realistic minecraft and you can see the small thumbnail it is quite beautiful so in this world I have it's no behaviour packs I'll needed for this by the way it's all resource packs we have three different things now adventure gaming used natural and s3d pack i've added another addition which is the ascension HD and it does make things look a little bit better so all three of these are down below in the description if you want to make things look exactly like I have today then you're gonna have to download these some of the file sizes are quite big now I'm using an iPad pro and I use this iPad specifically for gaming so I know that I haven't got a problem with memory if you're really limited on memory yeah you probably best not check in this out so yeah tip tip top tip tip tip tip make sure you have experiments of gameplay on a lot of things like this need the experimental gameplay so I recommend testing this in a private world before you go to your everyday world but I have a question for all of you and I wanted to leave a comment down below in fact I got a couple of questions one do you install shaders for this version of Minecraft and - do you use any texture packs for this version of Minecraft if I had the choice to install just anything that changes minecraft view it would just be a beautiful skies beautiful skies on its own just because I'm not a big lover of shaders anyway let's go into gamer let me show you how realistic minecraft can actually be so for me the number one thing that I love about this pack is is the water the water on this version of Minecraft has changed quite a lot over the years it's become more improved more impressive but the thing that you're mainly focusing on this is the blocks in kind of how they stand out like this stuff looks like cheese it's like grainy I feel like if I rub my face along this I'm gonna get like a sand burn but the whole point of this pack is to make things stand now I think things look a lot better further away than they do close up and I've noted this stone and from a distance it actually looks like bedrock dude I love this though because it actually comes with shadows I think that's like a big thing what wait wait wait wait does it actually come with shadows on your player if we got a video and we change this to third person behind is there any shadow no we still got circles wait that's illegal there is their circles in Minecraft my favorite thing about stuff like this it has to be the sky I'm a sucker for a beautiful sky in Minecraft that I don't know why for me this game is quite bright if you ever want some absolutely realistic grass this is what you're going for okay I see that all right that stands out a little bit more one thing I have noticed though is the trees and the vines kind of really do not go together at all right I see a village in the distance so let's go and see if anything's over there with the blocks so the closer I get there's a couple of changes that I've noticed look at the logs dude what is that that's that is quite strange to say the least and also the cobble is it weird that I actually really like the look of the cobble on this one I don't know what's going on with the logs they definitely don't blend in together and what is this dude there's some really strange luck in wood blocks oh these look pretty fancy I feel like this pack has been ported from PC and it's not quite working for this version of Minecraft I'll tell you what though this is maybe a grass path that is some serious mud going on there so you got grass block you've got the path block but you can see here the actual wood itself I mean it's impressive don't get me wrong because going back like a couple of months ago and a year ago things like this would definitely not be possible on this version of Minecraft I think all we also need to do is I need to make it nighttime but before we actually do that let's grab a couple of blocks more inventory and see what they look like so my block of choice to start off with is this wooden one now I'm usually a massive lover of oak but that looks quite interesting why is it got like bullet holes in it dude they are some serious bullet holes somebody's been shooting up the village what block is that is that actually oh that's gonna be concrete isn't it I don't think every block in this needs to fully stand out we've also got a couple of fences here I went with stone brick because they actually look I actually really strangely liked the stone stone brick ones they stand out a lot more they're more like bevel embossed so this one is brick walls go away cat you know invited stay out we have ourselves some stairs for some reason I oddly like that and then we can enter like the sandstone stuff where things become really weird they become this is cut sandstone why is it all grainy here it's like they smooth the sides and thought you know what forget about the top of it we have ordinary bricks who hey hey you're gonna build a house this is how your bricks are gonna look if we got a monster spawner I don't think this one's changed well I even noticed if you look at the look at the spawn egg in your hand they actually went ahead and made that somewhat kind of 3d styled as well all right maybe we should check out some blocks and also some ores hold on a second I forgot to show you guys the actual inside of the logs they've changed to represent what a real tree would look like in the center that is actually quite impressive to be honest with you this texture is like I'm pretty good it looks like when you pull a massive chocolate bar inside of a bowl and you mix it all up and then it's gone hard it actually looks like a chocolate brownie these ones looks like oh these are stripped that's why all right we don't want the strip ones we want the logs so this is the one that we see in the village built out of this strangeness dude what is that what is that I mean come on I love realistic Minecraft but this is like a whole nother level I feel like they're taking the whole realistic Ness too far however this one looks pretty good the the bench one looks pretty good what does this one this one's a jungle its jungle this one's the acacia one and then last but not least we also have the dark oak as well okay I can see what they've tried to do there out of all of them let me know in the comments section which one you like best the spruce ones like above and beyond dude this looks nothing like these ones maybe some of the textures that I'm using are also playing a big factor in this so I did see a couple other blocks while browsing and showing you this one's got the creeper face on now this one's pretty good because of course this is the kind of block that's already indented anyway I said as a normal minecraft player so that looks pretty cool we got this one which is I think it's just ordinary sandstone yeah it's ticking sandstone a little bit too far we have slime blocks why did they make them it's literally moldy cheese they made moldy cheese in Minecraft anyway we then move on to the ores experience dude that is that is really hard on the eyes diamond might look good in this that's gold they're obviously all going to be the same that's Dimond because that's how diamonds probably go and even I actually would be found in the F score anyway we got lapis this one looks pretty cool looks like someone's to spray it water on it we've also got redstone as well and then last but not least we have ourselves some emeralds ones as well cause on the next level I'm pretty sure this would look pretty good when you find it in a cave as well we would do some cave exploring but let's bring out the actual blocks of iron gold etc so you know you might not be able to fully tell but the sword is slightly been bossed as well I can't really see it maybe maybe if I throw it on the floor I look a little bit different do you look different slightly you can dude I didn't want to do that you can see it in there in the middle if we just furthest on the floor if you look in the middle of the sword you can see it's been slightly changed but hey we got some blocks of this stuff as well so we've got block of gold block of iron that looks like a radiator we've got the emerald one this is the diamond one I think that's gonna be the most impressive we have the lapis lazuli pillar quartz quartz pillar pillar quartz and then we've got chiseled as well oh my god it looks like it looks like an adventure that's amazed right there so let's make it nighttime again the sky is beautiful and the sky works really well let's try a couple of different items that actually bring out a night sky and see how that looks first off though it does look pretty impressive so we got ourselves a torch and I think this pack in this whole everything I'm showing you today today it's gonna look well better at nighttime we've got a block of lava as well I'm pretty sure mr. Skelly bones over here I won't mind if we just light him up a little bit no you know okay goodbye goodbye alright well he's not gonna be doing that so lava looks pretty cool that's quite bright we'll have to go into a cave as well I'm really curious as to how a cave looks we got our redstone lamp now ooh that does stand out pretty well as well I think they look a lot better a little bit further back the closer you get the more you're like it's not that great that's almost oh I don't even check this block from before throughout this one's quite standing out ish as well wait this lanta there's a jack-o'-lantern as well so we just type in LAN Tim I probably know that's a echo lanten so jack-o'-lantern this doesn't really stand out it would have been really good if that was like carved to stand out so how realistic can minecraft actually get before it is too realistic last thing I want to do is I'll try and find a cave system and see what it would be like if you were exploring a cave so I'm in a ravine and the experience actually is it's quite good actually it looks like this has been carved out with some kind of machinery and I think that's the whole intention of this I didn't realize the mushrooms had changed as well we'll go up here a little bit Danny problem is that we don't really have like a deep dark cave so have to try and find one of them I didn't even think about obsidian as well I like the water flow though that does work pretty well on that is gravel maybe they actually look like coffee beans or little pebbles actually so this is going to be a better example going down into a deep dark cave which is actually filled with water in here I'll tell you what though the experience down here is it's it's quite a nice ambience I kind of like that strangely enough I think this looks pretty cool to be honest with you all right let's go over further down see what else we can find in here I mean yeah I like this alone oh well you guys but I think it looks pretty cool inside of a deep dark cave it just keeps going down so I think the mining experience will be pretty ok I kind of weirdly like the stone if you hated it then this most definitely would not be a pack for you I also like the just about how the emit that how much light is emitted it's not a super lot but it still looks pretty cool so the question I have for you guys is is this something that you would use something you would not use it's a very different experience and I've never ever seen something like this so I thought let's try and make minecraft as real as we can I love the sky though but guys have a great taste they beautiful all the downloads all below if you are installing this I used all three downloads below and enabled them all so have a great day and I catch you next time [Music]", "29YUSJ1u4rc": "[Music] we you you guys don't you guys aren't saying anything this definitely isn't a chocolate candy bar uh I mean that isn't a little dirt bar than I I made an itch it's dirt dirt not chocolate yeah definitely not chocolate there's no evidence there's no evidence you can't prove it was jacket so we're gonna put the dirt the chocolate or whatever but no it's definitely not chocolate but first we gotta make the Shh dirt you gotta make the dirt dirt peoples first we gotta make the little dirt imprint like people trampled it trampled it it's it's dirt next we got to make it look like a shot dark bar and sorry for you air but listeners if you guys are listening that might be in here next we got to make the chocolate bar dirt bar wrapper definitely jock dirt dirt there's no evidence Sturt next you want to make the full wrapper for the shrub dirt bar that's dirt dirt track I did say if they don't worry but next when you make the little outline to make it look like the chocolate bar dirt bar Oh [Music] since I didn't actually put it up on the little wall the chocolate dirt bar can go right there next to my cake no I'm gonna eat it so bad just notice pretty much everything I have is either with a black outline most of its - well first you lie to you anymore this is really good chocolate I'm gonna go eat my chocolate and weakness anything we have to figure out how to make marshmallows now and Bram crackers don't sell anyone I was eating chocolate", "coXQP7Ug8Os": "[Music] hey guys banks Boyer back with another video and today I'm going to be showing you how to build a happy chocolate bar inside of Minecraft so for this build you were going to eat whoa so you need some purple some magenta will some blue some weight whoa some brown wool and some grey wool so let's jump into it so first of all you're going to take the purple wool and you're going to build a roll five for the base on the chocolate bar make I'll take your magenta bow and put it in the three minutes okay that's not thirty five so I did four back st. you take magenta and put three in the middle and then build up the side by 5 so it should be firefighter gentle but before you do that go to the back and build up so you can't see it the magenta because if you look it from the back and you see the magenta and stuff it just looks a little bit nicer without it showing through the back so once you built this up which I just finished doing you're going to do the logo so you're gonna take your blue ball this is just a logo that I've I think looks pretty cool you don't have to do you can do no logo if you want birds across in the middle of it then you're gonna build up but one more with your purple and then down on the back you're going to build a wall so it's three thick all the way up until it's level with the top of the build so like like that so then we are going to want to come take your purple wool and build up by three like this then that should be done there we're gonna do the same at the back like this this is what your chocolate bar should look like right now so now what you're going to want to do the face and I've just realized something I've forgotten the black hole for the peoples of the eyes so for the eyes you're gonna go to the side and engrave the same shape as I am into his face make two P two holes for people's and then for the mouth you're gonna cut into the middle my one block when I put the mouth going up to say they accidentally break that off that is the face for a chocolate bar so now you're going to build up by another layer now we're going to be moving on to the chocolate so you gonna take a brown wall in the center over these boxwood three and build that up by seven up by seven then this work so that Clegg doesn't quite look like a chocolate bar so far and look like a memory stick so we're gonna do is you're going to take your purple wool and you're going to build a base around the bottom a little bit up there right for detail and just put the base around the bottom do the same on the other side if you really want to build up like that yeah that's what it should look like and then you go in the back build the base all around the back then what you need to do is usually same thing on the other side so should look like this and then you are done with this part so now you're gonna do the wrapper wait to build out by one now you're going to die out gonna be down by one so should little a this so far then you're gonna take your purple bowl and build two like that go down and then build like that and then for extra detail you can take out your brown bull and I'd like good looks chocolate and then we can take out your gray wool and add stuff for the wrapper so then you can add that there if you really want that is the wrapper wait call them I know that's supposed to be anyway okay that's what she looked like just like this yes so move all that one so then you're gonna see these new box up here got a break though so it's like someone's taking a bite into the chocolate bar and then you can add for extra detail maybe some wrapper down there and maybe the same on the other side and that is your chocolate bar done so why don't we get a little bit of a 360 view of it that's the front that's one side of it right here go around and see the back of it the wrapper the other side I've gotta fill in and now this is the front so that is your chocolate bar done unfortunately guys that's all we have time for today but don't worry I'll be posting another video tomorrow so stay tuned for that until then I will see you in the next one goodbye [Music]", "we6fO7eHwkw": "Hey buzy beez it's Dzung and today I wanted to share with you some Valentine's Day gifts that you can make for your friends. Everybody loves chocolate right and Recently I found this chocolate shop in LA called Compartes oh my gosh They have like the best chocolate. They have dark chocolate that they mix with circus animals fruits whiskey just really fun things but They're kind of pricey one bar like this is like ten dollars So I was really inspired by all of their flavors then I thought hey Let's do a DIY version and have some fun with it so today. I'm gonna show you how to make chocolate bars with pretzels circus animals and fruits with roses Yep, fruit with roses rose petals are edible anyways if you guys are excited to make your own Valentine's Day gifts be sure to hit that subscribe button if you want to see more fun ideas and Don't forget to give this video a big thumbs up. I'll go ahead and get started with melting my chocolate So for this recipe you can use your favorite chocolate bar I'm using Ghirardelli, and I tend to like my chocolate kind of dark So this is 72% cacao the one from Compartes is   70% cacao you can find chocolates Good quality chocolates pretty much anywhere nowadays. I recommend Ghirardelli TCHO which is like a Bay Area company. Oh, what else is good vo is good and then Lindt is also pretty good, too You can find them pretty much anywhere, but I tend to shy away from milk chocolate because I find it to be too sweet But if that's your thing then hey go for it So to melt our chocolate I'm gonna start by doing a bain-marie here I have just a medium saucepan with a little bit of water at the bottom You don't want to fill it up too high, and I'm gonna bring it to a light boil once it reaches a light boil I'll turn off the heat and then I'll put This steel bowl directly on top you don't want the bowl to be touching the water because could scorch the chocolate Now I'll just take my chocolate break him into small pieces Drop them in the bowl And I'll just let it sit until it's melted about two-thirds of the way through and then I'm gonna swirl it with my spatula Alright our chocolate is looking good. I learned from a fellow co-worker at sunset who is also a pastry chef And she taught me how to melt chocolate correctly Basically you just take a spatula and you swirl in one direction so clockwise and scrape the bottom so that it's nice and smooth and That's it it looks beautiful Alright, so now. I'm ready to pour this into my molds, but first. I wanted to show you guys the silicone molds I'll link is in the description box below. You can get like a 2-pack for $10, so it's pretty cheap so the first one I'm gonna make is circus animals with sprinkles Honestly, this is great for Valentine's Day for kids and their classmates But I think I'm gonna make these for Erisy's first birthday favors They're so cute, and I love how they turned out so while I was testing the recipes There's a few tips that I want to give you before we get started the bottom of our chocolate Bowl Is full of water the first time I did this I didn't think about the condensation at the bottom And it spilled into my chocolate mold, and it kind of ruined it so before you start Remove the bowl and just wipe the bottom To get rid of any water, so it does not spill into your mold What's nice and clean, so now we're just gonna pour in a little bit just to cover the bottom This looks good so any leftover chocolate. Just go ahead and put it back on to the pot Because you want to keep it melted still for the next few chocolates Now with my small offset spatula. I'm gonna spread the chocolate to make it even I'll just give it a quick shake so that it levels out look at that So per day and now for the fun part. We start decorating Here I got some Classic circus animals, and I'm just gonna out randomly place them switch off between every other color and Last one a camel. I think this is my favorite shape in the circus animal cookie farm Now with the empty negative chocolate space we're gonna fill it in with tons of sprinkles here I just have some rainbow sprinkles And I'll just toss them in And That's it doesn't it look so festive and fun I'm gonna let it sit here for a few minutes Just so it kind of solidifies enough so that I can move it into the fridge So I've moved our circus animals sprinkle chocolate bar into the fridge, and I'm just gonna let it set for about 15 minutes Just until it's nice and firm Moving on we're gonna be making Compartes' probably their best seller at least that's what they told me   chocolate and pretzels So I've already broken up the pretzels into pieces You watch as varying sizes if you guys want to use those classic twisty Pretzels, that's totally fine, too if you are to use if you were to use those though. I would just leave them whole Alright again with our chocolate wipe the bowl Look how smooth that is So pretty now I don't want to fill the mold all the way through because as you add the pieces of pretzels or just our toppings in general the Chocolate could overflow, so I just want to leave a little bit of room and then using my offset spatula I'll move it around again and then we'll just sprinkle in our pretzel pieces I Like to add a little bit of the crumbs just so it adds a little bit of interesting Patterns to this alright so once I'm done sprinkling the pretzels. I'm just gonna give the chocolate mold a shake to even everything out now I'll just let it sit for a few minutes to firm up at the bottom, and then I'm gonna put it in the fridge Too so last but not least this one's probably the most fancy bougie one out of all of them Guys take notes because it includes everything that a lady would want gold roses berries chocolates You'll win some good points on this one alright so here I have my mold laid out and then I'm just gonna add my chocolate I Forgot to wipe the bowl and this is what happens there's a drop of water, but luckily it did not get into my mold Spread our chocolate out Give it a shake If it goes on to the mold like this don't worry about it cuz later when you break the chocolate it'll separate so first I'm gonna sprinkle some gold dust if you guys have like edible gold you can totally place it on too But I like the gold dust and that's all I have so I'll add a little bit to my strainer The goal just gives it a very pretty shimmer I got this at Michael's, but you can get at pretty much any craft stores now. I'm gonna layer on some freeze-dried strawberries I Like finding round ones with an eye like this cuz it looks really interesting just place it randomly and Then I have little pieces of freeze-dried raspberries that I've broken up into smaller pieces, and I'm just gonna sprinkle it around Finally I'm gonna sprinkle a little bit of rose petals Aren't they so pretty I actually got I? Actually got this in the spice aisle at world market it comes in this pretty Purplish color that I think goes so well with our bar our chocolate bar Smells so good - it's like potpourri You guys know the drill let it sit for a couple minutes, and then we'll pop it into the fridge so Here are our finished products the chocolate has set and The sprinkles some of them might be loose, but that's okay just shake it off But pretty much everything has stuck to the chocolate. It's so pretty this one is my Favorite look how interesting it looks it looks like a piece of art But I love how the speckles of gold just kind of shows through and then the Roses I actually Really appreciate that the roses weren't pink or red and that they were purple Just because it gives a little more interest to our design all right now I'm just gonna carefully peel our chocolate off. I really like these silicone molds because it makes it a lot easier to do this It's flexible And look at the back It's nice and shiny Gorgeous Okay now I'm going to show you guys how I would package them up to give as gifts here, I got some gold foil I got them off of Amazon make sure you're buying food-grade foil because there were some that weren't just Measure it to be the width of the chocolate bar Getting crafty today I'll place my chocolate bar in the middle of the foil Actually, I think I will flip this around Cover it Wrap it like a neat little package You can probably make the length a little longer just so it folds down here, but I miscalculated. That's okay. I Just realized this is my first time doing Arts and crafts or crafty things on the channel and as you can see I am NOT very crafty. That's my sister's Department growing up   Okay and then now to What I think I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna cut the paper just so that it barely covers The size of the chocolate bar so I think right here is good And what would be really neat is that this can double as your Valentine's Day card so I can write a little message in here. See who should I give this to I? Guess Nate or Erisy no she can't eat it yet. Let's write to Nate. Dear Husband I love you Happy Valentine's Day Okay, so the note will go inside so using our pretty side, and we'll face it down And then we'll just wrap our chocolate And Then if you guys wanted to add fun design I have hearts here that I've already cut that you can just glue on and Our chocolate bar is done What you guys think of my arts and crafts project? I definitely know that the chocolate is awesome, but I could use some work in the craft department I know This is not my area of expertise Anyways, I hope you guys enjoyed our chocolate bar inspirations today So I'll have the step-by-step tutorial listed on my blog at honeysucklecatering.com which is powered by? Squarespace if you guys are interested in creating your own online store website or even blog head over to Squarespace.com where you can get a 14-day trial if you guys are ready to start your blog I have a coupon code for you in the link in the description box below Thank you to Compartes for giving me the inspiration.

Bye", "JkdASL4ox8s": "this is EU I stream Dixie looks pretty cool but pro-gamer 27 doesn't think so please make you feel better and followers Instagram and Twitter hey what's up guys ey scream back here was another minecraft video and today guys I'm gonna showing you how you can make it actually work in coffee machine in my crop with no mods or add-ons that's not guys 100% vanilla minecraft and the best part is dude it's gonna work with any version of Minecraft whether you're on switch playstation xbox pc tablet iPhone iPad whatever it is this is going to work for you guys so it's gonna be absolutely and say so you know when you've been mining all night long and you're tired and you wake up the next Minecraft and you're like oh yeah and you're like a literal walking zombie you go ahead and make yourself some nice minecraft coffee drink it up and be like look man you are ready to play Minecraft again guys and you will be awakened if you don't like coffee well then this is a working old chocolate machine it can be either one guys it is really awesome because you know hot chocolate and coffee are kind of that same brownie color like poop color wait why don't we drink hot chocolate and coffee if it looks like poop color I don't know that's a question for another day I guess we go ahead and get straight into this build guys so if you are excited make sure to go down below drop a like guys that'll be absolutely insane you know what I want you guys to get a cup of some sort this is my challenge to you guys if you guys are able to get like a coffee cup or a mug and hit the like button make it start blue using a cup guys now I don't know whether I am you know I'm pretty lazy so I don't think I would ever do that but if any of you guys are actually able to do that let me know in the comments down below I'll be kind of impressed cuz I don't even know whether you can hit the like button with the coffee cups layout touchscreen words I don't know but that's my chance you guys enjoy to do that guys and you know if you're able to do it I might leave I love hot on your coming and of course guys if you wanted to channel welcome hope you having a wonderful day as always make sure to go ahead and stop coming into little by canceling ding ding to never miss another episode that'll be absolutely insane guys but you know I'm done and I'm talking you're probably sick of my voice by now I'm sorry oh just what you love ok whatever guys we go ahead and start building this coffee machine now the first thing we're gonna need to do is obviously kind of build like a makeshift kitchen or a makeshift house because you know I'd be pretty weird if we just felt a copy machine right here in the middle of nowhere I mean that'd be pretty strange so what we're gonna do guys is good like a quick makeshift kitchen now for this you guys this is what Evers your house is like obviously if you're building a house from scratch give some really cool recommendations to you so I'm gonna go ahead and use white terracotta as the ground and red terracotta as the wall and that I'm going to make the bench out of spruce wood and spruce Ted so this is what we're gonna do just for our makeshift wall now of course guys if your house is already built and you've build it out of different materials that is fun gasps I am totally old out for that customization guys you can go ahead and pretty much make your house however you want it to look I don't really mind just whatever you think looks cool it's cool with me but I'm gonna go ahead and use these three books cuz I think they make a beautiful just an absolutely beautiful combination so we're gonna go ahead and do that and then we'll go ahead and build in our wall if I can build straight thank you alright and we're gonna go ahead now you can go ahead and you can either make this three tall or fall tall personally I prefer full tall because it just makes a cool-looking coffee machine but once again guys totally up to you so now that we've done that we're gonna go ahead and build our quick bench Lugar one two we're gonna leave a space with a coffee machine right here one two three four just like that and then place Brewster's all across here so now that we've got kind of a makeshift bench we're gonna go ahead and start making this working a coffee machine in Minecraft I'm also gonna show you a few different customizations for it so make sure to stick around till the end so guys for this you're going to need a lot of stuff but we're gonna start with phase one of our coffee machine so for this you're going to need quartz Ted you're going to need a quartz slabs you're also going to need Pistons you're going to need some sort of redstone activation device so I would personally recommend using a block of redstone since that's the easiest you're going to need armor stands you're going to need a pot and you are we're going to need a flower pot so that should be somewhere Jerry is right at the bottom here guys and we are also going to need a a block of glass that's everything you're going to need for phase one of our coffee machine so in this gap that we've left guys now of course this might be in your house so whatever but you need to leave a gap and that's at least too long inside like your bench or wherever you're putting the coffee machine and you want to place a quartz slab here and then place a flowerpot facing outwards so it looks something like this now once you guys have done that you want to go ahead and place an honest and facing in this direction guys it's really important you get the direction right make sure it's facing in this direction then once you've done that you want to go ahead and hold on the arm stand to switch the position it's setting so we go one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and this is the position you're looking for now you can either have it in position 10 or position 11 it kind of depends what you like to look um I think this looks fine but uh you know what um okay we're gonna leave it in this position once you guys have done that you want to go ahead and put your flower pot there now the flower pot is as you can see going to act as the cup and this hand is going to act as the tap for our coffee machine for our coffee to come out up but it looks pretty weird at the moment cuz we just got this random arm stand dancing here so we need to go ahead and make it look more like a coffee machine to do this you want to go ahead and place an upside-down stare right here and then we're going to need to go ahead and make a double piston system to do this you want to go and dig up two blocks it replace a piston here and another piston there someone looks something like this guys once you've done that you want to grab your redstone activation device go cuddle I am that'll push that down and then one more just like that and you can destroy this and as you guys can see that well yeah it still doesn't really look like a coffee machine we gotta add one more thing you want to go ahead put a glass block up put a single piston this time and activate that push that down and as you guys can see if we go ahead and put a cork slab on top that is our coffee machine right there check it out we got a flower pot as the cup we got Cortez there and we've got a little tap and yeah it just looks really really awesome but we still have a few more details to add and then of course we have to make this actually work in game now the details I want to add is I want to add coffee beans inside this glass walking you may be thinking ear eye stroke how do I do that now hold yours guys it's very very cool and very very simple so for this step guys you are going to be armistead you're going to need cocoa beans now I know that you know you use caffeine and coffee beans to make coffee but this is the closest thing to things that look like coffee beans in Minecraft or if this is all chocolate machine well this matches perfectly and you're also going to need name tags and you're going to need an anvil guys to go ahead and grab one of those now this next step is pretty tricky so hang with me so first off we're gonna place an arm stand you and you want to go ahead and put it in the one two three four okay actually we're gonna put cocoa beans in his hand right here so you guys can see what's going on so four five six seven eight nine ten just like that guys you can have it in position ten hold position eleven just like that I think eleven looks better but it is up to you and as you guys can see the cocoa beans and now inside the glass then we're gonna put an armor stand make sure this one's facing backwards at this time guys this is important and again put cocoa beans and go one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven just like that so we've got cocoa beans inside there and finally guys we're going to Chuck another armed stand at the back here so you want to take down so it is the same level as the other Armistead's we placed and place it make sure it is facing it this way back here goes the same way we place the one inside our coffee machine put cocoa beans in his hands go one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven and then as you can see that is going to be inside our machine right there and check it out we got coffee beans inside our machine the only weird thing is we've got all these dancing armorstands around now if you like dancing our stands well you can keep them but personally I would rather they disappear so to do this guys I'm gonna jump on this side Chuck an anvil down open it up go ahead get a name tag and rename the name tag to coffee guys just like that no capitals or nothing that's super simple once you guys have that go ahead and name each of these outside arm stands coffee make sure not to name the inside one that is super important I want you guys have done that you are going to need the beautiful power of command box to go ahead and do /give @p commands a block just like this now if you don't have commands in your world this step isn't necessary you don't need coffee beans inside your machine I just think it looks cool and if you do go ahead and grab your command block now you obviously can hide this we're just gonna put this behind the wall for simplicity reasons summer go ahead put that there and then this command is super important let's switch it over to repeat then always active and this command you might even pause the video take a screenshot guys if you want to get this down so its effect and then you want to go at a brackets name equals all right just like that guys don't miss type anything like I just did you didn't see anything there guys so name equals and then you want to go ahead and smell coffee now remember guys no capitals coffee this about Co double F double E and then end brackets once you guys have done that you want to go ahead and type in visibility Goten space 10 that space true and make sure that's all good all right you can stretch on it now guys leave that and as you can see all of our armorstands have disappeared and we're left with coffee beans inside the coffee machine so it looks like the coffee beans are being spun around inside the coffee machine getting sucked up into like this little funnel and coming out the tap here into our pot now you may notice the ugly commands in the left hand side and yes I'm getting to those those are very annoying to get rid of that guys go ahead and do slash game rule and then do command a block output space false and if you guys give it a second or two that is going to disappear from your left hand side you're not gonna have that ugly text there now that we've got that guys we need to go ahead and fix up this wall so to do that go ahead and build like this grab your pistons and the redstone from earlier guys and we're going to make that exact same double piston system we did the first time so go ahead place Eh oh we need to go a little bit higher here so we're gonna go our piston of piston and then red terracotta go ahead activate activate just like that we're going to need one more piston right there and activate there we go and then this time you want to push another red terracotta and activate that and we are done fill that up and voila guys check it out we have an actual coffee machine with coffee beans inside it doesn't that look awesome I think it looks really cool it kind of looks like they're getting sucked up and as I said coming out into your cup there is one small little thing I want to add before I show you guys how you can get this to actually work and that is of course sugar because who doesn't like sugar guys so for this you're going to need some a white carpet some white wool white stain glass you're also going to need item frames so we're gonna head grab that you're going to need sugar of course you of course you gonna need sugar and we're going to also grab a button so now that we've got all of these guys what you want to do is one block because we know we have that arm stand there even though it isn't visible it's still there guys so we want to come one block across here dig out the wall place a white wall here white stain glass Chuck a white carpet on top go ahead put an iron frame out front and sugar and there we go guys we've got our iron little bugs for these sugar right there and around I think this looks really really cool guys of course obviously it's up to you whether you think it looks cool I think it does but that is our coffee machine right there now guys I'm gonna show you how you can get this to work in your very own Minecraft world now this doesn't actually need any command blocks so that is really cool especially if you are in survival so we go ahead and we're just going to extend this across cuz I thought you know it can be a little bit bigger just so it's even and my OCD doesn't die cuz you know if you guys are watching my channel you know I need everything to be said to another wise I just got yep kind of like that anyway so let's the guys have done that you want to go ahead and place your button right here now it has to be one space away because remember we've got that invisible armor stamp once you guys have done that you want to jump around the back here and you were going to need a few different things so first off this time you're going to need a sticky piston not a regular piston sticky piston guys also you're going to need to go ahead and grab a redstone block you're going to need some redstone you're also going to need a dropper and then you want to go ahead and oh you know we'll stick with this we're also going to grab one repeater and that'll be everything we need for now so we'll go ahead and grab that so you guys have done that you want to come where your button is you want to dig it down just like this and you want to place an upside-down piston and place a redstone block under here now just make sure this works guys hit your button and whoop and as you guys can see that's gonna push out redstone block down now that we know that works you want to go ahead and place redstone here just like that and you want to go directly where your coffee machine is and dig one block down right here guys and then a second block then you want to go ahead and dig under here so we're gonna go ahead and we need to connect our redstone across here guys so we'll go ahead and dig down and voila guys as you can see we have a perfect connection what you want to do is place a drop up facing upwards right here and then you can cover it up with your white terracotta or whatever your floor block is guys then you want to go ahead get redstone coming down here and file it into our dropper and just in case guys it might be a little long make sure to put a redstone repeater right next to your dropper and then you can go ahead and fill this back up with your floor block and of course guys you can go ahead and hide this with whatever you want you know as you can see you can kind of just hide this you don't have to it's just totally up to you guys you could even put this on the ground if you wanted to I'm just gonna kind of do it quick a quick little job here because we're a good time so we're gonna go ahead and do that now that we've done that guys when you press this button you can't see anything but it's actually activating the dropper here so now we need them shame to give us coffee now to do that guys you want to go ahead and choose whatever your coffee is now unfortunately we don't have coffee and minecraft guys in case you hadn't noticed so what I would recommend doing is either using milk or because you know coffee makes you like super hyper right guys I could you could also use a potion of swiftness then you want to go ahead and grab a few of those we're gonna grab some potion of swiftness we'll grab some milk here guys all right bang bang bang and then we're gonna go ahead and jump around to our anvil which I covered up that was really dumb of me but we'll jump around swear humble and what you want to do is go ahead and rename your milk to coffee and just like that or if you want it to be the potion of swiftness you can rename that to coffee as well and then you can do that for it you know how many coffees you want it's totally up to you guys so go ahead and do that and now we've got some coffee right then and once you guys have done that you want to go ahead and destroy this block where your dropper is open it up Chuck your coffee inside there and now guys check this out ready clear inventory I'm gonna switch into survival show you that in a hundred percent works ready guys we go ahead and hit the button alright hit the button please there we go and voila check it out guys I have coffee I just had to hit the button and check that out we have coffee inside our inventory and then you get our games I work in coffee machine or hot chocolate machine you can of course rename the coffee or - hot chocolate or you can also rename it to whatever drink you want it to be guys just by chucking it in and anvil guys and then putting that drink inside your dropper right here and then now whenever you come up here and you want to go ahead and get some coffee go ahead chuck some sugar in your machine go ahead hit the button and voila check it out guys this time we got our coffee that gives us our speed - and then now I'm super happy that I'm drunk Mike just kidding guys but no seriously I drank coffee before this done this video so I am a little bit tight them but anyway guys I hope you enjoyed today's tutorial learn something here if you did make sure to subscribe and if the bell icon so you can always get the coolest bestest builds before any other friends do guys and that brings us to the end of this video hope you guys did enjoy I will see you the next one - be right back [Music]", "3XrKXtWPQW4": "you guys they turned out amazing look how beautiful they are mmmmmm like smooth it's so much just like melting your novel it's amazing hey guys welcome back today I'm gonna be showing you how to replicate and infuse my favorite chocolate bar from Purdy's I don't know if there's a party's in the States but in Canada we have lots of them and they have really good chocolate and they make this amazing chocolate bar that's white chocolate with sprinkles and pop rocks and is so good it is like the best ever only difference is that ours is going to be infused with coconut oil here's what you're going to need white chocolate sprinkles pop rocks and the most important ingredient coconut oil so this is the mold I'm gonna use for my chocolate bars and I'm not sure how much chocolate I'm going to need to melt so I'm just gonna have put my little chocolate wafers in here to kind of like visualize approximately how many I'll need so I think that looks about good I might need a little bit more a little bit less so we'll find out but I just don't want to melt too many if I don't need to since this is the only mold I have for a little chocolate cute little chocolate bars so I'm just gonna put the chocolate into my Pyrex measuring cup but a bowl or anything is fine I'm just shooting to use the pirate so that I can pour it out after so I'm gonna put this in the microwave for about 45 seconds so 45 seconds is third melting a bit ruin and stir it we don't want to over melt the chocolate or it will get like chunky so you just have to melt it slowly and then stir it melt a little bit more so I'm gonna put it back in for 20 seconds that was 20 more seconds and it is perfectly melted now and then we're going to add in two tablespoons of our coconut oil so my coconut oil is just that partly room-temperature partly melted it would be best if I had this sitting on the thread shows fully melted that way I could put it into the the chocolate a little bit easier and measure it out but I just scooped it I was fine too now I shouldn't have to microwave this again because the heat from the chocolate should melt the quill but I might not do it we'll find out just keep stirring it a bit to just warm it up and melt it so I think it keeps me melted a little bit more so I'm gonna put it back in the microwave for like ten seconds and I do want to make some of my chocolate bars Oreo so I'm gonna have like a mix so I'm just gonna bring up some Oreos and add them to some of the moulds okay there is our ten seconds and you can still see little coconut chunks but I'm just kind of stirring them in and pressing my spoon against them to melt them there's still a little bit of Trump so I'm just let this sit here and melt a bit more while I put my Oreos into my bowls just gonna break them up and put them right into the mold I think that I don't know like should I do them with Oreos and sprinkles like these ones over here all gonna be the sprinkle and pop rock ones but these two I want to be Oreo but it just like should I also have sprinkles I don't know okay we'll save that to add on top okay so that those little chunks have melted a bit you can mix that in and I feel like we're probably gonna need a little more chocolate like that doesn't look like enough for all these but before I add in my sprinkles and my pop rocks I'm just gonna fill up the Oreo ones now maybe a little bit more Oreo on top I'll crush these ones a little bit finer those look good it's like cookies and cream I wish I would have crush the other ones this small kind of looks a little bit better mmm it smells like cookies and cream okay now for the other ones that I'm gonna do top rocks and sprinkles I could mix it directly in here and then pour it in but I kind of want to pour it in and then add it so we'll see how this goes I think I'm gonna have to make more anyway and obviously you can use any fillings you want like you could add any sort of like cookies you could add mint flavoring you could do like marshmallows oh you can do anything you want okay I do need a melt a little more this will just be like a mini one maybe just like those like Hershey bars you get a Halloween okay now I'm gonna add the pop rocks cotton candy how good is that gonna be with this is anybody else is just like love cotton candy flavored things like what do you have flavor is cotton candy I just feel like it's sweet flavor okay it's open these up let's see what color they are okay so they're pink I would have liked it they weren't pink to be honest because like I really want to see them but they might blend damn with the sprinkles so we should probably be fine today I'm just gonna kind of like mix them in like how much do we want it there you'll see a man sprinkles now sprinkles are the best part I like lots of Franco I like the crunch of them in there and we're just gonna mix them in again my god this looks so good so I filled up my molds with chocolate and put my toppings in them and then I'm just gonna put them in the fridge for like I don't know 20 minutes 30 minutes we'll find out how long it takes alright guys they've been in the fridge for about half an hour and they are ready to come out so we're just going to pop them on out of their molds but we're gonna do it gently so we don't break the chocolate while it's coming up guys they turned out amazing look how beautiful they are okay the best part tasting them ah mm-hmm-hmm oh we have the extra sprinkles hmm yes oh these are so good they're almost better than the one from Perry which is weird cause like I use pretty cheap chocolate but I'm thinking the coconut oil being added like smooth it so much just like melt in your mouth is amazing thank you guys so much for watching please leave a comment give us a thumbs up and subscribe and I hope you have a wonderful day [Music]", "6ssZuLvWmok": "hey guys this is yum yum cakes here and we're going to be playing some master builders and what the game is about if you don't know about it because it's a really new game is it's you're just um a builder and you want to it says what you're gonna have to build and so you have to build that with all this stuff and there's all these characters so yeah we'll just get started it is awesome so i'm right in front of it the portal but we're not going to support i'm just going to click on it and pick one and my jungle hideout i like that map a lot okay i'll do this one where is one that actually lets me in like not all of them were full i do not know why i'm just gonna pick up these milk watermelons that somebody forgot to get so monster builders there's only one kid and that's the kid that i have and everybody has that kit because it's only good there is you come with it chocolate bar oh my gosh i'm gonna love this i already love it i'm so happy let me just make a chocolate bar so i'll make it with whoa i think make it with like wool and do a little chocolate and also i'll use some another brick slabs let's make this pretty long chocolate bar this wide actually i don't want it to be too big because it would probably be kind of hard i guess it wouldn't but still okay so and just stick these together okay i think that's the outline of it so now let's fill it in chocolate chocolate i'm already almost done and we are we only have 30 like we already have four minutes left that's a lot for time for me to finish because i'm basically already finished or i should wrap the candy bar up i think i'll do that i'll wrap it like it'll make a chunk of it not there though or should it be it should be gold okay it should be a gold rapper a little gold rapper that's going to be awesome i hope we have time to do this i really want to have time i think i'll say i want to like willy wonka chocolate bar maybe that would be awesome i think i will do it i think we're gonna have time i hope we're gonna have time to break all of it so excited i've never done a chocolate bar before and build it it's just awesome play this game a lot by the way a lot two minutes remaining that's enough oh and if you guys have ever seen willy wonka you need to see it i bet you probably have but um it's just awesome there's two boy wonka ones and i just love it it's like a little just awesome it's amazing do you think that's good i think it's good it just needs a little more like chocolate out a little more chocolate maybe like i should have little like little stuff because it all got off like a little torn no i like how it is maybe i can put like some of it like on little crumbs everywhere a couple of crumbs here let's see i think this is gonna be awesome you have a lot of time that is amazing you have like a tiny bit missing like a bite yeah this is i think it's amazing there that's amazing i love it i'm not the best at it but i think it's good what is this it's not a chocolate bar i think it's my eyes are bleeding how is that a chocolate bar and that's cute that's cute i like it it's good it has a c for chocolate bar does he like made one what is this it's okay okay i man get how it's a chocolate bar it's like this chocolate okay i think they're gonna do my one of them i did my eyes are bleeding i wish they didn't it's gonna blow up yay it survived it survived okay i have to say this is it's okay okay this is awesome i get how it's a chocolate bar that is awesome that's good that's really cool have they liked me since big chocolate seriously what is this oh i get it good i get it like there's some milk and chocolate that's what it is oh amazing amazing this is amazing this is seriously amazing oh my gosh that is super cool what is this oh it's a hershey that's cool that's good it would take a long time to do all that like the hershey stuff like all the signs although you could type fast which i'm not very good at typing fast yay he wanna like this one a lot yay okay well i think i'm gonna in this episode here good bye but before i finish this video um i want to youtube subscribe so do it to know i said no bye guys bye on the count of three i'm gonna do this one two", "5p40G_d1lCg": "hello there today we're going to be building chocolate bars in minecraft for our first chocolate bar we will need one dark oak door and that's it basically you just place it down and there you have it a beautiful chocolate bar it's really nothing but now it's our second one for a second one you'll need 32 brown concrete and a lot of black hair so basically start by making this a four like bottom area and build up like that and you continue going like this and you also do that on the same on the other side so so one two three four and one two three and then place one two three four and then here you have the chocolate bar i'm gonna do the rest in creative because i don't i can't get up there and then you go build up like that and you continue going like this it's much easier to do in creative mode and and if you want me to do other bill tutorials like this one then please leave a like and if you want me to do another candy tutorial for example maybe like a bon bon then if we get to like i don't know 10 likes then i'll just do another a bon bon thing and if you don't want that i don't know then whatever anyway this is a chocolate bar and to add a wrapper you would get iron and just choose a spot up here and continue building down like that that was a complete look and if that happens don't do that just build up like that and then you just continue filling this in and then you have a wrapper it doesn't look like a wrapper but it's a wrapper and that's a fact and there we go i'm not that good in building please don't judge me okay maybe i should get rid of that i don't know what i should do to make this look better but it looks pretty good and also add one like that and there you have it a chocolate bar with a wrapper and if you want another chocolate bar and then i'm just going to do a quick easy secret base if you want me to i don't know if i should or not but this isn't one's like a favorite one of my favorite secret bases it's like so you so i'll just show you soon and right now i'm back and we've got a little house here i've made this house and totally nothing suspicious about this painting right everyone knows this you walk through the painting and then you just have your secret base and to make this you will need um at least um a two by two wall you can't do it like one because then that don't won't work basically you break out two of your the wall and then you place these two and i like having it just like that because i think it looks nice like that and that oh no saying yep like this and basically that is it and you walk through it and then da da da da inside is your secret base leading down to your nice secret base and probably not the void that i just fell into i thought there's more layers of bedrock in flat world whatever and and that is a simple secret base don't fall into the void again and then there you go the simple seek another simple secret base and bye", "-8_efitUP34": "[Music] so if you're wondering how to grow cocoa beans i'm going to show you it is very simple and we are right now in a jungle which is a location where you find the cocoa beans now you find them attached to jungle trees like you see here and they just grow normally by themselves so all you do is you come up and you can pick them with your hand by i'm uncreated but in survival you just kind of harvest them with your hand or if you use an axe an axe is actually the fastest way but then you just break it you know and you pick up the cocoa beans and you place them on jungle logs now they have to be placed in juggle logs if you place them other logs like oak it won't work has to be jungle logs now you don't have to use a jungle tree so if you want you just want to harvest a bunch of these and just place them like this which is what i do to make a farm just kind of place a bunch of them like this and then you just let them grow until they look full grown like you see over that corner forget if you can use bone meal pretty sure you can yeah so when they're like this third stage that's when they're ready to harvest see they have three stages one two three the third stage when it's fully brown that's when you can harvest it and get your cocoa beans out of them you see it's actually pretty simple all you're doing is placing them on these jungle logs required of course the jungle logs let them grow on their own me personally i find that they grow fast enough that you don't really need to use bone meal on them so i don't typically use bonemeal in survival i just place them on a bunch of logs and i'll create like a bunch of these or sometimes i'll even make a wall oops like this and make it like really long and place them like this and i won't do this too high maybe four max because you want to at least be able to reach it you know then you just kind of come along and harvest them and as you do you'll drop a certain amount of cocoa beans and the remainder you have you can plant them and you'll have a profit after that [Music] and that's all there is to it [Music] you", "yWgJKYvjKH4": "hey

video on if it's possible to cast obsidian. This proved to be a major challenge that took six attempts, broke multiple crucibles and two different kilns. But I didn't want to stop until I finally had success at casting obsidian. Previously I made obsidian blade by knapping, which is kind of a Stone Age technology. But a lot of people wanted to see me try and do actual casting with obsidian. Which is something that's pretty difficult because actual obsidian doesn't melt until over 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit Which is something that's very hard to achieve. So while looking for this I realized that you can actually cast glass using sand and a similar method that I used for the aluminum But because I can't melt the actual obsidian, I need to grind it up into small little particles, mix it with the flux and then melt it. And hopefully then I can cast it into some form of knife Obsidian is largely made of silica like regular glass but also has an unknown mixture of other impurities in it as well. That can make its melting point difficult to work with. Melting straight obsidian is potentially possible But would likely result in a very thick viscous substance That'd be hard to work with especially to cast my early attempts at glass making also had a fair amount of impurities which made it really difficult to work with so The solution to this is flux Which is adding chemicals with lower melting points that make the entire solution melt easier and be fluid enough to cast so the thing with knapping is that when you fracture it you're able to create potentially razor thin blades that are a Molecule thick you. Can't quite reach the same sharpness by just sharpening glass itself But you should be able get something close and it's also probably gonna be pretty Brittle as even this is brittle itself and it has wood reinforcing and holding it So let's give it a shot. First up is grinding the obsidian, melting it down and see if this is even feasible I used a ball mill to grind it to a fine powder in a liquid solution, which I then need to boil off. One of the biggest pains is getting a crucible That's just big enough to hold a large enough volume, but still fits inside the rather small kiln As it heats the Obsidian and flux tend to boil over some and unfortunately in these smaller crucibles nearly everything spilled out For this first test it looked like the Obsidian and flux may have separated, which means this might not be feasible Also enough spilled out and burned through the insulation until it broke the kiln's coil making the kiln unusable Next I tried a larger batch using a more flexibly designed kiln that I could scale up to fit a larger crucible (whispered) I uh, suck at this It's melted all the way through. For an initial small test knife I carved a model out of styrofoam and then packed it into the sand Once poured the hot glass will burn off the styrofoam and fill in its place Like regular glass, if my cast obsidian cools too rapidly it'll fracture and shatter So I took a note from the compound we used when we made glass with Grant last year and picked up a bag of vermiculite. Which can act as an insulator to allow the glass to slowly cool Alright, lets give this a shot. Unfortunately that wasn't enough and it still ended up shattering But the most interesting result was that the remelted obsidian turned out fairly transparent with just a slight amber color This is likely due to the flux which probably added to the transparency But this also might be related to how this glass is formed versus the original obsidian Which raises an interesting question on if this compound could even be considered obsidian anymore Regrinding this glass, I started a new batch, but this time, assuming it got more clear because of the flux I thought I'd attempt to counteract it by adding some new impurities back in specifically added in some metals that are often used in glass making to dye glass black: nickel and chromium Which gave it a nice dark color very similar to what it started with Now to cast it. (talking about fluffy cat) Usually she just lays in the grass and eats it. So I'm gonna try and cast this toy Roman sword in obsidian but I don't want the handle to be obsidian So I'm gonna cut that off Unfortunately by the time it came to pour it, my crucible had cracked and the majority of the obsidian had leaked out While I reset again for another attempt I was curious to do another experiment to see what would happen If you try to melt just straight rocks of obsidian This resulted in a interesting formation of a foamy mess Likely caused by off-gassing of compounds like water that'd previously been trapped in the obsidian The semi molten obsidian adhered to the crucibles as well as the sides of the kiln which unfortunately caused this kiln to break as well But in the interim I had fixed the first kiln and gotten a better fitting crucible. So let's keep going Collecting as much of the previous attempt as I could Plus adding some more crushed obsidian And some more flux I'm ready to go again This time with a very promising pour Alright, moment of truth to see if the sword is in one piece I've had mixed results so far with the vermiculite of Some things still shattering in it, some things not Let's see what we got Dreams shattered dreams Refusing to give up I brought my setup to glassmaking studio FOCI Where I could throw my final result into their annealing chamber and not risk it shattering Okay, so got a weird reaction in the last attempt where it got really bubbly when we poured it not sure exactly why, there might've been some cracks that formed when I transferred the mold or There might have just been more humidity in the air that made it damp and caused a reaction I'd like to polish this, it'd probably break up if I try to grind it and shine it up. So We're gonna go over there. Give a one more shot to do it the right way previously I added a little bit of a tang to attach a handle to it easier But that's kind of flimsy so I'm a little worried how well that'll hold up. So I think I'm just gonna do the whole thing obsidian, So I'm just super gluing the handle back on sand cast it once more I hopefully will finally have the obsidian sword Not very strong Working with FOCI, I learned how sand casting for glass is done a slightly different way Instead of packing the sand tightly around the mold you lightly place the mold into the sand and pack it only along the edge The idea is to allow the air to escape through the sand so it doesn't bubble up through the glass like it did last time Then they also torch the sand to leave a fine layer of carbon on top. So the glass can better release from it So after six attempts, I finally managed to cast a full obsidian blade. Unfortunately in the annealing process it got a little cracked and Probably can't polish it off and put a nice edge on it, unfortunately I took quite a bit of flux in order to make it cast-able which made it a bit difficult to actually temper It's kind of messed up the whole annealing and made it a bit weaker, so it's more ceremonial at this point. despite all the mythology around obsidian, it's really fragile, just glass and uh... So put it through a whole different process than how the obsidian originally formed, which is evident when it became pretty transparent at one point and then I had to add the additional dyes in order to turn it back into black. So it's kind of debatable if this is obsidian, but it's definitely made from obsidian and uh, took a lot of attempts, though I finally made it So this took six attempts and broke two crucibles and two kilns. Just fixed this guy and last time this crucible cracked it leaked the obsidian all over it and Eroded and did a ton of damage Fortunately, it's still working at this point But I don't want to push my luck too much so as much as I enjoy making unprofitable videos and I'm gonna call it at this point say it's complete So now that I've cast the glass next I'm gonna move on to a different mineral, actually try and do actual metals with some copper and make bronze So I'll do that in uh...

bedrock edition tutorial today I'll be showing you how to build a very simple cheap and reliable OneTouch brewing system of for your world so all you got to do with this machine is come up here and press this button but it's kind of a kind of a different system so what it does is it's actually storing the brewed potions on the brewing stand and then once you press the button it will give you those potions so it's basically instant potions and then it starts brewing at the next round of potions for you to grab later on so it's a pretty interesting system and as you can see it's a rather small system as well although it is not as small as I would like it to be but this is as small as you can really make it with it's still being completely reliable on bedrock edition I'll get into that a little bit later anyway that is pretty much all the details I need to tell you right off the bat about this bill so if you guys like the sound of this video then leave a like on it maybe subscribe to the channel so you guys see future videos and whatnot in your sub feeds and let's get in to all the details you need to know about this farm and also the tutorial so first things first of course and that is gonna be credit where credit is due so the main like basic concept and idea for this Brewer came from a very old exhume avoid video where he showcases this a three by three by three automatic potion Brewer which is a lovely I love this little guy it's very cute and tiny and it's just awesome a link to this video will be down in the description if for you guys to go check it out and like I said it's a very old video it is from 2013 so yeah it's it's pretty cool actually it's pretty cool anyway of course this doesn't work on bedrock edition for a couple of reasons one is the randomness and redstone components and two is the randomness in hoppers which I guess is also kind of a redstone component but whatever calling it two separate things so no matter how you arrange your ingredients in these droppers here they will rarely if ever appear in the correct order to brew the potion that you want them to so I try to expand the system this one is just as unreliable and then we got to today's design which is actually perfectly reliable which is actually extremely nice so of course you want all of your ingredients to arrive at your brewing stand in the correct order so that you don't get any weird useless potions and you're not wasting ingredients and that is kind of why the randomness and redstone on bedrock Edition is extremely annoying for basically any kind of technical build that isn't just like pure straightforward logic because you have to expand everything a lot more add-in just slower components a lot more delay and other things like that to get things done that non-randomized redstone would get done any much smaller and easier way anyway as you can see there is that demonstration there and there's also this demonstration here for the thing that actually effects potion Brewers and that is the randomness and hopper so they should appear in this order right here geez it should appear in nether wart magma cream a redstone dust and gunpowder but as you can see it doesn't always happen that way so again another massive thank you to exhume avoid for the original design concept and design a for today's tutorial now of that and all my other rambles out of the way we should get into building this Auto Brewer so the materials that you will need to build this are the contest my hot bar right here you're gonna need a for chest 10 hoppers a brewing stand for droppers three solid blocks at least two pieces of redstone dust one redstone torch and then a wooden button now it is very important that use a wooden button otherwise you'll have some problems with the potions actually going into your lower chest but nothing too much to worry about so place down a double chest a hopper going into the back of that you're then going to want a brewing stand on top of that a hopper going into the front of that and another double chest on top of that as well you're then gonna want to make this kind of check mark shape of blocks right here and then place your droppers on top of all these blocks and these droppers are what will be holding your potion ingredients for your potions now go ahead and place another block behind this hopper right here place a redstone torch on the back of this dropper and two pieces of redstone dust like that you can go ahead and remove these three blocks and place a wooden button on the front of this a dropper right here and that is of course gonna be the activation for your system so you can then go ahead and place in the hopper line for all this so place a hopper facing and down into the brewing stand and then just more hoppers going around like this nothing too complex for that one but again alright so now it's the time to go ahead and put in all of your ingredients so just go ahead and put them in in the order that they are supposed to be brewed in so we're gonna be making splash potions of fire resistance you can of course brew whatever potion you like so that's gonna be another warrant first magma cream is second redstone dust the third and then you're gonna need gunpowder or fourth but of course replace those ingredients for whatever potion you are brewing and then just go ahead and throw in a water bottles into the top chest here I don't recommend filling and filling up this entire chest so you don't have to worry about it pretty much ever again and then also go ahead and place in a blaze powder into your brewing stand now a stack of blaze powder will brew about twelve hundred or so potions I hear which is quite a few potions it's probably more potions than you will ever use this little system for however if you want more blaze powder then you can just go ahead and put a hopper here and fill this with blaze powder as well and that is pretty much all there is to that so the first time you press this button you're gonna get three water bottles you can just go ahead and put those and back into the upper chest but after that you will always get three potions of your choice from this system whenever you press the button and then it will start brewing in the next set of potions as well which is ever so nice so this is currently set up for a four ingredient potion which is pretty common however if you only have a three ingredient potion then you just go ahead and remove all of that stuff right there and then you have a significantly smaller system and that will work just fine however if you have a five ingredient potion like four lingering potions and whatnot then you're gonna want to modify it like so so place a couple blocks right here with a droppers on top of those blocks facing upwards of course you then want a block right there and a block beside of those two droppers and then go ahead and remove the ones underneath and then just place hoppers going around like this and then just place a couple pieces of redstone dust right there and that will give you a 5-ingredient potion so we're gonna put gunpowder into that one and dragon's breath into that one which will give us an extended lingering potion of fire resistance if I am guessing correctly not really sure just the demonstration but as you can see all the ingredients have arrived in the correct order and this one is currently brewing up to the nether woods then you got your magma cream your redstone dust your gunpowder and also your dragon's breath so it's a very simple and reliable system although it does get a little bit on the larger side so I guess you just get some lingering potions of fire resistance for two minutes not sure how long the typical lingering potion lasts for but that looks like way too many particles anyway I hope you guys get some use out of this little tutorial I will be releasing a bigger and better automatic brewing system here soon but that's still kind of in the works you can see it behind us now anyway thank you guys very much for watching this video to hope that you did enjoying some use out of it in your world or

the time that's as over and I'm finished okay guys time lapse now okay so now go build this right so this is just gonna be like a while of this being annoying I am going crazy on me okay also the server was beginning to get so laggy that straight it up just like crap to build no but I I can't even get to clay that's so annoying I'm gonna have to use bone which is gonna make it look straight up like awful I'm gonna add some details don't worry yeah that's just turning red then I have to call that done guys I'm gonna do a w4 willy wonka of course there we go with 30 seconds remaining we are good just need a fix this okay no we're good Oh guys guys 15 seconds remaining yeah this this is gonna rock oh this this is gonna rock what can i / ground wait that is like you're annoying folk / ground okay guys so wait now it oh look at that wait that looks like that looks like I [Music] oh I didn't get to road that I was gonna vote man my eyes are literally burning on that I hate why why

gonna say it's spine well it's okay hey whatever oh this is my own build Oh what it got real to W I kind of and remove it that's so annoying people are literally like gonna hate it wait what is this why are you then cave spiders everywhere this this is like no no I learned how to say that's inappropriate I can't oh okay Hey wow that that's straight-up light amazing thing you build this okay wait this is nothing sorry I do but you're gonna have to get it up my eyes are burning wait Josh I just go for the boy wait what what is going on guys there's there's is like No Oh anyway like of course you want and ya baktun here back turn one on okay okay Kady hey guys so next round let's do this okay hey so start in ten seconds these wait so I'm gonna capture America why the Captain America quit equip minecraft Captain America like like the Avengers guy quick what's the P we've got to build a ghost okay I feel one our boss oh no that is wait why is there no white thing loss that is actually annoying point if you work at like mineplex you are brought to fix us like it's terrible a Gore build bone wrapping well I had to feel like we could just build like a simple 2d ghost yeah this is gonna be easy it's so yeah yeah let's try it even though I know I'm gonna lose lose cuz I'm just like playing the time foot nothing I'm gonna make this a bit bigger anyway hmm break that that just looks like like a white minecraft emerald so I'm gonna give it that yeah y'all being this I am beating this so what's their face wait wait why are you turning into bone that just no I can't replace on the ground that that's irritating that that is so annoying and guys this really needs to be fixed like seriously anyway what else is here so still bone annoying oh yeah so bone annoying that it's pure rude as well anyway hey Ganga anyway guys as literally tan and lag ever gets so rude way to sign off flip even item frames please and they don't oh yeah that's good that says update with Pia Pia Pia Pia annoying this summer read this is like one the servers that reading needs to be fixed I'd like no one cares about sick like I'm breaking and I just turns into you know wait I'm gonna do it oh we can't even right side the key gaming you know what's gonna write it cuz we bought like loads of time that time to turn know how to play oh wait I can build a vice now okay yeah I can it's two minutes remaining this is gonna be annoying hmm oh we're gonna have to do a nice moustache you mean a nice moustache sir sorry by the die joke guys sorry sorry sorry so one minute like 1/2 minutes it's whatever wait now I can do what I want to right boo okay hey let's do hmm I'm glad this isn't as frustrating as doing like the gone w in the last one back that was actually annoying boom there we go break you out guys wait can I now make this black turn to ice again oh wait wait I've gone connected with the black okay we like down here Gordo like this which is annoying there we go oh this is working think so if you guys are problems on mineplex just do that and it's good Oh on moustache ghost with huh wait a minute seconds remaining yeah 30 seconds just tonight I go up icon she's gonna

actually reckless I literally likes wrapped it all here's mine I wait why why you do literally it why does the server just do this Oh what all that strange oh wait I I forgot to vote whoa that actually looks more like a gas but I'm gonna say everything's awesome and just destroy it at the st. yo just completely destroying like the best build um this is nothing I'm sorry dude but my eyes are absolutely burning cuz there's nothing anyway it says failure at that I feel like I think I just got like unlucky oh of course of course of course see one on that guy there anyway guys that's um how to be it for today's video over and out guys", "yiFqu1NHYeA": "glitch chocolate yo what's going on guys welcome back to another video today we're gonna be making a chocolate bar yes a literal chocolate bar then we been now we're gonna make a chocolate bar so we need all the materials we can get quite agree you are gonna need red for the chocolate bar we are of course going to need a chocolate okay now let's now let's just see if I can build this chocolate bar alright so you stuck me a bacon chocolate bar but I know it's gonna be a bit big so I'll just Sol's use the chocolate bar just to show off a little bit but if we can get if we can get this video to 5 likes I will make and something else and you get to choose in the comments what you would like me dab it you okay so I finished feetball of it but here's what it looks like so far don't mean right now we have to do a rapper like you are like if you don't know what a rapper is or if you live like in America or something then a rapper is basically just feet outline of it okay so basically just basically unveiling the packaging so we just gotta make the little outline of the bar so then and then we can use our good that's just how it's going to have to work so read well anyways we we are nearly nearly never done then this will be the end for the video just a short little build within five minutes going like that sorry where it is you can just push it in the comments everyone okay let's see if this match what I was thinking in mind that's it for this video okay bye and stay active or bye", "7GzRfE6o2KY": "yeah i can't find them we're live hey back again yes good morning everybody i i uh i don't know if you saw my tweet but reply to it he's like go to bed it was like oh my god i just got my stream in the morning gotta make sure to be alive that's the best like that's the best i could offer there you go there you go i brought my moral support here george come here come here come here hey i got my gucci's so the sad news is i'm not going to uh here when my new keyboard arrives i got a new keyboard coming today so with my security system in the basement here in the lab i'm not going to find a not gonna not gonna hear it there's georgie she's funny she's scared to come down so i had to let her at the letter from the in from the outside she doesn't like the spiral stairs oh cool all right so today we are going to build a custom entity from mostly scratch why do i say mostly because we have a template that we created that drops kind of the basic stuff in place to save you from basically having to type every single piece of each piece of code manually will save you a little bit of that effort but we will have to be doing some code so let me post a download link in the comments the dropbox link cool um so we will call that the this is the template add-on first comment every day rats what's up yeah sort of i um i might have beat you too every day or whatever mrs lee i got my audio coming back to me on your side you probably know that but just letting you know ah miss lee teacher welcome oh this is great okay everybody loading their class is loading in loading in okay so get that uh get that uh add-on that template folder downloaded and i will shell this clean share share speaking of share if you didn't watch my stream yesterday you didn't get to hear my share impersonation oh i missed it just saying i'm just saying you're you're not trying to sell her hair products right yeah why why do you why do you say that as i'm sorry that's weird is that awkward i'm bad yeah you're you're tripping over your words what's what's the deal i've got i've got no room to talk i wear hats you can't see the crying on my head so i know i i still still trying to figure that out you know what you know what's that what's the perception i want to create but this is the real it's the real deal uh you know half the trouble is picking out a good t-shirt as well so that's a rough it's a rough day yeah i'm like all right so i am going to i've got my screen up here okay all right cool we're going to get we're going to get rolling anyone that joins can uh can follow along so you're going to get this download that i sent to you you'll download it when you download it so like let's uh i'll i'll copy this one and paste it and i'll call it my downloaded so that you don't have to rename it like this i'm just doing this so i don't change the original one that you're downloading that's the one you're downloading so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to right click how's your day been yeah we are awesome josh coder hi dearer good morning good morning buddy what's up dude okay uh what am i doing oh see i can't walk and chew gum i'm going to right click on that folder so once you unz uh actually it i should have zipped it up but you it it's the whole folder download that yes we're using visual studio code you can get the uh the download all right gatlin can you find can you get the visual studio code download link and chuck it in um actually on it if you chat it to me i could put it through all three of them but all right cool so once you get this all extracted what i'm going to do is right click it and say open with code visual studio code right the cool thing there is that i've got the entire folder structure here in this in this view and what was the um was it i i'm trying to remember my shortcut key my my my genius shortcut key that i came up with we're supposed to save you time what are you doing oh there you go yeah that one that's what you're looking for yeah control uh let's go ahead and do that turn off okay cool all right so i got this little zooming dealio so that could hopefully make things a little bit easier for you guys so this is what we have going on here we have the the folder tree that we could navigate which is super helpful so we'll be able to look at all the files that we need to manipulate so these are the ones that i'm kind of giving you for free so we can change things up so what we're going to do is we're going to first of all customize this to make it unique for each individual and we'll zip it up and make it installable into minecraft we'll put it in minecraft and put the the development put them into the development packs so that we can go ahead and start customizing them in the world and here is the visual studio code thank you vs code download yo blast out to all channels thank you sir uh oh yeah and you put it there as well okay all right cool all right so let's let's get started with the the only essential thing we need to do here is we need to make this unique to us and you're going to have to follow along this process and if you look at some of the earlier videos you see how we installed the extension that grabs the uuid we're going to need unique uuids which is a little redundant and repetitive because the first the second u is the word unique what's the first word okay so what i do to be nice and zippy is i can highlight this area that says needs new uuid i do ctrl shift p brings up my command palette and i have this recently used generate uid and that's what a uuid looks like so i'm going to give you another tip there is a uuid generator uuidgenerator.net i'll post that in the chat uh so if you don't have the plugin you want to get a uuid you can go to this website and if you refresh the page it just loads up another uuid see that we just wasted that completely good uuid by letting it go now i don't want you to copy mine and i don't want you to copy anybody else's you go generate your own this is supposed to be unique to you so don't grab anyone else's uuid that will cause problems uh i copied i think i copied that one let's see yeah i copy that one and paste into that string so that's the way you can do that i'm going to save that manifest i think you would want to change you could change the description put your name in here and if you have a certain pack that you want to build you could put the name of the pack there so even though these are ordered improperly like this is the name and then the description shows up below it actually in the game but the reversed in the default pack i don't know why probably alphabetical something something like that okay so i'm using my shortcut okay so i've got the uuids created so we're going to save that and now i can go back to my file explorer and we're going to package these up so in here not the behavior packs folder and not the bp folder which is the the add-on itself but we're going to go into the into this folder here and i'm going to click and then i'm going to shift-click to select everything okay then i'm going to right-click and send to compressed zip folder and i'm going to call it template uh bp and get rid of the extension and call it mcpack okay and then when i hit enter it's going to be like we are you sure you want to change the file extension you know crazy things happen when you do that yes i do okay and so now our template behavior pack is created i'm gonna move that up to this folder go here go into resource packs rp same deal i'm gonna select the first folder hold shift click the bottom one right click send to compressed zipped folder and this is template rp mcpack yes indeedly we go back here now we have our two packs now here's another cool trick if if you don't know you can install these together by clicking on both packs right clicking we have inception going on here the box inside of a box so we can compress and we can call this template oh sorry mc add-on how do you like that getting worried you were going to tell them wrong information i sensed you were on me that's why i quick changed it i'm like i will not let him have that victory not that easily he needs to save me later when i'm really stuck okay so we're gonna we're gonna run this by double clicking it to get it installed so i'm going to double click boop oh ding dang ding dang dang education education is good uh so if that happens to you if you're one of those people fortunate enough to have multiple versions of minecraft what you could do is you could right click on it and then you could say open with and then you could select the proper thing so in this case this flat 2d grass icon is bedrock edition whereas education edition is like a bookshelf so i'm going to like that okay successfully imported template behaviors successfully imported template resources that's good news successful is nice so if you did not have success chances are you did something wrong most likely the most common thing is people they don't honor the punctuation so like if if you ended up oh shoot see that's a problem right there but if you if you went in here and uh selected a little too far or your your cursor wrapped to like the next screen the next line you would lose these things and so if i were to generate a new ui d now it kind of screwed things up okay so control z is your friend when you make mistakes we didn't have control z when i was a kid and we broke that lamp when my parents were at the supermarket and we had to figure out how to undo the idea of playing football in the living room because you were lucky you were allowed in the living room we just got kicked out we had to go outside yeah we used to we used to play knee football so as soon as our parents left remove all the furniture me and my brothers would play an e football and then when we saw the headlights drive in we would put all the furniture back and sit down and act like everything's chill and they'd be like what were you guys doing like nothing and then later they told us like we come home you're sweating you're beat red you're and you say you're doing nothing oops you miss those details when you're a kid we thought we had them it's like that video the kid with chocolate all over his face like i didn't why didn't he do it all right so we're going to create a new world i'm going to create new world and we're going to call this my template world and i'm going to make it creative i'm going to walk you through kind of like the the default settings that i use for worlds when i'm kind of building stuff and just want to have access to everything i'm doing so first of all i'll do like a flat world so i don't have to worry about finding a good a good place and creative and then i like to turn coordinates on because that's important if you start getting into command blocks and things like that i'll sometimes turn like fire spreading if i'm working on a map and i don't want to accidentally destroy something i'll i'll turn some of these things off but i like to keep cheats on i like to make it always day i like to keep inventory i like to turn off mob spawning so that we don't have creatures everywhere without our decision i like to turn weather cycle off if you if you turn off like entities dropping loot if you turn that off then loot tables aren't going to process and you're going to be like why is my loot table not working and it's because i'm not speaking from personal experience tile drops is the same thing that's the loot tables for blocks um so we have um all that one more thing i want to change is the difficulty difficulty instead of normal let's let's uh [Music] the we don't want to make it peaceful we turned off mob spawning because if you don't turn off mobs bomb and get slimes everywhere but we don't want to make it peaceful because then any of our hostile mobs will be denied from entering the world and then we won't be able to pick on the creeper or anything like that so i'll leave it normal i think we're good to go so before we create the world we can go to resource packs my packs template resources the ones that we just added activate and behavior packs template behavior packs activate and then create i'm a little nervous okay so let's see okay it's there so we could see we're in our world so i'm going to type command slash summon and then um start if ever like starter what happens oh something something exists okay we have a vehicle we have a starter vehicle polizia this is the um the invincible you get so much life yeah oh oh that's that's funny that if you've ever seen this problem um i'll help you fix that uh that's uh that's some that's a movement it's a movement issue you know we have as you get older not i'm not gonna say it okay so we don't want movement issues to be our like our trending emoji emoji okay so we're we're pretty good here you should be at a point where you've got at least this entity coming to life in your world if you've done everything correctly okay so now checkpoint if if you don't have this double check your work against the video and if you have questions you could post them in in the chat or in the video comments wherever you're watching it we'll try to answer but we don't like to answer if you don't like to uh you know check your own work we can't do everything for you but meet us halfway we'll help you out so i'm going to save and quit what do you tell your students ian gatlin before they come to you with a question before they come to you with like a question that shows that they've done absolutely no effort trying to solve but i rarely get students that don't have any effort at least in the classroom uh this new online stuff is a little bit different the biggest question that i ask my students is what is it that you're trying to get the game to do or what is it that you're trying to get the program to do or what is it that you're trying to do because often they come to me with their hands waving and i'm doing this i'm trying one of these things i'm like that doesn't help me at all like i don't know what you're doing what is it that you're trying to get it to do i was trying to get it to do this ah there we go all right and that's that's good that's good that's like the uh the whole rubber duck debugging thing you know like if you just explain to somebody what you're trying to do before you're done explaining it you already figured out what you did wrong because you had to you had to explain it forces you to think through it a little clearly in order to get somebody to understand it so if you don't have any friends like like me then just talk to um you know something on your desk explain to it hey what you're what you're doing and where you're stuck and if it helps you let us know i don't know what that thing is but yeah so the next thing we're going to do is now we have to take the the pack this this this pack and and we want to start working on it developing with it so i showed you how to create the com.mojang folder in your quick access so i click on that right it should be in your in your quick access and then i've got minecraft worlds click on that and then you can see i'm sorting by date modified so this most recent one here is the world that we just created and if we look at behavior packs you could see template behavior is already in here okay so what i want to do is copy template behavior so i click on the folder ctrl c and then i go up to development behavior packs click on that and paste that's my behavior pack now we're going to do the same thing in the in that latest world file with the resource pack template resource packs ctrl c and i can also click on here go to development resource packs and paste it in there so what this does is now that you could see the world has the pack that we created so we created the pack on our local drive zipped it up installed it into minecraft and then it just sits in minecraft not connected to anything and then when we connected it to our world it put a copy of the pack inside of the world at that moment in time and if we want to make changes to that we could go straight into the world and make and make the changes but then if we accidentally delete that world all of our changes are gone and so if you take those packs and put them in development in the developments folder what will happen is that world will see like oh i want to load this this template behavior and it looks uses a uuid to match against the one that's in the developments folder it's like oh there's a development one here that takes top priority so it's going to load everything in the developments folder the development behavior back in development resource pack first and so now we've created this override and no matter how many worlds we create that use that original behavior pack it's going to resort back to the development i want to get the newest latest and greatest so i guess our long-term process is going to be we're going to take the development resource pack and behavior pack when we're done and we're going to we're going to package that up as kind of like our official final and that's when we'll be backing up to save and stuff like that so we don't lose our changes sounds good all right so what we're going to do now that we have that is get out of this awesome zoom here and i'm going to go to the com.mojang folder um i'm going to close this these template folders i think we're done with that for now and in the com.mojang i have these two folders so i actually gonna right click over here and say open with code and open the whole the whole shebang there we have it okay so we're going to walk through now we just have to make sure we're kind of going to the right places so we have the development behavior packs folder so let me step you through what you have at your fingertips here you have this starter.json if you want to make if you want to make this uh let's let's call this i'll call this dude that's an okay word for me okay all right so we have we have clever like dude and then one of the things you could uh you could customize is the family that it belongs to so we could i think you could say like mob like that the the family you can you can customize and kind of group your entities together so if they're all a certain type of entity you can put them in a similar family and then we have our starter loot table defined as the loot tables folder and then and then starter.json oh see that that's cool that's the that's the live one yeah the live one moves around on you and but this whoa but this one is actually pretty static until you get to the edge pretty cool yeah that's nicer okay so we'll be doing that that starter that the starter json we could look at that folder or that file and see here we have a a loot table and this is in our previous videos we went through hacking all these things so you can get a familiarity for what they do and how to customize them and so you can see we're going to get an iron helmet because i have a minimum and a maximum of one so we're definitely going to get one or an iron chest plate or iron leggings or iron boots so we can test that out when we destroy the entity to see if we get something from the loot table so the um the vehicle just taking off we're going to go to our tools bedrock.dev i'm going to throw that in the chat if you didn't bookmark that already you should it's a great tool made by people in the community which is the awesome thing about this community is people you know like like myself kind of want to help people out and share so they put their invest their own time and making things available to other people so this is like all of the documentation for add-ons kind of put into a really nice interface and there's also a wiki that has a lot of tutorials that are really helpful that you can dig into so if i go to my entities and i like to go to the components i could also do a search if if you know what you're looking for but i would say just in your spare time this is the this is the kind of person i am in your spare time read through the components get a feeling for what these things can do does that sound lame this is this is this is the kind of rabbit hole i always have diving down to you and me are very much alike i'm like ooh every little paragraph oh has trait supply oh in the nether i could do something like this this starts to give you all kinds of ideas just like it really does one of the things that i really enjoy about these is once you kind of dive into it like okay well i want my entity to do whatever it is like i wanted to be able to breathe underwater you're like okay cool well once you get it under water you're like well now it's underwater why is it why is it dying instantly like what's what's keeping it from staying alive right and then you start to dig further and answer your own questions and that's this is why i asked my students like what is it that you're trying to get it to do because if you can tell me what it is that you're trying to do i might know another little trick that'll help out but that little trick that i might know will kind of spark the next idea for what it is that you want your piece to do like once it's underwater i wanted to be able to breathe but i also wanted to be able to move twice as fast because i've given it flippers and it just starts to like i said it's a rabbit hole you just spiral down these things yeah totally um and that's for for me it's inspiration like oh you know you want to you want to look for ideas on what's possible once you read through these things and find uh things that are curious and interesting to you then you might come up with a way to try to use them and then you have a foundation for a a goal that you want to build towards and at least some of the stepping stones you might need to get there so so i'm going to show you a trick here on on what you know if i've got this kind of like poorly demonstrated or documented thing or at least there's there's no sample code in in this one and um yeah you know what they they did add where is that i just saw this the other day they they have all of the um the uses inside inside the inside the packs let's see here packs behaviors is that just the downloads yeah that's just the downloads um if somebody knows if somebody's watching and they know kind of where's the where they have the uses that would be that would be cool um am i missing anything [Music] no but but the since we have already the the template packs i'll show you what i do locally which i kind of like for now is the i'll go back into the um let me find that folder okay um oh yeah so it's another thing i showed you in an earlier video is that you can have the vanilla packs uncompressed and ready to go in your quick access bar so i can i can uh right click this and then say open with code it should open a new code window the cool thing is that all of the vanilla pack is now searchable so if i go to edit find in files and i go have navigation.generic find that like the dolphin has uh navigation generic the fish has it these are interesting because these are swimming things that use generic because generic allows you to do on land and in water so the other thing we could do is um navigation dot walk bats hover is b's float is a bat right so you get the idea that uh if if you want to understand the different types of navigation you can look at how they're implemented in entities that you're familiar with the vanilla entities so this is uh this is a great way to kind of cross-reference not only get the actual sample code but also get the um you know find the right code to use sure looks like navigation walk is is is pretty famous let's uh let's just copy that ctrl c on that one there we go and i'm going to put that into the component section so if you remember a uh we didn't i didn't create in this template we didn't create component groups and events so we only have components here that probably would have been a nice thing to add but we can we can address that later i'm going to after a comma i'm going to ctrl v to paste it navigation walk is amphibious can path over water so this is if it has a i and then say is there a movement here a minecraft movement [Music] this is um movement dot this is the one this is the even more important one movement basically don't you worry people we got this so i i went found movement basic and if we can go back to our code i'm kind of stepping through the the process of connecting connecting all the dots connecting all the all the dudes where is this we go to entities and then i could try movement dot basic there we go not a whole lot of documentation but this component accents the movement of an entity thanks for all the details this is where searching your packs comes in handy okay so we kind of put that in there and we are going to make sure to save our work saving that one and i think the navigation is it's going to be more of an ai thing so let's let's um i guess let's leave it it might come in handy so the the movement one is more important for that hopping off the vehicle problem so let's go back in to the world my template world and if it acts funny on the current one well summon star oh bro what did i do and quit did we create a problem movement movement basic oh dude i called it dude i'm going to leave this um starter for now i'm going to go back and change it to starter let's go back in here maybe perhaps getting a little sidetracked i don't know let's see summon starter vehicle there we go oh hello and now if we drive when we hop off stays there and it was because that movement attribute so it kind of lost all sense of gravity and or lost all sense of how do we like that is that good it works all right so let's get let's get back to it all right so um we're going to try not to get distracted we're going to change this back to dude save it we have our you know we can we can call this dude.json dude.json save the file and now we have to um let's rename let's start renaming things so we're going to go through this process of kind of branching off this entity to have its own to have its own name here we're going to do it manually so the entity is called dude in the template behavior pack and do that and then we have our loot tables and then our entities folder since the loot tables folder only has this folder it shows them kind of on the same line together in visual studio code so if i click on this file i'll hit f2 so i can rename it dude.json okay now i make sure that my loop table path is dude.json and it is there you go so i think we're good with the resource pack i mean with the behavior pack but now we have to go to the resource pack because these two are tied together when you're creating a custom entity you have to def you have to define everything from scratch essentially so we're we're going to go through and make sure that everything has its own unique name so our goal is to get a dude entity by the time we're done so i'm going to hit f2 to rename it we'll call this dude.json now the interesting thing here is like this file name is somewhat irrelevant because when it opens this file it's reading the contents and it's using the identifier really as the most important piece so you can name this file really whatever you want it's just nice to name it something that makes sense when you're reading it that way you don't have to open the file to figure out what it is and so to that extent you could actually give it a more meaningful name to you then then the entity name if you needed to so the identifier is super important this is what's connecting the behavior pack behaviors of the entity and the resource you know so we might say like the the um the resource is the client side and the behavior pack is the server side in in the development of the game world so so um we need to provide both of those and they need to be connected for the for the entity that we're defining so that's that's the deal here i have a render controller that's just named generic so there's no it's not switching textures it's not doing anything fancy so we can stick with that generic one and you can use the same render controller across multiple entities it doesn't have to be named per entity so that's okay and then we have geometry starter let's change that to geometry dude and what do you what do you think gatlin should i change all of the starters to dudes here and then go and fix all the sub files or should i now should i now edit the geometry like i would i would say do them all here because we're here but then definitely talk about why we're doing it as we move forward okay yeah so so we're going to call our geometry geometry dude for our model we'll go into blockbench and make up a new model instead of that car and so same thing with the texture we'll have to create a texture and we'll save that as as dude as well now the materials entity is kind of like a default non-alpha non-transparent non-transparency skin or texture if we do entity underscore alpha test that will honor the alpha layer so if you want some transparency that'll work so let's let's leave that the way it is with alpha test and now we have animations so we have our animation geometry dude and let's call it walk and i'm going to add so we're going to change this to walk so our we're going to have a walk and an idle animation okay so i'm going to ctrl c and then i'm going to control v and i'm going to control v again i have two lines i don't have any commas yet so i have to add a comma after the first line so that these two are comma separated hello and so i will change the first one to idle and now so we have here again the if if you watch the previous stream where we're hacking the resource packs this file this entity file is like our table of contents this is the thing that contains all of the information that we need to to display the entity that all of the the client-side code is gathered up here and it's connecting to all these other files that actually have the contents so our geometry is in a different file our texture is in a different file animations are in a different file all these things are are listed as kind of like a bill the bill of lading shipping this is shipping this pack so just know that there's um this is kind of like our hub that connects everything together and so we'll say um walk now this kind of a rudimentary way of saying oh it's always idle and it'll it will walk when um there's a modified move speed essentially greater than zero so we'll see how that works as instructions for how to animate so one of the the more recent things is that the these scripts folder is kind of like a lightweight animation controller if we want something more intricate i did include an animation controller sample that doesn't really connect to anything but we can use this as a way of understanding how an animation controller works and so you can see it has a it has a an identifier so controller animation sample so if we were to go into our dude entity we would um we would add to the animations that animation controller with with no um yeah so we would we would give it a name and then spell out animation controller sample and then in this in the scripts we would we would run that controller just basically telling the the game do what the controller tells you to do so for now we're kind of doing the animation based on the states in here so it's a lightweight version of an animation controller let's start with this and we'll get into the to the more complex animation controllers later okay so now that we've changed this file let's save it and now we have to finish connecting the dots so we're going to go to the let's start with the model we've started.json i'm going to rename it to dude so which part of the table of contents is looking at this spot this is the geometry good question so this is the the geometry okay geometry is another word for the model and this is what we'll be using block bench for sue i am going to go into that and for starters just to make things easier i'll change this to dude as well and save it and before we go any further i'm going to go into the textures so remember in in this file we have the texture which is oh can can i i was trying to try to uh pull up my my my pencil tool in my zoom you can it's yeah it's an inception thing with the buttons it failure oh oh we got a countdown oh mouth back all right anyway so so the geometry is pointed is looking for dude and the texture is looking for this is a path right the textures folder the entity folder and then the file dude dot png we don't put the dot png there it kind of knows that's what it's looking for so we have the models entity folder here do.json if i click on that geometry.dude this identifier like i said earlier like some of these these identifiers are more important than the file names so in this scenario file name is irrelevant we're not connecting to the file name we're we're using the identifier is how we're linking those two up however the texture does use the file name so in this texture we'll hit f2 and we'll change that to dude to make sure it picks up this don't mind me so that's changed to dude so let's go into block bench and we can say open model and we can go into our development resource pack okay so i go here development resource pack template resource models entity dude.json and there we go it pulled in dude.png already because it's super smart and you can see these are all of our our blocks so this is a pretty detailed model so i hate to do this on this beautiful model but we're gonna we can select woof hmm so we have our let's say we have our base now let's create a let's create a model if you're not familiar with with block batch you would there are i'm not going to really cover the how to use it per se there are some other videos out there on that i've done some videos that are quite outdated which is why i'm doing doing this live stream and then also uh arts by kev he's doing a great series of how to use block bench so check out arts by kev on youtube for minecraft tutorials as well doing awesome work so what we'll do is create a quick model quick model is there is there such such a thing do i do i like this pressure so i create a cube for um call it leg one and then we'll create a cube call it leg two okay and so i will so the front is fit is the north side uh i i so one of these uh one of my tutorials i did uh i did a helicopter i turned one of the the creeper into a helicopter and when i was done with the tutorial the helicopter was going backwards and i'm like oh no the whole thing i did it i did it facing the wrong way and so i'm like all right i'm just going to kind of edit that part out and see who notices it and no one's like you know i was waiting for class to be like oh excuse me mr clyde were like you messed up but nobody called me out on it and so if you did notice it good for you and thank you for not you know publicly embarrassing me i appreciate that okay so i think i might center these legs a little bit i'm going to go to the move tool whoa [Music] and do that okay so you could see in our in our texture we have like all of this previous stuff and this is like a 512x512 pixel resolution so we have a lot of space that we can work with we can also use a smaller image one trick in block bench if we go to the eraser so we just went into the paint it's kind of covered up by the logo up there just so you know where we were there in the top right thank you yeah so up here that's interesting so there's animate this time yesterday i was doing the stream and i'm like that there was no animate folder or animate tab it was called preview and so i'm like oh no where's animate and i got into a 10 minute uh thing and then i'm like i clicked on preview and there was the timeline i'm like oh it's called preview why so at least now i'm just further confused but but yeah anyway thanks for pointing that out i did click on the paint tab the three main components are the editing where you're manipulating the blocks and the developing the shape of the model and then paint which is the texture and then animate is going to be creating the animations and all these files are going to branch into different folders you know the the model is going into the geometry the paint is going to be our png texture and then animate is going to be our animation so we're going to be able to branch all this data out into there into their places that they belong so if i go into paint and then say eraser see if this works five yeah i could make it bigger i can erase the original i'm trying to avoid using photoshop if you're familiar with photoshop that's a great you know or  you like to use a graphics program that that's a that's a decent way to do something like this wow all right good enough so we have these these clear legs stylishly clear legs if i click on this here wow i wonder if i can i don't want to mess with the size of this right now so i can in the paint tool i can go ahead and click on paint and if i want to make the legs green a green froggy legs and then paint oh that's cool that's happening because our uv mappings are mapping to the same exact spot so it's not like i don't have mirroring turned on or anything like that it's actually both of these cubes are sharing the same exact texture location so um that's okay i'm gonna finish filling this one in make sure to get all the sides so when you're working in 3d you have to make sure to move things around you can't just edit things in one look and sometimes you have to hide different components so if you hide one you could reveal an empty spot that you couldn't see because they were covering each other up so now what i'm going to do is over here i did a terrible job of erasing look at that man i would be very frustrated with myself right now but um wow yeah okay just cleaning up okay there's our little there's our little teeny leg so what we're gonna do is um important thing before before i go any further so important thing is to not texture while you're modeling you want to you want to do all of your modeling first and then and then you want a texture because the problem is watch this if i go into edit i'm like oh these legs are awfully short i need them to be a little bit bigger bloop blue loop [Music] now i changed my texture mapping everything's screwed up terrible so what we're going to do i'm going to click on delete to delete this texture and when you have no texture in block bench it gives you some default uh some default visibility on your shapes so they're not all transparent that's that's good i like i like that so let's keep that on and i'll show you how we can create a new template texture when we're done all right so let's create a body so i'm going to click on the base and then click add group and you'll see it should add it in the hierarchy so that it's inside the base and we'll call this body and we'll add a bone to that and we're gonna move this up and i i don't have a plan here so this is like a peek into my mind sad was sad world okay there we go that seems pretty weird love it and uh something is kind of cringing what's that so the artist in me is kind of cringing yeah sorry sorry dude um it's terrible but it's gonna be it's going to be brilliant i just know it okay we call that the the body i wonder if that should just be that should just be it that's the that's the actual head there you go that's cool let's do that now a couple of details i'm going to make sure i do properly is i'm going to go to my pivot tool and you can see right now the pivot point is set to the bottom that means when this character walks it's going to be anchored to the bottom and so the legs are going to flip back and forth which is going to look like it's kicking the head so what we're going to do instead is is kind of anchor the leg up here by the head we'll do that for both of them this one this one is a little off to the side so we'll just move that over and squoosh it up and again look at it from different angles to make sure you have good positioning and lastly we're going to take the the head oh well let's see that yeah i'm clicking on the i had i clicked on the cube but i want to click on the actual leg bone make sure that's selected do the same thing because we'll be animating the bones not the cubes right yeah the animation always happens at the the bone level yes so that's a good catch to click on the actual folder not the cubes and same with the head so now the head same deal if the head looks down and it's anchored all the way down at the feet it's going to swing back and forth when it looks down instead of we just want it to kind of rotate and pivot on that on that point so we're going to bring this up so the head will pivot right there on the legs so it should be kind of stuck together and we'll see that when we get to the animation tab and so now we're going to create texture we call this dude build the template i'm going to not compress the template i'll keep the power of two multi-texture occupancy i'm going to turn that off for right now what about making a hammerhead entity and when it attacks it will hit his head okay thank you all right so turkey has an idea like this looks like a hammer so maybe we could make it have like some sort of hammer attack animation so that's actually a cool idea i like that um so keep multi-tenor actually um keep the the background by default and now what we have is a template and look over here on the left hand side it's a it's a nice clean template everything's organized the tops are are this lighter white color the right or actually the this is the front is blue left is red right is green back is yellow bottom is gray okay now what i like to do when i'm texturing things is kind of do some block fill so we're going to go into our model and so this was a like so we're going to make this a hammer i guess we'll make this like a hammer with a weird face and i probably would have done a better job with the model it's not it's not too late i mean it's maybe it's a little too late but let's uh change the head to go back to edit because we're changing the model and i want to add a new cube with the head selected and there's my new cube so if i can add that here and just oh yeah this this will be cool i'll show you so i made it one bigger so it's it's one bigger on either side but it's kind of offset so that that's the scale and the way it's snapping so what i can do is i can i can click on this one and if you look at the position if i move the x position it's moving it it's actually moving it left to right and i'm looking at it from the left side right now so if i move the y it's going to move it up and down so that moved it down and so if i move it 11.5 and then this one is minus 3 to minus 4 so if i do minus 3.5 because it's in between minus 3 and minus 4 it now has kind of like a little extra hammer surface mm-hmm and the the entity is going to attack in front of us so do you do you think i should rotate the hammer so that the head is facing yeah yeah i think we should i think so and we'll put the face we'll put the face on the flat end so so i'm going to click on this cube and this cube this this is interesting too because what would what you would do normally here is uh you could change the dimensions so i'll scale it like in a different direction and that would change the way that would change the way the model uh textures because you're changing the north south east and west faces but we haven't created our texture yet so we're going to go ahead and and scale it so here like i don't know gatlin if there's a way to explain but like the um the the um let's see here rotating it kind of creates a rotation inside of a rotation like so like i like to avoid any any early forced rotation if you don't have to does that make sense is there a better way to explain that yeah if there's in black bench if you can scale it and keep everything facing the same direction it's more effective some applications that's you don't really have to worry about that although and the reason behind that just to kind of go down that rabbit hole is that you can freeze the transformations on an object and set them all back down to zeros where it's in blockbench i haven't found that feature yet if it does exist i haven't seen it yet which which thing so being able to like freeze the transformations on objects but it doesn't seem to have that so so what i am actually doing rather than taking what i had and just kind of uh scaling it um you know like rotating it around i'm actually re-designing it and it looks like maybe it's a little too and turkey scene if you if you rotate it you can kind of break the pivot point and that's that's also kind of a thing um one of the things i found within block bench is that after i kind of move things around whether it's scale or rotation i go back and check that pivot point and just make sure that it's right where i want it and if we can keep them all facing the same direction that helps considerably yeah yeah that's cool and um you know you could we could add a like if you wanted to do like a claw hammer we could add some extra blocks and make a claw coming out the back there so it looks even more like a hammer which i really want to do but we'll hold out on that uh so let's go and now i'm going to paint and i'm going to create a texture we'll call it dude we didn't know it was going to be a hammer thanks to the the the miracle of the internet and science we now know what it is i'm not going to compress the template i like to not compress it because i want to have extra size in case i do need to change something later like if i did want to add those claws i could have a little empty more likely to have empty space in my texture for that that's why i do that um 16 by 16 let's go for it confirm there we go there's the hammer okay so we go to paint just to kind of move fairly quickly here i'm going to go to paint bucket i'm going to change the fill mode to the entire cube and i'm going to pick a color kind of brownish and when i click on the cube i get every side becomes the brown color and uh let's do let's pick a gray for this part and maybe a lighter gray for the head and then and then we could do um back to the brush where it could be like and uh what do we think there are gonna move them eyes up yeah oops all right uh you know not the best but it'll work ship it yep yep maybe you know all right we could do something like this terrible all right all right so we have uh the hammer now let's see if we can get this thing to show up in our world so let's do file and i like to kind of break them out piece by piece so i'm going to say export the bedrock geometry and i'm going to export it right into the development pack that we have so combat mojang development resource packs template models dude do you want to replace it yes okay now we're gonna save the texture as well so i'm gonna just do a save as to make sure it's going to the right place so i right click and do save as and then resource packs template remember development resource packs and then textures entity dude.json ganzo and that'll change the size of the file too you see here it gave us a by 64. we have some nice empty space to add extra stuff and it's smaller than that 512 by 512 so it'll be a smaller file size as well sue [Music] did we uh well so let's go to now animate right and so um we can add here animation dude idle i think it's animation well let's leave the this default here so animation dude idle play once we can do looping and i think i'm going to leave it at that for right now and then in this yes it's your it's your invention sergey so uh thank you we'll see if we can get this this this hammer smacking people okay so now we need to do we need to do a super basic uh walk cycle here right so we're going to first of all i'm going to click on the leg one and i'm gonna click on like two and you see they they show up they show up here so um actually no this is the idle so i'm gonna leave those there i'm gonna click on the head there's the head and so one of the things we can do is we can keyframe the center and then we can have it kind of look so i'm going to move the timeline along a little bit and i'm going to move the head on this rotation so let's just say the hammer is kind of patrolling for somebody and then what you can do here is you should be able to copy this keyframe and then go here and paste it so it'll kind of put you back to where it started so the loop is going to be a nice and clean loop so let's see what happens yeah so if i mean it's it's awful but um but it's ours but it's ours uh i would probably make the uh the rotation a little bit smaller so it doesn't look as uh surveillance camera ish oh gosh okay all right i'm screwing things up here okay so zing screwed it up you can go here off to the side and change that to uh you know 12 and now click okay that's awful but i love it okay so we're gonna we're gonna leave that as idle and then one of the things we can do now is we can do the um the walk so we're going to add this and say walk same deal with looping and then confirm and so we have to bring in the legs now we have the walk highlighted on the left and then we can click on leg one and click on leg two and we can we'll keyframe we'll do the same thing with the rotation of both and see if we did our pivot points properly so so leg two let's go ahead and squeeze that up a little and then leg one squeeze that back a little is going to be so but uh arts by kev does a really great walk cycle tutorial this is not that tutorial this is not that tutorial uh we're already pushing our time but uh yeah i think you know let's let's give ourselves a little more time here are you okay on time guideline or do you have to be good yep okay cool um yeah i want to i want to get through this so i i'm going to move this other leg here and this leg will move back and then we'll do a similar thing where we i think we can actually drag and drop to to or drag to collect keyframes bring them out here can you make eyes blink in a texture yeah so so the the changing textures is a um a render controller thing one swapping textures but i think you you can uh create like a texture atlas that that animates as well um definitely won't be able to cover that in this one okay good enough good enough okay so we have our two different animations so if we go to animation save all animations and i'm going to go to the com.mojang resource pack folder template animations i'm going to say dude.animation putting it into a different file just to see what's going on okay so now i'm going back to visual studio code uh you see here our texture is showing up that's cool our model what did we just do animations let's take a quick look at dude so we have animation dude idol remember the this is our identifier this is important so animation dude idol animation dude walk and it has all the different what uh the timeline go back to your entity remember our and i i i did this kind of intentionally because we have to make sure that the name of the animation in the animation folder is is listed here on the bill of lading for the entity so i'm actually going to remove the word geometry i think that's a little excessive so animation dude idle and animation dude walk i'm going to save that i'm going to go back to dude animation dude idol animation dude walk all right i'm going to delete the starter one now no i won't actually i'll leave it um just so we have it as a reference point so last thing to point out and to look at when we go to our entity the entity is just to just to explain here so idle is kind of like i'm going to know the idol animation as idol i'm going to know the walk animation as walk so if i want those animations to run i no longer have to call them by their formal names i call them by the short names that i have defined here so that's where you see like in scripts when we're trying to tell what animations to run we're saying run the idle animation which is connected to this actually to find one run the walk animation which is defined to this one so i think um this entity might still be ridable i was thinking about that which could be i was just thinking like if we should add a random stroll to it so it walks but but let's i'm curious to see what happens when we when we hop on it did we cover everything we've got our generic render controller which we don't have to mess around with uh you can see it's just kind of picking all the defaults controller render generic is connected here controller render generic okay i think i think we're going to go into our world yeah make sure you save all of those files before yeah and the quick the quick way to tell is if they have a white circle yeah is this a weird uh situation here why are you not yeah you got the extra stream oh yeah maybe that was like the welcome window or something like that but you would see like if i make a change i hit space on here you see this white dot that means you have an unsaved change so make sure there's no white dots in your files in visual studio code okay summon dude oh that's good hey oh it's a baby and look it's idling right click we're writing it okay it doesn't animate when we uh oh yeah it is animating our seats a little off and our health is a little crazy but you can see because it's moving it's running it's running the movement animation and when it stops it runs the idle animation he is looking around but we did it we created a custom we created a custom entity that was our goal did we just accomplish that you might say we nailed it you're a genius you're a genius so uh that was great scale is important right so uh that is a large shadow so okay so good throw some so throw some questions if you're still with us and kind of following along or have questions so um my observation is darn it small and one of the things you could do in blockbench that's helpful edit if you go into the preferences settings and the grid if you put large box on i think that's the one this is cool it it gives you a better sense of the size you know because a a one by one block is like a grass block it's just a cube so we we've made this barely bigger than than a block in minecraft so we didn't have a good sense of scale also we didn't know it was going to be a hammer until it was you know until it was born into the world so um having a better plan and scaling appropriately is helpful so keep that in mind if you do need to tweak some things let's let's go and make a change real quick so we're going to go into the behavior pack in the behavior pack lives the in the entities for dude in our in our behavior pack we have scale so if i want to make it two times bigger i can change the scale of the entity now if uh of course we have scale in here in our template but if uh if it doesn't exist we go grab it and and bring it in and so we have a collision box that's where that kind of dictates the shadow so let's let's make the collision box a width of 0.5 and a height of 2. and see if our shadow is a little better i also want to change the health the other thing we can do is there's a behavior called random stroll so if you think of like i want to walk around like a pig does or like a like a cow does that if you look at the actual cow and those other entities they have a thing called random stroll and again this doesn't have our sample code so what we'll do what's up cars man hey this knicker is the snazz curies okay this is looking very great i always do mistakes in the empty json resource when adding new entities spent hours to get it done yeah uh i agree like the it's hard to get those details right and sometimes it's also difficult to get the right version numbers because sometimes you'll get like an you'll see the shadow but you won't see the entity and you'll be like i'm so close um and a lot of times uh either version numbers could be an issue in you know like your render controller and stuff like that uh so i'm going into here and i'm going to look at let's say i look at cow and i'll make this bigger and i'll do ctrl f to find and i'll look at stroll and you can see here the cow has a random stroll as a priority 6 with a speed multiplier of 0.8 so it actually when it's strolling around it's kind of slower speed as a multiplier um so we can copy that section go into our hammer paste that in and i could change you could change the multiplier let's change to 1.2 make it a little faster and uh you could change the priority it's kind of like the priority is like what it what it sees as its priority so like if an entity goes in water you want floating to be a high priority instead of strolling around because you don't want to start to drown if it's if it's in the water so you might make floating top priority and then like if it's not in the water floating will be bypassed and it'll pick the other things but maybe you can make it a little bit slower okay you want me to make a little bit slower okay give it some give it some swagger we can we can we can do 0.6 save so back to our world we have to always save and quit so uh we have to get out of the world and go back in and worst case scenario if you're really sure you got it right close the game and reopen the game but in this case with the development behavior packs it should reload everything from scratch hey look at that and there it goes it's walking walking around ah okay that's cool and the shadows are annoying on entities it's just kind of the way it is you can do work to get rid of them but it's it's a little bit risky it's a little bit risky of a thing to mess around with so you might have to just embrace shadows in general i think the we'll do our next our next stream i'm thinking uh we i love the hammer attack so i think we're gonna add like a hammer attack which is great because it's a behavior it's gonna target the player like so if i if i do game mode zero right now i'm in survival mode the hammer doesn't see me as an enemy it doesn't target me not even looking at me as uh like there's not even a look at player behavior so there's lots of things we can tweak there if you're watching this video you gotta hear this uh and you've stuck around with us to get this far go ahead and post some comments on what you want to see and we'll try to integrate that into into the process but uh i'm i'm feeling pretty good about this anybody any last questions gatlin you what are your thoughts got anything to add on that well i like the idea of doing the attack for sure but i'm also like let's put some particles in there because i'm a particle guy i love that stuff you do love the particles and the sounds oh and the audio yes and the audio right so these are the things we still have to get to we have to get to adding particle effects we have to get to mama bell it's okay i i was curious about your your tweet because i thought you were you're one hour behind us and you must be a night owl like myself but um but yeah you can watch the re watch the recording we we had some fun this is what we what we created it was in the middle of the night i saw yeah i knew it had to be of course my tweet was at like two o'clock in the morning and then you came up later at um probably similar time but uh we we ended up creating this hammer and dude surveils the area um yeah so but that's kind of uh so we're talking about what we're going to do next in in that so um anyway thanks for thanks or at least uh coming in and catching us but yeah so we're going to where where was i well we've got we've got to vote for the audio so oh audio particles attack behaviors things like changing textures uh more so we can do an attack animation so we do another animation um what else is useful oh the other thing that i like is kind of interact commands you know like if we right click on this thing or punch it we can have it do different things like um one thing i like is you know if let's say this was a turret you can you can right click on it and it'll give it'll go away and give you a spawn egg and you of itself and you could drop it somewhere else so if you're playing a game and want to have replaceable turrets that you can pick up you can kind of program the interact command loot tables too yeah and the loot tables together so it's kind of uh that's a pretty cool combo so there's lots of creative stuff that we can do and add on so this is kind of where we'll take it from here the hammer will be hey when you're a hammer everything looks like a nail isn't that right pretty much and we got a we got a vote here too for uh some animated textures so um through the texture changing thing yeah yeah i i know the people to call for that true story [Laughter] you can see my texturing skills i have to really push myself to create something decent new items for loot tables okay cool all right this has been super awesome thank you guys and gals and everybody for joining us i hope this has been helpful to you definitely tweet us if you are creating your own custom entity and making some progress uh share that on twitter and all that good stuff and um you know stay tuned you're waiting for the next stream i also really want to learn how to add anime textures okay gotcha seeding the player get angry cool all right well i guess we have to close this has been a good a good stream thank everyone for joining us gatlin thanks for being here buddy absolutely and we'll talk to everyone soon see you all right later y'all", "fbti1QFtzGk": "welcome back for semi-automated today I'm going to

Leah and today we're gonna be doing some minecraft this didn't just has to right is you know is this if you were thinking why is this vehicle chocolate bar adventures well my characters is a chocolate bar if you look so today I'm gonna be showing you a micron to it stuff where are we gonna go first well first let's go do that some bleep point it's just basically mirror place and we have to go down the ladder so that was just where we run on top of there and the Tron's so we have two different apartments that on that and this is like a little color and if you want I've made many books and this is an app that's quite big so we're like right bigger so let's go to the next place the next place is another place it's quite interesting it's my first world [Music] no it's my first benefit so [Music] here right now so we have the other workers my first house I actually made this like my cheat this used to be a survival house I know so other place is quite long so I'm just gonna skip back we're gonna see this if you see here there's quite a few furnace and here is the snow problem get right this is so funny look what I found out I find this out yesterday that you can do something else so [Music] pumpkin and see there's a big statue of Jesus so I see I know this is me and these if you want to know why I spawn these guys because they spread all the snow for me I'm just gonna show you my little bitty last thing kind of nice and these are their affirmance so like if you press that button and then other ones fireworks it's purple even the Panda likes it so that might be the last thing for today but for the last thing that I'm gonna show you is this trust me I know where I'm going in this world so that's easy so R up here and we're just gonna climb up the wines and then go back to where the trauma is know where the traumas and here's the pool bar you can like okay so that might be the end for today so bye", "S_4rdwU0oT0": "this bill that he was working by snow TV SM CPE this cup is empty whoa Brian another ultra bill this is like the third one in a row I didn't subscribe to you to watch you build some crappy stuff oh I know I know guys it's my fault it's because okay the only reason why you haven't seen you know a normal video in like forever and it's just been a bunch of Minecraft stuff is because I really like Minecraft and because recently I've been working on a new video it's gonna be a normal you know like normal video that I normally do it's it's it's another stupid video it's another funny video but it has a lot of editing into it so you guys are gonna watch the video and think that there's like no editing at all except for just cuts and a bit of text but guys trust me the editing is so so hard I've I've done this like eight times already that's not an exaggeration I probably have rieta to that video a bunch of times this isn't an update video I just wanted to make a video you know pretty much talking about this but not just a whole video just talking about one video so I decided to do another ultra build I know it's like the third one in a row but that's only because with this I hop one I did I was still working on I was I started working on the video that's when I started filming it and then I started editing so go back whenever the I hop one was uploaded is when I started I officially started on that video no joke it's taken that long so the topic I'm doing right now is it's it's a chocolate bar so what I did was I you know took the concrete and then I took powdered concrete white powdered concrete to make via make the wrapping to make it looks like it's being you know ripped open excuse me but to make it look like it's being ripped open so it looked really cool and then with a chocolate I wanted to make it look like you have the little bit pieces so then you'll see I took some that's brown it's brown concrete but then I took brown terracotta I think it's called to make it you know a dark in shade of brown so you know you can see me digging through there and then you know this was not a bit long build at all only took me like five minutes but then when I sped it up it still took me two minutes so I'd normally speed it up twice so it's like twice as fast or four times as fast but this time only sped it up once beat so it's twice as fast that's why it's not like the fastest moon video but honestly I kind of do like this build I do we should have put in more detail to it like maybe a glass of milk or something Oh Anna yeah I put it a little bite mark just cuz I had a I was like man this is a really short video let me do like a bite mark or something just think of it more detail but I wished I would have made like a glass of milk next to it and a you know like a cookie next to it - that would have been cool yeah overall this may not be the best build so far but it is a pretty cool build if you guys want to see another episode of me adding like a bunch of detail to it I guess I could do that I don't know but don't worry guys either Tuesday or Wednesday in the video will be uploaded the next good one it's gonna be a good one here's a little keyword of what the next video is gonna be about shower wood what did I say oh you can't go back in the video huh totally got you guys there", "l9m5ED2yC38": "hi what is up guys Lewis here and I'm known to be going on to my minecraft server well it's not so ever but my minecraft world the arcade over here and we are going to be creating a loose objects to the world oh how do I get inside here okay um but I am on creative because I need to like quickly bills and build bill Oh God hmm okay so guys yes we are going to be adding something to our okay but I have no idea what to at surplus think wicking a massive chocolate bar a massive chocolate bar forces yeah what I took a bar I was going to say for a signature but um but now i'm captain and sleep because I change my channel but anyways guys we are going to but a chocolate bar some we need to figure let's just do it here i guess so i know he's gonna do what I'm going to need need like its type of Willie Brown this color for the whopper understand any purple anything no just do believe the whopper ok let's get started I guess that isn't it affects my camera phones you can't see me okay okay now you should be able to see my hand I just have this one okay um sir mm what about oh yeah okay dudes let's do this okay so why's it so far and then we're gonna need it boom boom hey hey Mia now I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go fish fish yeah single single actually no i'll do all go fill this up we just want it like a little bit yeah oh god okay there we go guys the Chevy worked and now why is everything breaking all I'm gonna do is like going to fill it in this way I can like got a disguise their I guess do this but yeah you see what I mean I'm like I can build a massive bomb bit for the cubes of the chocolate and I was starting to look like a cocoa mug look a chocolate bar but don't worries we shall make it look like a taco bar guys we shut up I'll make it look like hmm then boo boo damn shift and then okay so that looks pretty cool I think beyond the same line but I think it looks legit okay now actually should we put a smiley face on so then we make this like chocolate bar a bit more like boom boom boom boom boom because we won't make it smell so then it will smile okay guys seemed like a good idea no you do it too this has been on for like six minutes please I'm a beautiful face right there and yes you're probably saying oh my god why is it so blurry well i'm just going to fix that was that good about all there should be pretty good should be okay no need me to get some get some black hole black hole and white wall white wall to make um its teeth so what we want is we want black there not that anyone hawaii kai hey 32 taguig hola tin ceiling down take it on ddd load it and I'll friggin I just need one more layer of chocolate like this and what I'm gonna do is then knock I'm going to go like this boom boom boom like it's sticking out yeah like this we do a play toy mmm no I'm actually does then you can save from this place as well I do need to fix that later close it doesn't look good they do kind of need to be even I guess so it's 12 did I do don't want yeah it's all even oh my god I can't even cooking okay guys let's see if we can get a cool snap shoulders so I hope you guys can see it probably caracals for some reason my camera keeps being blurry it's probably a setting my phone got it cell phone by accident but yeah guys this is the chocolate bar we have created and yeah I will see in the next video bye", "U0uqEwcQl2E": "gosh I say so good so glad I found this chocolate facility I've been on the run every day since you guys called the cops because I robbed that Bank to make money for my club how's that a bad idea Jim's gonna kill me I want more chocolate hey what's going on Twitter's issue was severe and welcome back to another minecraft mod review this mod is called the chocolate mod and today I'm going to be showing you guys what this adds into Minecraft so I've set up a little a little system here I'm gonna show you guys all the recipes for the new stuff so let's go ahead an get started so the first thing we're gonna be looking at is the liquid chocolate and the liquid white chocolate so basically everything you see here except for the chocolate cookies and the chocolate cake there is a chocolate and white chocolate version to each one of these items so I'm gonna go ahead and show you guys both of these so basically you're gonna start with you're gonna want to start your crafting chain I guess with the liquid versions of both chocolate and white chocolate so to make liquid chocolate you're going to take some sugar on the top cocoa beans in the middle and milk on the bottom it's gonna give you liquid chocolate and to get the liquid white chocolate it's going to be one sugar on top one cocoa bean in the middle and then three milks on the bottom so moving on to the next thing that is then going to give us some chocolate bars so if we take the two liquid chocolates that's gonna give us a chocolate bar and two two more or what white chocolates that's going to give us a white chocolate bar now I might be mistaken I may have laid this out wrong I think it actually outputs two chocolate bars so let's just we'll fix that right now I think it's I'm pretty sure it's too I don't think I set that up correctly so I think it's two on the output for those now if you come over here to the chocolate cookie to make the child cookie your race we're gonna put some liquid chocolate in between pieces of wheat and you're gonna get ate chocolate cookies and to make the chocolate cake you're going to take liquid chocolate on the top and then the rest of the recipe is going to be the same as cake and you're gonna get some chocolate cake check out what this thing is like you got me it looks very good alright the next thing is a chocolate block and to get a chocolate box you're gonna combine these chocolate bars and pattern such as this you need a chocolate block and same goes for the white chocolate as well now actually before I move on I would just like to say that there are some other blocks that this mod adds if you take four of these chocolate blocks let's do this let me grab this for you guys I will show you real fast what I'm talking about here um so if you take these and you put them in a pattern like this the chocolate blocks are going to get the chocolate bricks you then take the chocolate bricks and you multiply them into more let's say you have a stack of 64 you can also make chocolate stairs like this obviously the same thing goes for white chocolate as well so all of these are both duplicated in chocolate and white chocolate and if you don't want to make chocolate shares let's say you want to make chocolate slabs you can do that very easily by just laying three across the bottom of the chocolate bricks and you're going to get the chocolate brick slabs now there is chocolate and white chocolate fences I don't know how to create these yet there was no recipe on the on the forum page so I'm not 100% sure about that but those are in the game and if you're in creative mode you can mess around and use chocolate or white chalk offenses alright the next thing we're to look at is the chocolate and white chocolate sword pretty self-explanatory a stick with two pieces of chocolate above it and this is where we're getting into the stuff you probably have noticed already in the beginning of this mod review in my inventory so let me go ahead and get rid of these things to clear this up just a little bit and base I just want to show you guys the durability of each of these items so a sword has a durability of 250 and then if we go over here basically there's chocolate armor and tools and white chocolate armor and tools so I didn't put out the recipes for these but basically you just substitute a chocolate or white chocolate bar and you lay it out exactly like you would craft boots leggings chestplate helmets all the tools even the bow and it's gonna give you what you're looking for basically so to run down the durability for each of these the durability of a chocolate helmet is 165 the durability of a childhood chest plate is 240 chocolate leggings are 225 the choco boots are 195 the bow for both is 750 and I think it's yeah the durability is the same for each of you so I'm just gonna use chocolate durability for pickaxes 250 shovels 250 access 250 and a hoe I did not do the hoe did I well Oh does it matter the basic yeah you can see the white chocolate Armour here as well white chocolate hoe and try the hoe there you can grab those as well but I didn't feel like that was super important to include in the durability list there so whatever moving on we have a chocolate Apple and a white chocolate Apple pretty self-explanatory as well you're gonna be combining a liquid chocolate with an apple or liquid white chocolate with an apple they'll give you chocolate or liquid I'm sorry it'll give you chocolate apple or white chocolate apple respectively and over here we also have a chocolate and white chocolate egg and you just combined the same thing an egg with the white chocolate or an egg with the normal chocolate and you're gonna get some chocolate or white chocolate egg goodness so that's pretty much it you guys that is the chocolate mod I hope that you enjoyed it um pretty quick little run down there and if you're a big fan of chocolate and sweets like I know I am I know if you guys have followed me for a while you know that I eat very healthy but I definitely have a sweet tooth so

started I wanted to say that I'm not the founder of this glitch actually um I was actually found here you can see it on my on my duplication video I run duplication glitch video you can see just in the comments down here there was a guy that was replying to to one of these common threads and he was saying he was explaining how to actually do the glitch in the first place so props of this guy Dan cuber I scare her here and check out his video you know give the guys some support cuz he's the one who actually found this glitch but uh yeah guys so thanks to this guy but I'll get into the video right now yo what is up guys today have probably my best video yet I'm standing right here next to the world's tallest mushroom per year and I have another glitch or have another video about the duplication glitch and it's a this is a new way of doing the glitch alright I mean it's not necessarily a new way but it's using or it's exploiting a different thing here let's see what I mean but it's the same way as my other video you just put the item in there you know you turn this on and it looks away but this time it's a little bit different this is probably the best duplication glitch in Pocket Edition history probably in console edition history and I don't know my it might even be one of the best duplication glitches ever ever in Minecraft like them I'm probably gonna get corrected on that but whatever I don't care this one's pretty damn good that's all I'm saying that's why I'm really just trying to say there are three different things that you will need this was probably yeah pretty sure this is the easiest way to do it so first of all you're going to need a little pickaxe the reason why I'm using wooden is just to show that it doesn't matter which one whatever what kind you have there's only one problem with this glitch and you'll see is that you need a Shoku box so you need a pickaxe I'm sorry pickaxe right here choker boxes in there and any sort of dye any dye that you can use on the choker box the reason why I had bone meal sitting over there by itself is because that's probably the easiest dye that you can obtain and then the next will probably be I don't know whatever the most common flowers and yeah just like the other glitches just drop your little thing in here first of all we're gonna get an item to duplicate so you know I'll just drop down one of these Long's probably have a better idea beep okay if you have a showgirl box already but anyway just put a little shelter box down see my log is in there and have the choker box in my inventory isn't really a matter how we're you having and stuff I just I could do like that make sure your dies in there and there's a really really simple trick to this I showed it in my last video about the duplication which is that when you go to craft when you go to craft a shelter box you'll see and the the schalke box will go up there and what you need to do is tap pick up the shoulder box and then the other little box will appear right here and you need to tap that I believe twice so when the shoulder box is up there when you tap the little square that's over here it'll pick up the shoulder bar when you pick up choker box and then you tap a little square right here it will send the stroke box back to your inventory but when you tap the little box over here again it will send the choker box into the left in recipe that's really all that the glitch happens when transitioning from inventory to crafting table so you don't have to even craft anything that's why it works with this really well yeah I'll just demonstrating here it dies in there my choker box what's up Oakwood is right there you can see it and I'm just gonna flip this lever and you'll see I'm gonna do that tap tap thing over and over the right in here tap this little box and what you'll see turn this on tapped it crafting tap to choke a box to have to choke the white shoulder box again and you just tap DoubleTap tap DoubleTap double tap that button eventually if you can do it right it will ask a lot of the times it doesn't work and you see I you can accidentally craft a bone block so recommend typing this and boom Renta or it will pertain to whatever dye you have so don't accidentally craft anything else so not the way we deal with the dye in there the white chocolate box pick up the choker by double tap the white shelf about it's on the on the left not on the right and just keep doing this over and over eventually it'll work it doesn't look like it's there go boom s'alright oh my god happened twice I get that I don't know I have to say okay you see I think it was I think it was actually just a visual glitch so I didn't actually do Katie but I didn't actually duplicated clients just one let's see look that's why you have the pickaxe Canyon that's why you have the pickaxe s to break the choker boxes and this is also not only does it duplicate all the items inside the shoulder bumps but it duplicates the chakra box itself that's probably the best part so while you're doing this let's see how many oak logs that can get from just one I already have two in something you see right there sometimes you actually lose bone meal really happens but it's it's another problem with the which instead of duplicating it you have to delete one that happens a lot and luckily this only takes one bone meal because it will whenever that happens it's the same thing as duplicating it it's it's less likely for it to delete the item but it can't happen and it's the same type of glitch that's duplicating it you accidentally do instead of duplicating luckily it only requires one bone meal where more requires two if it were to require two bone meal and every time the glitch went wrong it would really to it and that's not really important so let's get back into this assuming I can get the old BAM you saw right there see that many times you missed quite a lot this is probably gonna be the easiest on there go probably gonna be the easiest on okay we'll see right now that's one extra one look at that or lobs you can see this is you can see where this is going imagine if I had started out with a full shoulder box of like diamond blocks or something like that I mean if you have that many in the first place what the heck can do in duplicating but you see what I mean this is ope super o P actually that's good let's get away with these boring old logs and let's give myself what do we want to do here what I see it right there beacons beacon I don't know 128 I said a couple stacks only two of this you'll see alright guys recording messed up for Tet but anyways gets get back right into this so I have to choke a box with two stacks of beacons here and I will show you just how freakin all penis just glitches and I really wish I was a founder for this but I cannot take credit for this this is insane so put that on and spam away that is already duplicated at once oh god I'm concentrating I failed failed so you get it look at that bang bang boom boom take that you guys can see where this is going [Music] completely overpowered this is really cool and guess what else you can do all watch this pop somebody's in the shelter box as well since you can't put a choker box inside of a show collects shells have been there this is this is Opie her down they lost three three bone now maybe it has something to do with when the duplication you lose one that might be what's happening there I don't know because it's the exact amount I've lost and the exact amount game from stroker boxes if that any sense at all from it anyways just see here okay duplicate it looks really an broke do I even grow but I even have to try man on accident you paid it twice oops no not never mind rich again look at this I don't even think I need showcase this anymore this is more than overpowered insane insane look at that I've got my chakra boxes ahead now yeah I guess what long sticky blog's always do kidding I can only get one chest I think you think I'll be able to get one I mean I can make two extra sofa boxes you see if I had more wood or anything like that look how many showers I have insane insane duplication which I am you can duplicate any item in the game any amount of times this is not even this is not even oh my god this overpowered overpowered turn survival mode integrative pretty much you can oh you you could also duplicate like a dragon egg I don't know what else I think you can only get one dragon egg not sure not sure how many you can actually get in without cheating but I mean now you can have as many as you want well yeah guys well I'm also gonna show you this I'm just gonna put myself and created for this a little guy then the same guy the same genius bag he showed me this foot also like this variant of the duplication there's also show me this pretty sure this is above this is kind of cool I guess I think if I break it it won't give me some well let's do this with the random chakra box in a dispenser you see it's the normal purple one summaries and funny dispense it turns white that is weird I'm off it's supposed to say the color on the top but it doesn't for this I bet you if I break it's not gonna yeah yeah [Music] happen [Music] mr. show he's this little miniature bonus to glitch see right here Vince that Barrett there somehow it stays white recessive that's a book but there you go it's a mini glitch inside of the most Opie duplication glitch in the world plus the tallest mushroom tree ever seen in your life if you want to see it I'll give it to you I don't know why you want this anyways anyways yeah you guys see just the power of this crazy killer trainer you can use again you can use any one of these dies put this up in there so you sure you're gonna forget about you just want to use any one of those dies ink sacs bonemeal lap is any one of the whether you get these from didn't get these from sheep my just being look at this duplication material over here exampling forgot to make done she's crafted or something yes you do duplication material right there freaking there oh also it has to be the number one lender Oh or does it really nope does not have to be you know more nevermind guy right there without with hanging color again does that mean that you can die oh you can die at one shoulder box an infinite number of times yep yep so it doesn't even matter if you accidentally do this or whatever if somehow I don't know you can have any color I guess did not know that but anyways you guys see how overpowered this book says look at that I just doubled everything if you do again double it again overpowered yeah I don't even know if this can be patched maybe maybe not I don't know they would have to fix this weird problem with the crafting table with the item I don't know really weird but anyways I really hope you guys like this video I'm gonna show you guys my skin again nothing did in my last well you see what I named the world and do good version to I can't even get to explain I can't even get to explain how overpowered duplication which is how short my little misery guy barely like double decides on the test that you got short yes especially anyways guy yeah you guys um yeah this is a most overpowered glitch ever seen in her lifetime I did not find it but I did find this version of it like without shocker boxes like this version but formerly me I just mess it this machine like this machine here design by post box path and I got into it I explained it a little more in my other video the machine was made by post box fat and then Skippy came out on a head with a video that kind of made me want to try to switch he a know what his deal with it was he couldn't he couldn't get it to work in a normal world but I mean I tried within minutes I got it to work I don't know what he did wrong with so that works then this random dude random genius came and message came and comment on my my video I'll probably just do a short clip of that like show you guys really on the comments and stuff he just showed me all right he just told me like hey did you use Ashoka box I couldn't get it to work at first but it's because I was doing it backwards I was putting the shelter boxes in there we're supposed to put the dye in there so yeah only the only bit of credit I get is like find out that this which works in survival finding out how to make it work like I'm the only one who did a video about not actually crafting it and then I don't know if that guy who decided to show up a box idea I don't know if he took inspiration for my video like I did from Skippy but whatever the case here's this crazy duplication but it's found by sort of me sort of postbox fat and that Dan cubed that and genius cuber channel and is a little common through it pretty cool pretty cool anyways guys I'm I'm out of here hopefully you guys really enjoyed this new mess of this place yeah I mean also if you want to see it again okay oh dude I thought that was a pink mushroom tree pink looks pink anyways never mind uh yep there you go all the guys choker box and you need a pickaxe so you can break it you can break it by hand and it was still dropped one percent sure about that in fact we'll test as I'm talking ya guys hopefully you guys enjoyed this the most Opie duplication glitch in the world anyways yeah peace out I don't recommend destroying your survival world with this but if you want to have some fun go write a freakin head all man you can I said this in my other duplication but you can totally have use achievements with this but that's messed up don't do that I don't recommend it I don't recommend it I do not recommend even though I'm not very good I'm not a very good role model because I have my act PvP videos I have my real weird exploiting skin have this most Opie duplication on the planet and don't follow after me anyways that is you guys later why every time I make a video it's like 10 times longer than it needs to be but anyways guys finally I'm dipping out of here I get this video out [Music] like 12:30 wearing in something close to that anyways yeah see you guys later um uncle guys enjoyed this and peace out check out my hat PvP video season 2 per man just came out anyways see you guys later", "SIyF1ZodZlY": "Let\u2019s face it \u2026 the chocolate bars we\nchoose to eat can make or break our day. If we decide to try one out and it\u2019s absolutely\nawful, and it later vanishes from store shelves, it\u2019s no big loss. But those epic chocolate bars we love from\nthe first bite can definitely cause us to be transported somewhere else entirely \u2026 in\na good way. And it\u2019s these bars we end up missing the\nmost if they vanish. Here are 10 discontinued chocolate bars we\nmiss - part 1. Kit Kat Caramac Well, by now we all know that caramel and\nchocolate go very well together. After all, the Caramilk bar is pretty famous\nand many enjoy its rich and pleasurable combination, almost as much as they love playing the game\nof trying to figure out how the caramel is inserted into the exquisite bar. So it\u2019s no wonder that other chocolate bar\nbrands wanted to get in on the game as well. It wasn\u2019t too long ago that Kit Kat released\nthis caramel bar, and although Kit Kat is known to release some pretty odd flavor pairings\nwhen it comes to their bars, this one was pretty run of the mill, as they say. And although there were a few that enjoyed\nit, perhaps it was its simplicity and run with the norm that caused its untimely demise,\nas many are and were used to Kit Kats that were outside the regular sort to be a tad\nmore extravagant. After all in Japan, there are over 50 astonishing\nflavors offered in the form of the Kit Kat bar we know and love. Perhaps caramel was a little too simple to\nsatisfy fans of the bar and its forays into the wild and crazy flavors offered. But, there are those that miss this one. 2005 marked the last time this one was seen\nin stores. Taz The Cadbury Confectionery Company goes way\nback, and when we say \u201cway back\u201d, we mean really back there on the old timeline. Is 195 years way back enough for ya? We thought so. It\u2019s true \u2026 the company got its start\nback in 1824 and well, it hasn\u2019t looked back since, releasing chocolate treat after\nchocolate treat, and although not all of the treats created by the great minds at Cadbury\nwere instantaneous hits, they have created some of the most important and successful\nchocolate bars the world has ever seen. But unfortunately, some of these have gone\nthe way of boxy television sets and the only way you can taste them now would be to travel\nback in time, and that isn\u2019t all that possible \u2026 just yet. And it wasn\u2019t that long ago that Cadbury\nand Warner Bros. Studios teamed up to create a chocolate bar that offered a whirlwind of\nflavor. The ever-popular character of The Tasmanian\nDevil definitely reached across the screen and touched audiences all over, and why not. Maybe it was the gibberish he spoke, or rather\nthe tornado he represented moving from scenario to scenario \u2026 whatever it was, he surely\nbecame a household name. So creating a chocolate bar that featured\nhis essence was a no-brainer on the part of the good people over at Cadbury. But like so many things from the years gone\nby, it fell out of favor with consumers, and that\u2019s a definite shame, as it would be\nnice to hold onto some of the things from our long-gone past, wouldn\u2019t it? Cadbury\u2019s Snowflake Now what could sound more appetizing or refreshing\nthan a snowflake? Can you remember being a kid and waiting for\nthat first snowfall of the winter season? Many watched the sky on a slow Sunday afternoon\nhoping for that first snowfall. The snow that would come signified countless\nhours of fun outdoors, whether it be snowball fights, the construction of towering snowmen\nand of course forts and tobogganing down the neighborhood hill. But for many, opening your mouth and sticking\nout your tongue and letting the fresh snowflakes land ever so softly was probably the highlight\nof the first snowfall, and we have no doubt that this was the sentiment Cadbury was going\nfor here. Now, we understand that a snowflake sure doesn\u2019t\npack a tasty wallop worthy of praise or delight, but it\u2019s the essence of the craving for\nthat first snowfall that likens the experience to a chocolate bar, as what can you crave\nmore than a sweet piece of chocolate? The comparison is actually quite fair; at\nleast for us that is, but we\u2019re sure you agree. Cadbury\u2019s Snowflake bar wasn\u2019t launched\nall that long ago. At the turn of the century in fact \u2026 in\nthe year 2000, but it didn\u2019t stay on the shelves all that long, as it was discontinued\nin 2008, but we sure had a good eight years, didn\u2019t we? Yes indeed, and oh the memories.. Mars Delight Just try to imagine how good a particular\nitem of food would have to be to create in people the type of wanton desire to inspire\nthem to start online petitions for the return of said particular item. You think we\u2019re kidding, but in reality\nthis happens far more often than you\u2019d likely imagine. Now Mars isn\u2019t as old and established as\nCadbury, but in its 87 years, the company sure has released quite a few tasty treats\nthat many have adored and even cherished. The Mars Delight is an obvious one that people\nstill miss to this day. The bar was very different from the classic\nMars Bar and perhaps it was this that made it so popular, as many consumers like change. It contained a wafer coated in caramel cream\nas opposed to nougat and plain caramel. It was coated in milk chocolate and that is\nthe only similarity between the two offerings. Cadbury's Nuts About Caramel Cadbury has tried to play the caramel card\nover and over again, time after time, and why wouldn\u2019t they? After all, they produced one of the most successful\nchocolate bars the world has ever seen. The Caramilk bar is composed mainly of caramel\nand they have used that sweet ingredient time and time again in a plethora of imaginative\nways. But in the end, it is the Caramilk bar that\nwins out and stands the test of time. It was created in 1968 and has sold a lot\nof units over the long years of its existence. But still, the fact that it\u2019s still around\ndoesn\u2019t halt people from missing the other bars offered by the company, like this one\nhere. Now the essence of the Cadbury Nuts About\nCaramel bar lies within the appropriate name, and it was the nuts that made it different\nfrom the classic Caramilk bar, and also what probably made it a little less popular, as\nthere are many out there that don\u2019t particularly like nuts in their sweets. But, the company even released ice cream bars\nthat shared the same name and list of ingredients, and although they did well, both items were\nlast seen quite some time ago. The 54321 Bar The actual title 5-4-3-2-1 was the name of\na song by the British Band: Manfred Mann, the group that brought the world `Blinded\nBy The Light,` a song actually written by the one and only legend, Bruce Springsteen. That was way back in 1964, however, and the\n54321 chocolate bar was a child of the eighties\u20141982 to be exact\u2014and it sold particularly well. However, it didn\u2019t survive the eighties,\nas it was discontinued in 1989, and it\u2019s still sorely missed by many to this day. The popular commercial featured a song that\nwas very reminiscent of sixties British rock/pop, so maybe the name borrowed from Manfred Mann\nwasn\u2019t exactly coincidental. In reality, it is in fact the same song, only\nwith the lyrics changed. It\u2019s also a title to a semi-popular Flo\nRida song entitled \u201cTurn Around 54321.\u201d But the similarities between the two songs\nstop there of course. The name for the bar however, came from the\nfive different ingredients that composed the bar: fused water, rice crispies, fondant,\nmilk chocolate, and of course caramel. The bar promised and delivered an explosive\nflavor that many are still dreaming about. Jacob\u2019s Trio Yet another chocolate bar on our illustrious\nlist of chocolate bars sorely missed by the masses, that got its start in the eighties,\nand while the era was a time for \u201cpartying,\u201d we\u2019d surely say that it was also a time\nfor tasty treats and of course epic Saturday Morning cartoons. We mention cartoons because the advertisement\nfor this chocolate bar actually was shot entirely as a cartoon and probably this was done on\npurpose. A catchy tune and tagline were also added\nto the commercial and the general public was hooked from the first reel of the ad. The song was a play on the ever-popular \u201cDay-O,\u201d\ninstead replacing the lyrics with Trio. The cartoon accompanying the song was cute\nin and of itself and featured the cartoon character of Suzy in hot pursuit of a large\nshipment of Trio bars. Simple enough, yet oh-so-effective. The bar was discontinued in 2003 but unbelievably,\nit made a return in 2016 after a campaign was launched for its return on Facebook, believe\nit or not. The power of united voices, huh? Mars' White Maltesars As they say, white chocolate isn\u2019t for everyone,\nand as the limited time these treats had on the shelves will prove, there\u2019s more to\nthe statement after all. Maltesers are pretty popular and the regular\nsort can still be found, but the white chocolate ones had a definitely limited run on the market. Yet another offering by the Mars Company,\nthese treats were adored by those who love white chocolate and would do anything to get\na mere taste of the substance any chance they get. Yet the lack of sales overall is what caused\nthis chocolate to be taken off the shelves and subsequently halted completely. Now there are many other white chocolate brands\nout there of course, but the airy and light taste that these particular treats brought\non is sorely missed by many white chocolate lovers the world over. Nestle\u2019s Toffo Here, the essential star ingredient in this\nbar by Nestle is all in the name, or rather a play on the name. And toffee is an adored treat loved by many\nthe world over. Toffee is made by combining both caramel and\nmolasses and the end result is nothing short of spectacular. So many treats like candies, desserts, cookies\nand of course chocolate bars contain this star ingredient, and the high impact flavor\nit brings can definitely be attributed to the success this treat enjoyed back in its\nday. Nestle has been processing food products since\n1866, and for the subsequent 153 years, they\u2019ve been bringing treats and products to the masses\nwithout ever halting on production. They\u2019ve released one food product after\nanother, particularly in the confectionery category, and all of these products have done\nwell. On the rare occasion, however, they did have\na few misfires, and after all, who hasn\u2019t had a few so-called missteps on their rise\nto prominence. The Toffo bar, which should have just been\ncalled the Toffee Bar, let\u2019s face it, struggled in its day to reach that global acceptance\nthat the company had hoped for. But it surely had its fans, of course, and\nthey are all missing this treat to this very day, still dreaming about the rich taste and\ntexture. But they can dream all they want, as it won\u2019t\nbe returning any time soon \u2026 unless somebody starts an online petition that is. As we\u2019ve learned, that tactic seems pretty\neffective. Fox\u2019s Echo Bars Echoes are still a wonderment shared by many,\nas the rebound of one\u2019s voice or any sound for that matter is pretty spectacular and\none of nature\u2019s many interesting phenomena. And speaking of phenomenal things this planet\nhas to offer, the many treats and bars we all enjoy can be considered pretty amazing\nas well. Aptly named, the Echo Bar was just that and\nthe combination of white chocolate and milk chocolate brought the best of both worlds\ntogether. In essence, the bar was primarily milk chocolate\nand if we can be granted the opportunity to juxtapose the chocolate echo with a real life\necho, you should see the same similarities and conclusions we came up with \u2026 the milk\nchocolate resembles the original voice called out into the vast mountains \u2026 the white\nchocolate represents the echo heard in return, as the echo heard is never quite the same\nas what\u2019s put out there. With us so far? No? We kind of lost the point as well, but it\nwas worth a try. Regardless, the echo definitely packed a punch\nworthy of its praise, and if you\u2019d like to give it a try, we\u2019re afraid you can\u2019t. Just imagine if you will, singing loud and\nproud into a valley expecting an echo in return, only to hear an utter and mocking silence\ncome back at you in return.

Pocket Edition again and wait oh i thought i was in creative for a second because earlier when i went on I was actually in creative and it was super duper cool and because I got to fly around and everything and it was just kind of funny because it was like a glitch that happened um so anyway guys um um one of the reasons that i'm making this video today is so that i could test out something that i got for christmas and by the way i hope you all had a fabulous christmas and you all got what you wanted and unfortunately I did not get one thing on my Christmas list and ace bandage I don't know why I asked for that but I just did um anyway um uh as so the thing I got for Christmas was a mic it's like a microphone that will make me like my set my sound on the camera like I don't know how to explain it but it will make you it'll make it so you can hear me better so um I hope this benefits everyone who's watching my videos unless you don't want to hear me talk which is kind of sad yeah but anyway um purpose the real purpose of the video is so we could is playing build battle as usual I don't think I've ever made a video where I wasn't on not ever ever made a video but like I don't think I've ever not made a video that's been on high pixel for pop condition that wasn't that wasn't like um for bill huddle I don't know why it's so hard to explain this stuff doo-doo-doo game will start in 15 seconds 13 seconds 11 too annoying 8 oops don't ring to the pool six five four three two one go chocolate I can do this I can do this why don't we do all Hershey's bar not draw build a Hershey bar that could be cool you have to my admit I'm having trouble speaking today do to do to do I don't know how I'm gonna build this um I think yeah there's gonna be enough space I think we're good I'm pretty sure British o war um so I'm going to make it a hershey on it and it's going to look amazing as soon as I get to that stage I guess until I'm not building like the walls um speaking of which i was playing this game what a completely unrelated subject i was playing his game and it was kind of like it was it was based off of minecraft where you got to pick your character actor steve and you could look like beginning minecraft and you have to build a house and chop down trees and it's like an hour of code thing and which is kind of cool and what hour of code is is teaching kids about how to code stuff and it's pretty cool and I recommend you to check it out so but but for now let's just um I don't know if we're going to have enough space let's just focus on building this Hershey bar um this her treat Hershey bar is not how I thought it was going to be let's get rid of that her shoes idea because it's not going to fit um yep out out of my chocolate bar doo-doo-doo mmm I don't know I'm gonna win this probably not I never win except for that one time when I wasn't recording actually I was recording but came out really bad and I had to do it again huh and that's exactly it's exactly my luck every single try and I try to record but yep whenever I am another whenever I'm not recording I have really good luck with this stuff but whenever i am recording it always turned out really bad and then I go and I and then I get sad and it's not it's not it's not fun guys it's not fun being sad so turn that frown upside down and watch my videos because I hope they're funny and you would joy them and I yep yep that's exactly what I had to say gotta get it out the way delayed away it looked like this looks a bit like a phone charger what if we made a face on the other side no I don't have time um what does i made like I know I don't have time what if I made this nope apparently not it's a chocolate explosion I have fencing my inventory this one's not that bad so I'm going to give it a good air into the wall nothing I'm sorry I'm sorry because there's nothing here it's a collar with hawk it's a cobblestone person hello Cabo man cobblestone and um it's like Hershey's chocolate I'm just a hopes I didn't get to vote is it like I get what it is so I'm going to get in ok I get like that I don't know um it's Elvis um good job mmm the platter chocolate no it's super buu not a poop good like who diz off like platters of chocolate I don't really know I'm sorry like I try not to be harsh with my judging but I'm sorry I'm just hard uh I guess it's like it's like chocolate Legos um oh I get it it's like straight up good job um this is okay I bet if I didn't wait so long thinking I would have been able to UM get this indie done I can't vote for my own build up so people are super pooping it's not nice see this is what I mean I'm I try not to be too bad i judging um or harsh but that was okay i don't know if i hit good or ok mmm there seems to be a lot of people up this one run good job buddy i'm going to congrat congratulate every single person who wins from now on i think i have good job everyone a new game what were the people i think this is the up not working really really really where where are the people who are supposed to be there who say start game or go back to hub my earrings which now hmm oh wait can you fly oh no no I can't wait what wait what I can't even supposed to be able to fly but I can I'm creative but I can't um I get this theme and I don't know what it is so I'm gonna get back when I do know something but the name of the scene means so yeah I'll be right back hey guys I'm back and as you can see there the theme is pickaxe and I'm kind of excited for this one because hey it's like something that has to do with Minecraft that we're building and nothing ever has to do with Minecraft and this game it's like all drawing real life stuff and pickaxes I guess to exist in real life but like they you know what I mean right and just like more common in Minecraft I guess I don't know not the miners doo doo doo doo doo I don't know how far this is going to go out like the handle thing but yeah I think that well one more my guess maybe I think that okay yeah and I think what would this would go this would go like this hmm one two three trying to decide if this really looks like a pickaxe hope that's not what it looks like um actually whoa like a stick don't sticks you on now hmm I think it looks this looks whoa I can didn't let me look down then it's like when you do this okay um actually he goes in the mic wait let me see this is they have it out yeah it has like a little thing at the top where it like this dick goes through the thing so I could pull out the others died and like it like sticks out at the top like that thing right there you can't think where I'm talking about cuz I don't know her yep here it is that doesn't look bad hmm look too bad does it I mean I'm thinking not you know I don't think it looks too bad now what if I made a what if i made like a bunch of they were what if I did this hmm I wish knows how to quick relay to do this like just put a bunch of it down and if I don't like this idea it's going to be like really really really hard to take down so I better like it so far I am and then I can add other words you got that I don't think and oh the person is not trying to steal my idea or she I don't know hmm no it's okay it isn't good it's epic epic epic oh that most people I guess are doing diamond ones but this one actually is pretty good because most people did diamond ones and not all pick Zach pickaxes in Minecraft our diamond ones um is that a monkey I doesn't quite look like a pickaxe oh this is like all the pickaxes um that one's legendary because there's multiple ones and I never would have had time to do that this one's good it's not exactly the color the pickaxe neither was the last one but it's still like really good i like their idea that's what i was going to try to do if i had more time um i think it says hi but not sure but i didn't get to vote on I can't see anything but I'm gonna give it an ok here's mine we do you like my pickaxe any button and any one onion and it looks like it and rolled my magnifying glass bit it's not that bad I can see were you growing but it looks like you went a little too tedious I can't see anything but most people are giving it poops on this one run the game this one is good good job good job I it was not that bad a good job anyway so at those two rounds so i am going mean to have to end the video here I hope you enjoyed this and actually I don't want to start a new game so I'm going to just go back here and i hope you enjoyed this video and i hope you will be joining me next time

another stream this time though this time instead of fortnight we have done something a little different we're going to play minecraft however we're gonna play it for I don't know how long two to three hours maybe longer probably not longer than that but it's gonna be a very very long stream and we're gonna see how far can I get into the game before I in the stream maybe can I even beat the game or no I doubt it but so what I'm doing is a hard mode survival world and I have cheats on right but the only thing that I'm the only cheat that I have is keep inventory that's the only thing that I have and we're gonna name the world mega shorter know Vegas stream there we go and create come on there we go so how far can I get into the game before dying Arab not before dying but you get it mmm how far Casey did you just try to spell sheave what okay so here we go let's see I don't know how long I'm gonna make this probably gonna be very long so let it be known that I haven't forgot about the other minecraft stream the one that seems like it's been forgotten that has ten parts been a long time since we've done that Casey and I but um I haven't forgot about that we'll get back to it eventually I just haven't really felt like I wanted to play this game and I didn't really want to play that world because since we're so far into it I kind of wanted to have her start over real quick start over see what I can do and so I'm doing this and I say I feel like you'll be pretty cool seeing how far I can get before like in the next two hours or so because I've got the only reason I'm doing this I got nothing to do so I mean yeah so I guess that's kind of cool yep this over here now make sure I get the preferred amount wait what oh yeah okay okay make sense alright so if you guys want more for tonight well if you guys do want more for tonight let me know but if you guys want more minecraft in the future and you want me to do this again because I will try to finish this out if you want hit that like button if you guys want me to if you do want me to finish this out entirely I will just let me know subscribe and get the bell if you haven't already if you would like to see me playing some games we do fortnight minecraft other shenanigans mostly for at night though because that's what's normal normally the people want to see which is kind of weird I don't know why you know Whitewood you know all right I gotta go find some sheep I saw some earlier there's a cow only care about the cows is where are the Sheep at okay there's one how long will it take to punch you turn ourselves let's hit you with this that'll work alright let me check the comment real quick it said I got a comment just now and now it's like no she you spelled Shiva wrong again spelled sheave wrong again nope nope hey where are the Sheep he'll cause stupid just running around push Eve no ow oh that's cool I'm just looking for sheep though I just want to get a bed as quick as possible because if I do that then we can go to sleep when it's nighttime not have to deal so the garbage that it throws at me there's a lot of K oh my lord okay maybe we kind of have to good start whoops give me one of those oh my god okay very good start I don't know where the music won no kind of scared cow there's no minecraft music no might as well just get my stone while I'm down here I need 14 more so yeah if you weren't here when I started it when I started the stream the whole goal of this is just to see how far I can get in the next however many hours I decide to do this and when I say however many hours I don't mean like six I'm not doing something absurd but I am gonna see how far I can do this so that this should be fun I do enjoy this game I feel like I should play it more often because it's a game that people do enjoy no I do have my organization I gotta organize and when I get my bed I can actually put it in here like I normally do I put my bed and my torches there well I don't actually have a slot for my bed I just leave it there until I get torches all right up we go okay um sheep chicken I need sheep I need two more have you seen any sheep no okay I don't care take your XP though thank you I won't kill you you seem like a nice fella all right I haven't checked the comments in a while let me do that real quick [Music] Seve Shrieve 66 hours okay I'm not gonna stream this for 66 hours that seems see that that seems absurd come on God what happened to the Sheep you know what give me a second let me just just make sure the music's on I feel like it's not audio/music said 100 what the heck is up play penile child what does that mean I mean I know what I know what the first word means but like you see all right you never know when I'll find like two other black sheep if I just happen to you know well here come see ya can they get one they get one color just get it up a little bit one more one more only one more and then I'll leave the sheep alone for the rest of the game most likely promise okay there are a lot of caves here let me just get some coal okay I'm dumb okay alright okay okay it's how far we can get in like a couple hours or a few hours let's not waste the whole time trying to mine one freaking piece of coal alright alright so again if you guys want to see me do this again oh my god it goes even deeper alright I'll have to remember that I just want to get my the last cheat people quick remember if you guys want me to do this again hit that like button let me know in the comments after the stream is over because live stream of chat does not last there is one live stream chat does not last forever and there's a village over there oh my god okay perfect so we're gonna have to remember that there was a cave over here okay okay can I have to remember that there was a cave over here okay very good all right I've been getting a lot of comments recently I'll check those meow oh no I missed this game squirrel chipmunk that was worth it okay I think we'll go to the village first there's horses here man this is all going so well now zombie or a horse I feel like it was the horse all right to the village we go but first that is - there we go very helpful okay um let's just go check it out okay you know what I will kill sheep for their meats there's a hardware well actually now that I think about it I could just get the freaking hey I could just get the stupid hay from these places because that makes life a lot easier if I get enough hay I'll basically have enough food to last me probably this entire stream as long as I can serve my food all right hello villagers ah I should probably eat very low hungry oh let's go oh yeah two emeralds give me all this give me at all alright okay hopefully you guys have more than just that okay I'll take a little bit of bread is that I'm buried treasure map is just unknown map what is this oh it's just like a map of the whole village I'll hold on to that yeah let me use your crafting table when I use this craft some bread and real quick I'm gonna be needing that expand it all right there we go there there and then cut this and then there we go look at my food now and bread gives more than raw mutton I'll play that much thank you very much what the huh no there's more hay over there that's good okay I'll take it still don't know why there's no music guys I'm really sorry because the music is some of the best parts about this game you know what take my white bed there's a better color anyway hey can you can you can you can you trade no you can't okay how long for the day when I can finally jump the fence I'm setting your cows free they don't deserve to be stuck here throughout the fence gate okay and then I'll check the comments after I get this hey cuz I know I did get a comment most likely it's just nice trying to smell Steve again which you have yet to do correctly it's pretty funny okay let's see or it might be just chipmunks again chipmunk nation yeah yeah okay that didn't help me kind of figured also guys hit the like button if you want to see me do this again I remember when this used to be so popular I remember I would get used after views after views solely for playing this game and it was awesome everybody enjoyed it it was so cool I was like the cool kid you know but not this just kidding so over a hundred and spend like a hundred nineteen pieces of bread or something I accidentally just shaved that piece of wood okay so we're looking good food wise have a little bit of armor was I in here yeah I was make sure we just check through this whole village oh you can you what this is terrible I've been in here right yeah what is that I hear like a crackling sound you checked you already alright we check this did I check this house Oh God Oh what there's things thank God caring music iron golem dude right there don't want to mess with him but I kind of do because I always kill them when I see them so I can take their armor never check this house over this is why we check the houses and I guess I could take the potatoes I really don't need them but I gotta have all the food I kept wanting me to put that dirt in there but you know what it's perfectly fine I think that's the extent of the village don't think there's much else good buddy it's gonna kill you but don't know if I should okay I don't know anybody who would take that trade if they even could afford it check this house real quick more emeralds perfect just in case we run into an actual fair village you know okay um Cave go back this way gotta go find that hey what is that what is that I think that might be just a tree but that looks like that looked like another village for a second okay back this way we're looking for that cave alright you know we're just gonna go in here cuz I feel like it's gonna start in here I'm just gonna turn all these into torches because yeah I figured I was going to get more coal I got you guys remember minecraft part six yeah that was the stream that I had my most viewers at once on I had 70 or so views I think not out not viewers at once but views at the end of it all it still gets views today I keep forgetting to put the the couple streams up for tonight that I did into my playlist and I'm always forgetting to put stuff into the playlist after cuz now I remember that I have a playlist and we're out of out of it over here now I'll just leave a torch just to alright fair enough there's a bunch down here oh my god okay this is going very well so far I think nothing bad has happened to me yet something surely is going to happen soon though and break I don't know why this one's gonna break it all right so now I can move my I guess I can move my bed down here let's see my coal 32 all right let's get a little bit more didn't want to get as much coal as we can okay let's keep going it's kind of scary it's kind of scary looking oh that noise how hot scared me oh my god I thought that zombie was just like a cave noise and it was that's a freak out but now it's just a zombie the first bad mob we've heard I remember keep inventory is the one thing that I decided to put on because I thought I should probably just make it convenient for me because if it becomes unconvenient and then I get sad all right let's see 49 call that should be good enough 49 times yeah it was 49 times we mined that cold we wanted that that's something we want oh you know what is it annoying me let's just fix this problem there we go so I watched The Phantom Menace last night guys it was pretty awful I'm gonna be honest it was not good okay where's the source jeez all right it's just not going away the waters just not going away who is that oh dude lava and water huh okay that's convenient um I'll shoot okay he could hit me from there let's go up just go up go up go up go up go up go up because I would like to that sounds so close I know it's not but it sounds close all right okay good start I think guys what do you think if anyone's still watching the stream please like the stream if you are still on it this is gonna take a long time wait wait wait guys I'm gonna go I'm gonna I'm gonna mute for a second let me see something real quick okay I'm back and I believe that absolutely nobody is watching this anymore well I had my moment in the Sun had my small moment in the Sun just like a breath of fresh air that's what it was like all right so let's make chess piece and a helmet even though I know I already have those two things leather is not gonna cut it well actually I should probably keep those be honest and I'll have six left over so I'll make a pickaxe some flint and steel I want to make a pickaxe in a bucket actually just make the bucket now so I can't make the flint and steel so there's the bucket let's get this let's get physical physical come on and get physical okay and now we can make our boots and now we've got a full set of iron armor yay we could I like it Abed No and pickaxe there we go alright so I'm going to do is move on pickaxe here put this up here get my crafting table and we shall move on with my life or with our lives let's just quietly go down here and let's go across to where the skeleton was I'm assuming this is where all the bad guys are coming from where all the noise is from but I can't be so sure we don't check it out it seems to go down for a while dang it alright we got more iron but that's all we got out of it may not even be very much iron however we did get a new passageway oh no ok more iron is it gonna lead to another one no no no alright wait did I just know okay I didn't all right let's go check this out then let's go up here first oh god that's good the cranberry he soon as I flushed my lady's dobby Oh Oh God oh I was not expecting that gonna be honest it wasn't too scary but obviously did not expect to get shot as soon as I put the torch down can I just make like an ultimate grapefruit or something where I can throw a grapefruit at an enemy and they just integrates really pretty cool disintegrates my enemies with a grapefruit alright last thing we gotta check is the lava and water thing again the music is gone I don't know why it keeps not coming that's weird one thing I do wanna do actually is get one piece of point there we go Wow and it popped right to me okay thanks well they're zombies over there so they're probably down here this is like an arena okay we're at redstone level already hmm redstone level already scam reminds me kind of Minecraft is like a land subnautica if you guys know what subnautica is I could stream that although I'm already doing a game play of it on my own and I've never beat it and I kind of want to do that before I stream it not again I've never beat minecraft okay there's a lot of lava here I could try the bucket trick to get to the nether I could try that however I imagine it won't come with success how much iron do I have 24 okay that's enough for in another entire set so we probably do have enough iron let's be honest but I don't really know let me get a bunch of blocks actually I do want to get a bunch of stone blocks just in case so like I can like place them down to go faster or a block some lava from killing me or something you know I think we are going to try the bucket trick stop so we need to do is we need to get bucket of water and we are going to make life happen oh okay you know what that actually ended up pretty okay and we can destroy these blocks now good all right and I've never actually done this with success before so can't say that this will go perfectly well can't say it will go well in general so let's just hope for the best here I know I gotta do to break this put some water here and now I got to decide where I want my portal so I got to remember one two okay this might be a little small for the portal area but we'll see [Music] let's grab some lava they hold on I want to test something real quick okay it doesn't work on the PlayStation I'm gonna check comments real quick before I do this cuz I know I got one nevermind I didn't said that I did but okay so another portal looks like this one two three four and so what we need to do is we need to know yeah see that's the one thing I've never done this but I did get one oh let's go I got one okay let's place torches I'm so happy I got one in chaos grab this [Music] now we need to put block here put a block here no put a block here love it we'll grab this grab this grab grab grab grab grab grab okay now we need to put a block here put a block here put this here grab the lava I'm kind of doing it right I think so the ground one counts as 1 1 2 3 I think we need maybe two more is it three more no there's a two more isn't one more I think it might be just one one who that one was too close for comfort okay um so now what I need to do is if we're gonna go up I don't know how to go up that's the one thing that I don't know how to do so I'll have to try to figure this out on my own I guess so that's a corner so we need one one and two at least we need at least two water's got to come from the top I try to figure this out this is hard alright well I mean let me let me put my block on top let me put a block here just to remind myself that that's a corner and then we would want here and then it would have to go down like that every time I fall I'm scared because I feel like I'm gonna dip into lava okay let's put this back get some wild uh see if we can figure this out okay think one actually I think I know what I got to do I think if I actually put it here now this is gonna this is gonna take some skill she's gonna take speed and skill let me put the lava down and take the water up let me move it gotta move into work a more convenient area no no no no yeah well this is kind of not convenient actually but we'll make it work okay I'm so lavas got to go here waters got to go on top grab it grab it you fool do it okay I did it okay see it's going perfectly or is that one too short that might be that's too short God dang it brick need to go one more up I think let me just make sure I did I might have done that I could have done it right still one two one two three four five maybe we're gonna keep going with this I don't think it's right at all but you never you never know scheme could be forgiving mama there water on top all right so let's put the water here grab the lava lava here water there we picked it up now we just got to do what we did the first time get it down that was quite loud and obnoxious okay so what we need to do is one two three okay so we can put the block here this is supposed to be easier we go gonna do this fast here here dang it that was my one source uh actually we're not we're not completely screwed yet I do have this llama over here okay last one here okay moment of truth was that good actually well I got a smelt piece of iron I got a smelt and ironing it first did I do that right I have no idea if I did that correctly I think I did I'm not sure though come on come on come on come on come on gonna let this smelt out for a little bit but come on did we do it correctly did we do it correctly did we do it correctly oh shoot okay come on please tell me this is just correct it doesn't look like it but maybe we did it wrong all right I wasted my time I wasted my frickin time I'm really sad man that could have been okay stop it with that you know what I'm gonna mine this with my iron pickaxe all hope is not lost quite yet it's just this is gonna take forever it's gonna take forever to mine this but all hope is not lost okay see that didn't take too long come on break for me break for me okay broken alright last thing we got to do is we got to get back over this way where did my water go is my water my water gone or do I have it in my bucket okay okay that's starting to get really annoying so if you could please stop it it'd be really nice can I just go to bed just take a breather you know we'll leave it down there good okay now I gotta put my furnace there you grab some lava it's okay if this falls into lava that's fine oh I shouldn't have broken that don't he blocks you know I do have costume see this is why I wanted to grab blocks okay that's good enough it has to be good enough okay I'm and now we can do this lava is connected I actually might not even need this lava so I'm gonna put it right here and I'm gonna put this dump this here okay but that turn it into Kabul why did that turn into Kabul okay I know what to do I know what to do anyway I can just block here lava place it some water okay I'll hope I told you is not lost this might light come on yeah let's go we did it there you have it it took forever but we made another portal without ever having to grab diamonds okay I'm not gonna go in yet I still want to explore the overworld see what else I can find but we made it to the nether without having to find diamonds which I've never done before because I've never tried it I've never tried it out okay okay it's not gonna work let's be rational be rational let's take our wins let's see how long have I been going for I have no idea how long I've been going for actually 48 minutes I probably go for two and a half hours maybe all right here we are guys okay we just need to get blazes that's what we need let me make an iron sword for this though I want iron for this fight I earn for this segment of the game and I'm going to make a couple of more torches alright let's go let's do this it is on like Donkey Kong yeah hey hey oh oh the nether is not nearly as nice to me as the overworld God come on alright however I I do have an innate ability to find nether fortresses pretty quickly why is there an Enderman here the Frick okay guys I prefer if you leave me alone they're everywhere the gasps the climbers climb was calling let's climb let's climb let's climb let's just climb let's just climb I think this is the ceiling because the nether does have a ceiling I guess I did not get very lucky this time I'm gonna be honest oh shoot okay let's just bob and weave [Music] tried to throw it back did not work ow mother got him wagging why am I freaking lagging this is so dumb okay I'm not gonna I'm not gonna hit you I'm not gonna hit you I hit the Enderman I'm good as good as dead as of right now okay the ghast is lagging me okay let's just try to get away let's heal a little bit go how am I gonna get back to the nether portal I don't know why are you guys everywhere I go you guys are literally everywhere everywhere dude I am NOT the best at deflecting the balls especially with lag we're gonna have to run past him [Music] no hate ghasts man they are so hard to deal with [Music] stop stop following me Oh God the cross no Jesus Jesus is in the nether who knows why alright the never-ending quest to find another fortress okay into the fire into the fire into the fire into the fire it might be on an island and another guy's gonna be honest we might be on an island and the nether oh Jesus okay seeing you here is not a comfort and gonna be honest finding another fortress has never been so hard for me honestly I have literally found them in two seconds like every time okay we've gotta get over there but there's a gas right there you watch as soon as I build this bridge it will kill me shut down hurt a little more than I would like it to have cut this out so sand so soon so soon literally the only brick I don't think the only block I don't think I've seen in the nether so far nether brick and I love to see another brick make my day if I could see another brick now the hardest thing is gonna be making it back to the freakin portal but honestly remember I have keep inventory if I die it's okay if I die it's okay I haven't died once which is pretty cool it's pretty cool and I did leave my bed so I will respawn at the portal I won't have to make a trek all the way back you got to be kidding me there's still another one no okay I think we've escaped the gasps wrath as of now what is it with this game and then cross being in the nether look at that that's literally the cross what the heck oh my god imagine if water could be placed down I love how you guys can just live in lava that's so fair like I hear them but I don't see him my god I would be such a happy person if I could just find a temple a nether fortress I here's what we're gonna do we're gonna strip mine in the nether it's gonna take not nearly as long as it does in the overworld and see where I end out okay have I been here the Enderman is here who if I miss this chump I was gonna say if I miss that job screw it okay oh yeah we've been here we've had to have been here let's get past this whoo Oh perfect jump okay um actually I don't think we've been here no this is open this is good this is good this means that we could theoretically find a fortress oh okay wow this is huge she's being stuck here like these freakin zombie do you like the nether though it's supposed to be it's you double hockey sticks in Minecraft but I actually like it okay we haven't seen blazes yet oh god dang it brick imagine if you couldn't craft and another than it would really be impossible it really would be minecraft hu don't you see I hate it here no no we're gonna go to this way because it is open over here and it's better no you don't see me you see me the best thing to do is just run forward at a gas dodge dodge oh my god they're literally everywhere this this is the worst nether I've ever been to I think literally I almost jump to my death at the very beginning maybe for just oh okay okay maybe there's a shining glimpse of hope break the brick brick the brick brick brick brick there's a glimmer of hope there is a glimmer of hope there are ghasts everywhere so we got to do this quick we're gonna do this now there can be lava and nether fortresses but we're gonna take the risk likes it see if we dug over there that would have been sad Oh God and put it with you and freaking shooting me as soon as you see me today okay all as well oh oh as well we found another fortress now we just need to kill like I don't know ten blazes be safe I don't freaking care I just need to make oh god and then we should probably kill that enter into I got it's so much safer on these been on the ground there's a place okay okay okay okay you guys are running Greg get it I get it I get it I get it give me your rods did I get how many to get I got one I got one I got one I got one wait I mean you dropped one I love that I found one though I'm so happy I just want it's just one don't burn me out he burned me okay well he's just kind of like all right he dropped one let's go just - good I need to get back up there so I can control the blade situation all right come on yeah three all right good good good oh I'm so proud of myself guys I've made it so much fun than I thought I would and the fact that we made another port without diamonds that's the best part because I've never done that and I did it successfully my first try all three of them okay spam spam spam freaking sword Adam I only got one out of the three that's fine that's fine fire out oh shoot okay this don't actually go fast he dropped one good good good this is going well okay they're starting to come in real fast seven this is more than we need we need 12 at minimum so we already have that amount because they turn into two blaze powder each but we want to get some extras just in case that the freaking when we go back into the overworld if we find the end if we get enough eyes of ender that it won't take and it won't take so long if they all break you know all right hardest part is getting back yeah that's the hardest part is finding my way back oh you guys are on fire instantly you go over there give me that all right I'll kill I'll kill them until I get 15 rods cuz this is not usually this is not nearly as bad as it usually is for me never beat this game guys never have I done a full survival world and beat the ender dragon question is will I do it on this try first or will I do it in our other world first I'm much closer in the other world but you never know the rate that things are going for us now crap dumb idea all right they're not giving me any rods anymore I'm gonna fight off one more wave be it one raw one dude two three or four however many I'll fight one off one more wave and if not a single one drops a rod we're just gonna go cuz 20 should be enough but if one does drop a rod which it didn't okay so we're just gonna go if it would have I would have kept going I mean we'll kill this guy he's writing for my face but when they get distance on you you got a you got a book when they get distance on you you just got a hawk it I think that's a term I might I just said something really cringey or inappropriate and have no idea I don't know what that word I don't know what it means but you never probably okay that I said that all right so if I'm going to get back I got to find my nether pull another rack pull however I don't want to get back yet and also the fact that I could just die that's another thing that I could do Nancy there it is I could just die to get back that would save me so much time and energy okay there's the boner so I don't think I've actually been in this direction we'll go in here first yeah we'll go in here first I see a skeletons legs free kick good ah never mind never mind I like glowstone God okay wither skeletons normal stuff okay there are no wither skull wood enchanted Bodhi might drop in this you might drop in this tomb I drop in less coal let's go I mean it's heavily broken but I'm breaking one which means it'll break less back it's not that great it literally cancels out itself and I probably would be better with just a normal bow myself but I'll take it hey guys oh my god hi what's in here who every color of the horse armor you could ever want get rid of the mutton that's been with us at the beginning of the game every color of the rainbow in horse armor I normally yeah chests kind of follow him stuff and so I mean you know take a saddle kind of need one of those and we can stack these anyway this is why you come to nether fortresses if you're not looking for blazes to get the chests because some of them can have diamonds and gold in them a kind don't want to deal with you and once I have two and so far we've been pretty unlucky I guess I've only got two chests and they're both horse armor related jump on here oh oh oh god I'm with it I'm with it what did you drop out obviously he would have dropped away self-install and I would have seen it but he didn't okay good good good there's a chest right up there oh I don't want to have to fight all you guys I don't like the spin moves at the freakin swear their skeletons do bye y'all yeah you did not survive that one at that time one at a time don't know what he dropped there's that Enderman can't lose track of you thanks bro okay there is just mined this out it's safe okay we found another act place chest all right a fresh new flint and steel I mean I only use this one once but I mean I'll take it I don't really need to get another work coz am I really gonna be brewing very much I mean I will just in case if I want to but I really don't care so let me just empty this out yeah we don't need this you don't need this don't need the glowstone dust don't need another brick sticks when we have 26 sticks left we really really really really really really really really really really really really don't need the potatoes but a whole high okay but you never know I could become the world's fattest man beat everything in sight so you really don't know world's fattest man doesn't sound too bad to me also I might want to get a shield okay this is a this is a fight I do not want this is a fight I do not want thank you for the boost okay whoo-hoo go go go go go go go go up the stairs up the stairs up the stairs oh I'd rather have this I'd rather fight this Oh Oh down stairs down the stairs open the chest what's in here bunch of ingots oh my god that was horrible oh that could have been so bad it still can be go go go go go what's in here gold more gold more gold more gold golden apples we can make a Golden Apple now if we want to oh dude that that was terrifying what was that three wither skeletons and three shooting skeletons and then the other side five blazes or whatever here's the worst part we got to go through that all again I'd rather take the blazes man because the off-chance let's go just down the stairs there's a chest here anyway see that's this not bad I'm not taking the gold chest plate by the way that's there are way more normally it's more normally there's more wither skeletons I think than normal skeletons but this netherworld I've learned likes to be different so another world really likes to be different so okay I've got no diamonds which is actually pretty surprising it's all been gold and stuff which I mean I won't complain it's just I would much rather have diamonds in the stuff that I have now nope nope nope I might take an ax I might take a might take a death on purpose I might do that because I want to well can I reach that from here no I got it I'm probably gonna take a death on purpose cuz I really don't want to have to try to find my way back there we go a diamond finally it's only one but it's a diamond doll right I think there's a lot left to explore here but I think what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna die now I'm just gonna die because I really feel like that I don't need to live anymore guys it's been an honor or we could just go out in a blaze of glory instead of suicide with no armor on just fight as long and hard as we can let's not die wimps let's die men yeah literate of them oh my god you what I might be immortal I might be immortal well we can certainly test that theory with the skeletons wherever they may be because they won't kill me in two seconds I bet [Music] this is where I broke through probably down the stairs where they are I bet down the stairs somewhere ow all right instant shot every time yours oh I bet Chester there was that I've been here let's go up I'm gonna guy I'm perfectly fine with that that was fun perfect all right very good very very good okay I can make two golden apples so let's do that cook a diamond shovel if we really wanted to um what are these never work block no no what I do want though is I do want to make some blaze powder we got 24 blaze powder that should be way more than enough and that was a very successful trip I think we owe not we got a bow we got golden apples blaze powder and another award that even the diamond I touched a diamond for the first time in the nether that's so what that's weird to think about I have a hundred bread left all right and yeah what now this is normally a spot where I would in this stream I'm gonna be honest but this is a mega stream it's so it has to go at least two hours well doesn't have to what probably should um so I'm gonna leave my bed here kinda wanna I kind of want this to be where I like if I ever need to go back you know you know what we'll just we'll break the bed well actually sleep here one more time though make a day and then we'll break the bed and then we'll probably yeah I'll probably just didn't volunteer Lee died again because I kind of need to go back up to the surf don't know what this map does by the way map 0 and I have map one yeah we don't need this map we're just looking for things to burn bones will keep the bones bones are kind of useless but we'll keep them actually now we won't keep them never mind ok so now we have space to take everything off and now we can just die very good okay let's put all this armor back on grab the stick oh okay the world is starting to come back into view very good we don't need extra okay the chunks are starting to load in okay probably shouldn't have slept because I really really really really really really really really really really really really really really don't need to do anything except for one thing which is find Enderman and those are found at night so basically I'm at a point where I'm basically at the same point that we are in our other world that which took ten parts this one only took one and we're probably I mean I'll take I'll check the time the stream probably not done here yeah one hour 19 minutes and 17 seconds I got no like dang it man you guys are harsh I'll tell you that much now I do want to kind of make do want to kind of make this just not a mega stream and make this its own thing however however I do want to kind of just want to do a mega but I'm not feeling it anymore like because I don't want to I don't want to sit here forever you know and just wait until nighttime and then Endermen a rare anyway why is there a sea turtle on a tree okay um yeah that's a good question actually guys do I want to call it here I don't know I would ask the comments but I don't think anyone's watching so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna call it here actually I think I'm gonna call it here I'm getting kind of tired actually anyway and I kind of want to go eat food I haven't had any food today in Saturday 1:30 so anyway thank you for caught watching this somewhat longer stream because normally I just ended at about an hour this one's an hour 20 it's not a mega stream like I promised but it's a big stream alright definitely got to change the title that's something I got to do can I do that now or can I do that later yeah edit let me edit the title real quick bending the title right now minecraft have a minecraft speedrun stream

better argue about our inclusion of this Nestle num no nobody's gonna lay a finger on my Butterfinger you guys are idiots originally concocted by the Curtis candy company in 1923 Chicago this candy confection was named by the public today it's chocolate and peanut buttery presence is a staple inclusion on supermarket shelves perfect peanut butter and chocolate nut button choco oh do that n no wonder with its flaky filling and crispy consistency Butterfinger has inspired imitators but has never been bettered with Bart Simpson as its spokes brat you can't go wrong nobody better real clean for my benefit number 9 Baby Ruth if there's one ingredient that complements a candy bar well its peanuts Nestle's Baby Ruth is full to bursting with peanuts well so give me some quest melted into the rest of this concoction the nuts blend with caramel and chocolate flavored nougat to serve up a chew to savor there's no big deal despite its brand name bearing a striking resemblance to one Babe Ruth the legendary baseball player Baby Ruth creators the Curtis candy company historically insist there is no link that being said the bar is synonymous with the major league regardless number eight Nestle Crunch creamy milk chocolate is the melody crispy crunchy try the harmony there's nothing like a little onomatopoeia to get the taste buds tingling and Nestle Crunch is perhaps the greatest candy that sounds like what it feels like that's why I love the slang rug first introduced into it's mouth-watering market in 1937 crunch is one of the longest serving sweet treats out there crunch crunch nowadays it plays the nostalgic card well with a recent slogan reading for the kid in you there's nothing quite like rolling back the years with a slab of crisped rice and chocolate given number seven oh Henry terms of caramel to fudge and piles of peanuts all covered in a chocolatey coating a candy bar experience so exciting it requires an exclamation mark oh Henry is another candy store heavyweight for which the brand name etymology is not entirely known Pedro Martinez has brought out the oh Henry bar Z of all the possible explanations for its title however perhaps the most pleasing is that it was named after a boy who frequently flirted with the girls who made the candy Little Miss candy bar paid a visit didn't she it's not what you think I know what I think with peanuts and caramel layered over a fudgy base and coated with chocolate this is a bar that provides one heck of a bite every number six three musketeers so much chocolate it shouts with flavor if you're eating a candy bar then you've probably already conceded a little on that day's diet regime but if you're eating three musketeers then you need not feel too bad go for it three musketeers is light fluffy chocolate with 45 percent less fat branded as big on chocolate not on fat it's the fluffiest of the sweet snack options nothing like clumpy chocolate on a stormy night originally created as three separate miniature bars stuffed with whipped filling flavored chocolate box book chocolate strawberry and vanilla hence its name the modern-day Three Musketeers is larger and lighter than most of its competitors it's tastier than most as well three musketeers cuz there's lots of fluffy new Three Musketeers number five Mars bar time for a Mars bar a king of the candy bar world the Mars bar is one of the most commercially and historically successful sweets on the entire planet you get more of all the good things in a mars bar with a name that takes us out of this world the ingredients list is surprisingly simple milk chocolate caramel nougat nothing more nothing less unless you're in the United States that is in that case it's chocolate nougat caramel and almonds if you like the taste of big crunchy nuts you're gonna love a mars bar hmm but the rest of the world goes nut free and loves it with its work rest play tagline and it's frequently customized promotional packaging this is a treat for anytime anywhere and anyone Mars has earth feeling satisfied responsible number four Twix is it returning these bars mid overwrite Twix why our special cookie is cascaded with caramel and cloaked in chocolate how good could their right to expand ebar when you can have two Twix doubles up our delight with their classic combination of caramely chocolate Ness and a biscuit base and we all know the Twix is the only candy bar with the cookie crunch another product made by the Mars company it was first produced in the UK in 1967 and introduced to the u.s. in 79 Twix try both pick a side known as Raider throughout most of Europe until the early 90s it certainly mounted an assault on the candy bar industry a younger product than most on this list Twix tastes good twice over when you need a moment chew it over with Twix number three Milky Way that's why I love a Milky Way another Mars creation the Milky Way was a candy bar standard-bearer for the 20th century can I have that Milky Way oh you can't have the Milky Way that's my Milky Way I went out this morning specifically bought this Milky Way to eat after my party that's weird it's not weird it's my special food I like it created in 1923 by chocolate bar mogul Frank C Mars its name was taken from a popular US milkshake at the time and was not originally linked to outer space as some believe you get the goodness of a quarter cup of milk and every bar this is a product that differs depending on where you buy it in the US it bears resemblance to a European Mars bar outside the US it's more like the American Three Musketeers either way it's well worth eating Milky Way it really helps hang out number two KitKat in times gone past America had the Milky Way and Britain had the KitKat another pioneer within its chocolaty field this treat was tasted first in the early decades of the 20th century break me off a piece of that I am totally watching what is the thing originally manufactured by Roundtree's but now produced by Nestle and Hershey in America the KitKat is so simple it's brilliant have a break have a kit kat triple layered wafer coated with milk chocolate that's all there is to it terrific taste aside the satisfying snap of one finger from another is iconic enough in itself we're told to take a break and we're more than happy to oblige before we unwrap our top pick here are a few honorable mentions you there's one indulgence that never lets you down score of all the cookies gone into Hershey's cookies and cream a mouthful of cookies in every bite get that Friday feeling with calories crunchy number one Snickers with Lisa only tasted peanut butter and chocolate Lisa had just eaten a peanut butter cup well with Steve I tasted something more it was peanut butter and Snickers did Steve had just eaten Snickers peanut butter square we know your candy cravings are no doubt doing cartwheels right now but we've saved a real treat for the top spot

watchmojo.com come on jump", "VbmTAxozIGs": "hey whats up guys killed it out here and today we are going to be learning how to create chocolate bars from my chocolate mud but before we begin I highly advise that you watch last week's video on brewing chocolate milk so I'll probably so the link will probably be in the description or I'll have something flash up on screen for you guys so just take a moment go walk to the video come back I'll be waiting here for you guys all right now judging that you have watched the video let's learn how you create chocolate bars after you have brewed your chocolate milk in either a cauldron or a brew kettle well you would want to do is heat up your bowls of chocolate milk in fairness and in turn this will give you a warm bowl of chocolate milk which is what you need to create chocolate bars or chocolate balls if you choose to go that route now the question though is how do i create the bars or the bowls or bars or balls and it's very similar to how you brew the chocolate milk what you need to do is you have to craft a chocolate bar mold like this and it's crafting recipes right here or a chocolate bar mold and this is the recipe for that and all you need to do is place your ball and barbells into the world and insert your milk and now all we have to do is wait for the textures to change to solidify up to show that the chocolate has hardened and that you are able to take it out now this will take anywhere from 12 to like five minutes so I'll probably fast forward the clip until that happens you alright as you just saw our chocolate bars here have just turned into I'm just hardened and all you have to do is with an empty hand you right click it and you'll get two chocolate bars and similarly from the chocolate bar mold you will get four of those but as you can see it's not ready now that took about five minutes so not too long but that's pretty much about it however let's say you made a mistake you you made this this chocolate bar and you wanted to have dark chocolate per se or maybe you wanted to remake it into a chocolate ball or whatever odd reason you know you make you made some sort of mistake and you do not want these chocolate bars in the latest update I have added in a feature with tinker's construct that allows you to melt down your chocolate bar into chocolate milk as you can see we got four white chocolate balls here it's throw a couple of them in there and we have a good amount of chocolate milk you know 140 and what you can do with this is you can cast it use into a chocolate bar using the ingot cast or a chocolate ball using the gem or pan counter you can also use no cast to make chocolate bar hmm a little bug there I'll to fix that but as you can see we have a white chocolate bar and some balls but the main reason this is implemented is for when you go to the chocolate dimension value you have an entire world made chocolate and what better way to abuse that world than to eat it because I mean it's chocolate why not but obviously you can't eat chocolate cobblestone or bricks or anything so what you have to do is melt it down here in the smeltery and you'll get chocolate milk unfortunately this does take a little bit but once it is done you'll get enough chocolate milk for one chocolate block as you can see we ourselves an extra dark chocolate block this can be crafted into chocolate bars or it could turn into a building block you know whatever you want and it's as simple as that if you wanted to you could take the chocolate milk and put it into like a tank and then bring that and then re brew your chocolate milk into something else if you would like and you want to reboot it into some white chocolate you don't want this chocolate anymore you want white chocolate and you can just do that yeah it's very simple but that is about all for this episode next time I will be covering how you go to the chocolate dimension as I have previously stated or talked about in this episode but I hope that you have had a good day thank you for watching", "890sicZUz9E": "hey guys my name's chocolate bar welcome back to another video today I'm gonna be showcasing my Minecraft world or my minecraft creative world um so yeah I'm just gonna be showing you around of what it looks like and I'm going to be well building what you want in it so yeah let's get into it I can't really build anything right now like anything you want right now because you have to put it in the comments but um I guess when you start commenting I'll build what you want so I think first we should start at the graveyard it's not really much it's just a graveyard you know rest in peace I wish I could assign here of like names but anyways that's it's practically a plain old graveyard nothing to it it's kind of boring but yeah and this pig this pig is always here like he never leaves I never see him go away oh and sorry for the bubbles around me I picked up my eyes closed okay they're open again okay um so I have the bad omen thing as you see on the side of my screen kind of um so sorry about that if you see a bunch of bubbles um so yeah that's my graveyard it's kind of creepy then I think I'll go to the Egyptian temple or whatever these things are called I forgot okay I don't know why these blocks keep disappearing like Minecraft what's wrong you know I haven't been here for a while but geez you don't need to take away blocks like this like see right here all right so yeah this is just the Egyptian temple it has gold in it which Egyptians use so it's not really much just your normal Egyptian temple or pyramid don't worry about this I'm working on this it was like this see stairway to heaven but it I never really finished it and I don't think I will because it takes a lot of work and I mean not that I'm trying to be lazy or anything but I'm not gonna put that many hours into something that will probably turn out horribly like with the pyramid it's kind of hard to get wrong in the houses like the houses are free-for-all design but this like you need actual talent and skill to build so yeah anyways let's go on to my treehouse it's more of like a survival treehouse this is one of my proudest projects I have to say it took me about two or three hours maybe close to four hours to complete this so yeah it has a bunch of torches your armorstands your furnaces crafting tables a lot of crafting tables and furnaces you got your chest full of potions that's what potions you full of food then weapons in here I'm your champion table and plate what was this about nothing and then you have your beds I think there's like 10 beds there or something oh and down here you have a pool with sarena the dog over there and then you have your farm all right continuing on sorry there are all these mobs over here I tried slang a few just now and it didn't work so anyways I that's the treehouse so pyramid our treehouse all right so here we have our snowball Stadium I would make this um I would invite my friends over but I don't know how to invite friends in Minecraft I know I'm pretty lame like in fortnight I can but I think you need like a Microsoft account or something to get in I'm not sure but um yeah this is the snowball Stadium you have your guys own food over there and then down here you have your two teams fighting with snowballs throwing snowballs at each other until one team falls oh it's like dodgeball it's basically dodgeball except with Minecraft and you die in Minecraft I'm sorry for this dirt block I don't like this dirt block here a bunch of strange things are going on in my world and you have a lot of torches up here because there were a bunch of skeletons used to spawn under here and as you see creepers and spiders and stuff are still under there because of the daylight the skeleton is up burning alright then I'm just going to go to this house this is the first thing I've ever built in this world I'm very proud of

pretty luxurious house this is what this is these are the good minecrafters unlike me guys seriously I am a terrible Minecraft early I know I build all this stuff but um like in survival I cannot

starting for some reason let me go back and get the shape bring me two amazing list kill me first cuz I'm really though is that Justin sound right I can't okay just one second Amy check on how long I've been doing this for cuz I'm I don't want to be recorded for too long right okay wait we have long we have a bit I always check like at the middle of the video ok so wait yeah come and get your helmet swung on the water in the middle guys what why do you spawn over there like we said her spawn points of beds right peace pigs ok kill them and get their stuff guys I'm really sorry about this I I have no choice I he would be lost there and he would die he wouldn't be able to find me so I'm sorry I'm social I don't want to do this but I didn't kill anything okay I just don't like cheating well I know you guys don't like it and i'm lagging great okay um stop lagging stop little scary nice yeah i know i just checked once i can make a little bit and lagging I don't know what's going on with my computer but for some reason it's really laggy I don't know what um they're real stop playing so um yeah I think I'm gonna end the video now if you have any ideas what I can do in later videos please leave a comment so we'll get me shirt in the video for story thanks for watching and we'll see you guys later ah think that your head", "awP5ewk9s4s": "hello today we're going to learn how to build a plane that works so let's boost for Nicholson's like just a little plane like okay okay so one two little plane design I'm just going to show you how to build one module is because if you want to build more than one it's gonna be a hard to do oh yeah so we'll just do how to build one module you can copy the rest if you feel like it I'm going to do it for the sake of the video yes I know Voyles continent you look so nice okay Scott you little play down so you're gonna want a left feature write my speech from left feature see what else probably want a go and you also probably go to more and up future [Applause] [Applause] of future damn be true so tell yourself out some years let's get this thing going okay so we have this one which is facing north so you're gonna want to build one facing west south and east you're gonna want to do a corner to corner I'll be done so I'm assuming that you completed it okay I'm assuming you've completed it now you probably wants one of them more than one you also probably want to test one just to make sure that anything goes wrong you don't screw it up like that so putting slash clone or just close and you're gonna want to find the bottom northwest corner of this smart a few market out with colors so bottom northwest eyelid which for me is 471 for negative work lifting iron and you're gonna want to find the upper southeast corner which for me is 479 7000 451 then you're probably gonna want to place your a test plane will get further away so let's do 471 for number 44 the northwest locations well you're gonna want to have its towed out can't just drop it okay okay that's obviously going to do nothing okay yeah it's good okay next put up what you're gonna want to do is so let's first put on the training sequence so first part of the twinning sequence technically wouldn't need this block like really sensor it's only just gonna be a clone commander not an actual tell anything you know what I think you actually might need this command block and you were going to on the command block said TP the player so this is gonna be the North module or the one that goes north north is always going to be going down on that food number four position so you're gonna want to have it go east TP the play yeast when loaded so put in a squiggly by - I'm going to want to have it be lower by 1/2 on the why they'd even want to have it on the same place on the Z and you're also going to want to have them because you want them to be peace in West wait ricotta which number West is is it to sandy no so thank you you don't want to help me facing 90 so test this hopefully it should put us way yep yep okay that is perfect now it's trying for the part where you actually are cloning it towards you so you're going to want to do clone find the northwest corner once again so this is going to try to go to the West one which would be 462 for negative 15 so put it in this way they note that the codes I have are not going to be the same thing you just make sure you in the northwest part of the thing again watch this going down on the first number going down is down on the second and going New York is down then bicycle so for east up and south so this would be 471 7 and 1/4 million four three two and then you were going to wanted so it's going to take a bit of math but you're going to want to go to e so for West it's going to be before the place you're going to want to have a place is going to be over by two going west will abide to going down and actually no upper by five I screwed something up oh yeah like with what score you know mega boy yeah don't do what I did it's negative swimming and negative food so now when we do this which high chance oh no I know I'm gonna do this think that seemed to work hold on don't don't go on without me that's all I gotta say don't go on until after I test you old school okay yeah that puts this one good smack dab middle okay that's what we wanted so now I'm just gonna want to repeat this process except the only thing that's going to change is obviously for this one you're gonna drag Northwest Southwest except so the direction you want to teleport Matt to face with this one that's gonna be zero for this one it will be 270 and flew this one it will be 180 so yeah no yeah if you have it it's going to be 0 90 180 270 okay I will come back to you once you've already done hey once you're done you should probably you'll do something along the lines of this just travel a little spin around and yeah probably just do this trust me it's just for some reason this one was defaulted to being on food no food okay yeah also that it's not gonna work say can literally just keep on spinning around have no pump so you now mr. torgue on the left sequence which is probably exactly just like the way so obviously you're going to want to put them on the center so the sound from this can walk would be two blocks in the last having to be in the you every time okay so this is what happens and it doesn't it's just like really see you don't want to keep doing huh that's why negative 0.5 so it just puts you on the ground and then also something's to 270 because we've is in the east this goes south 90s West seriously every point eighties so now when you do this to just face you straight and put this back then now for the clone command probably if you did this will probably have this audience talk somewhere he will have the coordinates of what you want in stocks moves so let's see the first one is 24 hundred and fifty don't touch and 48 488 742 then as always find the distance to the this block right here so one two three four five six and west one down and we put this in action let's go up yet did why do this oh yeah make sure you don't put in a typo otherwise that's gonna be a big big screw-up yeah always always use this test button so that way you don't have like a meltdown every screw up because I screwed up like that and I fab belt outs and the Sun fun okay so now you got this face east no problem and now just copy and paste that for the rest of them it's gonna be a lot easier it's cuz you have the coordinates of the other planes OD in one command block so it's it's pretty easy okay so we should go in throat eight it's your finished hopefully you have that you can easily rotate on this plane all directions which is what you want to be able to do okay now long to the direction I'll get rid of this because I don't want to touch that meltdown if you accidentally pump it sauce so you're gonna want I've been execute app key and then we kill days and then TP and to leave a negative one that will can change based on how far you want them together and then you want to go let's just give this a test and if it's chocolate in the over and okay you want from the slash clone find the quotes of the North module should be B's except so on the opposite one so the opposite points of the direction you're going so this will be the south like going on typing in your option gonna walk I bid one more on the axis and then you were going to have it to the amount of blocks in the Sun so and now you're gonna want this to be equally negative 1 because it is 1 block goes to the ground not 2 and then negative 1 and that if you do that that's just going to make it stationary now that will change based on how far you talk with them except we don't want it to be stationary so we're gonna put it as 2 and that's just gonna make us go on also you have to put in place close otherwise it will literally not do anything you're after running out so now once we do this probably let me get funny and we should take on the scrap plane as you can see the you're trucking along only that fast obviously can change it by changing this number like here we go north Japan and this number that Q it will go and go look this ball oh absolutely I think I think that was a bit of an inconsistency yeah this will go until you're out of the chunks so if you are wanted to have this light go on infinitely you can just have you know like an alt account just loading these chunks that's up to you we'll probably see you probably want to do this on a creative build world yeah and then obviously plus South East copy it onto all those you know you've done that once you've done that you should be able to fully go on about in all directions no problem just like this no problem yeah close bedroom they just receiving whatever oh yeah easily just go on about nope well so like that isn't really what we want but we want this thing to get to fly fly up and down right this is a funny consistency oh yes it is okay so what you gonna module to do is so I'm going to choose the left side it's probably up a magic that you choose left I saw you don't get caught behind but so we actually need to UM get this thing to go up and I played a dum-dum move by beginning to fill out phileas so she wanted you had teeth I don't know whatever corny let's just say I'm in the southwest corner to do this one this will be 26 with another 46 we do go without with Philip and now there should be like nothing which is correct so it's also nice is from now three we meet again below so what you're gonna want to do is so wanted du /dx kita gave you a key and square rules and swirls and then above one the why and bat for food so please everyone that's gonna be why you're gonna want to be above one that's going to be from each of them and then the respective direction yeah so once you've done that it's just gonna keep trying filling in the other but nothing is going to happen which is expected it's now you're gonna want to go down here and then you're gonna want the coordinates that you are just used for like here except one exception this point in like he'll even want to change it two or three or lower then whatever that is so let's put that in I'm gonna sleep but obviously it's going to change for you okay so that is and then we're going to want it to be that so let's do some math again again outlines so this is one two three West then only one on the bottom one to five five north so now let's plug this in to test this good chance it'll fill so that's why we're doing it test cuz you've probably just once you done with that I like to eat here your friend you know you want to try make sure you like he put like some sort of caution Billy that says like don't go huge don't don't use these planes because these are modules and the whole car thing will win but still now if we do this again I think I know what I did that is I yeah yeah you gotta make sure you put in the top code yet so now maybe this itch yep except let's look at the back cuz I don't think something is right yeah I think it's only going up up so I think what happened was this is it although this is a back nobody want this to meeting want this to be six so now when we do this we gotta get out of my face you make me angry I only have like a troll okay now let me do this we are going up we are not leaving a trail which is perfect so yeah you got the up sequence correct so now I'm told you're probably see now you got it repeat all these should be easy because you have those codes that you supposed to like you if anything about machine is the lower Y chord and obviously the respective positioning to wha this protocol point okay so you sure have gone the up going up code of you playing complete so now you can easily just keep on going it up oh yeah this one yeah obviously pull up again well again and we can go up --except you probably also want you to go down right because what comes up must come down also what's up just like we go so you gotta have a way to go down with module okay so you're gonna want to do is so going to the last one slash execute not pee pee pee and then respective a east-west north-south direction and then negative 1 for the Y and then is another one going north and also make sure to print this Wiggly and then what you're gonna want to do is so you also probably don't want to get the syntax with this again so looks only 149 then 479 8 negative 150 or go one up on your high Michael then you're gonna want to find the distance to the other side say 1 2 3 4 5 and they always never - we want negative two because it's going to have a dropped end unlike the other one it would be a little quote could change it knocked out flow upward that changes it and then they want to go one two three four five and I think that's gonna work I don't know also put in place voice and they'll please yeah I think we'll be able to get it down so that's a stumper forward and I think I did something good oh I know what he's really thinking I did this again keep doing this right yeah one more like this so now let me do it it's not a stupid honey probably will be it's kind of stuff that's what we need you to test me probably alright now we already sending the copy me and will probably stop descending properly when we get out of rage I don't think we're all over H bar as you can see we love going down that's we do not crush let's go so yeah and now as always you gotta repeat this with West so and he's have fun so we things should have been built this is the finale so you know what this slime stinks cooling system you're ruining the offer yeah now let's get out I hate you existing probably's but yeah anyway so this so once you have that all done tests and stuff that should all be deleted so forward you really get inconsistencies but if you do it's not really getting fullest you know you like standing on the edge that is then you might be screwed up somewhat doesn't really matter because they'll probably be doing this in a creative world but please don't crash the center like anyone's buildings to anything don't use this for anything like don't don't feel like I don't know like don't put like a bomb or look like you that has like I don't know let's do don't don't put something out there that has something like that like don't do something like this that's just you know cruel so yes so you think should be all complete yeah so got your up thing down maybe crushed random oh nice yeah so please please don't try like do this online I'm gonna like say that you built it because that would be really annoying yeah this is uh this is the build simple playing minecraft also one thing to note is uh you didn't need that what place boosting god did you for putting that in and you also can only do this like awesome link that's close that's why this is a nine by nine so that those comments will only work on a school you can't just like you can't have like that electing the route object so that's why it's a nine by nine anyways I think you see", "eladLZZEHZw": "hey guys thank you for joining me today I really wanted to make a makeup tutorial today here on YouTube I've had a really strong urge to start making YouTube videos to give a huge shout out to my friend Alexis here on YouTube she's been pushing me to do a channel for a really long time now and today of all days when it's a really hectic in my life I decided to sit down and just come up with a look that I want to wear to the concert tonight so um this is what I came up with kind of bold I don't know maybe not many people wear this at a concert also is kind of cool toned um I'm using more of a warm tone person but I know the odds are today and I decided to make a cool tone look oh I also forgot i'll be sure to link Alexis channel down below in the description box and please go check her channel out she's been such a great friend and she's been giving me tips on what to do or how to start YouTube or how to start my channel cuz I honestly I don't know where to go and I'm not used to speaking in front of a camera so please be nicely guys um I will get used to this if I decide to pursue and making more YouTube videos which I think I would because it's I had a fun time it was pretty fun but I don't know about the editing process because I'm not sure how to edit either but hopefully this video turned out okay for you guys he's subscribe if you're not i mean i won't have any subscribers so yeah until then i'll see you guys next time okay so i'm first going to start off with the LA girl stick prime mystic in and i'm just going to run that across my eye and I'm going to blend it out with my finger so everything is nice and smooth next I am taking my Maybelline fit me a matte and poreless powder and toffee and I'm just going to set my eye area so when I put my transition color it will show and with my morphe m4 for one blending brush I'm just going to take my line point Venus grunge palette and dip into the shade divine and I'm going to run that in my crease and I'm sure you guys know that the blending process is a process and so when I use these shadows that I'm using on my eyes it's going to look like I'm not really putting anything there but trust me it will look good in the end so next I'm taking this make it beat shadow and bedrock and I'm just adding more definition any depth to my crease and as you guys can see I'm kind of winging it out as if i'm going to do winged liner but for this look I'm not going to do a ring later I'm just kind of fanning it out further and for the cord graves of this look I'm going into the morphe 35 d smoky palette and I'm taking that kind of gunmetal silver shade and blending divine and bedrock together and now with my wet'n'wild crease brush I'm going to dip back into divine and kind of place that back out in the allergy and blind even more I know you guys it looks like there's nothing there yet but the next shade i'm going to add is kind of a darker darker silver shade and with my elf eye contour blush i'm placing that directly onto my crease and as you can see it is giving it more depth and definition and great and i keep blending blending blending that darker grey and i'm using my finger to kind of wipe my kind of winged edge to make it a little short and here i just went back in with my wet and wild crisper to blend all of those colors together this page chocolate bar palette called white chocolate I mean taking that and this nap on my brow bone to get a little more key and whiter okay guys now for the fun part I am taking the next glitter glue and placing a small amount on my ring finger and I was just going to dap that on the places of my eye where there is no shadow okay you and here's a more bees are disabled sorry the photo I'm going back into divine and just and here i am taking massacre way by many different ways Wet'n'Wild I know me inner corner highlight Coco lashes and Goddess rather long position I swear you guys flashes and for me feel five I also will apply this mascara to the base of my lashes like it's my 35 Kelly I'm taking the lashes I just black and I'm taking this equal tools tools and good brush and I'm taking the liner side and I'm going to cover my lash line with that black eyeshadow so I can hide eyelash glue hello look I don't have to apply and here are you taking George Jana's 12-hour need to last liquid eyeliner pencil in black point just kind of blending in my falsies in my natural art washing and next I'm taking color flops and that I learned and piggy bank ever loved this place is so cool and I'm going to have in my waterline so it here is the finished look look I actually went back with masquerade I make us weak and I'm taking that shadow and I'm kind of learning it higher up closer to my brow alone infertility bangs I kind of just wanted to give you two options the first one is for a buck up purple color pop the ultra satin lip and into it another good for me purple little better than come but I also wanted to do another option which is my mood so I'm taking them on monday lithuania and i'm learning my lips and then I'm going to take every stars the more lipstick and Gemini so back up with this look thank you guys so much for watching", "p2H_sAFblEY": "so what is the best food sauce in my craft tri-c's it's go together and what is sitting to that state how do you get steak killing cows is that efficient probably not how do you make it more efficient well they got a farm that's always you have to build in this video this is another day of six or five maybe even seven I lost checked by day one now why would you want to have a car phone what is it useful for well you can get steak from it which is a very good and very easy to get food sauce in Minecraft okay it cleanses your mouth very fast and its overall just useful and it's easy to find so what more could you want and it's also used to get experience which can mend up your tool though you can combine in time there's all this renamed stuff put away defense must get a letter from a cup from which is useful for many things many ways number one which is to read books you know his books to get bookshop book shots to get lecture new legends to trade with villages to get more books and more enchanted books but also you just like to invest of contraptions so that is redstone he ain't even possibly something well it's very simple consisting of not a lot of profit works or puts in an area of five body it's very invented I thought made out of blocks that are very difficult to get I would say the hoppers this one yet and then Estonia are very hard to get in the early game there is the two comparators or the comparator and the observer will salute you at the cost would you like to come together for that how does this thing work but when you do but a matter of a year it depends from water than C and then this costs top after down a basic you can grab you we can just right click yet complete them up and as you see the baby cows will come out of here now as soon as you're done in the cities whatever yeah and then you can eat them to kill all the make sure they fully grown up before anything happens because yeah okay but since this guy is a baby he won't drop anything and all the chocolate appear now how does this thing work well when he does button right over yea it paused the Spencer okay this is Spencer then dispenses all its water and yeah pops up and those cows basically pop up and down because of the water and that's how it works skate now I cheat once again it'll just check the water so that's basically this that button pauses but directly powering this Spencer although sometimes a little bit difficult because when it is found right over here we'll have to pulse it twice okay so basically what happens is that we have a monostable circuit at Omega and this dispenses or basically suits on this button into here okay and then it just goes back and this comparator lights up for only one thickness absorbing the texture products piece of resin that's powering this block and it indeed opposes to Spencer if you wonder what that sign is therefore it's basically to prevent the water from flowing out into this area what's going on to this area and this area now let's get into the tutorial man you want a full icing list in the description below and we'll be even finally Falacci you start off by placing a three by five area that's just a five block area is going to be your front side so this final area that we are going to be decided that's going to be pressing buttons I just need to make sure that he didn't go ahead and make sure I could never see this and then go ahead and connect it up just like the escape please buttons on each of these sides go ahead and place a dispenser right over here has to be dispensed another dropper because it will not work a little twerk turns around yeah drink I just God please just an MP's a hopper facing incidentally okay you have to define click it just like that then go ahead and it's all yeah okay this is this then you can go ahead and place a sign right over here and please down a block on top of it just put in something like this okay to that and then you can just go in please in all your classifier you can fill in watching that dispenser and now bind that dispenser but now what you can do is kiss a dropper facing in this direction just like this okay miss miss in this direction business or please hopper facing inside of it and go out of this a better place in this direction put any other blocked in yeah it doesn't matter what it is as long as it's just a block quick then go ahead and kill a observable face in this direction and a red piece of ass oh that's rapidly increase in the blocks if you did the mark machine of this block career I can fix black eye today if you want I completely download design kind of you need to get cows into this space right over here which is find yourself in that then you need to get a wheat farm or initial bar on the trolley down series many description comes in right now check it out if you wanna get some at amounts of wheat or you can go on manual route so yeah now once done with that do you button it up the cars if you once again to come down and eat the bottom are killed cause what they grown-up stick up to you all your drops and have it could be not so say thank you for this video hope you lots of the new and I'll catch you in my next video and subscribe it like and Bobby [Music]", "dM7BRsnJJhs": "- Oh no, oh no, there's too many. (light music) OK, so today we are gonna\nmelt all 100 chocolate bars into the one epic\nchocolate bar, hopefully. Let's get started. I'll move these to the side. Oh no. (pots clanking) I've got a little bit of water. Which I'm gonna start boiling. Um, how do I start this thing? Wow, cool. So I guess I'll just start\nunwrapping the chocolates. I'm just gonna chat with Tasty. You think, Matt, a Tasty\nproducer, should just pop in to make sure I'm doing this right. - Wow, this is a lot. I didn't know there was this\nmany candy bars in the world. - I don't want to mess it up. You don't mind helping? - No, I'd love to. - I'm gonna start throwing\nwrappers on the ground. OK. - Oh. Wow. You know, what a lie. They're supposed to be candy bars. York, that's kind of a weird flavor. - Yeah. It's not gonna taste good, I don't think. - Oh, I've been very excited about this. Oh. I'm into it. Yeah. Are we being exciting and fun? - It's time to start giving\nit a little bit of a mix. - OK, it does look like\n(car honking) literally. - Yeah.\n(laughing) But it'll taste good. This one is chili so it's\ngonna be a little bit spicy. - Mm. This one has cornflakes in it. - Opening some of these is\nbringing back my childhood insecurities of not being able to open up. Watch you do it in one second, one try. (laughing) We're on the home stretch.\n- We are. - And I'm ending with\ngood 'ol Three Musketeers. - All right, classic. - I think that should be stirred. But I don't think it will all fit. So why don't I get another bowl. Wow, sensual. So I'm gonna go back up and shoot. But once this is fully\nmelted pour that one into one of those and then let them chill in the fridge or freezer. - Not this one. - OK, got it. So I'll check back on you later, right? - Yes, please do. Chocolate soup. Chocolate soup. You guys want to try it? So delicious. It tastes like frosting. - It's very minty. - Think it would fit in this? We're just gonna do it. There's some interesting\nchunks at the bottom of this. Some wafer, peanuts. You're right, this is a good size. I'll get this one going. This one does have different bars. You can tell. Alright. Put it in the refrige. Oh if I make it safely. So while the other\nchocolate is getting cold, I'm gonna melt this chocolate. I don't have anything to\nsay while it's melting. (crickets chirping) Oh, it's solid. - Yeah I'll just rest it on my bump. And then head off. I don't feel super good\nabout this next step. Let's go, upstairs,\nmaybe Matt will be there and he'll help us. We found him, he's up\nhere, he's making sushi. I think I need a big sheet pan. Yeah. - Well wait. So you're taking the one\nfrom the freezer on to here. - OK. - Oh yeah, look at that. Let's put a little pool\nof it in the center. I'm feeling good. I think we're good to go. Three, two, one. Wow. - It's pretty on this side. - Yeah, now I think you\nshould do the honors. - OK, oh, wow. It worked out like the right amount. How did that happen? - So now I say that we\nput it into the fridge. - So are you gonna come\nback and eat it in an hour? - I will try part of it. - Ta-da! Matt come look at this. It did crack a little. But you know, I still\nfeel like it's beautiful. Alright, going for it. Mm, taste great. - Oh do I have to do it too? It's like chewy on the inside. - This is delicious. Oh it's kind of peanut buttery. - I'm getting coconut too. And a little bit of everything. - Alright guys! - Oh. - [Everyone] Wow! (laughing) - Well, see ya. - This is good. - It's great. - Legit. It's happy hour. - Today when the day started,\nI did not expect to be here. - Yep. - But we did it. And it's actually pretty impressive. - I'm kind of over\nchocolate right now though. - Yeah, I don't think I'd\never want to see it again.

think this is 12 colors 3 6 no it's like 9 colours anyways but um yes so we have dark blue white light blue grey red purple orange green and blue I just no notice that spelled purple wrong but yeah ok so let's check out a couple easy golf carts I'm guessing they all function the same but you can see that they Oh almost trend that they do all ride so they do Drive but the problem is there's like that big health bar in the way that that's probably going to be a problem but you can't just punch it and it dies like the furniture mod so yeah you need something really overpowered to kill this if you but that's the thing if you probably wouldn't want to destroy this let's check out the dark blue one now so this is what it looks like they have like the headlights in the front and like the the grille I don't believe two players can drive I don't believe so you have the the red lights in the back and the exhaust some very nice details here and you have little little wheels there it does look a little tall but that's fine I want to see myself in third person riding this alright so here's me in the golf cart this is what it'll look like I'm pretty sure if you put this on multiplayer world you can play with your friends so if you guys want to try that out then you can do that if you want to I have noticed it does go really fast I want to check hold on what if we run into an animal alright nothing happens I was wondering if it would kill them but also I've tested this out already you can't make the card jump like you could with a horse I'm guessing they coded this with with a horse they just changed a little bit of the code and the the model to make it look like a golf cart Oh another thing they have this at the bottom I didn't notice that before and now the steering wheel is pretty nicely textured okay so I have all the colors lined up here there's nine of them when I looked at the add-on it said that there's 12 but there seems to be nine there's green orange purple light blue gray white blue dark blue and red one major complaint is that three of them are three different shades of blue which doesn't make a lot of sense in my mind like why don't you add different colors like brown or well actually technically Brown is a shade of orange I'll be real but you could have used some other color other than like three different shades of blue you could use a different shade of red and you could have used a different shade of like purple or orange or something like that so there wouldn't be three different shades of blue I just it's just a minor - complaint it's not it it's not a big deal the golf carts still work so this is a very cool add-on in my opinion no you can't sit in the backseat I wish you could but um if you guys do want to check out this add-on then drop a like and subscribe and download the add-on in the description turn on an experimental gameplay so if you did enjoy this video drop like subscribe leave a comment and I'll see you guys in the

there's this just kitchen very nice it's the bedroom bit small very nice to rated I often hear I wondered why my science kept exploding because my science kept exploring for some reason I don't know this is a recording this is prerecorded that's living over it yeah this was the first house here I'm doing so uh foreshadowing oh no here actually I have a funny idea our next house I gotta keep up this we made you build this house together actually look at that that's nice there's some advertising not important this is the inside nice I rate the wooden house let's give it a 9 out of 10 this is a little bit bigger did some white carpeting just not finished golden stairs Wow an empty chest it's not more than that yeah that's a certain kind of glitch I'm giving this house a 10 out of 11 so I really loved this one because it's a giant chocolate bar and it's made by a tiny chocolate bar it's very cute Wow they actually put a lot of effort in this and he himself has a skin of a chocolate bar and he wanted to build a house made of chocolate so I really like that I have to give it a ten out of ten because of the creativeness it's very nice very very well done interior looks good very cool very good very proud of you so this house was unfinished but I have to review it anyway because that's I made promise so someone grifted I think I think it's a nice house and put effort in it good down good job oh this was a big one this was a huge house I don't know I think they build it with two of them with the two of them and there's some signs on the wall I like this now I said was that apparently that it's a diamond bunker yeah it's a diamond bunker now we have the first for some diamonds on gold some emerald on the floor someone has been breathing I think or they just did it themselves because they were bored I don't know and then it had like two or three more floors but the finish so I'll just this one is quite nice actually with windows next house is no but it's a very extroverted it's very colorful there's diamond there that's quite nice actually 9 or 10 this one I giant wooden wall around it and some rails on top of it I mean who does that who comes up with that I don't know hey look it's the Emerald floor indictment another real where so apparently this guy like the wheels I had a lot of beds I don't know why last house is a this is one's funny because it has four collars carpet it's blue very nice then we have green smaller room then we have the juice creeper outside just staring into your soul very nice this orange carpet and you've got a little swimming pool and I didn't realize this firstly he has a helicopter platform I didn't understand it at first it's a helicopter landing platform so I got it yeah I read it nine of them thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next video [Laughter] [Music]", "SGHLe6JD4qc": "hello everyone this is nice for here also know Sean and today i am playing minecraft this is PE i know i'm sorry i'm ashamed but there's a reason for it i'm here with my friend Joseph gar as 200 no 2005 and he just walks away no I'm actually here with Sarah the twin okay and there's another one okay no I'm really here because I have awesome blame for who stilled my for well I was one who told you about this server so okay fair point don't be saying that I saw your Ford okay okay fair point and we're gonna be playing survival games in here now because this is the P version it's suckish so we're not gonna do a lot and because you're saying there is suckish ok ok ok there's oh ok since let's be able to go and back up just forget it forget it forget it wait behind that they enjoyed it no I didn't so drive on Valley yeah we're gonna have to wait so all just not yeah I'll just end it back when the game starts that ok how's that sound Blaine sounds good for sounds good ok I'll go and we'll see you guys that look is this oh my god oh I thought it was a walrus it looks like it looks like a walrus puppy that looks like a chocolate bar cute ok guys we are back or man ok ok you just ruined it we are next to each other can you see me sometimes we have chance oh and we see the chocolate bar ok you guys will find out what that is at the end of the video you know I might not even have time to go and put in like my normal ending that I do with what i call the bunch of Kyle Alphonse tiger and well didn't know I was gonna save Bob Bob the Builder season shirt um okay and I was just looking if I got VIP did you get VIP so I ever I'm playing with you I never get VIP yeah I got to you feel like my five times when I'm not playing with you I have VIP cool like and then you always get VIP when work together should we tell him how I beat a speed hacker okay so i made it to death match with it was only me and one other guy and it was a speed hacker meaning he'd like to speak to on which wasn't very good for where we were but um in the P version there's this glitch with fire where other people can't see the fire that you went down was really only on this yeah so he stopped one of her eyes stopped chasing after him so what I did was I put fire in a line and I ran towards him he ran into the fire freaked out and fell into lava and i won confetti fireworks yay celebration remember that one time when you end and death mention you're like the weakest one and just like back up straight into the lava oh yeah I went into deathmatch freaking out so much that I was the weakest one there I kept backing off until I fell into lava by accident okay you see how that guy is armed Iran over there yes that means he either one VIP or is a VIP 1v1 DF happy and that guy won via AP and that guy won't wait what I'm gonna have to zoom it dude i found found him oh that you were talking about earlier oh my god no I'm not going to zoom in nevermind guys never mind never mind hopefully we get to kill her hit Wednesday's are ya other wives we've run around screaming oh my eyes good luck guys no wait it's uh oh someone actually did say no really what we owe their two of them good luck turn on your chat for one second okay oh do camp starting I mean we didn't make a game plan okay i'm running spawn I guess I am speed hackers hope not okay I didn't get this fine me neither ok let's go backwards I just realized the castle isn't fully loading in but I see it now ok let's go we're following him like you're way ahead of me the very first time I played on this map which I did not record um and this was on the computer Oh Xavier version um what happened was yeah we failed horribly when we played on MP

to like comment and subscribe share do all that stuff um put this video up on social media but this channel up on social media and yeah i'll see you guys in the next episode dude you ruined it you", "pKlFIO0-Ay0": "[Music] hello YouTube it's me cartooning professor with another YouTube video so today we are going to be doing a tutorial and I really hope that you really liked this tutorial this tutorial is based off of slash clone yay okay anyways so this tutorial is gonna be based on how to use commands and we're gonna be reviewing some little troll hahaha yes we know but yes let's just jump right onto it so then yeah it's just my place that don't judge me but I really think it's really good so yeah we'll just jump right to it and we're going to start doing some cloning but however make sure you check out this game guys this game is called rise of kingdoms and it's like the best og game in world history what you're gonna do is that you start off as a small city and you grow your empire this is a very good game and I really want y'all guys to download it my you need to at least get five hundred thousand power I have 3.8 million and you're able to unlock cool new chests which gets you cool rewards there's the silver and golden and then you're also able to join new alliances as well as you're able to earn gems to get new perks and you're able to just earn everything alright so this is I'm just checking out and making sure that I fill everything out as you can see my Alliance is we are the chocoholic so then this is a lion's donation over here this is a little quick tour but yeah so and then you have everything to be able to join my Alliance just pause the video to type in the Alliance which is on the bottom right hand side and you need to at least get 500,000 power so once you have this things ready you're able to grow your empire as big as you want and you're gonna dominate everyone out there who is really bad yeah I'm just flexing over here I got these cool commanders yeah I'm gonna have to upgrade this man right quick so do you do all right so now he's fully upgraded I'm gonna now give him some cool tips let's just upgrade that oh yeah let's upgrade that oh yeah baby all right so I'm sorry so yeah this is so far oh that's mm oh that's I like that all right now that we got that we're just gonna go over here and use our boost because we obviously do not have any let's just do some daily challenges that we haven't claimed get those sweet warts now was just gonna unlock some little chests and now we're gonna get these chests bless you will get oh that's a lot of good stuff but yeah make sure you guys download this game is rise the kingdoms and I really hope you enjoy so far and look I have not expected that go well so right here guys this is my new rise of kingdoms so I hope you guys like it this game you have the scoreboard on the left side no that's right oh geez on the right side and it changed automatically and we're gonna now show how to do the cloning but first let's just start off with a little troll yeah it's with /fo hopefully you checked out that video which I'll leave in the description but yeah let's see what city shall I destroy hmm there go my arena but yeah so over here we're just gonna check out these commands so this is the clock - why the scoreboard change and over here this is raw text so I put that the command says epic terminus lava 1v1 shield and epic targets no lava death match and I will show that in another video but right now this feels want us be stick with the cloning but however if you want to get a sneak peek at the scoreboard I will be gladly to show you guys just let me just get the right moment so let's see so now we're gonna check how these both commands work so how they work is that they go on the clock right and then it goes every other three seconds I believe or four seconds so then yeah those are what the repeaters are for for the delay and then that's just how the clock functions so right now I'm just looking at how I'm gonna label this for you guys so make sure you just just follow up and most of these commands that you're gonna see and these both command blocks won't actually work first time because you're not going to just put it in like that's not how it's gonna work so I'm gonna show y'all how that works by just a few minutes of still scratching my head why am i moving um guys I can't move like a Joel [Music] having to replace my controller oh there you go okay so anyways let's go back to it wait oh okay okay so I'm gonna show y'all guys the command block like I said so we'll just start off with this remember luck so this command block is with the et this is the et wins is what displays it so what this does is that it just keeps looping this command like that's what the repeaters are for is /scoreboard space objective space set display space and then sidebar and in space like the title of the game so I'm it not the game oh my gosh the title of the scoreboard yes indeed so it's technically like this what I'm typing right now is she / scoreboard like this is that simple but that's gonna be for another video now this video I'm gonna be trolling this person's thing ha ya get owned oh my gosh anyways yes so now that you know that I'm just gonna stop making that loop because I was getting me a headache and she's gonna one more time and that's we're just gonna stay at so let's see let's just destroy this base in particular so all I gotta do is I'm gonna do it I'm not gonna do it in command block because you can still do it on like the text bar so I'm just gonna do it like as if the lava was flying from the air it's like just try to troll your friends cuz they're all flying right now and then they're gonna come back and then you're just gonna freak out so what I just did is I found the coordinates which I didn't do a very good job of it and messing up was and countless of times finally I got it yes it's perfect all right hopefully this will work nope scratching my head another ten times work I hate my life work yes it's finally working about time yes finally alright so yeah this is gonna be so cool oh god just look at the lava just slowly rising oh my god I've was old bad whereas BAE's oh my god moving on so now we're here yay so we're gonna look at this look at my beautiful portal I think is very good I put so much detail in it no cheese but I can't somehow get through it oh that's because I have barriers on let me just grab myself a little barrier so we could be able to go through it but I'm able to break it in creative mode but just to see all the barrier that I created because I don't want anyone to go through this portal yet so that's why it's covered up with barriers so I'm just gonna get this and imma show you that I merely covered the whole thing with barriers now knowing the fact that I didn't cover the back side I'm at the light Underground oh my gosh so but I did cover it to the point to where they can't reach it so now we're gonna use this as an example of cloning so we're going to go to you're going to go to a corner as shown I'm going to a corner and then so that's what you're mainly gonna do you're just gonna do that but I'm not gonna do it I don't know what I'm doing here oh my gosh we're just gonna skip that anyway so yeah you're gonna go to a corner then you're gonna go to the other corner but like you have to start off like as the flat face so as I am standing on right now and then you're wanting to go I'm riding these corners down because sometimes I forget so then you're going to go to the other side of the dimension which is I'm going like as like a rectangle or it could be a square wherever you're trying to clone then you're gonna find the edge mark of that dimension I am typing it down why am I doing this I don't need to say this anyways as I'm typing it down I'm now gonna do something else so now I am going to now going going I'm saying going to many times I am going to measure how tall the structure is which is very important so remember your x y and z are very very very important thing so my structure is like about up to 75 y4 so it goes from 69 to 75 that's my cloning height so but on a flat world make sure you be careful on that guys for all your flat world peoples so as you got the coordinates down you go mark a place to where you want to clone it so let's see what am I going to clone it hmm I shall clone it over here yeah I'm a clone over here so then you're gonna clone at the specific spot that you want to clone your object so how how does this work so you're gonna of course type in slash clone then you're gonna space and then you're gonna type in the coordinates like because I wrote mine down so these are the coordinates I think there are 4 67 69 and 2 1 3 then I'm gonna type in the second set of coordinates which is the begin and end which means like the beginning or end mark of the cloning thing so those are the dimensions that I have circled out and those squiggly lines is the exact position where I'm at right now so I won't have to type in and do that story then you're gonna do mask and then you're gonna do you can move that structure if you don't like it there or which is very easy in Minecraft or you could just clone it normally and with forest I haven't learned about that yet but I'll make sure I'll give that to you so I'm gonna do normal and I have cloned object guys it was really that simple just if you missed that part please scroll back but I will provide it right now on the screen so you can follow but sometimes cloning nether portals doesn't really work especially when you don't clone the ground because as you can see only close the surface area but make sure guys you clone like the ground - so like you clone inside the ground just the case if you're cloning inside structures I just cloned the part upside hey I never tried this you can just destroy the bedrock oh my god can hear it oh yeah that's not good they need to fix that but yeah you could just make sure that um you like clone like make sure that the block you're trying to clone you clone like the block itself - and then you wanna you wanna like clone it in the ground not on top just in case if you want it solidly like on the ground cuz even if you those people who have like what'm blocks as like floors or something but yeah so that's technically how clothing works and that's it so again with move you're just gonna move the clone just move in like a building like thing or something and normal it's just gonna clone it normally so like you could create like a whole city just cloning the same buildings that's that's just how people do like they'll just clone the same building like on the road or something and then yeah so right now I am going to create a sky block so you can always create sky blocks with this but you don't even have to build it this is why command blocks are legendary legendary so right now I am writing down the coordinates for this section so my structure is all the way at 80 so with cloning that trees make sure you get if you want trees make sure you get the height of the tree too because it will not clone the top part of the tree then your dreams gonna clone all the way deep in the earth say like y equals 20 that's technically how you do it ladies and gentlemen sleight I'm just gonna do six oh six and then you just clone it up in the air like it's that simple you could just do squiggly lines and then 200 it's really not that hard so that's what I'm gonna do right now and I'll show you how to do it [Music] you [Music] so as soon as y'all get the coordinates you should have something like this if you don't think you should probably go back in the video and check but this wraps up today I hope you guys enjoyed the video make sure you subscribe and like and I'll see y'all guys next time bye", "Lo9ZtvnUDIE": "hey guys welcome back to my China I know I've been talking about this for weeks but it's finally time for me to show y'all all of the official colors for the barrel cosmetics a HD lip gloss line I'm rocking my favorite color of all time

way that you want so each lip gloss comes in this really cute little jar here and the best way to put it on for me at least is using a lip brush and you just use it like normal and wipe the lip gloss on there you also can use your fingers a little bit of more messy that way but sorry guys the lip brush is not included in the orders but you can look find them at your local beauty supply store dollar tree and all of those cheap places for about like 99 cent at the most so I'm going to go in and I'm going to show you guys the other color so this one is go rush so we're going to go in and I'm

snippet that I didn't do swatches of the the two clear ones which this one is ice queen and then this one is crystal ball they're both clear so it's like pretty much like a clear gloss so for those who are not an adventurous for some of the colors that I have these two will be good for someone to just toss them in person you have on those days when you need a little blocks these two are really great they're great to go on top of a color if you want to just make it look a little bit fuller but I didn't bother us watching them cuz they're clear and they have little specks of like reflect glitter in there not really glitter though not that grainy type of glitter cuz that bothers me but like just a little bit of reflex in them so like if y'all really want me to swatch these I can but it's pretty much gonna look just like I have like just a plain gloss on so I didn't bother us watching them all together I have eight beautiful colors thanks to anybody who helped in either inspire a color or help me with the name or anything I just appreciate it and I also want to give a special special special special special shout-out to my teammate my friend my sister Bailey for helping me

good condition for today's episode welcome back elites today it's slime farm time but first I need to show you this so last episode we actually doubled our slime count kind of crazy but no we're still gonna make the farm today's episode is kind of in a way a part too if you're planning on making a slime farm and you're using this video I definitely recommend checking out the last episode first if you're gonna make a slime farm you need to make this farm in a slime chunk if you build it in a random chunk well guess what it's not gonna work so yup make sure you have a slime chunk that is very very important now we spent all of last episode talking about that so we're not gonna talk about that too much in today's episode so yeah just check out the last episode oh right so with that disclaimer out of the way that means it's time to jump into today's project right wrong I need you to do one more thing drop a like on this video and subscribe even if you've already subscribed subscribe again ah ha okay so now let's actually get into the project let's start with the materials the materials have been laid out in this chest by of course yours truly so there are a few different ways to build a slime farm the way that we're gonna build it will need these materials in here and then actually a little bit more I didn't get everything we're gonna use iron golems to trick the slimes into their demise today which means we're gonna need iron blocks and pumpkins to make the iron golems how many iron blocks definitely not a stack don't worry this is sort of just representing things hopper minecart collection systems are pretty much our go-to in this world so we're gonna go ahead and go to that again for this project that means we'll need rails powered rails and a hopper minecart we're also going to set up some fancy circuits connected to that system but those circuits are technically optional if you caught what we did on the show here cane farm pretty recently think that stuff that's stuff exactly will be creating an identical hopper minecart unloading and items and off-station magma blocks will be using Magnavox to get rid of the slime and then we'll need lots and lots of building blocks but notice what's not in here aside from all that other stuff the building blocks why aren't those there well that's because we're gonna mine a lot of building blocks today and we'll probably just end up using those building blocks so if I haven't said yet we have a lot of mining to do today we have a lot of work Pam you're coming with me let's go ahead and go down to the mines to start off the episode so last episode we found the slime chunk the slime chunk that we're working with today is right over here it's really close it's underneath the iron farm this chunk right here is a slime chunk again check the last episode for all of the information on slime chunks now what we want to do is actually go back up to the surface and grab the beacon we we're definitely gonna want to make sure we have hey Stu the whole time reminding out that chunk today because if we don't then things are gonna take a long long time and I mean I mean honestly it's not like I don't have all the time in the world right now I we you know so kind of can't go anywhere stuck inside you know but still but still if I could actually make this not last like all day long that would that would be nice that would be a really good thing I like the sounds of that so beacon it needs to come with us not gonna lie at least I kind of low-key actually enjoy making slime farms these projects are really really grimy they require a lot of digging but I don't know what it is maybe it's just like the chill vibe of it all I kind of enjoyed and from the looks of things from the sounds of things Pam is pretty excited too you know the rule when the minecraft dog starts barking that means the minecraft dog is excited it's definitely a mechanic you could look it up don't bother looking it up just believe me oh alright so we got the beacon now we need to go over to the chunk where we're actually working which is this chunk over there and then we need to dig straight down we need to get really far down on this chunk definitely not under the iron farm as well so our beacon will activate so maybe like right here and then we need to set up the beacon now you know the rule you usually don't dig straight down but I'm pretty confident here that there's no lava I hope I don't make a mistake here with that guess oh yeah what I say we are fine we're good exactly that's exactly what I thought now I think I'm going to go ahead clear out a little bit more space here just to be sure that we can get our fold 9x9 beacon in here I think I'll also actually go ahead and tower up I think what is it for layers for a max beacon maybe four layers put the beacon right there just so I know that the beacon is actually centered under this hole definitely don't want to go through the trouble of placing all of these iron blocks down and then it's off center that would be kind of annoying oh all right so full beacon place down now all we need to do is get haste to going now to be clear you technically don't need a beacon for this project and it's not a required step you could totally do this without a beacon but there is a lot of jigging so I definitely recommend having a fully stacked beacon and a pretty good pickaxe as well today I think we're gonna go with the soap pick because I'd like to use stone in the final build so slime chunk found that's technically step one so step two set up the beacon and get digging we need to dig this entire chunk out but we actually don't technically need to dig it all the way up to the surface so I will only spawn within the slime chunk below y40 so if we go ahead and dig this chunk out to say maybe why 44 then we'll actually be good off to a solid start as we can see there uh-huh uh-huh perfect okay so we're currently at what uh why 11 okay pretty solid starting point what I think we want to do is actually place the ladders and go all the way up to y40 we'll start from the top and dig down that's gonna make things a whole lot easier digging upwards you know that's kind of annoying we would have to place blocks and pillars and yep one work very well if we dig down we can just look at the floor and dig we're also definitely gonna want to have some torches on hand because if mob starts spawning in this chunk or near it while I'm working here that's basically gonna be annoying but here we are up at Y forty or Y 41 this is the perfect starting location so the chunk that we're working with is the one that I'm standing in right now it would be a good idea to start by finding the borders of your chunk so there's a border right there then if we go along this side if we can find the other border which is right over here water water's gonna have to go away though so other border right here if we dig this way we can find the other corner and then we can dig right through here to connect everything up now that we have our border it's time to dig out the center of this Chum now I kind of got lucky and the chunk has a cave in it which means a little bit less digging but then again I got unlucky because this is the only cave to my knowledge in this junk so I'm gonna have to dig everything out all the way and bam is dark again because Pam got in water damn you need to stand with the water you're not water dog now technically for this farm we could cut out a little bit of digging by utilizing subjects what's the sub junk well the sub chunk is basically a piece of a choke so a minecraft chunk is a 16 by 16 block area in your world the chunk goes from the bottom of the world all the way to the top of the world but that chunk is actually divided up into sub chunks if we climb down this ladder we'll see a blue line right here this blue line is a sub chunk it check this out zooming in on the locational information on the f3 screen of course first we have the coordinates negative 271 and so on you know then we have the block finally we have the chunk so we have 0 12 5 in negative 17 1 0 if we start to move up past the blue line that one in the second chunk of numbers went from negative 17 1 0 to negative 17 to 0 we're in the second sub chunk within this chunk now now actually utilizing subjects when setting up a slime farm isn't a bad idea at all forgot to light this up the skeletons go away go away pam pam why do you stand in the corner while I'm dealing with this come on pam pam you help me please please you are the guard dog look the skeletons distracted Thank You Pam nicely done nicely done you too strong way to go pee anyways remember to light things up if you walk away from them utilizing subjects is not a bad idea when doing a slime farm but we're not going to do that today we're just gonna dig this whole thing out so again step number 2 after you found your slime chunk you need to dig it out dig it out from like why 44 why 43 all the way down to like y11 y12 something like that that could be good you could go even farther until you see bedrock but once you see bedrock definitely stop now I've got a lot of digging to do so I'm gonna go ahead and dig I set up some extra supply drop off chests down below I definitely plan on keeping all of the materials that I get when digging this thing out I'm also going to back track a little bit and put some walls on the top part of this chunk like Dover here we don't really need this open I'm also gonna make sure the ceiling is smooth up there I need the ceiling to be smooth because well it's really just about aesthetics if I could make the top of this thing smooth well nothing would change other than the looks it would look a whole lot better anyways though I've got a lot of digging to do I'll be back soon [Music] [Music] no ma'am we got sad under G right here Here I am going back over to the zombie farm I didn't finish yet there's still a lot more digging to be done but the pickaxe is not doing too well we need to repair it I was hoping I could get through all the first part of the digging with with one pickaxe but no no that's not the case here so time for me to wait and fix this pickaxe up and eat it all the way back up to full health that that was a lot of digging that took a long time but oh boy I'm glad to be down digging right right I'm wrong okay there's a lot more digging to do but this is what's happened so far we have a slime chunk dug all the way out and hey would you take a look at that there's a slime down there already that's kind of amazing actually perfect timing my guy I like it Pam's up on the beacon nice and safe there but yeah we have more digging to do unfortunately so yep this has been dug out and the sides look good notice anything or maybe don't notice anything yeah it's all stone it looks really really good on that side and on that side but this side and this one not so much and that's because we need to dig out these sides as well but thankfully this time we don't have to dig a whole chunk so we're just outside of our chunk over here we're gonna pick two sides of our slime chunk the sides don't matter for us we're gonna pick this side and that side the only thing that matters about the two sides is the fact that they're opposite each other after we finish all or at least most of our digging in this next step we're gonna come back in and put some spawning platforms inside of the slime chunk of course we're trying to let the slime spawn right now the only place they could spawn is way down on the bottom like we just had a minute ago but anyways soon we're gonna put some spawning platforms inside of the chunk we need to clear out an area to lure the slimes over to so we can get them to an illumination area and then of course an item collection area that's what the sides are for so slime they're they're pretty small brain did they just hate iron golems for pretty much no reason slime hate iron golem so much they will jump clean off of a platform to try and get an iron golem even if that iron golem is out of reach this is bad for the slime but very very good for us oh boy okay okay aha death number three yep that's right I was trying to get down to a bed to sleep and the Elijah oh the Elijah did to me yeah okay nice eh up everything's here that's beautiful that's good everything's safe that's nice I guess I I guess I guess I won't be flying down this junk anymore yep mm-hmm ah yeah all good because I wanted a shortcut to get to the bed that I should have had on me in the first place very nice we're right back to level six exactly where we began Pam stop laughing stop it anyways I was trying to say that the slime only the slime of small brains we can use that exact mechanic to let the okay okay okay this is getting crazy basically we compare the mechanic of slime absolutely hating iron golems so pair that with their immensely tiny brains and boom we have the recipe for slime to think it's a good idea to jump clean off of a platform to try and get an iron golem they would have never had the chance to get in the first place long story short that's great news for us all we need to do to make that happen is clear out an area on the side of our chunk and then put iron golems in the wall on the other side of that gap the gap is gonna be three blocks wide this time but you could do four blocks wide as well if you make your gap three blocks wide like I'm doing you'll have a little bit less to dig but unfortunately sometimes slime can actually end up landing on ledges near the iron golems it won't cause any problems they'll just land on the ledge and idle around a little bit which can be annoying but there's really not that big of a deal now technically you'll only need to do this on one side of your slime chunk I could do it just over there and I would be good but if I did it just over there in a slime spawn way over here at this side of the slime chunk it'd have to jump around until it gets close enough to the iron golem that will be located in that wall to actually be able to try and jump off of this ledge long story short we can speed that up by doubling the amount of iron golems that we have in this farm and also at the same time doubling up on the amount of falling areas sure it'll be a little bit more digging but in the long run I think it's something that'll be worth it if we can convince the slime to move off of their platform a little bit faster they'll get removed a little bit quicker and then there'll be more room for more slime to spawn starting the process all over again if you don't mind the digging you definitely could do this on all sides of your slime chunk but today we'll just be doing this on two sides you see what you're looking at right here yeah that's right this is hard this is the most cinematic shot of the whole series this is the big money shot right here take a look at that Pam The Beacon the scaffolding the clean stone that's a granite no did I say Endocyte no definitely not did I say that other no I didn't say it that's a clean stone oh boy the digging is finally done and lisas been a long day has been a lot of digging putt finally it is done which means we can climb back up this ladder right to where we would just work yes I know I had to do the fly down and get the materials for the next step that's right we could finally move on so if we press f3 and she turn the chunk border back on it we can see that over here we're out of the slime chunk over there we're out of the slime chunk that means our slime will be falling into this area and being eliminated how are we gonna get rid of them well magma Bloggs we're gonna use magma blocks to get the slime to go away of course we can use other methods like cactus we could use other things like campfires or wither roses but megabox are just the easiest cheapest option that we have here so with that being said we're gonna get rid of the slime with the magma block so the slime balls will be sitting on the magma blocks to pick the slime balls up easy hopper minecart system so we're gonna start by laying some stone bricks down because that's kind of how we like to do things in this world that way if I'm digging around down here don't know why I ever would dig around at Wi-Fi but I mean you never know if I dig around it why five and I see the stone bricks that means it's time to stop digging then we need a minecart line so what we're gonna want to do is actually dig down here and add a power source will do a redstone torch that'll be good redstone torch right there block rail rail rail we have a little bit of a power bump to bounce us off that wall now we need a lot more rails these rails are gonna have to go down this way then we're gonna do a u-turn and go back over this way somewhere in here like maybe maybe that block right there that'll be good we'll put another power source another powered rail another one and another one just to make sure that this minecart stays moving forever now we're gonna take that one out and do another turn just like that put that one back then we're gonna do the exact same we're gonna move back towards the center we'll put another power source down we'll put the stone bricks back and then a few more power rails then we can go ahead and run this line right into the wall now we need to stop and think about something do you think your guy wants to come all the way down here - why five six or seven to get the slimeballs every single time whenever I need slimeballs uh yeah no definitely not that's that's a big no so we can set up a simple circuit system a bubble column to send all the slimeballs up to the service there's a little bit more work but it's definitely worth it I would definitely 100% hate coming down here each and every time I need slime balls just would be really really tedious so what we're gonna do is we're gonna take this rail line the snakes around over here and run it into the wall one block into the wall or two on the second block we're gonna go over towards the center this rail line is going to go towards a central location oi lava be careful I didn't even hear the noise the rail line on this side is going to run over towards the central location it's gonna meet up pretty much kind of with the other one then we're gonna set up on this side so now I need to duplicate exactly what I just did but this time it's over here everything is exactly the same though now the middle of our chunk is right here so let's go ahead and make a hole in the wall temporarily and then pick one spot ah and lava yeah it's gonna have to go away there's a lot of lava down here it was really painful to work with but let's say maybe like that spot right there that's where we'll do our bubble column elevator that'll take items all the way up to the surface but of course if we're gonna have a bubble column right here that takes items all the way up to the surface we need to turn the items that are inside of the hopper minecarts back into items so all we need to do is a simple minecart unloading system this is the exact same thing that we built in the sugarcane farm episode so first things first automatic dropper zargo we start with a dropper placed right there then we have a comparator coming out of that dropper now we're gonna run into a big problem because bedrock so we're gonna have to move everything up not a big deal okay let's go ahead and try that again dropper right there then we need a comparator comparator comes out of the dropper goes that way next up a sticky piston sticky piston goes right here then we did an observer looking towards that sticky piston I said and observer looking towards that sticky piston just like that finally we need an observer placed right on top of the ciggy piston looking towards the dropper we put something in the dropper that moves up the dropper shoots the items out perfect now we need to replicate that on the other side okay so now we have two identical circuits looking towards where the bubble elevator will eventually be which will be right here that'll go all the way up to the surface now of course we need a way for items to get inside of our dropper so that means hoppers if we place a hopper here and a hopper here we'll be good now all we need to do is set up a simple minecart unloading circuit thankfully this circuit is really easy too so coming off of her back hopper here we'll place a comparator that comparator goes into a block with a redstone torch on it above that torch a block then we need a repeater going this way into a block finally to finish everything off we'll need a rail right there a powered rail then we need a solid block right there and we're good this whole side is finished and now I need to replicate it over here again oh right so let's go ahead and run a quick test here we place some minecart with a hopper in it right there it bounces off the wall and it goes this way if we place maybe some items in its way maybe yeah okay it picks it up it goes over this way it unloads those items and then it goes back on its path this cart will continuously run forever yeah yeah yes it will okay cool that's perfect now I did go ahead and come back in here and add a little bit more power to our line over here just to make sure the minecart is good but you sir you you are gonna make a lot of noise you need to stop now so both systems are in and they should be fully functional I'll just need to make sure I block this one off from the outside cave there's a big ravine here I definitely wouldn't want mobs running into the minecart and stopping it now it's magnet block time we'll come back and have the bubble elevator in before we finish everything else so now the magma blocks the magma blocks should go along either side of your slime chunk directly above each and every rail so with the magma blocks in this is what we're looking at now it's time for us to actually block some spawns so slime will spawn no matter the light level it's super bright down here but slime would be able to spawn if I wasn't standing around down here down in this area that would kind of be a problem how will the slime ever make it up on top of the magma block so basically long story short I dug a little bit too Pharr if I take slaps and place them on the floor down here slime won't be able to spawn down here the first spotting platform for our slime should be one block above the magma box not down here basically I just dug a little bit too far which isn't a problem at all so what I need to do is cover the entire floor of this chunk with slabs when putting in the slab floor to block spawns it's 100% fine to remove torches in fact you definitely show to remove torches so you can put slabs everywhere slabs will stop all hostile mobs from spawning so you don't need to worry about light level but the floor down there has now all been slab Dover we're good that means it's time to start setting up our spawning platforms like I just mentioned the first spawning platform should be one block above the magma block so we can go ahead and grab a block any spawn oval block is fine something like granite which is very beautiful by the way would work that's right you heard me right granite there's nothing wrong with it and thankfully I have a lot of it over here along the edge of the magma blocks I use solid granite blocks so that's just for aesthetic reasons you should be making these platforms out of slabs because slabs are cheaper and they work equally as well but I'm gonna go ahead and run solid blocks along the edges of these mega blocks so I can't see under these platforms because I think that would look really bad but granite haters out there I have news for you you have been hating the wrong block all along granite it's fine there's nothing wrong with it the texture is good especially since jaffa did the beautiful beautiful texture update granite it's a good block you shouldn't hate on it we're gonna use granite to make all of our platforms today because I have a bunch of extra granite and I haven't used it in this world quite yet I was initially gonna use stone but that would have been too predictable and actually it probably would have looked I mean it would have looked fine right stones good stone looks nice but it would have been a lot of stone this is all stone so we need to switch it up and use some granite I think at least as long as I have granite so yeah these flat forms should be built out of solid spot herbal blocks and the blocks though they can be slabs so long as you place them on the top half of a block so right here we have a slab top half of the block if you're really unsure if your slabs are in the right spot try and place a torch on it if it works then you're in the right spot if it doesn't work then you're in the wrong spot now these spawning platforms should be solid platforms from side to side platform right here is complete it's a solid platform now thankfully like I mentioned earlier slime will spawn in the light so you should definitely light these platforms up you could get fancy and put your lighting in the floor which is actually what I think I'm gonna do I'm gonna go back up to the storage building and see if I have any see lanterns but you could also just be plain and leave torches on the ground and that would work too one word of advice though don't go too crazy with the torches or the lighting you don't need an obnoxious amount you just need enough if you get your light level above eight everywhere no other hostile mobs will be able to spawn on your platform now sea lanterns what do we have in the stock pile over here do we have a lot we have 46 okay that's enough to start then if I need more I'll run over to the ocean outpost and hello slime would you take a look at that there's been a slime that has already spawned down here too soon too soon you have to go away slime so platform number one is in where does platform number two go well platform number two goes a couple blocks above this one so one two three four on that fourth block is where the platform begins so right there platform number two and every platform after that should be three and a half or four blocks above the previous platform depending on how you look at it again one two three on that fourth block a slab on the top half of the block and the platform begins now I know it's gonna cause a lot of noise but I think it's time that we get our hopper minecarts running so let's go ahead and get those things placed in we'll break you carefully I don't know if there's any lava anywhere down here I don't want it to spill all over this stuff but hopper minecart right there magma block back there and that minecart is running which means I should probably focus on getting this bubble column in I think I'm gonna take a break from placing platforms and go back up to the surface get all the help that I need and get the bubble column going all the way up to the surface up on the surface I'll place a hopper and a chest for all of the slime balls to be stored in okay one more but but before I go up to the surface and do that stuff I'd like to talk about iron golem placement a little bit because it might be easier for you to place your iron golems in as you're setting up your platforms so so generally the more iron golems the merrier on this farm if we have an iron golem in the wall over here and then a slime spawns where I'm standing the slime will be more likely to lock onto that iron golem sooner if we have an iron golem a little higher up the slime we'll still be able to see it it'll just need to move closer to that golems or to the edge of the platform to be able to see it so what am I saying here well I'm saying that iron golems need to be placed on the other side of your gap in the wall how often well that's really up to you and up to how many iron blocks you have I'm going to position an iron golem in between every two floors on either side so that's gonna be a lot of iron golems the Chamber's that you'll be putting your golem s'en should be two blocks deep and definitely should have a light source or two inside of them they don't need to be perfectly centered but you can perfectly Center them if you'd like finally your golem should be kept in with fences I recommend placing fences just like that right there I have a 4 by 4 hole and then I have lots and lots of fences but no fences right here if we were to fill this opening in all the way with fences slime actually wouldn't be able to see the iron golems even though you can see through fences slime can't see through them iron golem number one of I guess the whole world boom right there you live there forever now now earlier on in the video I mentioned something about slime potentially being able to get caught on a Ledge near the iron golems that ledge is the ledge right alongside the fences that spot right there it's not really a problem iron golems are pretty strong have you placed the fences like that the iron golems should be able to keep themselves defended but if you feel a little bit nervous about that you could go back and make your trench that gap area over here four blocks wide instead of three or you could make your iron golem sell a little bit deeper so the Golem has more room to move around okay and with that I think that's actually pretty much every single step of the slime farm so that means I can go ahead and get pretty much the rest of this farm in I need to figure out lighting placement though I'm thinking maybe like there and then we could go to the middle and do oh no the middle would be too hmm I'm gonna figure out how to light this platform up as well does that that's a that's an 8 ok that's perfect that's perfect I'll figure it out anyways I'm gonna mess with the lighting try and figure that out I'll get a bunch of the platforms in the golems in as well and the bubble column as well when I come back we should be just about done with this farm oh wow we've made it such a long way it's been a long day this is a big project but I've actually really enjoyed it look at how close the ceiling is now though if we take a look at our coordinates we're at y 33 a so remember slide will only spawn below Y 40 this platform is at Y 37 if we went up to the next platform we would actually be right above Y 40 which is no good where our Y 41 so that wouldn't work which means the last platform for us based on our spacing is gonna be at Y 37 I'm definitely gonna go ahead and put another iron golem on that side and on that side I have a lot in the walls so far I think I maybe have three on on either side one two three yeah three on either side and all of the platform's look like this so I figured out the lighting I have them kind of space a little randomly but they're also kind of not random at the same time so we have one right here then it goes over then it goes over over over it kind of basically just goes back and forth and then same with the center they go diagonally back and forth this one I think is actually in the wrong spot it should be over there but it's not that big of a deal because the lighting is good everywhere here and it's good on every other platform as well over here I have a little bit of a work area I took the beacon down I moved Pam out of the way you know all that kind of stuff thankfully I was able or am going to be able to finish all of these platforms with the granite that I had I only took like two or three stacks out of the storage room which is really really good in between cuts I did also go over to the ocean outpost for sea lanterns I grabbed two stacks of sea lanterns from there came back put one sack away in the storage building right away and then kept the rest on me also in between cuts I know I did a lot but in between cuts I got the whole bubble column in and the item drop-off Justin as well will check that out once we're back up on the surface there's a slide or there was live now there's a view slimes iron golem iron golem fences and finally last but definitely not least beautiful beautiful granite slabs not gonna lie this is definitely the best looking slime barb that I have ever made all of this granted it's beautiful granted haters tell me what you think about this down below hmm mmm admit it it looks really really good all of the stone - it all looks so clean so perfect but with those vinyl granite slabs that we just place that that is actually the entire slime farm now the thing is up and running in it's good we could totally remove this ladder but for now I'm actually gonna lead the ladder there as an access point I think I'll probably come back at some point and move the ladder to the outside of this farm and then put axes doors to each and every floor why well it's more of a why not type of thing Pam you come with me you are excited about this barn being finished I know I know it's been a long day Pam but we have one more thing to do we need to check out the drop-off chest on the surface and see how many slime balls I have so slime were actually spawning while I was working on that farm especially once it started getting on the higher of platforms the item drop-off chest the thing box storage unit is this thing for now ah it looks like I need to move the slab down okay not a problem at all slab right there so slime balls no get caught up there and I can't open it okay okay okay well that's a bad idea I just dumped water into my slime bar beautiful now it's spilling everywhere else okay okay hold on it was never a problem it never happened because staircase so what do we have in here we have oh nice a stack of slime balls already not bad and two more actually those two were sitting on top of that slab that we just fixed wow that's not bad I'm impressed actually because I haven't been away from this farm a stack of slime balls while I was inside of the farm that's not bad that's not a bad start at all that slime barb is going to get even more productive when we're not near the thing when we're doing other things like things over here doing the outro type of thing you know when we're not close to it wow I am really really happy with that though oh wow and look at that we actually already have more that is really really good we're gonna have so many slime balls in no time we're gonna have more slime balls than we actually ever know what to do was actually being honest we already my be at that point but hey it's okay we can have even more more it's cool so that's how you build a slime farm and that's episode 77 of the Minecraft guide if you haven't dropped a like yet remember to do that it helps these episodes out a lot and to subscribe if

everyone", "-nIQ2AZPuUU": "Oh guys it's a PS gamer here and welcome to a minecraft video and yo as you guys can see we are once again on my building world again so welcome back to the building rope guys once again and once again I was a little bit late and that was a bit weird at the beginning of the video once again because I like literally right when I did the intro of the video I just went it like right in the middle of the intro and it looks like Charlie once again is not is shy okay guys so welcome back to the building world guys once again and for the third building world video I almost did forget pause and also I did just notice that the nametags are showing on pauses space now I could sadly I couldn't sadly put a nametag on Charlie because for some reason it wouldn't work but here for the longest time the name nametags were actually showing up on anything you such as animals see mostly anything though so I'm glad that they actually unpack Soto but anyways before I do anything else I am going to add someone to the EPF friends but before I do that I just need to see a humongous thank you guys for actually putting up with me not posting that much you guys I did tell you guys in the last couple of video videos I am actually pretty busy in my life right now so I'm extremely sorry about that but you guys have been supporting me like crazy and I'm so happy that you guys um that you guys have been supporting me like that and I will continue to try to upload as best as I can so thank you for that guys but before I actually tell you what we are going to be building today I do have to add someone to the AP of friends and that person is Christopher and the reason I'm adding Christopher to the AP efference is because he or she actually sent me um she he or she actually comments on a lot of my videos ever since they've been a supporter and they actually said like hashtag we love the EPF camera hashtag to a PS gamer to 8000 subscribers and stuff like that or basically just says like hashtag wall team that's one of the ones that I saw so yeah and they basically are just a humongous supporters legislate to say thank you for all those comments Christopher and welcome to the AP of Frenchmen thank you for sending those nice comments to me and oh yes guys we are on the back of the AP f French don't I don't know what I'm going to do once the back gets filled up but I don't think I'm just like to say that it's not that it's actually going to take a while but it wit won't actually take a while because I do know that I do have a bunch of supporters and that is you guys and yes and the board will get filled up by I'm like crazy trust me okay guys but um because I haven't posted in such a while I thought that I would make up for not posting in such a while so I thought that I would make up by building something humongous today and that thing is a humongous chocolate bar or a humongous KitKat and it is literally going to be huge I'll tell you all about once I actually start together so the bottom slope is going to be 30 so like this so one table that's actually technically one see I'll tell you guys after I'm done this so one two three together will be quite a bit of counting in this video guys it's just a warning but yeah I should probably cap now I'll talk to you guys after so sorry just about this part but I will talk to you guys after 1 2 3 4 5 but yep 5 & 6 up almost forgot there um 7 8 wait okay sorry guys I just keep messing up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 yes we're finally on high we have to go to 30 which is pretty um which is going to be a lot so 10 and then just get to 11 12 okay I'm gonna start speed up of 13 14 16 16 I will double check again trust me guys so 17 18 19 so much counting 20 almost there guys just um deal with it for a little bit longer 21 I think of 22 23 24 and 25 over there 26 27 and 28 and 29 and finally 30 okay guys I am just gonna do just one more just like account just to make sure that I didn't mess up but thanks goodness were there so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 oh oh I messed up are you serious no okay pause no up oh geez okay pause can you please just come down here don't do that exact same thing don't worry I will heal you I'm sorry pause I'm so sorry I messed up a little bit well that's okay guys sorry once again for the counting guys just don't worry Doug but counting will be done soon just for this part of the video there is going to be quite a bit of counting and I did just realize that Paul just I mean pause just hit the ground well it was sort of his fault for talking about that pause 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 oh ho no are you serious now we have to go 14 fit up seriously 15 16 17 and then 18 don't worry guys I won't double check after this talk about this guys 19 20 21 22 23 24 24 25 26 and 27 28 29 and finally last but not least 30 once again I am sorry about that guys and but I need to get it right or it's gonna totally mess up the build and yeah it is pretty annoying when the dough gets messed up so I'm sorry about that part but you will have to sit here because yeah I know we built the doggy daycare but for some reason I just hate sending him off there I don't know why but I just hate it yeah you guys can clearly see how big this thing is right now okay so now the next thing is that the left side is going to be 17 up okay so the thing about this chocolate bar is that it's sort of going to go on an angle if you can get any of that so yeah it's gonna go from here now we're going to be going up 17 but on the angle like this bunny to make sure they do it like this yes I'm sorry for the counting once again but don't worry it will be done soon okay so but it's only 17 this time right so one two okay look let me just restart that okay so how much have we got it for Freddie yeah okay so this is 1 2 is 1 so 1 2 there nope 3 & 4 5 it's just so much counting I can't believe it's almost done guys 6 7 then almost add 7 8 now why do I keep messing up my I keep messing up every single time 10 11 12 13 and 14 almost no 15 sixteen second last one sixteen and finally seventeen thank goodness like my controller is literally shaking there because there's so much counting okay so yeah you guys can clearly see how big this chocolate bar is going to be already I'm actually not convinced that that's big enough like honestly I have a feeling that I actually messed up oh did I mess up here did I seriously mess up again no I think a host of a gay guys have extremely don't worry guys it's almost over I know I'm counting so much position this is honestly just how it goes but yeah thank goodness there's only a few left so one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 okay 13 so don't worry guys so 14 15 and then 16 we're almost done guys and finally 17 but yeah I'm just warning you guys there is going to be quite a bit accounting just for the first part of the video though okay just for the first part I promise guys okay so the next thing is going to be the top slope is going to be up 30 again oh no oh no just bear with me guys okay just bear with me okay so I believe it's to once again right I'm pretty sure I don't know why we're saying right because yeah you guys already been hearing you probably don't even know so yeah one two three and four oops five and six and seven eight nine ten it's coming so slow Kip Revis 11 yeah I believe that's 11 see at 12 and 13 and 14 of 1516 we're going much faster and i jinxed it but there was a 2k 17 18 and 19 in 2021 almost there guys 22 I know this is painful trust me I watched videos like this and it is painful 23 so 24 25 so what these pics can't go too fast so are myself 27 28 29 and 30 okay not double-checking that and I did just notice that there is a mosquito in here and it it's biting my arm get off okay good I got it off for now but yeah there is a mosquito in here I saw it as soon as I start to record and yeah it keeps finding me it is quite annoying okay even so now guys we're on the last bit of counting now I believe so now we are on the right side which goes up 17 once again and yeah this is basically how big the chocolate bar is actually going to be so just let me just leave my switches right here just like so like that okay then we're gonna go up 17 once more and that is all the counting I believe so what yep one and then two yeah and three yup it's always like this I always mess up four and five and six only seventeen though guys in seven and eight nine and ten eleven and twelve and thirteen fourteen fifteen and sixteen almost there and finally seventeenth okay now that was painful for me and I do realize that we do have an extra block but you know what we'll do I think we're just honestly just going to break that off we'll have to deal with that just let me look at that I did have an extra block in the test for some reason I have no clue on why I had an extra block I'll have to extend it like when I actually unlike when I cut a head I could just like fully just take that part off if I actually really really want on my if I actually really want to but okay guys so at this point in the video this is what I just planned out but at this point I am actually going to cut ahead in the video because I just wanted you guys to get just the gist of what the design is actually going to be in as soon as I can actually find my controller Oh No where is my controller oh it was in my lap the whole time okay guys see ya once again this is just going to be the gist I just want you guys just to see what at least the design is going to be before we start to fill it in so I'll see you guys in one second then you guys I am back okay guys so well can you guys just excuse me for one moment thank you where are you okay this is getting so annoying as a mosquito just detect I story about this dis effect ah oh geez and got me oh I think it's dead okay guys sorry about that I just killed the mosquito that was bothering me the whole entire video before entire time when I was cut a head that dumb mosquito was just bothering me okay guys so basically what I did while you guys were gone would just do like on the outside wrapper of the chocolate bar or the KitKat and nut KitKat and now what we are going to be doing is the chocolate inside it and the chocolate inside the KitKat is actually going to be two layers so it's going to be like this is basically how it's going to go so it's going to be a one wrapper at the back two chocolates in the I mean like two layers of chocolate in the middle and then we're also going to be doing another rapper at the end so in general it's going to be overall it's going to be four layers wide and yes it's going to be pretty fun for me isn't it yeah it's going to take me literally three hours to finish this video well for you guys it's just a simple like 28 minutes or 30 minutes right but for me it's a simple three hours because yeah in between Easter I'm actually going to tell you the truth in between this cut it took me half an hour just to do this yeah it does it takes you at least that long or like quite a bit like 20 minutes to half an hour 25 minutes to half an hour it does take you quite a long time yeah in between this cup my hope is to try to get as much of this chocolate layer done um as we can because because that's the end of this video I really so badly want you guys to actually see me on like making the chocolate up here out of the KitKat and then also putting KitKat specifically on to on the chocolate bar but yeah because um because the chocolate bar is actually open like you're going to be able to see um the chocolate a little bit the end because it's open it's going to look like you won't see all of KitKat all you're gonna see is KitKat that's it oh it actually sounds like isn't KitKat there you ready all my goodness I can see the dead mosquito on the desk you okay that is a sight that I'm never going to get out of my mind okay okay this look at the screen that's good okay I can't stop well okay let's just look at the screen we have like I was saying I actually sort of forget what I would say be able to say um yeah like I was saying there's going to be four layers and there's get it's actually going to look like the chocolate bar like someone's unwrapped it it's going to look like it is being eaten or something yeah if you guys get any of then yeah I'm not sure if you guys getting that yeah I will certainly get it and that's what matters okay then so yeah this is actually going to take quite a while oh and I just didn't realize look at that village in the distance because did you guys I don't know if you guys remember but um we have at least I think at least three or four villagers in this world and we have like one in each corner which is quite weird we have one well we have one right here which is here right now we have another one which is was by the Easter egg and then we also have another one way I would at the other side of the world which we won't be reaching for at least another probably three years on the building world two to three years on the building world yeah I believe yeah actually I think we only have three I'm not entirely sure yeah I'll have to check on the map again if I were a time and yes we do have quite a bit more to go so yeah guys this is what I'm going to try to decide because I don't want to let you keep you guys here for the whole thing because yes this thing as you guys can see is absolutely massive but also another thing that I will definitely 100% not be able to get this chocolate bar or KitKat all done in this video that means with all the details and stuff so if you guys are either um to see or want to see the Kit Kat or chocolate bar all the way done just look at the thumbnail of this video and I guarantee you that in the thumbnail at all the details will be done well after this video is done before I take the picture I will try my best to put all the details that I can think of see if I'm going to estimate by the end of this video we will probably have KitKat on - that's my main goal I don't really care about having the chocolate sticking out either even though that's going to look so yummy because right now just steering the plate just listen to this resent listen to the clay blocks placing do you guys hear that it makes me want to eat chocolate so badly because all I hear is like the clay blocks my bum ba-bum ba-bum ba-bum ba-bum ba-bum ba-bum boom boom boom that's all I hear this whole entire video just in my headset okay okay so let's just keep going there is the village once again and also another thing guys when paws fell off the chocolate bar I was so scared because I was in the middle of concentrating on counting so I didn't exactly have a sort of in shock when it happened but then as soon as I cut a head I'm like oh my goodness okay I'm gonna heal you even more because yeah I did not need to do that and I know guys that pause has not been going off to the doggy daycare lately and that's just because he just keeps water to be in the videos he keeps barking at me saying no because believe it or not before I actually did this video I was planning on taking him to the dog nature because honestly look at this bill he couldn't even been in the video for five minutes yeah I was about to take him to the doggy daycare but then he just kept barking or ruff ruff or no just like saying that and it broke my heart so I was just like okay you got to come in the video because and I know that you guys 100% absolutely love to see paws but he's like a celebrity he's even more of a celebrity than I am right yeah paws is what everyone comes here for right okay yes yeah I can hear positing are you talking about me and yes far as we are talking about you will be will be coming down to see you as like the end of the video to set the yeah let's just looking right okay pause is gone I'm pretty sure it's because the world is like um I'm pretty sure it's just because the we're too high up because yeah believe it or not this chocolate bars at least 130 blocks in the air and pretty sure yeah but 130 blocks in the air it may not look like it but I actually counted it's about a hundred and thirty blocks in the air I think I'm pretty sure but yeah it's about that anyways if you want to know the exact number if you want to build this Theresa and I cannot wait till this is done like and also guys just another thing before this video is unlike I'm always in the video on my build don't always look the best to the end but this is not going to look like a chocolate bar for pretty much the whole video and but until once we get to the end you guys will be like oh it actually don't look like a chocolate bar I want to eat it so yeah that's what happened to me when I was done the testicle then like no but then I had to burn it down me and you do not know how long it took me I didn't only have to burn it down cuz you can't burn place I actually had to break the clay and it took me forever let me just say that I just did realize that I did make wait nevermind I didn't make a mistake there thought I made a little bit of a mistake there but it is okay soon as we get to the end of this row I am going to reboot my slippers and you see I think I just rebooted it but yeah I'll just leave it but then I'm going to see like how far we'd go after we've done two more Rossiya this row then another road that I'm just going to see okay there's the village once again okay then we're almost but I don't know for almost there I want to guess we're about a thirty more lines to go because I don't even think we just a halfway point yet how I'm gonna have to check but yeah let's just see well actually yeah we have we hit the halfway point actually quite a while ago so yeah I'm going to go up actually yeah I'm going to go up two more levels but I'm pretty sure I'm going to go ahead I'm not sure I like keep designing keep looking at like the clock in the video keep watching the time to see are we gonna have time because I really really so badly want you guys to see me put like the chocolate make unlike some of the chocolate appear like make it look like some of the chocolates coming out and I also need time for you to write KitKat which actually is going to take quite a lot of time as well yeah I will actually need to have quite a bit of time for that yeah after this row I'm going to cut ahead okay almost there almost there okay guys so once again I am just gonna kind of head it in the video until we actually get to the UM yeah I am just going to cut it in the video until we actually get to the part where I'm gonna make it look like some of the chocolate is visible and then also we're gonna be doing the KitKat part so I'll see you guys in one second then listen okay I just have to coffee let me just say that again yo guys I am finally back okay guys first of all let me just say that was the longest cut ahead of my whole YouTube experience of my life I literally did 3 or 2 more rows of this that I had to put on all the details that literally took two entire hours but yes I am just about ready to end this video but honestly the video has only been 18 minutes long and it's been like two to three hours for me but before we end off this video I do just have to do a few more things like for first we need to put on KitKat right so yeah let's get straight into it then so how far are we gonna go off so we need to put on the K so 1 2 3 4 so yeah like I said it's not going to be like showing all the way it's going to be like um showing just like half the words gonna be showing like KitKat that's it I know it sounds like I'm saying KitKat just right off the bat yeah we will probably not be able to get to filling in the what's it called filling in on the chocolate over there I tried my best but yeah I just I was missing way too you guys are missing way too much of the video and yes guys I dunno you guys have missed like I don't even know how much you guys have probably missed like so much of the video it's it's awful like it's also as much as you guys send this yeah it's okay though because I did manage to get as much done as I possibly could kids let's see if I can go down to here like this and then I'm gonna make the sign 2 by 2 as well so yeah we 100% probably will not have enough time to make the chocolate a little bit bigger over there but like I said just look in the thumbnail this video and it will be all done okay wait but just need to fix that well I'll try my best to get over yeah just look in the thumbnail once again okay oops okay I made that a little bit too small there I'm gonna have to gonna have to do it like this hey you know what I'm still making decisions here decisions are really really hard to make when it comes to this sort of stuff okay that looks kind of weird that honestly looks kind of weird okay let's do it the other way so yeah we're going to do it unlike it yeah we're going to do it this way but actually you know what I'm going to do I'm just gonna do it like this to be honest with you guys I'm just going to do it like this yeah we only have a few minutes left in this video so I'm going to try to like use my time as widely as I possibly can but I think we can at least fit to sign on in this video right it doesn't really to be honest with you guys take that long to put on the sign because what I did in the test video and only took just a couple of minutes yet honestly won't really take that long so it's okay we don't need to panic just yet and as they say that I mean just yet yeah but the fines not going to be perfect I do just need to remind you guys about that okay can we're almost gone the kid okay let's just say I think that Kay looks pretty good in my opinion I think the Batcave looks epic yeah we're going to keep that kay okay so then we're going to go one two three four like this and then yeah we're going to start up a little bit more higher though remember because remember um it's on Diego and I don't want to make it just go fully straight right so we're gonna start it up a tiny bit more so 1 2 3 uh yeah I guess we could start there I'll fix it outside the video if it doesn't look as good that's good but we are at a very good we are going to make pretty good timing for this video I would say yeah we're going to be pretty good timing in case like that I believe that's going to be ok yet yeah we're just gonna keep it like that first of all we just need to see it okay up up up up up okay good now where's the sec alarians gonna go right beside the eye or am i gonna give it to her now you know what I'm gonna I'm not going to put like me I make k-b I'm not going to put it right inside to the others already I've already like put so I've already have like the most least amount of space in the world beside that said to him I don't I'm not sure if I made the I too high compared to the K but let me just count 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 no that's just perfect would it be hard to me finally getting something just perfect right okay but I still can't get over how long that cut took me like that cut literally took me forever that's how long it was okay so kit that we did so far we just have kit okay so how far is this so it's just two blocks I can go two blocks above again so how like far away is this three four okay so one two three four and yeah I can just do this soak it now we're going to be doing kit we're doing the tea now almost done guys don't worry I don't know why I'm saying I'm not because this video is going to be a regular long video but for me it feels like I'm like okay APF gamer you're almost done I've literally not been able to stretch for three hours this is the longest build that I've ever had to build I do just have to say that definitely okay I think that's gonna be good enough yeah I'm sort of trying my best to make it go up on Mego I am trying my best guys and that's all that matters right okay so like that okay we've done the first done the first layer of that oh yeah forgot I'm making it too so it's going to be no we're going to make it further away because we want to make it even right because if we don't make it even then it's going to look weird it gives you because you know how sometimes things bother you when they're not even like say all of a sudden we're just going to say a cupcake for instance say I'm for instance I just put a cupcake on the table it has to be even for me I cannot have it like on the slightest angle or it doesn't specifically have to be a cupcake but you get my you get the picture right I can't have it just like not even it would just like really really um make me upset like it would really make me like okay I make you want to go change it so badly okay now kit I speak that made that tea a tiny but I think I made that tea a tiny bit too high but that's okay because easily just so fixing and right can we have loads of time to finish the sign as you guys can see in the video okay like this now did I like make it go up at all anymore I don't think I honestly even changed it at all yeah I think I'm gonna have to okay let's see I'm sorry it's funny because I've sorta go I get stuck that cake good okay now go like that and then we can just suck okay good now I get it now okay so far we've done kick I'm not sure if I should make the tea go a little bit farther I'll have to decide that another time yeah KITT and now we're going on to the another k for cat now we're going out to cash two three four but this time we're going to make the K go a tiny bit higher okay yeah Burgas yeah we're totally going to have enough room for the UM for the a but because there's not really supposed to be a space but I'm going to put just a tiny bit of a space just to make it look like like there was supposed to be a space right because yeah cat and I'm not just I'm pretty sure that cat isn't really another word but you know what I mean right you guys know what I mean okay so that's going to be the K right here so let's go up up up up up all the way up to the top like that or like so okay then where are we going to start this I would say here I don't never bite okay that's a little bit too I'm high up yeah it's a little bit too high up okay so and then maybe I can do it wait let me see let me just see this case oh yeah for some reason it seems like I did that k a little bit taller which I thought yeah I think I honestly made that K a little bit too so I mean a little bit taller so yeah I yeah that's going to do it I guess we could say that's going to do it right okay now let's see if we can place it there yep that's going to be pretty good Kaelyn two three Vedas I know we gotta go Oh Justin up oops I broke part of the chocolate secretly I just wanted to eat some know you guys knew my secret though but it's okay guys I will share some with you that is one of the points of this video right because yeah I haven't uploaded in a while and I'm so happy that you guys have been okay with that because yeah like I did say a billion times I am very busy in my life at the moment so yeah honestly it looks like kick butt like spelt differently it looks like kick butt spelled differently okay so now we're going to be doing - oh for a second I thought I did the bubble letters weird for a second I thought thought I did them weird okay so but for this I'm going to be making it go out this way it's going to be kind of awkward 250a in but it's going to be okay because yeah we sort of don't want to like 50 a and all the way to the it's going to be cut off just the slightest bit right okay so like this see please please please that we just have to fit the small and I think yeah we're just want to do it now we just have to do the a I think I made the k2 short but it doesn't matter right it's just it just matters what word just manage let me actually get it in right okay so one two three four okay here we go now it's time to actually try to fit the a and I don't know how well this is going to go though okay so go down just the slightest that I guess we could say like this I honestly don't even know what I'm doing here maybe I can make it go up like this because yeah we're going to try to make the eight pretty big because like half of the bars getting cut off right see I'm going to try to make it preemie but yeah I am just gonna start saying bye to you guys right now well anyways guys I really really hope that you guys did enjoy this video of me building

So tear open your favorite wrapper because\nwe're counting down the Top 10 Chocolate Bars Ranked Worst to Best. Skor Considering that this chocolate bar was made\nto be a direct competitor to the Heath bar, we\u2019re prepared to take a little bit of heat\nfor this preferential pick. Yes, we\u2019re claiming that the Skor bar is better than the Heath\nbar and that\u2019s why it is where it is on this list. While the Heath bar has long been\noffering customers a delicious toffee crunch, it is really the Skor bar that took the fantastic\nrecipe and brought it to the next level. The confectioners behind Skor were able to produce\na bar that reviewers claim has a stronger chocolate and a more buttery flavor and consistency\nin comparison to its counterpart the Heath bar, which is said to focus more on the almond\nflavor rather than the butter. The funniest part is that although the Skor was produced\nby Hershey as a direct competitor to the Heath bar, today in 2020, the Hershey Company now\nowns both bars! Despite no longer needing the two similar bars to go head to head in\ncompetition, a long standing feud in consumer preference has forced the company to continue\noffering both bars to cater to the fans. Luckily for us, it doesn\u2019t look like these crunchy\nbars will be going anywhere anytime soon - so they can continue sticking in our teeth for\nyears to come! Hershey\u2019s Cookies \u2018n\u2019 Cream Starting us off is a contender who is really\nan impostor - but just too delicious to ignore. Although years ago the\u00a0Hershey\u2019s Cookies\n\u2018n\u2019 Creme bar changed its recipe, replacing cocoa butter with other ingredients so it\nis no longer considered actual white chocolate, this has not seemed to deter fans from binging\non this far from ordinary candy bar. While many of the chocolate bars listed opt for\ngooey or crunchy fillings of peanut butter, caramels, and nougat, the Cookies\u2019n\u2019 Creme\nbar opts for a solid chocolate bar with mix-ins distributed throughout. The mix-in in question?\nDelicious chocolate cookie pieces. The entire bar makes one think of the popular Oreo cookie\nsandwich - and although the taste of the two is very different, it can be seen that both\nhave similar qualities. The difference mostly lies in the additional sweetness factor that\nthe bar offers in comparison to the salty crunch of the cookie. Fear not though, as\nthe entire candy bar is filled with tiny cookie pieces that give it just enough of that salty\nvs. sweet flavor that everybody loves. And anyone who adores this chocolate bar must\ngive this hack a try: take one Oreo, a toasted marshmallow, and a square of Hershey's Cookies\n'n' Creme bar. Assemble the three ingredients like a s'more and enjoy a flavor explosion\nlike none other! Almond Joy So how does a candy like Almond Joy end up\non the list of the Top 10 Chocolate Bars? By being so absolutely different and delicious!\nWhile most of the confectionery market in the United States has chosen to steer away\nfrom coconut, with its somewhat polarizing and unmistakable flavor profile, Almond Joy\nhas used the ingredient to its advantage in creating one of the tastiest treats on the\nmarket! Before getting any deeper into a few interesting facts about Almond Joy, it\u2019s\nimportant to give credit where it is due to the mother of the Almond Joy, Mounds. Mounds\nare very similar to the Almond Joy in nearly every way. However, the almond originally\nwasn\u2019t used when Mounds were created in 1920, leaving only the chocolate and coconut\nfilling. It would be 25 years before the demand for something new saw the addition of a popular\nnut and the Almond Joy was born. Unlike many chocolate brands who have dropped variations\noff over time, Almond Joy and Mounds have remained true competitors and friends in the\nmarket. As the popular retro commercials used to say - 'sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes\nyou don't'. With enough demand for both bars, Hershey has been able to continue production\nand satisfy demands since purchasing the company in the 1980s. In these difficult times, with\na slogan like \u201cUnwrap Paradise\u201d maybe we all just need a little more Almond Joy\nin our lives! Butterfinger In the race for the best baseball themed chocolate\nbar, the Baby Ruth is an easy choice to make. However, this close relative is an even more\ndelicious and arguably more popular chocolate bar to slide safely onto this list: the Butterfinger!\nThe hilarious name from this chocolate bar actually stemmed from a contest! Considering\nthat the manufacturers were already producing the Baby Ruth bar, executives marketed both\nbars by dropping them out of airplanes over cities in the 1920s. Although Butterfingers\nare rarely associated with baseball, these delicious peanut buttery chocolate bars are\nadored by candy fans. In fact, these bars are so valuable that in 2018 Ferrero Rocher\nbought the bar along with several other Nestle products for nearly $3 billion dollars! That\u2019s\na lot of cocoa! Although truly an American snack icon, perhaps no one loves the Butterfinger\nmore than one of America's most well recognized families, The Simpsons! Not only did Butterfinger\nhelp give the Simpsons a boost in popularity, as the characters appeared in a commercial\nbefore their own television slot, but the bar has also made guest appearances on the\nshow in recent years, including one of the popular Treehouse of Horror Halloween episodes.\nNothing beats a Butterfinger! Reese's Cups There is no doubt that one of the world\u2019s\nmost popular chocolate bars focuses on just two simple ingredients that are now known\nas soul mates: peanut butter and chocolate. Reese\u2019s cups were originally released to\nthe public in 1928. After good sales during WWII due to the fact that peanut butter was\nnot being rationed, Reese's cups continued to skyrocket to success. Their popularity\nincreased especially after their cousin Reese\u2019s Pieces was featured in the 1980s film E.T.\nThe Extra Terrestrial. Today, Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups are one of the world\u2019s most\nbeloved chocolate treats, accounting for almost 50% of seasonal sales. In fact, if every person\nfrom the US, China, Australia, India, and Europe wanted peanut butter cups, Reese's\nfactories make enough in a year to give each and every person one cup! That is a whole\nlot of peanut butter and chocolate! Nowadays, flavors from caramel, to crunchy, to dark\nchocolate and more are all available for purchase and that is just the beginning. Currently\non Reese's website, the public can submit suggestions for new flavors of Reese\u2019s cups!\nImagine the possibilities! Perhaps a peanut butter and jelly cup! Or maybe even a new\ncup entirely, with dark chocolate and a candy cane filling! For any fan who has thought\nthat they have had the perfect filling and cup idea, now is your time to shine! Twix So which one do you eat first? The left Twix\nor the right Twix? The idea that one side is better than the other when it comes to\nTwix bars is part of the company\u2019s genius marketing platform launched in 2013 in order\nto boost sales. Although there is no real difference between the two chocolate bars,\nthe campaign tells us how one side envelopes and the other side smothers the bar in chocolate,\nin describing how the left vs. right Twix bars are crafted. The advertisements even\nincluded a \u201chistorical backstory\u201d commercial to describe why the two bars are made so \u201cdrastically\ndifferently\u201d. Both bars are actually made of a biscuit interior with a layer of chewy\ncaramel and then covered in a smooth milk chocolate in exactly the same way. The true\nhistory of the name is really just a simple abbreviation of words. Instead of calling\nthe chocolate bar \u201cTwin Biscuit Sticks\u201d the name was shortened down to the popular\nand memorable \u201cTwix\u201d, which has to be one of the cutest names for a chocolate bar\naround! Before settling on the name Twix, some European fans may remember the chocolate\nbar being called \"Raider\" for many years. The \"Twix\" name was only changed once the\nbrand decided to venture into the United States. The taste is absolutely incredible and a perfect\noption for any date night, as each person gets their own chocolate! Win win! Just try\nto remember to actually share! You can still pick your favorite side. Milky Way It would be an absolute crime if this list\ndid not include one of the most iconic chocolate bars of all time: the Milky Way bar. There\u2019s\na reason that the cast of \u201cThis is the End\u201d finds themselves at odds over who deserves\nto eat potentially the last Milky Way bar on earth. These things are so creamy and delicious!\nWhat may be surprising to some, is that despite its popular use in American pop-culture, the\nU.S. version of the Milky Way bar, and the flavor that Americans are so accustomed to,\nis actually sold under another name worldwide. Although the Milky Way bar can be purchased\nglobally, the version sold in the United States is completely different to the international\nversion. While the American version of the bar features a caramel layer over a thick\nnougat and then draped in chocolate, the global version opts to remove the caramel and lighten\nthe nougat. These recipes may sound familiar to many, as on the global market, the Milky\nWay bar is actually sold as the \u201cMars\u201d bar and the international Milky Way bar recipe\nis sold in the US market under the name \u201c3 Musketeers\u201d. Confusing? Maybe. But luckily\nno matter what part of the world someone finds themselves in, they\u2019ll be able to get a\ntaste of some version of this light and tasty chocolaty nod to our galaxy. Snickers There may be no more well advertised chocolate\nbar in the world than the Snickers bar. In 2010, Snickers launched the \u201cYou\u2019re not\nyou when you\u2019re hungry\u201d campaign. The advertising campaign featured a wide range\nof celebrities with everyone from Betty White and Mr. T to Sir Elton John himself. The campaign\nfocuses on the idea of \u201changer\u201d which are those feelings of irritability commonly\nattributed to hunger. The campaign features a celebrity in an unusual role. Another character\nwill then offer a Snickers bar to the celebrity in question and after eating the bar, they\nimmediately revert back to their original self. Only after the hunger has been satisfied\nwith the taste of a Snickers bar is the scene set right. One such campaign featured Rowan\nAtkinson playing his star Mr. Bean character as a ninja. Only after Mr. Bean eats the Snickers\nbar does he return to his warrior self, enabling him to take on the troupe of enemies. The\ncampaign has been considered wildly successful, and in the first year of its use alone it\nwas able to boost sales globally by nearly 16%. This is a massive accomplishment for\nsuch an already well-established chocolate bar. With a wave of popularity like that,\nthe next time hanger has you down, reach for a Snickers! Kit Kat Whether talking among friends, checking out\nranking websites on the internet, or reading opinion pieces on the top chocolate bars of\nall time, at almost every turn, one encounters the beautiful red, glistening packaging of\nthe Kit Kat Bar. The light and beautiful textures of the wafer cookie layers, in smooth and\ncreamy milk chocolate sends fans through the roof when it comes to this chocolate bar.\nThis obsession starts at a young age as every child can remember digging through their Halloween\nbags in order to find just one more bite size Kit Kat treat. As fans grew up and their tastes\ndiversified, so did the flavor profiles of the Kit Kat bar itself, as the chocolatiers\nbehind this perfect confectionery worked tirelessly to develop new flavors. Although\u00a0the versatility\nof the Kit Kat may mean just about any flavor would taste good, it is the careful care and\nresearch that ensures every flavor of Kit Kat to hit store shelves is a guaranteed success.\nSince launching in 1935, Kit Kat has expanded to include flavors such as Dark Chocolate,\nOrange and Mint just to name very few. In Japan, the versatility of this bar, and its\nconnection to good luck, has meant that over 200 flavors have been created and sold! The\nnext time you\u2019re looking for a break, you know exactly which chocolate bar to grab. Dairy Milk The reason for both the name of the candy\nbar and it\u2019s creamy consistency can be attributed to one obvious ingredient: milk! At the time\nof Dairy Milk\u2019s creation, it was using far more milk in its processing than competitors,\nwhich in turn created a much more luxurious consistency that not only left a creamy and\nsweet taste on the tongue, but also a craving for another delightful bite! Apparently the\nAmerican market was actually fearful of just how amazing this chocolate tasted! In 2015,\na law was passed banning the import of the internationally made Cadbury chocolate, allowing\nHershey\u2019s to license and produce Dairy Milk in the US - although with a slightly altered\nrecipe. Considering that British Dairy Milk often beats out its competitors in blind taste\ntests, it\u2019s obvious why the US market would want to get in on the action and why the UK\nwas happy to keep their original chocolate stashed away! While many other nations are\nable to import the classic purple wrappers, not everyone may be familiar with the various\nflavor options. Fruit & Nut, Caramel, and Whole Nut (a hazelnut flavor) are some of\nthe tastiest varieties currently available for sale! Whether trying out an American or\na British version of the chocolate bar, you\u2019re already a winner because everyone loves a\ngood Dairy Milk!

But which ones are the best, and which ones\nleave the most to be desired? Here are the rankings from yuckiest to yummiest. Butterfingers are definitely unique. And like so many unique things, people either\nlove them or hate them. There's really no in-between. The Butterfinger is likely so divisive because\nof the texture of the candy layers. If you're expecting a deliciously creamy peanut\nbutter experience, this definitely isn't it. As the old Bart Simpson commercials advertised,\nButterfingers are \"crispity\" and \"crunchity,\" not smooth and creamy. \"Crispity, crunchity Butterfinger from Nestle.\" \"Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger.\" So where does the unusual brittleness in the\ninside of a Butterfinger come from? Corn flakes. To make a Butterfinger, corn flakes are added\nto peanut butter, and then a separate sweet, crystallized molasses concoction is created. These two mixtures are folded together and\nformed into the bar, which is then enrobed in chocolate. Many people hate the result, but you never\nknow until you try one. Even the worst candy bar is someone's favorite. If you love coconut, Almond Joy or Mounds\nshould be your go-to candy bar. Almond Joy has sweetened, shredded coconut\nand whole almonds smothered in a milk chocolate coating. The main downfall is the chocolate itself. It's grainy and bland rather than smooth and\nsweet. But if you are a big coconut fan, you aren't\nmunching on Almond Joy for the chocolate anyway. You just want to get your coconut fix. Over the years, Hershey's has produced limited-edition\nvarieties of Almond Joy, including white chocolate key lime and pi\u00f1a colada flavored versions. Most of these variations have flopped, and\nthe company has thankfully stuck to the original for the last decade or so. If you prefer dark chocolate, grab a Mounds\nbar instead. It has the same coconut center, but with a\ndark chocolate coating, and no almonds. If coconut's not your thing? Skip them both. Both these bars are made by the Hershey Company\nand are chocolate-covered toffee bars. So what's the difference between them? They are ever-so-slightly different. In the Heath, the toffee is a lighter color\nand the almonds in the toffee are visible. The almond taste is the overriding flavor. In the slightly thinner Skor, the toffee flavor\nis rich and buttery rather than almondy. And the Skor bar does seem to get stuck in\nyour teeth a bit more than the Heath does. If you're a toffee fan, try them both. The subtle differences in the toffee will\nlikely determine your favorite. If you're not into toffee, which can be an\nacquired taste? You'll probably hate them both. With its bright yellow wrapper and big red\nlogo, you can't miss Hershey's Mr. Goodbar on the shelf. But this candy bar is mediocre at best. During the Great Depression, Mr. Goodbar sold\nfor just a couple cents each and was marketed as a \"tasty lunch\" because of the nutrition\nof the added peanuts. But it's been almost 100 years since then,\nand the bar has barely changed with the times. Peanuts and chocolate are typically an awesome\ncombination, but Mr. Goodbar doesn't really live up to its name. It's just milk chocolate combined with a bunch\nof Spanish peanuts, and though it's not horrible, it's not impressive either. There are just a few too many peanuts and\nthe chocolate isn't as rich and creamy as it should be. Unless it's one of the last candy bars on\nthe rack, you can almost always find something better to satisfy your sweet tooth. PayDay candy bars were created in 1932 by\nthe F.A. Martoccio Macaroni Company. Production of these peanut caramel bars has\npassed between multiple companies since, and they're currently part of the Hershey family. There's no doubt that if you love peanuts,\nyou'll love this bar. \"It's more than candy! It's a PayDay bar.\" \"Are those peanuts?\" \"Yes!\" A PayDay is simple: It's a log of firm caramel\nrolled in salted peanuts. The saltiness of the peanuts and the sweetness\nof the caramel makes for a happy marriage. But don't ever put it in the refrigerator,\nthe caramel center will become impossible to chew. The big sticking point for a lot of folks\nis that there's not any chocolate at all in a PayDay, though there was a now-discontinued\nchocolate-covered version many years ago. If you like the composition of the PayDay\nbut want chocolate too, then get yourself an Oh Henry! bar. The iconic Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bar isn't\nlacking in popularity: More than 264 million of these bars are sold every year. But if you've ever tasted high-quality chocolate,\nyou'll know its popularity isn't necessarily because of the quality. Hershey's chocolate just isn't really that\ngood. It's not very creamy and even a bit waxy. But it's affordable, easy to find and, maybe\nmost importantly, everyone's heard of it. For s'mores over the campfire, Hershey's will\ndo just fine. But for melt-in-your-mouth lusciousness, this\nis definitely not it. And you don't need to spend a small fortune\non European chocolate to eat something better than Hershey's. Other brands of milk chocolate, including\nDove and Godiva, are better. So, if you have a choice, buy one of those. The 3 Musketeers bar is simple: a whipped\nnougat center covered in a coating of milk chocolate. That's it. Just nougat and chocolate. And while some candy bars feature very dense\nnougat, the 3 Musketeers nougat center is soft, light, fluffy, and delicious. But because these candy bars are so light\nand fluffy, one bar can feel a little unsatisfying. Are you wondering why it's called 3 Musketeers? When this bar was first manufactured in 1932,\neach package contained three small bars with chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry flavors. But during World War II, cost-cutting measures\nforced the elimination of the strawberry and vanilla pieces. Mars has produced other varieties of 3 Musketeers\nover the years, but the originals never came back. Hershey's Cookies 'n' Creme bars are the same\nsize and shape as its iconic milk chocolate bars. But these bars are white and contain little\npieces of Oreo-like chocolate cookies. Hershey's replaced cocoa butter with a mixture\nof oils to create these candy bars, so it's not even really white chocolate. Even so, if you're looking for something other\nthan milk or dark chocolate, these bars are a pretty tasty option that you can find at\nmost stores. If you like the white portion of the Hershey's\nCookies 'n' Creme but crave a little more crunch, you'll also like their White Creme\nwith Almonds bar introduced in 2019. These might be a little harder to find than\nother Hershey bars, but they are worth hunting down. Crunch bars have their issues, for sure. For one, the chocolate has a tendency to break\ninto a million slivers upon your first bite if it's cold. But the combination of chocolate and crispy\nrice is hard to deny. They're two things that just seem to go together. And if you're popping entire fun-size Crunch\nbars into your mouth, the shattering chocolate is less of a problem. Nestle sold its American candy brands, including\nCrunch, to Ferrero in recent years. But years ago, when Nestle still owned the\nCrunch brand, the chocolate giant expanded it to include Crunch Ice Cream Bars, a clear\nargument in favor of Crunch as a top-tier chocolate bar brand. Invented in 1964, this candy bar was originally\nmarketed as the $100,000 Bar before its name changed to simply \"100 Grand\" in the mid-1980s. It adds another element to the Crunch formula:\ncaramel. It manages the perfect amounts of caramel,\ncrisped rice, and chocolate so that none overpower the others. It may not be the most popular bar on this\nlist, but it does a lot right. And because of its name, the 100 Grand bar\nhas been used in several newsworthy pranks. In 2005, a woman sued a radio station after\nthey gave her a 100 Grand candy bar as a contest prize instead of the actual $100,000 she was\nexpecting. Originally produced in the United Kingdom\nin 1967 as the Raider bar, this candy bar wasn't brought to the shores of the US until\n1979. But it didn't take long for it to become a\nhit. The name Twix combines the words \"twin\" and\n\"biscuit,\" since Brits tend to call cookies \"biscuits.\" \"Twix is the only candy with the cookie crunch.\" \"What about the $100,000 Bar?\" \"Nope, rice and caramel.\" \"Nougat?\" \"No.\" \"Positive?\" \"Please.\" In the last thirty years, a number of different\nunusual flavors of Twix have been released, including coffee, mint, and Cookies & Creme. Still, most candy bar aficionados will agree\nthat the original variety still remains the best. In 2017, more than $63 million worth of Twix\nwere sold in the United States, making it one of the top six chocolate candy brands\nin the country. Chocolate, caramel, and nougat come together\nbeautifully in the Milky Way bar. Though this nougat isn't quite as fluffy as\nthat in the 3 Musketeers bar, it's not super dense or heavy, either. But make no mistake: It's the caramel in the\nMilky Way that makes it special. Some chocolate bar caramel is too hard, and\nsome is too watery, but the caramel in a Milky Way is gooey and creamy perfection. Milky Way isn't named after the galaxy. Instead, its name comes from malted milk,\na popular drink back in 1923 when the candy bar was introduced. And if you're traveling in Europe, try not\nto get confused. Milky Ways there are more like American 3\nMusketeers bars, while Mars bars in Europe are more like the American Milky Way you crave. So if you'd rather eat cheap candy bars than\nexpensive Swiss chocolate on your trip to the Alps, now you know. Standard Kit Kat bars have two or four pieces\nin the package you can snap apart. Each piece has three wafer layers separated\nby chocolate, and of course, the whole thing is covered in more chocolate. The result is a wonderfully light, yet absolutely\ndelectable treat. In the United States, 192 million Kit Kats\nare sold each year, making it the fourth most popular candy bar in the country. Outside of America, Kit Kats are sold in a\nwide array of flavors including scrumptious varieties like Strawberry Cheesecake and uniquely\ndisgusting ones like Cough Drop. In the U.S., you'll find the original milk\nchocolate version, as well as newcomers like Mint & Dark Chocolate and Lemon Crisp. Whatever flavor you prefer, few candy bars\ncan touch Kit Kat's versatility. You can eat your Kit Kats by themselves, break\nthem up into ice cream, crumble them into cookie batter, or use them to decorate cakes. We'll just note here that if Reese's Peanut\nButter Cups were bar shaped instead of cup shaped, they'd be at the top of our list. But we'll abstain from a debate about whether\nthey're candy bars. Reese's Take 5, definitely a bar, is the next\nbest thing. It takes the chocolate and peanut butter of\na Reese's Cup and adds caramel, peanuts, and pretzels. Initially released in 2004, this candy bar\nhas struggled to gain traction among buyers. Hershey has tried adding different ingredients,\nchanging the wrapper, and most recently renaming the bar as Reese's Take 5 to associate it\nwith that wonderful cup. Sales of Take 5 may never skyrocket, but that\ndoesn't take away from how amazing it is. Every bite is crunchy, salty, sweet, and chewy. It's beautifully complex. If you've never tried a Take 5, change up\nyour candy bar habits by giving this relatively new bar a try. Mars makes 15 million Snickers bars every\nday and dubs it the world's best selling candy bar. The original Snickers bar, first produced\nin 1930, is still the best. Its combination of caramel, peanuts, and nougat\nsurrounded by milk chocolate is just about perfect. However, you can also find several variations\nincluding the Snickers Xtreme, which does away with the nougat. Snickers Almond and Snickers Peanut Butter\nare also worth trying at least once, although they're not good enough to eclipse the original. Aside from just being delicious, clever marketing\nand advertising campaigns undeniably play a role in this candy bar's popularity. \"You get a little hostile when you're hungry. Better?\" \"Better.\" And it can actually pay off on its \"You're\nnot you when you're hungry\" slogan; it's hearty enough to make it a meal all on its own, yet\nflavorful enough to be an exciting dessert.

minecraft java and shin will i think automatically we start restart minecraft bedrock edition and it will say unlike the full game because bedrock and java doesn't mix so if you guys enjoyed this video leave a like maybe even subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next video good [Music] bye so you", "cDj9ppAlebc": "[Music] what's up this is couch potato mike coming to you from taterville yes the future home of my gigantic villager city let me show you what i've done so far in here this is going to be the town hall and uh does it look like much right now but i chose uh to use quartz in this and quartz is a bit of a sometimes so uh you gotta go mining in the nether which is always dangerous uh now as you guys saw on a previous episode i had built a bartering uh automatic piglen bartering uh system uh which i then built a better one on my wife's world and then came back to mine and built and converted the less efficient one to the more official one but you know what piglet bartering uh farms need gold and if you're looking at my screen right now well well not my screen your screen i hope you see that i built the new gold farm you guys knew that i had that other gold farm well i built one right here in taylorville because i mean damn i just need more gold and this one's even more awesome because it has off and on switches it's a lot more compact and let me show you what it does here let me just apply these steps real quick turn this on that turns it off and on any second now you should see piglets start coming there you go and instead of plummeting to their little deaths there we're just going to flip this switch right here and turn on this mechanism and just start mortalizing it and if you look at the bottom of the screen i know they're a little loud but if you look down at the bottom of the screen watch my experience bar as i stand right here it's climbing and i'm not doing a damn thing how awesome is that really and uh my wife wants one of these too so uh just give me a minute and i'm just gonna pop right on over to her world and i'm back i'm over here in uh my wife's world now the crafty uh the lovely crafty potato who's running around in the background there because uh spider spider okay yeah there is a spider back there need some help with that spider bit oh you got it all right well this is the site where we're gonna be building this on her world in case you're wondering why my health is low just had a wick attack me which also explains that empty bucket right there now for speaking of buckets for this build you are going to need a bucket of lava a couple of buckets of water you're going to need about five trapdoors you're gonna need almost a whole stack of obsidian you're going to need a slab a sticky piston for regular pistons you are going to need a dispenser 16 observers i think some levers at least two uh stacks of solid blocks whatever blocks you want to use you're going to need a rail you're going to need uh oh it's down here you're going to need a hopper you're going to need a mine cart with a hopper uh let me see uh you're gonna need some ladders you're gonna need a trident uh and uh hey i got a potion of swiftness off that which cool and some sugar i got distracted all right well let's just uh get into this and if you need anything else i'll let you know when it happens all right yeah here we go gonna need a good wide open area like this one now what we're going to do we are going to start uh i got a bunch of cobblestone um now but we're not using the cobblestone my wife uh wanted uh for this i guess for an aesthetic reasons we are going to be using smooth stone for everything that we need here so what you're going to do we're going to start by building a little pillar up one two three and you're going to build this 15 long so so that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15. all right and now uh hold on let's uh we don't need that quite yet so let me put that cobblestone back on here this is going to be my uh scaffolding for this particular build and we're going to hop right back up here son of a all right we're going to build try this again two ali all right now we're gonna get out our obsidian don't need the ladders or that quite yet again all right so and we're just going to cover this with obsidian ah i did go find all that stuff myself yeah she did collect all this uh in survival mode because you know me i only build in survival mode which is means this is gonna get really  interesting when i have to build the other side of this thing so uh is there a safe way to do this i would imagine so but i'm not gonna so that's two three eleven twelve 13 14. 15. thank you all right so the hell it works for dream all right hey i'm still alive how about that all right and now we're going to build up on the other side here i'm going to do this a little bit safer i think so ah here we go all right and we're just gonna cut our way back down  right here now as it stands we currently have um a completed nether portal now the key to this we need to find out which way uh piglens are going to come out of this thing so i'm going to go ahead and pull out the uh flint and steel here don't need this quite yet don't need the sugar at all but whatever and uh we're just going to light this some and we're going to watch we're going to wait and see which side because this portal is so big a pig one will come out of here at some point now we could just turn this off and turn it back on again repeatedly but i really don't want to wear down this damn this damn pickaxe so let's just wait and see what happens okay i'm back i was actually in the process of building a little contraption to temporarily turn this off and on when this guy just finally decided to fall the out of the damn portal yes go kill him actually let your dogs kill them good boys it looks like he dropped a gold ingot there for you so uh yeah so this means that all the piglets will drop on this side they always uh will drop um on there so uh now we know what we are doing so we take the side that uh is going to uh that they're gonna drop on and first things first we are going to build a uh thing all the way down here all right so uh starting right here if i'm not mistaken we're just going to build this all the way down hey all right first thing we are going to uh we are going to build a little chamber right here that's a ditch basically it's going to run all the way down this thing almost all the way down all right i'm actually going to put that there and then we are going to come until see here i believe i believe i believe well we'll let the water dictate exactly where because we're going to be putting up some water too so actually just go ahead and build this all the way down and we can remove what we don't need in a minute all right so now we need to uh climb up here hello we're going to be building this up uh see where we at right now from build up a c until a height of uh four this being one so one two three four i'm gonna try to go into the nether again one make it too wide here son of a all right uh hold on jump around all right hell all right hold on we are going to build a glass wall in front of this all right so let's get the hopper off here and move the glass down oh god i hate it when it happens but i'll come back and fix that in a minute okay that's where i'm going to stop for the moment so i'm going to come back down here and place these two blocks now we're going to get this bucket of water out and it is in fact going to dictate where i stopped building that wall i'm just going to ride this on down nice refreshing ride yeah see and we're going to take out this block and this block now we're going to extend this over this way by two then come back this way by two and we're gonna put a block right there and we're gonna spin around for a minute and this builds this little uh area right here which is awesome uh and that area is very important the water comes right here this is going to be the start of our kill chamber all right so we can actually go ahead and build this glass down a little bit more uh where's my glass all right all right one more row as a matter of fact now we want to leave this area up slightly open uh what we're gonna do here right now is going to hello honda is it all ready all right well i'm going to build for another second here usually when she comes running past me like that all hell's about to break loose we're going to go ahead and build this up on the end here towards even with the glass now at this point uh we're going to go ahead and build this little area up too i need more uh smooth stone but not all the way all right not like the other side i'm gonna go one more here and one more here and at this point or what we're going to do uh we are going to get out an observer although i don't think i need any more of the glass blocks at least not for the time being so we're going to get out is this an observer those are observers uh we're going to get out a dispenser oh we're going to get the bucket off our hot bar and then we're going to get out a dispenser so now you're going to want to place the uh hold on you're placing them both facing the same way you being attacked on all right we're going to try not to dip into the nether here all right so that you want the dispenser facing that way and no i'm sorry that's not the dispenser that's the observer and the dispenser facing that way too and get the hell out of the bed all right i'm gonna go ahead and open this up a baby one we'll go ahead and kill it and go ahead and drop that in there and then we're just going to go ahead and cover these on up and yeah all right all right let's hop in bed real quick giggity i personally think if you're married on the game you should be able to hop into the same bed now i lit this portal myself which is fine and everything but this portal uh the way it works it has to turn itself off and on repeatedly that way it makes the piglet spawn so we're gonna come up here and we've got to build a little self lighting chamber so we're going to come down to this end right here put a block right on the end and build down by seven i think that was four five six and seven all right pop down here now on this end yeah get the torch out of the way all right on this end we're going to crouch again and we're going to place an observer facing outward all right there is an invisible wandering trader right here you know hiding would work better if you weren't going every like few seconds all right so you got your one observer that way now you're going to want to put five more face in the other direction i hope i can do that from down here yes okay it is letting me that's one two two why is it doing that that's crazy you guys are seeing that right three four five all right now we're going to completely wrap these around i am using the wrong block sorry about that hon i bet nobody's really going to be able to see this part so okay that one was an accident you just want to bring it down here to the end like this and put the i'm just a bunch of non-happy accidents this evening all right hold on are you kidding me all right now we're going to try to slip into the nether again so on this end you're going to want to crouch because your controller is screwed up cover that go too high on this now we're going to go too high almost all the way around we're going to make a little elongated horseshoe pattern here now before we complete this we want a way out and i've got two where are they and this is the best time to pull out the trapdoors all right you can use any kind of wooden trap doors you want here you're going to be putting five of them like this i think these are dark oak aren't they i like these they look like chocolate they make me want a hershey bar all right and you're going to want to place those down and then make sure that they're open and now we're going to go ahead and close this part in [Music] i'm going to follow the off all right uh check axe actually it all right hold on okay wonky controller all right hold on excellent all right now i need to get back up here one more and we're gonna come right to the middle here put that up there for a minute actually we're done with the trap doors so i'll just put that up there take this bucket of lava put it right in the middle now uh the observers working with the lava are going to be what uh repeatedly lights the portal all right so that's good now i am looking at this and i am starting to think that i have in fact put this whole  thing in the wrong spot i haven't okay so yeah build it exactly as i did before but you want to put it at that elevation you count up three and then do it right there you want to leave a gap right here or else the whole damn thing's not gonna work all right uh but what we're going to do now uh is actually make our kill chamber now for this you're going to need you're going to need your pistons and get that bucket uh well my controller is even wonkier than normal right now guys you're going to want your pistons you're gonna need your observers uh get important steel out of there you're gonna need your trident and let me see here still gonna need those don't need that i need the glass block and where'd my slabs go i only need one sword for right now hopefully i won't need it at all all right so we're going to do uh we're going to start with the pistons you put you're going to be placing them in uh this exact configuration right here and then on the back of one of these pistons you're going to um this specific one right here you're going to place a lever all right now don't do anything with that yet first things first you get your observers now you're going to have them coming out like this the first one you'll have it coming straight out the front coming off that piston and you're going to turn so you want the arrows like this all right and i'm going to go ahead and get rid of this block right there for the time being so we can place this uh where am i going and actually for right now we're just going to uh take this block out all together because we are going to need access to those we're just going to do this to every one of these all the way around and this was the tricky one and if you just want to crack that and make sure yep all right that's good now we're going to be filling it back in these gaps here i was not trying to fill in that gap that's not a gap as you can see that is my controller pissing me off all right so not even all right now i gotta go find my slab it's in there isn't it it's in there yeah it's in there we're gonna come to the front of this uh because now we are building our uh is this on sandstone we're going to dig down four and then we're going to dig forward we're gonna dig out those three right there and we're gonna go forward three all right all right and then we're going to dig out these two and get out our chests where's the chest all right i'm gonna put a double chest right down here excellent now we are going to get out our hopper crouch and place that onto the top of the double chest now we're going to uh just hop up right here and while we're crouched still we're going to get out our mind track and uh let's see i don't need the lever just yet i don't know how those keeping it up on my hub okay i put it there that's how all right so while we're crouched we're going to place a rail right there place a mine cart with a hopper on top of that back up here destroy this temporary block and actually going to move it right there this way that make sure that the mine cart uh can't possibly get moved this should still be able to open excellent all right and now we're going to get out our ladders here put some stuff back on our hot bar shall we not the jack-o-lantern yeah after this video i'm going to take my controller out and shoot it all right just gonna put some ladders right here give it giving us easy access to this and you know what while i'm at it hold on a sec get we're going to kill two birds with one stone here i don't need the other sword so i have an extra trap door here so there we go all right now we're going to put a block right put that right here put one right here this is why the glass block ended up back on there i'm gonna put a glass block right here and now we're gonna go ahead and try this little number you might have to do this okay well this one just started going the first time right all by itself so excellent it's funny this has a side effect of uh opening that trap door just close that all right so we're gonna come in here remember we left this one open so we're going to take our trident ready aim fire right there bullseye that sob all right now we're gonna close this hole back up all right excellent excellent excellent excellent we're just gonna make sure now what this is doing as you can kind of see in there it is knocking that trident hall to helen back shoving it all over the place therefore effectively making a trident killer now uh i don't know what happened that stuff down there let's just go see uh that mine cart with the hopper should have uh yeah it collected it collected the slab in the stone that's sweet all right let's get back out of here close that back down you know just so you're not always like stepping around the hole now we've only got one little step left one little step left remember we loaded uh that dispenser earlier so now it's time to put that dispenser to use so i'm gonna get back out oh that hold on watch out for the dog all right crouch all right now we're going to get out our sticky piston and it's going to go right there excellent excuse me for a sec here take a step back here if i can there we go all right now on this sticky piston we're going to put a lever so let me get that one lever left okay all right and you ready for this guys lastly last but not least this observer know when this observer is placed looking straight into the cold dead eyes of that observer all the magic should start happening so let's get at it here we go the portal is going on and off there that was weird why is there water hold on ah i forgot to add a key component so you gotta have some place that catches the water so what we're gonna do is uh just gonna place a block right here and place one two blocks oh well not that one but yeah that can stay there i don't care i meant uh we're gonna place another damn block right uh here all right one more right there and one final block right there and that should stop the flooding sorry missed a step guys now this is building up so what we're going to do here is flip this switch and that should activate the brightness killer oh one other thing wow right there he's the baby zombie big woods in there and what's going on now i'm gonna back up a little bit is that trident is just mortalizing all of them and because the trident that you threw you get to collect all of that wonderful wonderful experience too well i'm collecting it i built it so we're just going to go down here look in this chest and already it's been going for like less than a minute we got a gold ingot we got 14 gold nuggets and we've got some rotten flesh you know [Music] trade it with a cleric you know she's good yep you can breed your dogs now the awesome thing about this and now what we're gonna do um we're actually not done i'm gonna put in one one last thing here that's not even what i was trying to  put in hold on let's do this real quick shall we son of a come on down get up here and this switch remember i put in that switch well this is what happens when i do that it shoves that it shoves that observer out of the way therefore actually turning off the portal or leaving it turned on sometimes the babies are harder to get don't dance around and there we go and as soon as they're all dead you can turn that off and there you go i did that mostly for memory which is awesome so i have to turn on that switch to make the portal go and that when right the upper switch is to make the portal go the lower switch is to uh activate the kill chamber and down here is your collection area and you saw it wasn't running for very long at all and you've already gotten some good stuff in there yep yes it is awesome so so that is going to do it for this episode you've got a the new and improved version of the gold farm i wanted gold i didn't want to have to kill everything but i wanted the experience and now i've got both and so does my wife so uh that'll do it so remember to like and subscribe and share and all that good stuff and until next time this is couch potato mike and this is the crafty potato reminding you as always that uh life is an experiment and your results may vary see i did the thing [Music] you", "XKEzcn1fWbg": "[Music] no god no god please [Music] bruh [Music]

family or any subscribers that I do have letting you know that I want to build up to spread the word to all social media and just get it out there to friends and other people I have about 5 subscribers right now and it's all family I know that I know that for a fact so yeah spread the word and let's get on with it okay I'm going to start [Music] [Music] little bit louder see anything just will be in right over there I'm gonna go get it first before I start exploring this desert oh dang there's so many kids but 11 would ya go back to where I came from okay so I collected some and I killed animals I collect some stone chop down some trees I got this state gun obviously you can see I'm a half hour and oh now I just need to last through the night which I can do that yep and then make a door right here my inventory grab that door just like that and then get this coal then torches place them right there there we go and I've got my steak right here put the rest of my coal in there and put in my mutton okay um okay so it's night outside we're not gonna be doing anything interesting this night so I'm just gonna skip ahead to when it's day okay I'm back I've got the cooked mutton and my coal you're my inventory from that and it is now day and I'm gonna be going out there killing that pig and then we're gotta kill that skeleton to get bone so I just get a dog a dog is very important and you don't feel like protecting yourself and you wanna good to help you out with that anyways um make some sticks now I can make stone axe and a stun pickaxe now we can go mining and chopping down trees I'm just gonna get this extra quick or pickaxe sorry then I'm gonna I get stone axe and this stone pickaxe cobblestone guys I know probably five of the people that are actually going to watch this video for the gameplay but I know that my mom a little bit showing how to play just kind of like explaining as I go it's still gonna be like just playing minecraft but I'm also gonna be doing a little bit of a tutorial so this is a pig now I always kill animals with an axe because it just feels right using a sword I don't use swords much because they don't tell mobs I think using an axe saves you more resources because you can do 2,000 and kill animals and you can chop down trees now you kill animals for food what you eat up in the top left up in the top right is your hunger and then your top left is know which our hearts number is like meat on bones your hunger will slowly run out when you're active like a run and jump like this I call that sprinting 1 sprinting is really by the night you go for over 2 times like really fast then you'd sprint you'd go really fast like this this is walking just holding if you're on mobile then going forward pressing the arrow like this but if you're using a controller then it would be pushing the thing forward now if you double-click the controller thing forward then you'd start going faster as I'm showing you but if you're on mobile again you'd double click the arrow give you a wolf and mutton so it's kind of like a win-win and you can also share sheep to where you don't kill them you don't damage them but you still get their wool you can share it off of them can't really show that just yet I'm sure I will in the future they eat grass to grow their wool back once you shared it off and now you can see my hunger bars are down now the hunger can heal you if I didn't say that already those hearts they can go down when you're damaged they say ok this is a creeper they that's not a creeper this is a drought these guys are created it away they can swim and they just killed me yeah as I was saying drones are made when zombies go underwater usually they shouldn't be able to survive on land why why can you guys walk on land I've done you enough anyways they swim underwater they're supposed to be underwater creatures but I guess not anyways it's goodnight again so I'm just gonna run around killing mobs and I'm gonna skip to one a day if I can go away from these mobs to press the pause button just to explain nighttime mobs spawn a minute mob creatures like zombies skeletons and spiders spiders aren't just like creepy bugs these spiders they're huge this is a normal zombie not a drop and idea how he's underwater if he stays underwater long enough you'll become a drowned and hitting them with swords is the most efficient and you can eat their flesh they drop rotten flesh when you tell them skeletons they'll either drop bones and with that can come a bow or arrows because they shoot at you with a bow and arrows just look you just shot me with an arrow that's a giant spider right those aren't small in the same and they do kill you that's all you should really know there's another thing that's really rare is a spider jockey a skeleton riding a spider which can kill you very easily creepers I never showed you this creepers explode like this watch if you got and then they explode now when there are water they don't do any damage to the environment around you but they do do damage when they're not in water you leave that she leave trees you can chop down for a wood wood is a very important element bones bones that you get from skeletons you can get dogs with those you can team dogs by just clicking on them with a button enough times and if a bunch of blue or a bunch of black smoke shows up around them and that means they didn't accept the bone and that they don't want to be yours so you try again and again then again with all your bones until a bunch of hearts show up and you see a red collar on them that's when the dog has been tamed by you then he's loyal to you and if you hit a mob he'll go after that mob mobs are these monsters by the way like spiders a zombies creepers and these guys which are like zombies but they don't die in the Sun and they take away your hunger they give you food poisoning which makes those little hunger bars go away really fast they turn green and they started disappearing like this might as well show ya sense up teaching you but see they turn green and they start to disappear really fast and these monuments they don't really do anything they just sit in the desert cactus you can make green dye out of sand you can make glass if you put it in a furnace you can make a blast furnace to make certain things really fast like make smell horse and I'll teach about ores maybe in the next video or in the next video I'll just get on with gameplay depends so yep those are giant mushrooms they don't really do anything I kind of forgot what they do when you micro I'm messy yep they don't do anything unless you have silk touch the silk touch pickaxe the silk touch enchantment is really rare fine but if you do find it it'll collect any block how it is like grass with the green on top of it now if you mind grass now or just garage dirt it won't have the green on top but what the self that pickaxe it well I hope you enjoyed this video I gotta get away from this spider but yeah I'll see you in the next video", "3L8Pzc8GGyU": "what is up guys chocolate bar gaming here back was another crazy gaming video today I am

welcome to another episode of good eats as always this video is being sponsored by magical butter com use my name bass drop keys to get 20% off your order magical butter calm so in this video I'm gonna show you guys how to make homemade chocolate bars I'm gonna show you how to do a dark chocolate bar a milk chocolate bar and a white chocolate bar as you can see here we have a double boiler setup no waters on the inside waters on the outside now you can set up your double boiler however you want to you have a smaller pot but a bigger bowl but you know use whatever you have I have a pie rack a Pyrex measuring cup that I'm using that's why I don't have like a dishcloth or something underneath this because this is very thick so I don't worry about this breaking so what we're gonna do is we're going to take our butter and we're going to put this in here there we go as always if you want to see the exact measurements of everything that I'm doing click the lateness in the description is going to take you over to Good Eats 420 com where I'll give you step-by-step instructions plus the exact measurements of everything that I'm doing so we're going to just let the double boiler to start to go and then we're going to melt down this butter that's what we're gonna do right now [Music] all right so we're melting this down we're gonna make sure that it's melted down fully there we go double boiler so you want that water to start boiling all right I think that's good all right so that's nice and melted now so we're going to go ahead and separate this into three different containers those be doing three different bars let's do it all right so we're going to break this up into three parts we're gonna put the four tablespoons in each one [Music] so in the recipe that I tweaked in order to come up with this recipe they actually use cocoa butter to make their bars I actually use our special butter here so I didn't really know if it was gonna work or not so after you have it divided into three equal bowls you're going to use different ratios in order to come up with a different bars for this first dark chocolate bar I'm using two tablespoons of cocoa powder two tablespoons of powdered sugar and a pinch of salt for the other two bars there's different ratios if you want to know the exact measurements of everything that I'm doing go ahead and hit the link it's going to take you over to goodies 420 com well I will give you the exact measurements of every single bar [Music] [Music] now on the third one on the white chocolate bar it actually is white chocolate but I didn't like the consistency the way it was coming together I couldn't get it to come together without any lumps so I put some cocoa powder in there in order to get it to loosen up and come together the way I wanted it to you want to actually stir this together each bowl whenever you put in your bars together you want to stir it together until there's no lumps and then you pour it inside of your mold so that's what you see me doing right now once we do that I put it inside the freezer and let it set up for an hour and then I'll show you what it looks like after we do that all right so we had this in the freezer setting up and we're gonna see what the outcome is first time doing it let's try to here's the first part that we tried the dark chocolate very nice and there's the first bar dark chocolate [Music] just try the milk chocolate one that we tried out [Music] see how this came out I'm pulling the decides away from it just to be sure as my sticking at all on these molds then once I have the sides done if I'm going underneath it and trying to attach it from the bottom very nice look at that look at that milk chocolate look at that very cool we got two layers to milk in the chocolate ooh that's nice okay and as you can see right here this is 24 squares per bar and so we'll go into the dosage after this all right so for this one right here this was supposed to be a white chocolate bar but the way that it was coming together I added some chocolate to go ahead and make it come together right so it's good to see what happens with this one this was the one that I was worried about right here good like I said this was supposed to be white chocolate but the way that it was coming together just wasn't coming together or blending I should say the right way so I'm gonna see what happens there we go so you see we did the cannabis leaves on there and there we are how to make your own chocolate bars if you're interested in everything that I put in here click the link that's in the description if you're interested in all the dose information that information will be on the website as well I hope that this video helped you out until next time guys peace and

like parts of the game yeah it's really really spooky I've just had my shoes together you know yeah that's the wrong I was talking a board game now come on I think if we keep going we're gonna find out something or we'll find a bunch more candy we Feeny let's go salty peppers Pub somebody's in here they're gonna help me I just I don't think anyone lives in there and also the door is very crooked just your size that's exactly this size wait this is a big chest of candy cotton candy to eat my dad's favorite candy a saltwater taffy brand I'll come you get to eat all I can you know I got to eat if you're 50 Kenny then I won't eat all this candy note this is online now this door it's definitely my sock Nick do you know what this is this guy is made out of candy this is big he's from the Texas State Fair you have to know who he is I don't know who fake Texas but he looks very tasty looks like he's me I'm jellybeans I mean that door maybe in that Sun well here we can go to the next world we have to go to their next herb do you think it's a lot well it makes sense oh my goodness let's go what is this place Wow look at this painting it's made out of candy too I'm starting to think everything in this place is made out of candy even this little fox and he's got well are those little candy corns hmm I love him I'm gonna take him home okay we can't go home we have no idea how to joke I don't even know how I'm getting home at this point who is this lovely lady Nick maybe you maybe you should ask her out on a date talking our girls down from the ceiling it's got kingi inside of it a key do we need a key to get home Nick I don't know but that's definitely not candy I mean is it made of candy that's definitely not candy so maybe that's gonna help us get caught of candy winds are one key so I have to close my eyes and use the key and then I'm gonna teleport all right I think we might need more than one key I have to find more keys Nick I don't know it's terrifying and really cool look at [Music] Brianna look behind you what it's another clock maybe the clock Oh Brandon look Oh the clock is mine goodness this place looks so cool we got Alex - this may be the next key is through this door if I was a key I would be hiding in here let's go hi what this place it's really cool Brianna but something's scaring out me transistor maybe she knows something maybe she's the key that doesn't work you stop trying to stick your key up those pretty trees knows you should ask the tree where the next key is you seen Pocahontas yes of course you know like the grandma lives in the tree and she knows everything so maybe if I go and like talk to her like she's my you know relative oh okay sure are you my relative she's not responding she seems kind of quiet I'm offended Jimmy and we're supposed to find the keys all by ourselves because we're super awesome at Candyland so that's pretty much the same thing I'll do it on my own but first bring out how you did the swing what did you swing then just looking for a key yeah but Briana I mean it's fun but I don't eat that much candy and I don't want to be stuck here forever okay there's got to be more keys I mean why would there just be one special key maybe if we swing long enough then a key will fall down from the sky that's not a bad idea except I don't want to swing anymore okay I'm a nurse I can help you but first I'm gonna swing a little more oh I'm kidding I'll help you Nick lollipop treasure there's so much candy and last time we found a candy you know we found next okay how many licks does it take to get to the center of the Tootsie Pop 637 I tried it once you know the answer yeah it hurts your tongue or you can just bite them and you get to the center no that's bad for your teeth Nick oh yeah hmm well if I was a clue hi this snail knows the snail knows arrey arrey do you happen to know where our key is he's not responding this it's the biggest flower I've ever seen what's its no Iban huh whoa well they smell like a key they smelled like like a unicorn wanna smell an unicorn smell it oh that's a stinky unicorn what about this one I like this one's color better let's try it that's not what a key smells like that's chocolate smell it it smells like chocolate elephant I wish that videos had smell like 4dc Nickelodeon used to have smell-o-vision smells good that the key should be in there somewhere it's a minty this has to be it we have to get out of here okay well let's try it let's try and go home tap your little fingers and toes and all the things you got to do that's not what Dorothy did I didn't see that she did this and then she flew like a bird and then she no that's not what happened but she did this with her heels and then she closed her eyes and Breanna nothing's happening I think we need more keys fine follow the sweetness oh I've seen this room it's like we're in the ocean Breanna and guess what the ocean has candy candy lots of candy I always wanted to be the little mermaid when I was little and basically like this is it oh he's really mean looking he's got a creepy eye but he's made out of jellybeans Charlie told Brianna we can't eat the candy but he smells so good I know sir he's so tall and look there's full of fish behind him it's kind of like he's underwater I love it this is a baby shark in real life it's mama shark whoa Bri what's behind us oh my gosh do you know the way shark like it smells really good I didn't know what shark would feel so good well if it's made out of candy of course you know we had to stop messing around okay wait Brianna look there's candy here in it there's candy sticks these are full of energy and they're like vitamins they're full of vitamins C and D Z P it's a seahorse oh another one behind you Briana the seahorse is wall I actually hit him I'm sorry I apologize Nick did you know unicorns were under the sea well yeah Briana and that unicorn has a skull marine why don't we have a submarine wait how are we breathing underwater I don't know not getting very concerned okay Briana if I was a key I would be hidden in the scariest possible place so what's the scariest thing we've seen in the ocean room scariest possible place the Steve no breathing off I was thinking more like baby shark dude dude it's green like seaweed third time's the charm I mean this has to be ready we're going home I'm just I'm closing my eyes and that's it this time we're gonna that's we're done nothing's happening we're still here so there must be even more keys but honestly I'm starting to think I don't want to leave cuz this place is awesome so we can just sustain ourselves on candy that's fine I'm pretty sure you don't allow do you candy every single day of your life my dentist doesn't need to know wait Briana are you sure we should be around I mean these are candy sharks but don't they still eat people it is getting a little late at night like what if they comes in white sir for the museum did you go to the next room really fast does it starting to get really scary let's go Wow beautiful candy room I have ever seen this is like a candy museum Brianna and look all the paintings are made of kid this one is emojis so it obviously knows where the keys are right well I mean that one's laughing at you that one seems like you might be kind of a nice guy and then not God doesn't like the guy above him Briana this is really confusing for me I don't like candy are so the key must be up here right I don't see a key up there wait for ya maybe it's by that giant cat I'm in 20 buddy this I'm really afraid of snakes I'm really scared of snakes true did you see I got Preston the snake you were there right I was there but Briana you know what's funny there's not really any candy here that we can eat I know who would know he looks like you've been thinking about where the key is for a long time what's his name I think his name is thinking man okay call Henry I really want to eat your jelly beans but all I'm gonna say is where's the key because he definitely knows he's pondering what if Henry was actually white like us he was trapped in there but then eventually you just kinda came yeah what if you become kids not us if we don't get out of here we're gonna turn into jelly bean for you know we have to find this fourth key because the flora is the magic number obviously and hopefully that means that we're gonna get out of here after four keys because this guy definitely only found three of them Lisa here she just turned into jelly beans and this guy is just terrified that's what I'm gonna look like that's a jelly bean Oh oh wow that is pretty accurate Breanna what are you doing we're supposed to be looking for the king it can't be so bad bikini I also could just be the queen of chameleon look at this I'm on a throne look I love candy but not as much as I love pizza and Preston styles calm and minecraft so I think we need to find that key I banana can we just build a throne at the office yes so fine [Music] there's a pinion or two to banner this room is probably the coolest I remember Bennett look there's a part on the floor where you can spin trolley I love gummy worms I don't even need the key anymore this is too fun I'm just gonna wait here I can eat gummy worms I can spin around hey vana what's this light switch right here what do you think this does maybe this gives us the key I think it was a bunch of confetti no Briana we have to look for the last key come on get off the spinner okay whoa Briana Briana are you dizzy no no I'm not Briana why is there a little hole on the pigs we have to stop messing around the key has to be here somewhere [Laughter] okay well four keys that must mean we could get out of here so there's gotta be like an exit somewhere do you hear that it's by the majestical unicorn Wow Briana this is a pretty unicorn it's so pretty and funny so we have to walk that way I don't know we can fit there but there is lots of arrows so I think that might be the way to go it's pointing our way home Nick that's the saying goodbye leave you're gonna go home arrows okay well let's try it are you ready Briana you go first and tell me if it's safe [Music] [Music] [Music] I don't want anymore [Music]", "O-AOZwgq-3U": "so what is it guys dream see now in today's video I'm gonna be showing you now I don't know I guess I

whatever we're gonna build our pizza so just gonna build like a little it's gonna get ourselves some wood because of course we need to you know be like you know most people just have a wooden house so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna build like a little house like this I'll build a little house on fat that's that's the house one we're talking about okay I'm a bit of wool first let's build a wall like this and then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna build something like this there we go and then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get some stairs can I get some stairs oh no okay let me get this oh gosh let me get that and then I'm gonna give these my fact you know what guys I don't even know I'm doing in fact okay let's just build pretty much a kitchen counter guys okay there we go then our counters gonna be made out of wood as well that we go and then of course you know if you want you can add some things like iron like this you can add iron like that you can add maybe a barn in it for fridge of stuff like that because you guys did say to make me a working kitchen I should make you guys a working kitchen bar I'm not gonna do that today's two pieces tutorial so we're gonna be using it for the actual pizza guys we can use a bunch of different things but in today's tutorial I'll show you guys are two things you can use so when I go into an armored stance but when I use when I get ourselves some redstone where's the redstone there we go and I'm gonna get myself a I think he call it a hat it's not hat it's a it's a you know it's not hi son almost almost piece of armor guys I'm really really really bad doing this oh yeah where's where's where's it where's where is it we could use that but you know I'm gonna use a I'm gonna use a pumpkin guts because the pumpkin I think pumpkin works better anyways so there we go let's get us all some pumpkin and then I'll gosh guys oh gosh okay there we go come on get those pumpkin there we go that's just just not used just not use too much as you guys do know to the new version of Minecraft so wherever you want your pizza to be let's say for example all my pizzas to be right next to the fridge what you want to do is you want to kind of just you know I guess you could say and knock out this area here then what you want to do is you want to get yourself some us know like this there we go no I don't make sure you're not put down I think it's around the we layers of snow and then you wanna slap down the armas down like that and then you want to slap a pumpkin on this head right like that brilliant brilliant stuff then you want to slap another Alma stand down like to the side of it and then you want to put another pumpkin on this head if you can do that if I you got to do it above because like I'll show you guys why cuz cuz it's not easy to place it again so first almost and pumpkin unaired second almost and cut it to the sort of diagonal like this like looking at the point they dare I don't want to put the pumpkin on the head and then we're gonna hear it hear it and then it's gonna drop down like that as you guys can see then we're gonna do is we're gonna place our stairs above this so we need to do is we need to get ourselves oh gosh we need to need to go behind like this and then we need to crouch and then place the stairs above so we need to place the stairs behind like this is you guys can see I probably could have just went behind and done advise you guys and see I don't know it's pretty hard to do but you just need to place the stairs upside down just like I've done like that then once you've done that guys all we need to do is need to get yourself what do you need we need ourselves a piston guys a piston there we go not sticky piston guys a regular road one of the mill push it and piston out I don't know if that's what you call it up pushing piston and then you want to put I think you put a block of redstone there and then I block a register next to it and then destroy that one just draw that one and as you guys can see we've got a pizza guys but this isn't the final final thing yet guys cuz what you can do if you want if you want your pizzas to be a bit more like abs who want to see a pizza to be a bit more better because of course you know this is a nice pizza but it isn't the best so we're gonna go up here we're gonna go get our pressure plates there we go and you can place a pressure plate down guys cuz if you want it to be like food there you go guys you can have a pressure plate which is exactly like food now this is only one design there's another design which I will show you guys so I'm just gonna destroy this to show any AMA stands and I'm gonna place a normal honest stand back down so all we need to do is this gonna be it's gonna be a little more lengthy but you know I think it's worth it so we're gonna get ourselves a crafting table like this then all we're gonna do is gonna place that place that bad boy down then we need to get us of a lever I learned to Nick I don't think they call it leather tunic what do they do they could I let the tunic no they don't oh no that's that's the that's the the chest is for the cool leather tunic so once you go I love the tunic they're in to get ourselves some I think it's orange so gonna be pretty much using ourselves I died I think you could have died not died like I like it actually passed away but I think we just need to duck why can I use the crafting table okay there we go so put one in there there we go and then we'll put another in there there we go and what what I I thought you could die okay hold on guys hold on a minute guys I think maybe what I should do is because I know you can die another way guys I know you can use a cauldron to diet but I'm not sure exactly out so let's actually see if that works guys hold on a minute guys because because I told you guys I'm not the best minecraft so let's see a cauldron um cauldron there we go there we go and then you pull I don't know what you put in it I think you put warn and then you put dinah and you put the leather in end and it comes out I don't know guys let's just see if this works you put the war in it then go into my inventory I don't know if it's gonna work I really don't know it's gonna work if it works amazing if it doesn't work oh my gosh okay and there you guys see we've got orange water which is kind of nice kind of cool kind of weird and then let's see if the leather cap works guys this doesn't work I'll be so embarrassed okay there we go guys you guys can see we got our leather cap our orange of the cap and that's how you die guys that's how you die so leather cap died now of course what we need to do is place his leather cap on his head on his head on the animal stands head Jesus guys I'm just I'm all over the place today all over the place so we need to do now is I'm gonna you know do the same thing we did before so get the stairs but place it back this time so I want to do that we got a place like this oh gosh jumping jumping jacks and then we need to place a piston above so what I'm gonna do is I'm actually gonna place a block above then I'm gonna place the piston above like of that oh gosh like that so you wanna place a redstone block above like that and minarets don't block next to it and then it pushes it down and then hey presto we pretty much are done here and fill in the wall and then get yourself a where is it where is where is the words irrigates off a pressure plate it goes of course your piece of wood it's coming to plate now you can either do guys you can even do a pressure plate like this so you can have one like a very slim pizza if you want a pizza to be more thick you need to do is you need to just add more layers of snow and after we do that we can also do as well is I see people do this all the time and if I get myself a trapdoor we can do use you know a bunch of designs you can have you can place a trapdoor like that and then have it open you know for it to be looking kind of like a sort of pizza box thing I don't know guys I never really liked the design but some people did so some people used it but yeah I don't know it's like a kind of cool little thing I don't I guess you can open it and then and then your pizzas there and then your pieces not there anymore I don't know guys so you guys let me know what you guys think about that but I think I think is really cool I think is really awesome but at the same time I don't know I just didn't like the design of that much but yeah I think it's episode was really successful suggest what you want me to do in next week's episode guys it's been absolutely amazing spring juicy and yeah guys let me know if you guys want me to start shipping out so much to some amazing subscribers because I do I love you know giveaways but gifts and stuff but I want you guys to be you know if you guys do want money much money much is absolutely incredible guys it's just like that designer did a great job I mean I think if you guys you know watch this ball you're probably probably a little subscribers and let me know if you guys a do one that much shipped out it should be an update link in the description now guys cuz I've had so many issues but hopefully we've got a we've got we've got everything good to go guys so it's been do some see you guys enjoy the video don't forget the daily mark off videos check out the channel and until next time I'll see you guys in my next video it's going to be peace [Music] [Music]", "1FWppxzdGa4": "after collecting all our ingredients and making my chocolate and all my feelings and I have everything to do the final assembly of my chocolate bars so I'm here with Danny Stein a chocolatier who's going to help me out and hopefully this all work out he took a little bit of how you got into chocolate making I actually started as a savory cook and was told that I should maybe think about other career paths and because I'm too stubborn to do that I decided to just go into pastry instead and through my program at the French pastry school really learned that chocolate was my passion and I hear you even have a tattoo of a cacao pod I do I do yep my arm so you're a bit of a fan then just a little all right so my plan is to try and recreate several popular candy bars like Reese's Peanut Butter Cup not rageous butterfingers the doable we can do it all right so shoots are the Reese's first sounds great okay so what's first step so the first step is to temper the chocolates so that we can make the shell and we need to temper it again yes because we'll actually have to liquefy it so that we can make the shells once we've done that we've taken out all the stage five crystals and we'll need to reform them so if we didn't temper it again it would have a bad texture if they'd be super soft after several 10 second bursts in the microwave attempted to temper the chocolate the way Peter had taught me unfortunately my skills haven't gotten any better and I was failing to properly temper it so I let Denny take over the chocolate all set now we started first with the peanut butter cups we'll just fill it most of the way like I'm playing in the mud all day your hands are surprisingly clean like everything it's practice the peanut butter cup filling Jenny recommended adding some like cocoa butter to help the filling set more solid thank you so we just type them in and you want to leave about an eighth of an inch on the top good and then we'll just let these set right in a peanut butter will harden your adequate very good well the peanut butter filling set we moved on to preparing the nut rageous filling will just actually mix the peanuts and the caramel and then we'll form them by hand into logs big gooey mess not look delicious take a little bit in your hand the interesting texture kind of feels like a really messy sneeze so they're not holding their shape well enough to dip ideally we would not put it in any kind of freezer cooler but sometimes you can get away with it what's the reason for not doing that so any moisture that gets into the chocolate will create sugar bloom which destroys the texture of the chocolate and creates like a grainy texture on the top so we want to avoid doing that if we can okay know what I think our best bet is to pop them in the freezer and see what happens okay I'm not going to touch anything okay well in outrageous feeling Joe next we've prepared the chocolate molds for the Butterfinger bars so we'll just take ladle full of the chocolate pour it in to each of the cavities and scrape them up just try and push the chocolate so that the cavities are completely filled okay so now go ahead and whack it on the counter a couple of times tapping the bolts helps remove any air bubbles go ahead and tap it that's great and that's it is how you make them old cool well the chocolate molds for the Butterfinger setting retrieve the now more solid not rageous fillings from the freezer so in order to put them what we'll do is take a little bit of chocolate on two fingers put it on the palm of your hand uh-huh we'll just smear it right on what is this doing so what this is doing is making sure that we have a nice base when they do this in the factories they probably use a thinned chocolate to make sure that you get in between all the little peanuts because if there's air holes the caramel will leak out and it also dramatically reduces the shelf life what we'll do is we'll balance the chocolate on the tines of the fork so take it bottom up drop it into the chocolate and you'll flip it make sure the entire top gets covered and then you want to pull it out again tap it to try and drag as much excess chocolate as you can off of it willing to be able to see the shapes left but peanuts if at all possible we can't do it too long because then you'll stick to the fork it's part of the problem with having our filling be semi-frozen oh all right and then one other option that we can do since we're you know here at home is to just go a go again and do another round on your hands yeah we can get a slightly thinner shell since our chocolate is so thick at this point it's really important to make sure that there's no caramel or peanuts actually poking out of the chocolate oh those are basically bleeped Oh correct next we'll fill molds for the butter fingers wax paper you and then I'll trade you you can do that with this one think they got hard yeah gotta move quickly it's okay they're like more like Buckeyes this way and uh we'll just let them set after having to travel 5,000 miles to the southern tip Mexico putting in 35 hours of labor finally have my finished candy bars when I add up everything together the total cost comes in at just over $1,700 in the end it seemed like they all turned out a lot better than I expected actually you want to do the honors and try sure I'll start with a dark chocolate sounds good just like a Hershey's bar all right hmm that's very different it is very different it's it's got that smoky flavor mm-hmm roasting over the fire yep it definitely has a really strong smoky flavor which is unusual in chocolate it's got a good temper overall I'd say pretty good all right try the peanut butter cup next time all right that's a rhesus I like races I mind so it's a little tricky to peel partially because the shells are a little thin and partially because maybe our temper wasn't the greatest when we did this one hmm that's pretty good really good flavor yeah I think similarly the chocolate a lot better character to it mm-hmm fulfilling might be a bit bland compared to the rhesus could use a little bit of salt but the flavor is really good little runny and definitely not a sweet since we didn't have any of the powdered sugar to add to it yeah but overall Oh oh sweet yeah they're very different ha ha ha I kind of like mine more I think I'm just gonna keep eating my Reese's that we might have my judgment next we have the Regis so what I like about best about the one that we made is that the caramel is a really nice dark caramel and it's got a really great flavor it does have a little bit of challenges it's a little bit crystallized the texture is not quite right but it's really good I did enjoy it more than the Reese's one yeah so what you're not pretty good I like mine a little bit better too yeah and lastly we have the butterfingers like that let's probably my favorite of all these store-bought ones try mine it's very different because it doesn't have that distinct crunch so like texture makes it very different yeah I do kind of miss the crunch that the regular Butterfinger has but again flavor-wise especially with the homemade peanut butter really nice I think it just could have used higher percentage of caramel to make it a little more crunchy so overall they do a good job or not overall you did a great job yeah yep especially flavor-wise which ones are best um I enjoyed your not rageous the best okay I thought your chocolate was quite nice mm-hmm I really liked the flavor in the races I'm afraid the Butterfinger lost oh but it was still very good well this has been a really eye-opening experience I really appreciate all the help you've been able to get me I don't think it would be able to do without you thank you don't miss new episodes on how to make everything

Juventus - a very short one before the Germans of three releases illegitimate just three releases in three days so in honor of that because I most likely won't plainly Juventus too much afterwards I have a little bit of a bucket-list series right now the first episode of this will be the challenge to top they like that like the top 20 or something in the server maybe even lower maybe talk for a little 50 because I am quite low right now but I want to see how well I did in the end and I would also like to see what rank I am and everything and yeah just just fight a lot of people this is going to be a PvP heavy episode so if you enjoy it like and I guess I guess we'll just get started because I want to I want to I want to I want to fight people and that's what we're going to do today so we're going to figure out top 50 earth of 30 you will see in the title maybe how much I did and yeah ever enjoy have let's have a nice time I was about to make an outro that's not a good thing in on intro so before we start I obviously wants to look at all my stats all my rankings and everything so my main made it to 979 point 1 million battle rating augment 20 she made it or evolution 20 right through she made it to artifact quality yeah wait am I am I am evolved obviously then my Pamela is evolution 18 2.48 five billion baths rating quite high stats quite high gear we've all seen it before then we have release 240 million then we have our Tina 219 million bath rating and then we have 268 million base rating door evolution 9 organist 20 augments 20 I was so happy back then when it was one I finally made augments 28 was was a very good time to see how it worked to see like what would happen with the visuals after Eggman's 20 so we have had a lot of fun times in this game and it's time to to decide Lee unfortunately decrease the content of it to about zero after the join these three releases so it's time for us to actually start doing some stuff now this is kind of the end of the game that started my youtube channel that got my youtube channel there it is today so let's stir so fully you guys are excited full age range is 3 it's going to be better let's let's hope okay so I think I'm going to fight stop 50 you know what no top 60 not going to fight everyone and at the top 60 and remoter but we're going to try to kill top 16 first beard let's view stuff then we'll fight him 2.5 billion but writing is main okay 1.1 billion his monitor okay so technically I should win this is Lee if I lose it I'll be very obsessed with myself so frost beard and I love course mention all the names of the people that that's that's good that maybe I stuff the game that I played with for a very long time I've I think that would be nice as well at the top 60 here maybe even the top hundred again Mike look at it so we have our source right as well and the return of this visual so we should win right now it shouldn't be a problem my palm nasty high agility she just killed Moira the Moira is dead for the she's on her last lifeline he so Lee will hit she hasn't died quite yet my Dora died for the first time my Dora died for the second time she won't turn into a card because my palm was the only card in my list ID for the first time she will do her Reggie although she will not make my Pamela Pamela rage get one more time she will however make my main rage kill the enemies should be very close to dying right now I don't know what skill they will have in the next hole arm also ever using a dragon Proust beard also have yawned a lot in my videos right here Syria so it's all day it's dead for the first time finally she's their main focus absolute zero welcome Alice and Athena my Pamela is getting hurt but my main is actually hurting this oldie quite a lot the Pamela is very dodgy and I'm very happy about the dodge here that I'm not getting frozen however I do have a debuff from this all day like the one do sting HP or something I I don't I don't remember it even but yeah I do I do have a skill here slowly it's immune to data that's at moment now she is not she is on the last lifeline as well I still have two lives left if my intrepid triggers so technically I should be quite safe right now to win so we'll see though they saw they died and the Dora died which means we won so that's quite awesome that's that's quite amazing yes we beat Frost beard I like I like the name I genuinely like first beard named Orion storm Orion storm is quite an old-school player the well not too old-school in comparison to most people but I remember we install room for a long time ago Orion storm has always been a minor catcher but not too much anymore 1.5 billion by 13 pan Lolita a 10 star artefact played I wouldn't think that that's ten star yeah razor has definitely gotten his priorities focused or her my bad as we'll see I think I thing was a family home my account 1802 3i I could probably get a name change in here but I won't ask them because I don't care enough about the game to like ask them hi can you change my name it's it's not worth it it's not necessary even so we're not going to do that so yeah people are definitely dying quite nicely here we're making some good progress this well okay the reason this person's team is dying quicker is because they're more Pamela focused which means the rest of their team is weak that's kind of why this for me as well what team dies rather quickly except for my main because I was a main focus a little bit which I regrets but yeah 170 million hit she tanked at Pamela's on her last lifeline right now but is that Pamela's Opie my daughter will respond and she will give me a little fridge and I'm taking a lot of damage I'm taking a very big amount of damage at the moment she's in me that I'm not immune to that I don't think but I'd left me I have a shield that should help me tank a lot so I'm happy about that I think I'm going to be no okay my blade of ruin somehow killed that Pamela yeah that's the benefit of having a little bit for throwing - is that minion rear solar sail this game has had a lot of events thousands tens of thousands of them total probably over the years it has been going so that's not too bad so we did beat Orion storm let's head over to 58 Lana Lana is retinue Lana has a quite a balanced team very balanced with a divine shield even she doesn't have a North artifacts thing she must be free to play like anyone like anyone who pays at the moment has artifact Roddick so Lana must be must be afraid to play account most likely most likely Lana must be free to play or was a cashier before Dorothy vector Alex but most likely a free to play player Lana died for the first time okay well this is easy I didn't I didn't think it would be this easy but it seems to be this easy so that's that's not like it's for for Lana that is but that happens that happens well this is dying array is indeed dead this is going to respawn it doesn't matter what happens land I won't be able to kill a single person in my team I should win very easily Ilana I'm sorry that you that you must that you dot that I'm sorry I'm sorry let's fight 57 I guess let's see here yeah Asterix he's been there from the beginning I even typed to him a little bit the other day like 2/3 to say go nothing game but outside of game he's an awesome player 600 million main he's an awesome player but he does not fully know how to how to build but that's fine that that's totally fine if you are watching this Asterix just ask me for help or look at my guides and they will help ear towards a one hero build the asterixis been there from like the big he's been there for a damn long time as a bender from the beginning I think he is one who's been there pretty much from the beginning I think he is a one of the most old-school flavor service I I am I'm not even the most old-school player like SF he is older than I am in the game I made my accounts one week on day eight of the game or something so I am one day one week late or so maybe even more so I'm late I'm like maybe I was even ten I don't think I was ten days I think it was eight days before the game launched or after the game launched I didn't do any closed beta or anything though so my Pamela is dodging a lot asterisks his Pamela won't really do much to me I don't think most of his team will do much to me to me to my pal not the rest of my team obviously he will hurt because he's more balanced than I am that's why does my why my team dies because they were there every week they're there damn wee wee week so it's it's not looking very good at the moment the panelists said she will be a culture and then Dora will not respond we won against us race also I have not seen any big major racial issues at the moment so I'm pretty happy about that there is a big difference between this and let's fight matric zero zero zero one mentally Afghan I've not fought this person before so this should be interesting how is this team while his team is me winning basically I should beat this guy if he if he kills me then I'll be very surprised then I'll be like okay maybe no no don't if he if he kills me with his right I'll be damned surprised oh man I'm yawning too much but yeah some some videos I've been way too much this gives a nostalgia factor that's the only reason why I'm doing it so my plan was fine obviously because Moira is weak my Athena will be able to rage get giving my Pamela damage 20% out of her full attack so I'm actually very happy very stoked and happy about that I'm dodging a lot so the ray will need to kill my family somehow the Ray is a dodgy one it's a it's a Dodge ray for sure my Pamela will rage kill even more he died for the first time he should interrupt it and respond with off ruin my main did die she will have a respawn and Rachel my pal my panels are edge killed and then Ray's on his last lifeline and matrix is on his last lifeline as well purgatory will trigger my list world right kill my Pamela will rage kill the Ray will die for the final time that's what I thought like he wouldn't he wouldn't be close I don't yeah that's what I said man that's what I said HP doe 44 million for the 44 million my HP is quite quite decent for my team but not much against enemies with the same power hitter as I have okay now that we've fought stats it's time to fight the boss the boss from play hard they have a 300 Oh 50 million is like Pamela this Pamela making my Pamela it's a hit Pamela it's not a dodgy one higher agility okay well the boss he may kill me the boss has a stronger Pamela but I have dodge but he has it so I think he should win but but we'll see regardless we'll see if he beats me or not I hope that I beat him but the full cards full cards I don't have full cards he is playing house of cards I am NOT ok that's Pamela still dodged me and I did not sure luckily I tanked it 120 million it I want a much HP left or 31 million like almost what my entire team s like my door Alice and Athena that shouldn't should be this should be very difficult let's do that let's rage killer and hits the Pamela thank goodness I managed to kill her first okay this is this may prove nicely for me yes she's not focusing on my own Pamela thank you goodness man okay this is we may have hope we may have some hope that there is a chance there is a way show me the way show me the way let her focus on my Dora sure I'm fine with that please don't touch anything thank you my Pamela did get broken through shield and just won it so she will die one shot to this Pamela when she does a rage good I think hopefully that won't happen hopefully I will be able to kill her before that happens I just need to intrepid and then I should be fine no absorb that's not good that's not good at all okay please let me win now please let me win yes I'm into that show she so oh it didn't trigger yes I beat the boss I can't believe I've done this I kill them I killed someone better stronger Pamela yes 50 billion attack higher HP higher everything even hi Roger no I'm not liability but yeah just killed someone touch thank goodness and thank goodness for orangey orangey kind of play the hands their tank you reckon I can kill him I don't know if I can kill tank to be honest I don't think and maybe 1 billion I should be able to with the with us it looks right now I should be able to I haven't I haven't fought him and yeah since I lost recorded it which is a long time ago Matt months year almost maybe or something so yeah it's gonna be fun it may be a year I don't know it's as well as as I fought em so it's old it does have a higher agility she also dodges I crapped on tank however did die for finally I don't think he has artifact gear so technically we should be fine I think he stopped he stopped playing fully like he doesn't he doesn't play he quit he fully acquitted in half quit like some players did he full liquid so yeah let's see here I don't know why maybe maybe we will say manager registry I don't know yeah we'll see we'll see my frickin source record needs to rate scale right now so we'll see here yes okay now I'm going to get the hit I require I think so that's going to be nice it's all they will rage kill I will dodge a lot which is nice at least I know you have a lot of HP to tank it as well I like what I did when I fought them before I had all this all these stats you know you know you know so I should I should kill them all so yeah I'm glad I didn't read kill the runway states because I would have rage killed when she wasn't the real revival mode so I'm happy about that I paid gear was introduced at I think when he played I don't know maybe I don't think I don't even think pet care was introduced so I don't know sir but we should be able to win this one right I see now I don't know why I wanted to do an accent error but I want to Tim I'm a recurring G if you have if you haven't noticed because I'm kind of crunching at myself at the moment the panelists at the door said so yeah I do beat Hank I think we can pretty much confirm that I kill him right now I don't think he like okay no so I beat tank but to be fair he yeah he can quit a long time ago but I do tank for everyone wondering I should I do kill him yes now it's time for us to fight chalice no chalice is way too high case and perhaps let's see no I should not kill case on what about my TCS hmm my TCS is the last personal fight and then I'll tell you guys about all the people who I don't know I don't know what I was going for that well we'll we'll see we'll see it's it's no problem is no rush we we find we find out here sure I was also if you want to remember looking in the camera I was looking at the cable for my microphone so that's the thing right there so this should be an interesting one my TCS should kill me according to battle rating but we'll see I kill this YCJA it says Lulu I'm scared after it says Lulu that will most likely recommend sane my pan my main tanks a hits though luckily so that's nice early didn't get all the red she deserved or wanted writer the issue will rage kill I will I will be fine the issue isn't too powerful where I am like yeah I do have a deeper for the moments also that freakin levy autos that levy autos is going to be the kill of going to be a lot of men Livia those yeah the Beatles why oh yeah I was thinking about Vernon Guardium the vo so I was like it is leviosa Lovato's it sounded kinda kind of kind of the same also I'm so happy that I'm dodging delivery right there maybe there's hope for me maybe I somehow can kill my TCU's most likely not I'm I'm not I'm not optimistic about this I'm very little optimistic bone downs and I'm not going to win I'm not going to be close to winning he's going to wreck me yeah he is going to just rake me I'm pretty certain of it yes the biosis is going to ruin my day I'm dodging a lot though so that's nice but yeah his Lovato's is going to wreck me actually not well they were still hope but don't count on me winning if I had to if I was a casino or a better yeah but I wouldn't bet on myself so MIT C's is stronger than I am so let's see here war horse has been with us for a long time same rigorous new Adrian is quite old lotto is damn old I think he played when I first played I think Nuri is rather old house is not too old Magic Mike is quite old blue siren is not too old to be honest can see me as old Joseph is old master 71 is all cracker belly I think he he he started before I did so he is like ancient Raistlin is very old

even a final showcase of my account my own account so yeah have a nice day and goodbye", "-_hVuzFRcSU": "now it's time for the ultimate treat my chocolate-covered caramel bars think candy bar and we're gonna really master some great techniques making a cookie base a caramel layer and in robing the entire bars in milk chocolate I'll start with the cookie base I've got half a cup of room temperature unsalted butter so now that I've softened this up I can add 1/2 a cup of sugar and I'll just stir this to blend now that that's blended I can add a single egg yolk a cup and a quarter of all-purpose flour and a pinch of salt go I'm stirring this to blend it but it's not going to come together like a cookie dough it's actually going to be a crumbly mixture the more crumbly texture means it's actually going to cut more cleanly in addition to being crumbly it's an even buttery color and that's your sign that your mixture is ready to put into your pan which I've already lined with parchment paper I spread it out making sure you press it right in two corners of your pan because you don't want that caramel seeping over the sides of the cookie base and now this is ready for the oven it takes about 15 minutes at 350 now what's unusual about this particular recipe is that you don't have to let the base cool like the Nanaimo bars before you put on the next layer I actually want to make the caramel while the base is baking and pour it on while both the base and the caramel are hot the reason I put hot caramel on top of the hot crust is because the two will fuse together making it easier to slice without losing the caramel topping so I start things off not by adding sugar but actually water 1/3 of a cup goes in the bottom of the pot I'll add 3/4 of a cup of granulated sugar at this point on top of the water now I don't add cream to this recipe but I do add sweetened condensed milk I need 1/3 of a cup now the final ingredient and I'm not going to add it yes in terms of sugar is a third of a cup of corn syrup before you start cooking caramel you want to have all your ingredients on hand because once it starts you can't walk away so I've got my corn syrup that I'm going to add once it starts boiling then I'll be adding butter later on at the very end vanilla and salt and at this point I'm going to turn the mixer on high heat and this is a caramel you actually stir and you stir constantly but I have an instant-read thermometer so at every step of the way I can keep tabs because there are specific temperatures you want to hit to get that perfect texture and that satiny feel when you bite into the caramel now that it started boiling I can add the corn syrup I'll return that to a boil and then I'll actually reduce the heat a little bit part of the reason for reducing the heat is to control the cooking so I can really watch that time but also to prevent scorching that condensed milk wants to caramelize very quickly all right now that I've crossed 110 I can add my butter 1/4 cup of unsalted butter and I added it once I keep now the heat the same and now we keep cooking it to 115 Celsius and my color tone is immediately starting to change mmm and just lean over the pot it's starting to smell like caramel now I'll remove it from the heat to stop the cooking I'll add half a teaspoon of salt and vanilla so that gets stirred right at the very end and now it's time to pull out that cookie crust from the oven [Music] beautiful or this on top god I love that I'll give this a swirl just to get the caramel into the corners this needs time to cool inset once this is cooled I can cut it into those little bars and then we get to play with melted chocolate [Music] you [Music] for the ultimate bar what could be better than a shortbread base topped with caramel and then the whole thing completely covered in milk chocolate well that's exactly what I'm doing here and it's time to dip these bars in chocolate but I have to cut them into thin bars first so here they are after the caramel has set that three hours [Music] look at that beautiful shine [Music] ready a clean parchment lined baking tray and then arrange the bars the only remaining ingredient left in this recipe is a pound of chocolate tempering is the process of heating cooling and then gently reheating chocolate so that it sets at room temperature and this will keep the caramel inside the bars gooey but still set without that process you have to refrigerate your chocolate when you first melt your chocolate you want to get it nice and warm 45 to 48 degrees Celsius that ensures all the crystals the cocoa solids the cocoa butter all fluid and flowing within the chocolate then we get to play with it to cool it down and warm it up a little bit there we go I'm in that zone of 45 to 48 degrees so now it's time to play with the chocolate when you're tempering chocolate marble is ideal because it stays cool but there are also other surfaces that stay cool a granite countertop or stainless steel and if you don't have a marble table well a marble cheese board will also do now what I'm going to do is pour out 2/3 of this chocolate right onto the marble and then this chocolate that's remaining I'm gonna keep on the tea towel and I have to get right to work and you keep this chocolate moving as I'm working it I can feel it actually thickening and you may have picked up on the difference there we go now that I'm under 27 I know I'm fine this is that final step to warm it up to between 30 and 31 degrees so maybe I became a pastry chef so I could play with my food is really this is what it is playing there we go so I'm in the range I need to be I've got bars ready to dip I'm gonna drop a caramel shortbread bar in give it a nice even coat now that I've dipped my bars I let them set up until the chocolate has solidified then the last but important step popping him in the fridge but only for three to five minutes and here we are after you've taken them out of the fridge you can store them at room temperature and remember they'll hold their shape and shine beautifully these are absolutely spectacular and well worth the effort", "yJDG9F7kEjM": "hi i'm kristy sullivan and today on diet doctor explorers we're going to look at what's the best kind of chocolate to buy well it depends on if you're cooking or eating with it if you're just looking for a little bit of a snack you're probably better off sticking to a chocolate bar that's higher in cacao like a dark chocolate in this range i've got one that's 72 percent dark up to 100 unsweetened and the carbs range too in this case it's 11 grams of carbs per ounce or 30 grams of chocolate and this is 2 grams of carbs per ounce or 28 grams within this range of course the carbs are going to be higher with the lower values the higher percent of cocoa that you get the lower the carbs are likely to be there are some exceptions to that and you have to pay attention to serving size even within the same brand this 86 cacao gives you lists of serving as 45 grams or 10 grams of carbohydrates per serving for 45 grams now it looks like that's a lot more carbs until you realize that the same brand at 30 grams or one ounce is only five grams of carbs when you compare them this is slightly higher but make sure you're comparing the same serving size pay attention to the ingredients and that's where we can get in trouble with some of the sugar-free bars so you're going to see things labeled keto or you're gonna see that this says sugar-free sweetened with stevia and we know that stevia is an approved sweetener from diet doctor or we've got this one that also says stevia sweetened and no sugar added but when you start to look at the ingredients and start to configure the net carbs you'll find that even though this says it's only two net carbs per serving it has inulin and dextrin now inulin and dextra may be safe for some people but if you have diabetes type 1 or type 2 it may impact your blood glucose so if you're doing this for medical reasons or to control metabolic issue make sure you test your blood glucose before and after using this one has maltitol in it maltitol is a really inexpensive sweetener it's used by a lot of food manufacturers not only does it cause gastric distress it also is notorious for raising blood sugar so it's a sugar alcohol that's really not safe to deduct that's one that we would definitely not eat in my family and then this one has tapioca fiber again when you look at the neck carbs it looks pretty good but adding the tapioca fiber is what actually lowers the carbs and gives you the lower neck carb and again if you have diabetes you want to test your blood glucose as with any of these you want to test before and after eating now this one was interesting because it's 100 cacao no sugar added and when i start looking at the ingredients it has cacao shredded coconut and cocoa butter there's no sugar and there's no added sweetener and so it's actually pretty interesting that it's only three grams of carbs for an ounce or 28 grams of chocolate so that actually may be an exception to my don't buy anything that says it's keto or sugar-free last you've got to pay attention to serving size it's not three grams of net carbs for this entire bar in fact it's that serving size for four pieces or an ounce so if i open up the chocolate these four pieces are a serving so this would be my three net carbs per serving so you can nibble on that a bit of a time that would actually be a lot of chocolate for me or another safe thing to do is to buy it already packaged in bites so this is 92 dark and the package says that it gives you three squares or five carbs five net carbs and so these little squares of chocolate are already portioned for you so you can have a little bit more portion control with these things and probably one to nibble on because it's such a dark chocolate would be plenty and you're going to get about let's say two carbs two net carbs and something like that the same thing is true for this one it's 88 dark chocolate but it's going to be roughly five carbs for two pieces of that as well if you're cooking with chocolate you might want to stick with the 100 unsweetened chocolate because then you can add your own sweetener to it as much or as little as you like if you have questions check out the sweetener guide on diet doctor to see what sweeteners work best and which ones to avoid and you also might want to spend some time with the chocolate recipe collection that i put together because now you know exactly which chocolates to use", "A-OZK2I4CtQ": "What is the best candy bar ever? I'm Maggie from Columbus, Ohio.\nLet's talk about that. \u266a (theme music) \u266a - Good Mythical Morning.\n- Today's episode is brought to you by the RhettandLinKommunity, \nhome of the Mythical Beasts. Upload your fan photos, videos, or other\ncreations including some like these. (Link) Of course, if you uploaded\nthose, it would be plagiarism. - Don't re-upload somebody else's. \n- You know, we're on a mission today, Link. We're on a mission to find what \nthe best candy bar ever is. This is my mission face. We decided-- \nwe think on a weekly basis-- - Can they see these candy bars?\n- No, those are out of the frame. Oh, we have a bunch of candy bars just out\nof the frame. I thought you could see 'em. - (whispers) Don't show 'em to 'em yet.\n- They're all right here. - You didn't know that.\n- We've got this idea. We think we're gonna do this maybe on a weekly basis. \nWe'll see how it goes. Hopefully you will latch on to this concept. We want to \ndetermine the best ever of stuff. We thought candy bars would be a good \nthing to start with. We're gonna go through some candy bars that are \ndown here. We're gonna talk about 'em. - We're gonna present them to you. \n- But we want you to make the decision, because we're gonna just go through and act\nas if we have never seen candy bars before. As if we're cavemen who are just being \n(gruffly) introduced to candy bars for first time ever. (normally) And we're \ngonna just-- we know nothing. We have no point of reference. We're just going to\nkind of lead you through these candy bars. I'm pretty sure that sounded \nlike Cookie Monster. - (laughs)\n- You're like the Candy Bar Monster now? Yeah, maybe. You vote in the comments. \nYou just say whatever your favorite candy bar ever is. We're gonna tabulate these \nthings, then next week we're gonna reveal what's the best candy bar ever according \nto you, the people who watch Good Mythical Morning. If we don't have a candy\nbar in here that's your favorite candy bar, just add it to the comments. We only have \naccess to pretty much American candy bars - because we're in America. \n- Including Kit Kat. Let's start here. - So, are we gonna eat these?\n- We're gonna be like cavemen. We're not gonna talk like cavemen, but \nwe know nothing about candy bars. - (gruffly) Mmm. Me like eat Kit Kat.\n- You sound like-- (laughs) You sound like the Cookie Monster too! (normally) Well, I want to \nsound like Cookie Monster. - Oh, okay.\n- All right, so these are shareable. - (grunts) Oh.\n- As you can see, even as it came out - it was already wanting to be shared. \n- (gruffly) Broken! Of course, that doesn't mean you have to. (normally) Well, let me bite the \nother end. I wanna taste each one. - I'm just joshing with ya, Rhett. \n- Okay, um... there's a wafer inside and milk chocolate on the outside. \nKit Kats are very melty, I noticed that. - As a caveman would notice.\n- Very tasty. One of my favorites. - This is vying for my vote.\n- Good bar. So we're gonna eat all of these, \nbut not all of every single one? Yeah, we're just gonna taste 'em. \nAh, Milky Way. I mean-- sorry. - 3 Musketeers. \n- Read the label. Yeah, I can read. (gruffly) I can't read! \nWhat is this? What is these letters? - (gruffly) That \"3.\" That \"musketeer.\" \n- (normally) It says, \"Whipped up fluffy chocolate on chocolate taste.\" \nUsually they tell you what it is... - \"Chocolate on chocolate taste.\"\n- I think that this is just a - nougat-filled bar. I think that...\n- It's chocolate-flavored nougat. - But don't ask me what nougat is.\n- It sounds like an insult. Like something you would call your younger\nbrother. (silly voice) Hey nougat! Haha! - (normally) Here we go. I'm gonna taste it.\n- (silly voice) Hey little piece of nougat! - Come over here and gimme some OJ!\n- (silly) What're you lookin' at, nougat? (normally) It's a simple bar. 3 Musketeers\nis simple. I've heard that they're different - in other countries. \n- Oh yeah? But in America, it's just nougat \ninside of a chocolate bar. If you're in other countries, let us \nknow what it is. Crunch bar, here we go. - I'm gonna move on to the next two.\n- Gotta keep things rolling. Like Rhett said, just because we're eating\nthese doesn't mean you have to vote for one of these. Put anything you want in the\ncomments. We'll tabulate these and we'll let - you know in the next Best Ever episode.\n- Or make a video response with your reasoning for why you think something \nis the best candy bar ever. Even better. \"Cru\" -- that's all \nI've got of the Crunch bar. - Nestle Crunch. \n- I like a bar that says what it does when you eat it. That gets points from me. Another pretty simple bar, it has Rice \nKrispies -- or known as \"crisped rice,\" according to Nestle, \nsurrounded by milk chocolate. I don't know if that's out \nof focus, but... whatever. It's like little pieces of crisp \nrice encased inside of chocolate. - It's a little too simple for me.\n- Okay, now we've got the coconut bars, Link. Both from Peter Pan-- and \nthat's a company not a legend. - Almond Joy and Mounds. \n- Now, I do not like coconut... - Okay, well...\n- so give me the one that doesn't - have coconut.\n- They both have coconut. - Well, I like almonds.\n- One has almonds. You can just eat the almonds right off the top. So basically \nthe difference between... Now, first of all, I didn't realize this until right \nnow. Mounds is dark chocolate and Almond Joy is milk chocolate with almonds. I'm even gonna eat some of the coconut. \nI'm doing this for you people. That's how far I'm willing to go. I'm willing to \ngo so far as to eat coconut. Wow, how daring. Let's \nkeep this thing moving. I don't like it. - PayDay.\n- Right now Kit Kat has my vote. They are definitely getting worse as \nwe go. PayDay is a peanut caramel bar. That's how you pronounce \n\"caramel,\" people. And this Mr. Goodbar, which-- I like a\nbar that exudes positivity. Again, it's getting points just out of sheer \npositivity. It's very simple. Peanuts... It's like a Hershey Bar \nwith peanuts in it. Oh my goodness, talk about \nlog of peanuts... that's heinous. All a PayDay bar is is a log of caramel \nthat somebody rolled in peanuts. It looks like something that my grandma \nwould make. And I'm sure it would be - great, but it doesn't--\n- (silly voice) Hey, I made you something. I made you something. It's real special. \nIt's caramel and then I put peanuts on it. - (silly voice) I rolled it. I rolled--\n- I call it PayDay. Don't ask me why. - I rolled a caramel log in peanuts.\n- (normally) Is that how your grandma talks? (high pitched) No, she talks more \nlike this, and she says, \"Woo-oo!\" (normally) Nana always says, \"woo-oo!\" \nif you call her and she's in another room. - Like a rapper?\n- Woo-oo! She's always done that. Woo-oo! Hey, I gotta tell ya, after having my mouth\npolluted by chocolate after chocolate, - The salty...\n- This is good! PayDay is good. It's refreshing when you're \neating twenty candy bars. - Your grandma knows what she's doing!\n- Yeah. Mass produce that, Grandma! Nana! - Baby Ruth.\n- Baby Ruth. I'm growing a little concerned about-- \nnot only the sound of this, people are gonna be complaining, (high voice) \"Oh, \nthe wrapper sounds are really getting on my nerves! My dad came in the room \nwhen all the wrapper sounds were happening and he was like, (deep voice) \n'What are you watchin'?'\" - (laughs)\n- (normally) We get a lot of comments on - Good Mythical Morning...\n- What happens when your parents walk in? (silly voice) \"My parent walked in \nright when you said 'naked!' ... awkward.\" Well, sorry. Okay, while you're opening up\nthe Baby Ruth, I'm gonna tell you we have a Reese's Fast Break bar. We don't have a\nReese's cup because Reese's cup's not a bar, it's cups. Any caveman\ncould tell you that. I just dropped half a Baby \nRuth in my crotch area. - (laughs)\n- And your dad just walked in and heard - me say that.\n- Don't mistake it for a turd, which could happen easily. I hope \nyour parents didn't hear that. - Now listen. \n- So you can't vote for a cup, but you can vote for the Reese's \nbar, the Fast Break. But it doesn't count as the cup, it's \njust this is the Reese's bar, you know? Now, this should be good. This has got \npeanut butter, some kind of cookie... (gruffly) Cookie! -- (normally) and\nthen it's covered in chocolate. Why don't you feed it to me? \nJust kidding, I'll take it from you. - That was a bad idea. Edit that out. \n- It's not cookie; it's milk chocolate... - Mm, yeah there's no cookie here.\n- peanut butter and (gruffly) nougat! I'm pretty much determining that my vote \nis gonna have to go with something, now, - with nougat. \n- We really gotta move now. We're gonna - go over our twelve-minute barrier. \n- No, we're not gonna do that. We're also talking about \nSkor and whatchamacallit? Heath Bar. No, Whatchamacallit \nis an actual bar, you really... - Oh.\n- And we don't have it. - I confused the issue.\n- Okay, this is the problem - with toffee bars.\n- Ugh. When you open them they \nare always broken, look. Oh my gosh. That is so \nbad, I have to spit it out. You're such a wimp. You can't eat toffee, \nyou can't eat coconut... you probably couldn't eat hornet larvae either. Look at this: every time you open a toffee\nbar, it's broken. It's like an old person's - femur. Look at that thing. It just-- \n- You can vote for Hershey's, the purest chocolate bar ever, unless you \nwanna vote for, like, the Milka bar. - I like toffee.\n- I'm not even gonna eat this one because... - (repeats) I like toffee. \n- And, of course, the classic Snickers. - Why did we decide to eat all these?\n- Nougat... because we're stupid. - We're doing it for you.\n- If a caveman came across these, he would be, (gruffly) ah, I've gotta \nget these back to the cave. I don't know - what it is, but...\n- Butterfinger. (normally) Butterfinger is an unusual \nbar that has orange-ish brittle stuff in it. You could vote for Twix. Now, peanut butter\nTwix also exists; we don't have those. These are caramel Twix. Here \nyou go, eat some of that. - Butterfinger's peanut butter flavored. \n- Yeah, I don't even like it, though. I'm hatin' on a bunch of these bars. \nAnd last but not least, Milky Way. I found a video of an old commercial on \nYouTube. I never thought that Milky Way - made me think of sailing...\n- (narrator) Sit back, think about sailing... mmm, I really count on Milky Way. \u266a A Milky Way a day helps \nyou work,rest, and play \u266a - But maybe it'll-- (coughs and laughs)\n- You okay? I'm gettin' choked up. Maybe \nit'll make you think of sailing. Okay, what do you think is the best candy \nbar ever? I'd say out of all these... First of all, you should never sit down \nand eat--like a caveman-- eat multiple bars all together because it really throws\nyou off. You will also agree that, if you do this, that PayDay is the best \ncandy bar ever and that can't be true! - Yeah, it can't be true.\n- It can't be true. There's no way that PayDay is the best bar ever, even though \nit's great if you've eaten twenty other - chocolate bars. \n- Let's close down this episode. Vote in the comments: What's your favorite\ncandy bar ever? We'll tell you what you decided next week. The wheel doesn't like to go clockwise, \nI'm sorry. I listen to the wheel. It says, - \"Spin me counterclockwise.\"\n- (Rhett) Oh my goodness. - Soap Opera: Rhett slap Link.\n- Are you sure that doesn't say, \"Link slap Rhett?\" If you wanna slap me, you can. I'm not the\none who is afraid of coconut and toffee. I'll take a slap to the face, I don't \ncare. But we gotta have some sort of-- No, no, no. It says \"Rhett slap Link,\" \nokay, I'll do it. Just go for it. So it's - like a soap opera? It's a dramatic scene?\n- Yeah, let's just say that, like... (silly voice) My sister is in the \nhospital and you're her boyfriend - and I can't believe...\n- Hold on, why are you getting mad at me - 'cause I'm about to slap you.\n- (normally) I'm invoking you and I'm taking off my glasses 'cause I \ndon't want you to break 'em. (silly voice) I can't believe that you \nwould sell the company business while she's in the hospital! You should be \nin there! You're such a turd. You're like - a nougat. \n- Call me a nougat again and I will - slap you in the face.\n- Nougat. Thanks for watching. It's \nuphill from here, people.

we're from neuro growth CA nice and we are so excited to be here today to talk about chocolate making and be sure to click that bell below the video so you get notified about all our new content so we want to get this on the go right away Andrea take us away alright so our very first ingredient that we're gonna add to our double boiler is cacao butter so I'm gonna put this in and Jeff is going to explain some of the benefits of this yeah so notice how she did say cacao butter not cocoa butter this is something we would have to do a whole video on but when you use cocoa it is highly processed you're gonna lose out on a lot of the benefits that we're gonna be talking about in this video so be sure to do your best to use raw cacao butter and paste and we're gonna have links below the video for you to get all that so we've got the butter in there which is the fat from the cacao now what's this next one here all right so we've got 95 grams of cacao butter in the double boiler the next ingredient to go in is 95 grams of cacao paste so we're gonna put that in and maybe we should explain what a double boiler is so a double boiler method is a way of preparing chocolate that doesn't burn it so what we do is we take a pot and we fill it about a third of the way full of water we bring the water to a boil with a Pyrex Bowl on top something that's heat resistant and isn't going to crack under under the high temperature then once we put all of our ingredients in here they're separated from the element on the stove and that's what really prevents them from burning yeah you don't want it to burn and even furthermore if you want to take it to the next level you could use a thermometer to measure the water and to measure the chocolate to make sure you're right around or below a hundred and fifteen degrees Fahrenheit that's the magic number and if you start to go any higher a lot of the enzymes do what's called denaturing they start to deform and you're gonna lose some of the amazing benefits that raw chocolate has to offer and of course like she said the waters in the pot there's no water in the bowl so you're not getting any sort of contamination and this is all starting to mix together and melt quite nicely and why that why that's happening or sorry as that's happening let's talk about micro dosing for a second why would anyone want to microdose magic mushrooms now for me personally I've struggled lots in the past with depression with anxiety and of course you know I fixed a lot of that or worked with a lot of that via food meditation yoga but somedays especially in today's society even when I'm checking off all those boxes I've eaten right exercise sometimes it's just not quite enough I need a little bit more of that mood elevation that a psilocybin brings to the table and of course I'm not interested in tripping out or hallucinating and that's what makes micro dosing so amazing for me and do you micro know Sandra yeah I do my kurtosis I like to follow a regimen that's a four day on three day off schedule I feel like that's what gives me my optimal focus and just helps keep me I don't know like just content and happy and free from free from stress and it really turns off like you said the monkey mind that goes on in the back your head and just allows you to live in the moment and be who you are without the little voice you know behind on the on your shoulder and telling you to think you know telling you all these things all the bad yeah it's you know it's tricky I know that little voice in the head you know it can be so annoying tells you things you don't want to hear but you really want to learn to work with that voice and work with yourself and personally I have found that you know the prescribed SSRIs the prescription antidepressants turn that off it's insane to me it's you know after four weeks of being on them you know I had this experience where there was like no voice in my head and like we were saying I wish I could have an on/off switch for it but I never wanted to be gone and I find using a psilocybin doesn't really turn it off but it definitely changes the tone of that voice it's a lot more encouraging it's not like this you know nagging person who's telling you you're never gonna get it done you're never gonna do it so it's so important and it's something that you know is worth trying for sure so how are we doing with the chocolate here looking pretty good we're almost we're almost melted it's probably going to need a couple more minutes you know one of the things I was going to say about SSRI drugs also is that they often leave you feeling like you said just disconnected you know whereas micro dosing it's the exact opposite when you micro dose you tend to feel more connected to the people and the world around you which is a huge asset and a major reason to consider my producing I love how you said that and I've heard so many people explain it in a very similar way where they've been on these prescription drugs for a long time and they feel like they've lost a part of themselves and you know on the contrary when they microdose with mushrooms they feel like they're connecting to something so much deeper so that's such an amazing point and I also love how you said earlier how you do four on three off I'm more of a fan of the five on two off but no matter what you resonate with more it is extremely important to take time off every single week you want to keep your tolerance to a psilocybin low so that you're not having to constantly take more and take more and I know a few people who never take days off this becomes more of a crutch and then they get very depleted of their neurotransmitters so like anything it can be abused and when you take those days off it just keeps you in check keeps you responsible and now what an amazing thing amazing thing too but the days off as many people find that their best productivity and their best focus and best mood is on their off days and as the brain heals itself with these potentiating herbs and mushrooms that's that's exactly what's supposed to happen you're supposed to feel better long term and that includes your off dates yeah and I think it's such a confidence builder when you feel good on the off days it starts to make you realize oh I don't need to take these all the time this is actually healing something inside of me it's not just a drug I'm taking to mask something now another thing I love to take to help me with my mood and just you know overall feel good is of course chocolate so you can see how this becomes such an amazing synergy now one of the reasons I think you know raw chocolate raw cacao is so powerful it is it is in fact the highest source of magnesium in a whole food and magnesium is the mineral that most people are deficient in I can't remember the exact numbers but it's insane like over 70% of Americans are magnesium deficient so what does that mean you know why should you care about magnesium well it is an extremely long laundry list magnesium is used for hundreds of functions in the body in fact each and every one of your I think it's three trillion cells needs magnesium every single day it's needed for muscles I'm sure you all know someone with the restless leg syndrome and that can be a sign of magnesium deficiency so chocolate is such an important superfood and Andrea how do you use chocolate I like to have a little bit of chocolate every day I mean who doesn't usually mid-afternoon when the kids are getting home from school that's what I like to you know break a couple squares off and just enjoy it it's kind of I don't know helps me mellow out and set the tone for the rest of the afternoon kind of a little pick-me-up I love it and this is why I love making chocolate because if you buy it at the store it's not the chocolate that's bad for you it's usually all the other stuff in it the white processed sugars etc so when you can stay away from that and use other sweeteners then you know you're really gonna have a medicinal experience and not something that's just taxing the body and something it needs to get rid of and speaking of sweeteners what are we using to sweeten our shop yeah so we're using maple syrup to sweeten our chocolate you could also use honey if you preferred we've the reason we opted for a liquid sweetener is because it's just it's nice and smooth as opposed to a as opposed to a granule of sugar like say coconut sugar or you know any other kind cane sugar or something like this so when we add maple sugar it just blends in so seamlessly and we don't really have to worry about mixing it a whole lot so once your chocolate is totally melted then you can go right ahead and add the sweetener nice if you are using a granular sweetener I would definitely recommend it as opposed to just stirring it with the spatula yeah I'm a huge fan of the liquid sweeteners as well it just it blends right into the chocolate now I do like having some crunch in my chocolate but if you rely on the sugar for that then I find you know some pieces have a lot other pieces don't have much and it's just not a smooth experience and now speaking of crunch what do we got here up next yeah so our preferred way to add crunch to your chocolate is by adding cacao nibs which is more chocolate okay you can't really lose out so what Kanekalon abs are as they are just cacao beans that have been ground up and just into little small chunks now what we do is we grind them up even further in a high-speed blender just to make them into a bit of a powder and this retains the crunch still but it's nice and evenly distributed throughout the bars rather than having a big chunk like this I mean you could do this if you wanted it's all a matter of personal preference but this is this is what we prefer yeah Ike I said we're big fans of that smooth experience everything blended very well but definitely experiment at home and what's nice about having the cacao nibs just in the house is it's a way to eat some cacao with zero sweetener now it is quite bitter and in fact when you eat that this is when it will make sense to you that cacao is indeed a medicinal superfood it is not I mean I love the taste even the bitter nibs especially like I find it really grow on you at first you're like no not what I was expecting but you'll find yourself craving it and I think this all ties back into the magnesium is your body says hey give me some more of that stuff and just going back to some of the benefits of cacao this is an amazing vasodilator which means it opens that heart right up opens up the veins and the arteries it softens them so you can have increased blood flow which is excellent for exercise recovery and so many other functions and you know just so many is that literally the list is so long of what that can do for you but if you have blood pressure issues heart disease which is so prevalent in society today then cacao is definitely something you're gonna want to look into all right so let's give this a stir in it was getting in there now this isn't gonna emulsify completely like like the other ingredients that we've added there's going to be little chunks you're going to notice that there's little little grains of cacao nibs inside of your inside of your pot inside of your bowl yeah and that's perfectly fine it's those little granules that are gonna give you that nice nice crunch and so now I guess we've got one more ingredient here that's you know kind of part of the basic recipe and it's a such an important one what is it all right so this is right skipping a step here so this is salt so we like to add in an eighth of a teaspoon of salt salt is pretty much a critical ingredient in chocolate it helps to round out the flavor profile and so a little bit goes a long way just an eighth of an eighth of a teaspoon and your your goal good to go and don't worry how the measurements will have it all in the video description below but you know if we've have any chefs watching as you know that contrast in flavor is so important so we've got some bitter from the cacao we've got sweet from the maple syrup and now there's a little bit of salt it just gives it such a nice little twist and it really brings out some of the other flavors I'm speaking of measurements we added a quarter of a cup of the cacao nibs lips to our ice nice let's put her in got a little bit of salt in there so that's the basics for chocolate like if you were just gonna make chocolate for friends and family you didn't want to use any sort of medicinal herbs that was an amazing recipe to use as your baseline and then you can kind of like a set experiment with the different sweeteners more crunch less crunch you can have it more of a white chocolate if you use more of the butter there's literally endless endless possibilities atoms atoms are actually endless fruit you can use high-quality essential oils I mean literally the list is endless vanilla although insanely expensive these days is like vanilla and chocolate is just a match made in heaven and if your flavoring with things like vanilla and maybe extracts always make sure that they're oil-based because if you add water-based or alcohol-based extracts to your chocolate it's going to cause your chocolate to seize and you'll ruin your batch that would be so sad yeah it literally ruins the whole thing you're gonna want to stay away from that so now let's get into some of the medicinal things we're adding to this chocolate so we are actually going to make the neuro Grove snack chocolate bar so just like you're used to getting in our neural growth caps it's gonna be the same experience but via a chocolate bar so the first ingredient we have here is one teaspoon I believe one teaspoon of mucuna so mucuna which we'll let Andrea tout here this is amazing for dopamine it's got l-dopa in it which is a precursor it's just a fancy way of saying it gives your body the ingredients it needs to make dopamine which is one of the most important neurotransmitters in our brains it's all part of the reward system that our brain uses to make us feel good to make us feel like we've achieved something so so so important and another cool thing about dopamine is it can be a little bit energizing it can be muscle building it's even a precursor to HGH which is human growth hormone so so amazing and it's even got adaptogenic properties to help you out with all the stress we face in life today and then the next one we got one of our personal favorites is the lion's mane mushroom now once again we've got one teaspoon in there you can use more you can make it more medicinal you know you can add it in there stir it up like she's doing and then taste it if you say you know it's not very much for me I could use more than by all means make it more medicinal it's just gonna give you some more superpowers powers like you know better memory increased focus you know that's what lion's mane is all about and it's not even all about upgrading the brain but it has some amazing components that repair the brain and rejuvenate the brain all naturally so such an amazing amazing medicinal mushroom you know there's we don't have very many good studies yet but things like Alzheimer's disease especially in the prevention side of things you know huge hugely important and we've even seen some people with Alzheimer's they use the lion's mane with the oscilloscope in that we're gonna talk about here and they're getting some amazing results so it's definitely something you're gonna want to look into and just kind of stick up-to-date because there's so much research coming out right now it's it's tough to keep up with to be honest well the studies are rolling out like crazy the John Hopkins University and also the University of Toronto and P real college London all have psychedelic research centers now our human studies are going on so you're getting double-blind randomized placebo-controlled controlled trials all these high quality studies that people look for when they're trying to determine whether or not something is real science or anecdotal evidence and so these studies are coming out and you can just you can be you can see that maybe you like rolling out by the day cuz it's crazy you know we were really studying these things in the 50s and 60s but when a psilocybin became illegal we won't we turned it off we walked the other way so now that the doors are opening again we are just finding out some amazing amazing staff so now I'm gonna get into our final ingredient here the star of the show and this is our a psilocybin now we're not gonna mix this into the whole pot here and we'll show you what we mean because we've made enough chocolate here to probably make about six different bars and this amount of a psilocybin one gram is just for one bar I'm not a fan of making a huge batch because you want it to be as accurate as possible this is of course for micro dosing it's not for partying so you want it to be as precise as can be and of course some of the benefits of a psilocybin are increased in flow state it really turns off that default mode network in the brain which is a fancy way of saying you know when you look outside you're gonna see things that you know you've never seen before even though you've seen them a thousand times you're gonna see the same trees the same flowers but you're gonna go wow that looks so beautiful and you're gonna feel happiness and it just becomes such an amazing experience so I think we're ready to go here yeah so part of controlling the dose of the bar is measuring and so we know that in these particular trays that we can fit in a quarter of cup of our liquid chocolate that's what we'll do is we'll just measure out you might need a help guide help guide it in there or spoon maybe even to whatever you have on hand looks pretty delicious I'm definitely waiting hungry so then what we do is we put that into a small bowl and then we can whisk in our psilocybin yes so once again for one bar we're going with one gram of our golden teacher a psilocybin and one note I'd like to make two you know we're talking about the studies and and one of the biggest things when it comes to studying any sort of medicine drug herb is safety you know is this safe to take and one thing I always like to tell people is you know there are some psychological you know dangers I don't really think there is with micro dosing but with macro do you started with macro dosing you can definitely run into some issues like the bad trip and and so on but when the micro dosing scenario it's extremely safe and in fact there is no lethal dose of a psilocybin I would say almost everything in your medicine cabinet at home is more dangerous than a psilocybin mushrooms you know if you take too much Tylenol like you can actually die even taking a little bit of Tylenol although needed sometimes can have you know a toxic side effect so with the psilocybin this is an extremely safe herb or an extremely safe mushroom I should say so don't be scared about all the stuff they were saying in the 70s and 80s toward people away really do your own research and come to your own conclusions on if it's something you should try or not all right so we're just gonna pour this carefully into the mould as you can see it flows really really easily and we want to make sure that we scrape out this container so that we get all of the medicinal properties that we've invested in adding with these ingredients into our bar one cool thing about chocolate I never said either is that they're realizing it is one of the most complex foods on the planet there's actually several compounds in the chocolate and they have no idea what they are and I always just think wow that's you know we think we're so advanced but there's still so much that we don't know okay so once we have this poured into our mold we can pop it into the freezer just like just like so and how long is that gonna take before we can munch down I'd say for sure ten minutes but I'd give it 15 just just to be on the safe side you want it to be nice and crispy mm-hmm so we have some that we made ahead of time that we can show you so let's show you guys and yeah what's super cool about this mold is it's got ten individual squares that can be broken up so as you remember we used one gram of the oscilloscope on and it's evenly mixed into the one bar and that would make each little cube point one or a hundred milligrams which in my opinion is the perfect microdose and of course if you wanted to do more you could eat more and you would have an actual you know if you could measure it it's not just random and again that's why we like to mix the oscilloscope in right into the individual bar you want it to be as accurate as possible yeah and it's really really easy to do it doesn't take much time but it's a really important step because you are using this as medicine and you want to make sure that you're getting the right dose every time yeah I mean you just want to be respectful with it right you don't have to be crazy you don't have to be super super scientific but you do want to take it seriously it's not wishy-washy this is very very potent medicine and although safe it is you know it's extremely effective and you want to use it properly but anyways you know this was so much fun I love to make chocolate I love to taste chocolate Oh should we try some absolutely okay let's see how we did Cheers Oh Cheers mmm nice mm-hmm texture is good there's a little bit of crunch there it's creamy mm-hmm you know very soft just melts in the mouth very good and like we said you can take this in so many different directions with flavoring in fact I would love to hear from you like what is your favorite chocolate and maybe if you even if you've never made chocolate you know what do you find self reaching for it the store does it have fruit flavors is its citrusy is it minty not nuts as a very common one because we could do all that you can all be incorporated very easily but anyways let us know below what's your favorite chocolate and have you ever tried micro dosing using chocolate ok thanks for watching guys this was such a fun video to put together be sure to like subscribe to our channel share with your friends and if this is the first video you've seen if you're like what chocolate micro dosing what's going on be sure to check out our complete beginners guide to micro dosing down below in the links our email is also below in the description to the video if you have any questions about growing making anything send us an email we'll do our best to help you thanks guys [Music] you", "RrlfhYMk7ck": "[Music] now I spend a lot of time and thought on my videos and one thing's for sure is you guys love chocolate now about a quarter of a million views on my last chocolate video I've refined the ingredients and the method in which we temper the chocolate I'm also providing you with some better ingredients and the easier way to do it so without further ado let me show you version 2.0 of my chocolate recipe let's do this so chocolate is three ingredients so it's really important that we pick high quality ingredients in my last video I use slur as a sweetener since then I've been using a Lilo's and the finer the a Lilo's the better if you can find a confectioner powder perfect second is a cocoa powder and pure natural miracles makes a really good one you want something that's very fine and organic because there could be a lot of nasty stuff so I found this one works really well and so here's a really good kokoa butter links for all three of these in the description below and more information later on the video now tempering chocolate is all about accuracy and the most accurate way to cook is sous-vide we can get an exact temperature with a sous-vide bath so that's what we're gonna use today we're actually gonna put our chocolate mixture and we're gonna melt it down very precisely in a sous-vide bath now we're gonna heat our sous-vide bag up to 115 degrees Fahrenheit now we're going to use 1 and 1/4 cup of our pure nature miracles kokoa powder and we're going to toss that right into the ziplock bag and so yes sous-vide we are cooking in a plastic bag and you want to find a heavy-duty bag that won't rip very important more on that later and check this cocoa butter out it's really interesting they make makeup with it they make chapstick lotion it tastes awesome of course it's missing that cocoa powder taste and any sweetness but it's rock-hard it's already tempered and this is what we want to get out of our chop now I usually chop this up with a knife but recently I saw someone using a cheese grater to break this up and how that was genius we're gonna grate ourselves a cup and a half that also is gonna go right in the bag double-check that there's no big chunks of anything in here we want a nice fine powder inside the ziplock bag now we're onto our last ingredient here and this is the al ulos sweetener like I said I use swear before by recently switched to a yellows which i think is has a very close taste to sugar in fact the chemical structure of the agya lowest molecule is very similar to sugar way closer than a riff that's all or sucralose or anything like that I'm using about 1/2 out 1/4 cup of al ulos right here now the key to sous-vide is getting a high-quality plastic bag you only want to use name brand name in the game pretty much we want to get all the air out so this sinks down now as you can see I'm starting to massage the bag the butter inside is melting and it's mixing with the AL u lohse and then as I'm massaging this and making sure everything's melted I see in the sous-vide that the water bath is starting to turn brown [Music] because I bought low-quality bags I literally just said use high quality bags so off to the store hook these bags shout out to ziplock get the freezer bags they tend to be a little bit thicker get the one with a double zipper alright and just like that we are back same measurements same ingredients I had to throw the last batch away if you get just one drop of water in your chocolate mixture it won't temper it will stay soft so if you try this recipe out with the sous-vide method and you can't get your chocolate to stay hard and it keeps melting in your hands it's probably because you've got a little bit of water in there so redo the recipe be very careful that there's no holes in your bag and then no water gets in now we're gonna keep it in a 46 degrees Celsius or 115 degrees Fahrenheit we are going to ensure that it stays in there for at least 5 minutes okay so once five minutes is up we have to cool the bat to 81 degrees Fahrenheit and 27 degrees Celsius the best way to do that is to add a little bit of ice in there or cold water take hot water out and just pretty much make sure that you don't let it drop below that that's really important because that's when a crystalline structure inside the chocolate starts to form aka tempering and then you're gonna want to bring it back up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit or 32 degrees Celsius you're gonna get yourself a nice clean mold to make these in I like using a silicone tray I think it's the easiest way to make your own chocolate bars now I couldn't have made this recipe any easier for you guys because the container in which we tempered our chocolate is also going to act as our piping bag and we're gonna use that to pipe right into our chocolate mold [Music] now I only have one chocolate bar bowl and I realized that I had a bunch of tempered chocolate left over so that gave me the idea to try a recipe that I want to do for a while which is a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup so I figured I would include that in the video for you guys as well and you want to do two layers you want to do your base layer which is because it's going to be a very thin layer at the bottom of the cup and that's gonna be where the peanut butter sits on top of and then we're gonna come back again and cover the top but first we need to let that temper inside the fridge same thing with the chocolate bars into the fridge to temper down now it's time to get a good thick chunky peanut butter and we're gonna put one scoop right in the middle and make sure that it doesn't touch any of the sides and then working quickly we're gonna cover that up with chocolate and then back into the fridge to temper once again and at this point I'm sure you cannot wait to see how these turned out and honestly I'm pretty proud of myself it's been almost a year since my last chocolate video and I must say this recipe has improved a lot and I hope you guys try this now version one of these Reese's peanut butter cups I have to say worked really well this might be the final version now if you guys make this recipe I want to see pictures of it so go ahead and hit me up on Instagram and if you have a question don't hesitate to ask I respond to everybody thank you guys so much for watching as always keep Paquito stay healthy peace [Music]", "z0KndzOOv-0": "yeah ah chocolate as a society it's one of our favorite things to shove down our gobs to make ourselves feel better plus it can also help you recuperate faster from Dementor attacks there we are I'm sure that's a real thing anyway the problem with chocolate is for some reason shops are getting more into the novelty bandwagon which is another way of saying that they're sticking [ __ ] in chocolate which really shouldn't be mixed in with it and I've got three of the more bizarre varieties for us here today and we begin with one which I believe is American because it says on the back it was imported from America I actually got this from a Tesco in Newcastle I believe it is Tabasco chocolate if you're not familiar with Tabasco it's kind of a little cat with six legs that talks to you when you sleep no wait it's a hot sauce Michela Neko Avery Island Tabasco brand spa chocolate mmm yeah it's a hot sauce quite a good hot sauce hence why we've all heard of it on the downside yeah it shouldn't really be in chocolate should it I'm not sure what to think of this also it's been sitting in my bag for ages it's got dirt on the back of the sticker oh great so now it's both unpleasant and unhygenic marvellous anyway let's eat some chocolate can make that sound more exciting good knife hey everyone in sessions that crazy guy what's he doing today he's gonna eat some chocolate Wow amazing right it's looking quite dark as child doesn't quite knocked about but that's because it's been in my bag I've just remembered I didn't get this some new cast a toy gun from Edinburgh there we are that was today's City mix-ups doo-doo-doo-doo regular feature um yeah put the smell off smells of dark chocolates there's a bloody surprise right how spicy is our then not getting anything yep just can't trace a dark chocolate hmm I think this may be less of a novelty thing and more of an actual thing oh wait getting a bit of heat yeah just some spiciness afterwards it's kind of like that chili chocolate you get except spicier yeah as more heat to it yeah that's perfectly all right actually in fact I'd say it's quite good you will not read large amounts of it because it would get quite spicy I feel them yeah definitely Oh sort of back of the throat heat thing going on but yeah it's alright it worked in it yeah well done well done Tabasco you have done us a solid which I believe is a good thing and is not referring to [ __ ] anyway next up the world's biggest frickin slab of the limited edition Cadbury Dairy Milk the Vegemite I [ __ ] you not comrades and I really understand this one Vegemite is that kind of Australian Marmite stuff that they are apparently obsessed with as a culture and stick it in or on everything and indeed for some reason is now gots a massive massive 200 gram bar of Cadbury's chocolate I'm assuming it comes from Australia in fact yes I've just put on the back it says please call Cadbury consumer advisory service Australia free cool marvelous well it's that very nice foil wrapping you can peel and reseal it marvellous I'm going to assume that this actually goes together quite well because you know you're gonna have a sort of salted caramel thing going on maybe because Vegemite is quite salty as it goes um actually quite like Vegemite and with a few people in the world who likes both Vegemite and worm I got is sticky oh wow there it really is a chocolate bar with some Vegemite on the inside well here goes nothing bye nothing I mean a cube of chocolate and some gooey um what it like so choppity yep that works then a hint of them Oh Vegemite Oh God ah oh there doesn't go together at all ah God nope my spell go down Oh oh yeah god bloody hell that nauseating Oh wasn't expect do you know is expecting the Tabasco to be worse oh dear Charlie I'm back in position I made the fatal error of leaving the thing to spit things onto slightly out of arms reach there oh dear that is absolutely disgusting oh dear it's salted bloody caramel Oh Mike salted bubbles are there that was bloody awful whoever came up with that idea to be horsewhipped for laddie yeah yeah and once again yeah great my mouth no taste so disgusting I don't know if I can actually try the next one without rinsing out at first in fact yes I'm gonna have to jump Cup I have returned for some t800 petit or limited edition milk chocolate bar with cheese and onion crisps thanks title is this sir tato is my gay Irish brand isn't it mmm yeah County Meath that sounds pretty Irish keep Island beautiful so the potato men can take over it was so strange character there tato mr. potato mr. tato jeremy tato arden up the hell his name is it doesn't look anything like a potato the starters he looks like a bit of corn that's been found in some [ __ ] with a hat on anyway yeah cheese and onion crisps in milk chocolate why that is not something that is really sorry I was just completely thrown that I just spotted on the back best before 29th of January 2014 I'm sure these were in date when they were sent to me my god have had these knocking around that long I don't expect we got two of them but two of them were the same date my god they're from the same batch number I'm sure these were sent in separately as well that is really bizarre anyway um I mean I like cheese onion crisps and I like milk chocolate I looking forward to them together right what's Oh God so I got foot and mouth disease or something right and I'm one cube of this company's bags up bloody Vegemite mark right here goes umm-hmm this weird doesn't kind of tell you anything yep maybe good is massively out of date Oh God oh oh ah that is worse than the worsen - bloody crap over there oh bloody hell I was really highly flavored cheese and onion in the Chara and when it's mixing with the sweetness of the chocolate and stuck in your teeth oh come back to basket all is forgiven oh dear oh that's made me feel properly nauseous do you know that doesn't happen to me very often half the problem is I'm having whole bloody cubes of this where's normally for eating something weird or nasty oh just have a little bit oh well there's notice bit of that is absolutely [ __ ] horrible [ __ ] you mr. potato whatever your name is [ __ ] you twice up the arse you big potato headed get Oh dearie me ah there are the worst video since God the last time I ate something well I don't have something to take the taste away camel balls hey it's his bubble gun which I get sent regularly so I thought I should probably show it yeah the joke is on the man a taste of my mouth is astonishing Oh Deary me right mm I feel like we're licking the bloody floor of a cheese factory as I'm right camel balls yes there is the camel look and there is testicles just in case you hadn't spotted them already so the joke is this bubblegum is like the balls of a camel or something you move it open and old that's much telling it funny actually usually it's just brown my god I've stuck every arab deer and and if i buy the top off now we are parking the top off camel balls that's what youtube is intended for you can see inside is some blood or in fact a sort of sugary solution is perfectly fine it's just like very sweet tasty bubblegum but the idea is of course unpleasant and yet ill various hmm I'm just happy taking away the taste all that [ __ ] frankly so my recommendations tabasco's interesting try out the Vegemite and chocolate doesn't work still is horrible and the cheese and crisps that are even worse maybe they're better if they're in date no now they really won't be willing okay Barry mm-hmm time the infinite joy of cheese and onion crisps in chocolate you told me that it's at a date as well yeah he's about a year old date I know your dream yeah we wouldn't be the same without our date food what I would recommend just the one square smells chocolate actually without a date is it more mature cheese ah yeah yeah stronger flavor I think I mean you want it's like take toe is like an orbiter suitable what ok tall I think he's on my risk actually from me yeah yes naira sure brand do you told tato limited-edition hopefully it's very limited based on this is does taste about baked chocolate is only does weights all the crisps here there's a crunch coming in ah it's pretty bad oh yes come in ah what is a point of that Isis costume idea I care I get my head right at all I actually really hate teasing any crisps as well Oh brilliant hmm Leary I like cheese any crisps but not in chocolate ever I've just done a spray like a cheese on in spray on my sake and that's good and cleaning that up is something to look forward to Oh sir that's disgusting dan you like chocolate I love chocolate sure what about cheese and onion crisps I can't say I've ever tried it well there's one way to find out how you sit on this important you know every time I see always bring me the best stuff you always you always bring me the best stuff and it always warms the cockles of my heart I would say try that half a chunk that's on the top that's been there don't bite off more than you can chew what other lucky sawdust or I I've had it and barians have it ok then I so I'm kind of is it like an initiation that's enough food club above the Egypt food club huh I knew you'd smoke why smash a bit weird it smells like [ __ ] it smells like when you get your ears pierced and many people know about this bunny ears people take thee when you took a piercing curve to fit any rub it you smell your fingers it smells awful and it smells just like that it's like a good it's a weird purse I'm not even joking I swear to God that's a real thing though I'm really glad I didn't know about before I tried it it smells like that it really does but let's be open-minded just get the chocolate at first shocked long I'm gonna get chocolate oh oh there is just strangely delayed response there's really delayed yeah oh no it's tangy oh-oh-oh consience do this the question is it should science have done it although it oh yeah that's really peculiar that's really rude it's not like offensive but it is literally like what what you expect is lift your life I'm have their chocolate and then a minute later Glen Arbor cheese on Incred and it is literally like you've eaten two things and it's like timed perfectly so one when one's finished will kick the other one in I can't say I find that offensive I'm really hated Oh made me feel quite ill now only a little bit you clear the whole chunk no doesn't have that much more needed yeah the only thing I'd say is that now I've got like quiche like a quiche taste money and I don't like quiche subscribe for more", "oXkDnPDl440": "what's up guys I have got an extremely exciting recipe for you today it takes about five minutes to prepare and it's extremely easy microwavable one thing that's a little bit out of the ordinary that you might want to get is one of these chocolate bar molds so we are making chocolate bars today you don't need to get this you can just use like if you have mini cupcake molds or something like that you can make it into more of a fat bomb type of thing this is cool because it makes a really nice looking chocolate bar so the ingredients we're gonna need is 100% dark chocolate baker's chocolate cacao butter this we get on Amazon I'll link it below it's a little bit pricey I think this is what like 20 bucks or so last you a while though and this is zero carb it's just pure fat coconut oil or you can use butter if you'd prefer stevia and erythritol it's in here for sweetening but you can just use one or the other to get the best taste though you're gonna want to combine the two okay so let's start by chopping up the cacao butter and the chocolate chopping it up just makes it melt a lot more quickly and uniformly mainly the cacao butter it really does not melt that easily so you want to get the cacao butter nice and small pieces and this is one ounce or 28 grams of each ingredients and then we're also going to use one ounce of coconut oil that's two tablespoons okay so we have a microwave-safe Bowl here we're gonna do this in the microwave because it's just super simple but you can also do it in like a double boiler type of setup what are you doing in there what are you doing she's trying to be blueberries okay so let's weigh out 28 grams or 1 ounce of coconut oil perfect 15 drops of stevia 1 tablespoon of powdered erythritol so if you just want to use stevia I would say do about 30 or 35 drops if you just want to use erythritol I would say do about 1 and a half tablespoons I would even go like if I was making this for me personally not caring as much about the taste I would go with all stevia because the erythritol has a little bit of trouble dissolving but we're gonna go with the Ruth root all because that does make tastes better one tablespoon and this has to be powdered if you use the granular you're gonna get some some sand eNOS in there now this is optional but I like adding a little bit of vanilla and a little bit of salt to the chocolate bar about a quarter teaspoon or just a little splash of vanilla and then a pinch of pink salt now let's microwave this for about 45 seconds now just add in the cacao butter and the chocolate to the hot coconut oil it should be relatively hot now you just got to stir it until it all melts you might have to microwave at one or two more times in case it doesn't all melt just give it some time it should all melt now we're gonna pour it in our chocolate mold be sure to put it on a baking rack or else it's just gonna spill everywhere when you try putting it in the fridge pour this right in there and there it is now pop this in the fridge for a few hours three or four hours it'll harden up nicely and what you will be left with is this we have one made ahead now I think you should store these in the fridge because at room temperature they're like pretty melty if you want to try making a more shelf-stable version use less coconut oil and more cacao butter you just might have trouble getting it all to kind of combine when you do that I'm working on a milk chocolate version this is like a very dark chocolate flavor but maybe we'll get that to you soon but let's give this a try oh I forgot to mention this entire chocolate bar right here is 2 grams of net carbs - that's gonna beat any chocolate bar you find on the market the inspiration for this was all the low carb chocolate bars that are coming out now and they're all low carb but not a lot of them are high fat so this one is actually high fat as well it's like pretty much entirely fat incredibly delicious very dark chocolate flavor though so if you don't like dark chocolate you're probably not gonna like this the nice thing about it is though if you just get a nice intense dark chocolate you don't really need to eat a lot of it and my ex you just need to get the chocolate craving' covered right a couple pieces of this after dinner is like perfect it's not even one net carb so definitely give this recipe a try we'll be working on a few variations on this you can definitely add in some stuff like some nuts or whatever you want recipe link is in the description of this video let us know what you think about this other chocolate type recipes you guys might have share them below in the comments thanks for watching [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "WJehyISxpXc": "welcome back to my channel today we're\nmaking some delicious healthy chocolate bars we're making Mars we're making some\ncaramel squares and we're making cookies and cream if you guys haven't seen the\nvideo where I make Snickers and starburst and Twix and all that I'm\ngonna leave all those recipes down below because you don't want to miss those and\nlet's go ahead and make some delicious candy bars guys they're so delicious\ngooey oh you're gonna love them let's get into so first off we are making Mars\nbars I'm starting off with date which have a really nice natural caramel\nflavor to them and adding that into my food processor I'm adding in some\nvanilla as well as some almond butter and you can do any kind of nut or seed\nbutter though I would suggest either an almond butter or a cashew butter for\nmore of a neutral flavor if you do use it peanut butter it won't be paleo but\nbe it'll have more of a peanut flavor which will be closer to a Snickers next\nI'm adding in a pinch of Himalayan salt and then I just blend that up until\nsmooth and this blender is a kind of like a\nfood processor and blender in one it's from Ninja I love it it's fairly\ninexpensive as well to make the nougat base I'm adding in about a quarter cup\nof the caramel that we made and I'm going to add that to some almond flour\nthis is a great way to just make the base using something we already made or\njust a little bit of the caramel and then some almond flour so I'm just gonna\ncombine that until it is nice and chunky and it kind of gets more sticky because\nwe're gonna be making the base so then I just took a loaf pan and I lined that\nwith parchment paper just to make it a lot easier to remove the bars after cuz\nthen you just have to lift up the parchment paper so go ahead and either\nusing your hand or using a spatula go ahead and press down our mixture onto\nthe base and make sure you get like a nice even layer and the great thing\nabout the loaf pan is you can cut this either into bars or to mini bars after\nto and you can easily double or triple this recipe if you need to so then I'm\ntaking the caramel that we made and I'm putting that over the top of our base\nand then you just need to smooth out the caramel layer on top of the nougat base\nwith your spatula until it nice and even and then we are going to\nbe chilling this in the freezer I would suggest for about four or five hours or\neven overnight just so that everything really solidifies and you're not gonna\nlose anything in the chocolate so once it's nice and hardened I'm just slicing\nthis up and I'm gonna make mini bars but you can definitely make full bars the\ngreat thing about this though is that you don't need like a huge full bar\nthey're quite sweet they're quite delicious and satisfying so I'm\nbasically making but the twin size or let the helloween sized ones so I slice\nthat up and then I made some of my homemade paleo chocolate which I will\nleave the recipe down below it's simply cacao coconut oil and a\ntouch of maple syrup you can also just melt down some paleo chocolate chips\nI like the Lily's brand or the Pacha brand but if you can't get those it's\nreally easy to make your own chocolate at home I've been making this for years\nand years and years and it's really easy and also the great thing is that when\nyour bars are chilled the chocolate is going to harden a lot quicker it's set\nin the fridge for me in about 20 minutes and these are your wonderfully delicious\nMars bars full of a nougat and a nice caramel next up we're making cookies and\ncream and I'm so happy with how this turned out so I'm using some cacao\nbutter which is actually normally what white chocolate is without the sugar to\nthat I'm adding in some coconut butter and then melt that down and add some\nvanilla and maple syrup you can also do this before it's fully melted I just\nwaited a bit once everything is nice and melted just stir that together so that\neverything turns out nice and smooth then I'm taking some paleo Oreos from my\nOreo video which I will link down below in case you haven't seen it you can also\nbuy them I have seen them or I've seen gluten-free ones as well but the recipe\nI do make at home is super simple so I'm going to leave that down below I add in\nthe melted mixture I'm putting a few cacao nibs on the top just for a little\nbit of crunch and extra chocolate flavor I let that set in the freezer for about\n20 minutes and then you have it all ready to go and you can definitely make\nthis into a bark too you don't have to make it into bars if you want to pour it\nout make a thinner layer or you can cut it in two chunks but honestly this\ntastes so similar to cookies and cream it's so delicious I'm really really\nhappy with how this turned out I know you're gonna love it and then we\nare making some caramel squares so if of course we have to make the caramel which\nis really simple to make it's just coconut sugar coconut oil and a little\nbit of vanilla stir that together a bit and then I'm adding in a couple\ntablespoons of cashew butter again you can use almond butter here I would\nsuggest either almond or cashew they are a more neutral tasting nut then as\nopposed to a peanut or you could also use a seed butter here I would use\nsunflower seed over pumpkin seed it's a little bit more neutral flavor so if you\nneed a nut free version you can definitely use a seed butter here or if\nyou don't like either those coconut butter it works as well so just go ahead\nand stir that now once it starts bubbling set a timer for about three\nminutes and you're gonna leave it about three minutes while it's bubbling and\nthen take it off and it's going to thicken where I'm putting that onto some\nparchment paper because we are going to harden this before we dip this in our\nchocolate but honestly this is such an easy caramel that you can use in many\ndifferent recipes so definitely save that you can drizzle this on ice cream\nyou can use this on pretty much anything that's a very standard caramel sauce and\nthen you're just gonna spread it out so that it's about a quarter inch thick and\nthen for rapid I just put it in the freezer but you can also chill it in the\nfridge until it gets nice and hard like this and then I'm just using a knife to\ncut it into squares and as you can see it's got that really like almost taffy\nthick caramel like chewy caramel texture to it I'm cutting mine into little\nsquares that we're going to be dipping into more of our paleo chocolate so for\neach of them I'm just dipping them inside and then we're going to be laying\nthat onto either a silicone mat or you can just use more parchment paper you\nwill see the chocolate run a bit especially with the paleo chocolate so\nyou can even do a double layer if you want which means to put it down let it\nharden and then come back and do another layer I find one layer it's okay and as\nlong as you don't mind that it slightly slides off the caramels and they're not\nperfect you could definitely trim off the chocolate on the sides if you want\nthem to be perfectly square and then just save the extra chocolate you\nchopped off before or something else and once you've covered them all you just go\nahead and let them sit for about 20 minutes in the fridge\nyou have these wonderfully chocolate-covered caramels I mean guys\nlook at how the caramel pulls and it's no refined sugar it's vegan and it's so\ndelicious all right guys I hope you enjoyed this video if you make them\ndon't forget to share them on Instagram and show me because I love seeing all of\nyour remakes I hope you're all having a great day and\nI will see you in my next video bye guys", "ApOaamySTOU": "hey guys i am so excited to announce built bars new flavor raspberry cheesecake i am so excited i actually have already tried this so this isn't like a first impressions with you but i will tell you this it tastes exactly like those raspberry butter cookies that have the raspberry jelly in the center i love those cookies i will have to tell you i actually have been thinking about those cookies and when i took my first bite out of this that's exactly what reminded me of those cookies this is so good it's very fluffy very like that musketeer candy bar texture just like the cookies and cream the cookie dough like it's just the texture is so great so the macros on this is 17 grams of protein we got five grams of sugar five net carbs um 140 calories and the fat is 2.5 grams of fat so um oh my gosh i am just so excited about this flavor i'm gonna tell you i'm definitely buying a box of these i am really really just happy about being a build bar ambassador this like tops my list of like accomplishments that i have done in my life like i it's just such an exciting thing for me and i i just like can't tell you like i just feel so lucky and to be able to try new flavors early and to you know basically sample them and be able to tell you guys about them and i so good so i'm gonna take a bite and show you what it looks like on the inside because i tell you what it's it's just it's so good there's legit real pieces of raspberry so white chocolate so if you've never tried their white chocolate and you like raspberry i highly recommend this their white chocolate is incredible incredible i have tried other white chocolates or keto white chocolate and not my fave this way chocolate is so good every white chocolate bar i've tried from them is on point and with the raspberry and this white chocolate it just goes together so well so let's take a little bite oh my god oh my god i just got that that raspberry cookie taste and it's like who needs those cookies it has real chunks of raspberry in there real chunks of raspberry so you get that nice texture of the like raspberry when you're chewing it and i think that makes all the difference i think if it didn't have that texture of the raspberry it'd still probably be good let's just be real but that texture just elevates it and the white chocolate with the raspberry i'm telling you if you love those raspberry cookies you need this because i'm not kidding you i used to kill a whole box of those back in the day and oh my god this just brings me brings back that flavor for 140 calories and 17 grams of protein and five grams of net carbs you just cannot beat it so i highly highly recommend this bar i would definitely be ordering probably two boxes of these oh my god i'm buying something i'm obsessed with bull bars george and i just cannot get enough of these new flavors and this just beats it this makes it to my top five like real quick so anyway guys get yourself some of these these go live at 2 a.m eastern standard time and i will definitely be staying up and getting some but definitely use code hk socco to save 10 and just so you know you can use my code as many times as you want it's not just a one-time use thing and if there is a sale on the website you can use my code for additional off and sometimes they have freebies and everything so always get you know especially if there's a brand that you want to purchase from or you purchase a lot from you know i check daily because you never know what's going on with websites and flash sales and stuff like that so definitely i would suggest signing up for emails because things pop up so anyway get yourself some raspberry cheese cook oh my gosh if you love those butter cookies with the raspberry i'm telling you you get that taste and uh i don't need those cookies no more and this solves everything so thank you guys so much for watching let me know if you're gonna be picking up any of these raspberry cheesecakes and go belt man i am telling you go built because i they just keep topping each flavor and it's like i keep saying this is my favorite this is my favorite but it's like how can you choose when they're just so incredibly good you just you just can't and again if you haven't tried their white chocolate this is the time to try it because they don't always have the white chocolate all the time so um excelente excellente so awesome job built thank you guys so much for watching definitely pick up some build bars and i'll see you guys all later", "nGHZP9OGQFI": "it's Lawren it's Halloween today whoa so I'm wearing this wacky top hello everybody happy Halloween welcome back to offer food I'm Lauren Toyota and it is Halloween today so that's why I post bright and early because maybe you'll have a chance to make these today if not whatever who cares I had to release it on Halloween Halloween is a Wednesday so anyway if you watch this channel you know that I always make fun of Halloween kind of like up all the ridiculous things people make for their Halloween parties that are shaped like ghouls and goblins and chopped off fingers and pumpkins puking well I came up with a great idea for this year we're gonna make a vegan chocolate bar it's a caramel peanut chocolate bar it tastes like a Snickers but I didn't want to call it like vegan Snickers I don't know it's caramel peanut chocolate bar it's better than the real thing it's better than any chocolate bar I've ever had as a vegan homemade or store-bought there really aren't any really good like chocolate bars you can buy in the store that are vegan they tend to be too sweet the chocolate is chalky anyway these are legit and you're gonna want to make them even if it's not Halloween you're just gonna want to make them all the time and have them in the fridge and stuff your face full of these chocolate bars they're so good you know they're good because I'm not really even a sweet person and I'm addicted to these and I keep going back to the fridge and like taking a little bite and then being like okay I'm not gonna eat that and then I go back to the fridge and take a little bite which is like the kind of problem I had when I was a teenager trying not to eat all these chocolate bars before I was vegan of course so alright who cares if it's Halloween it just happens to be Halloween we just have it making chocolate bars on Halloween let's get into it we're gonna make a homemade really easy oat flour crust then we're gonna make a real vegan caramel with no dates in it and then we're going to coat these things in chocolate and top them with some Maldon sea salt flakes cause we're fancy like that so first we're gonna turn these rolled oats into flour in the food processor now you're gonna add all purpose flour sea salt granulated sugar packed brown sugar and melted vegan butter process that until it's all combined and then you should be able to pinch it together you're gonna dump it out into a parchment-lined 7x7 baking pan and press it into an even layer so you want it to be pretty compact and like a very solid flat base cookie crust here now we're gonna bake this in an oven that I've preheated to 375 for 12 to 14 minutes on my oven it's exactly 13 minutes on the dog you want the edges to just be slightly turning brown but that's it you don't want to over bake this to make the caramel you're gonna combine vegan butter packed brown sugar thick coconut cream scooped from a can of coconut milk or coconut cream peanut butter and sea salt in a saucepan and get it on a low bubble once the butter is melted and everything's combined until smooth you're gonna keep it over a low bubble whisking constantly for about five minutes it's ready when it starts to stick to the sides of the pan but it can still run off your whisk but you can definitely tell that it's looking thicker like a caramel don't heat it any further than this [Music] and then stir in roasted salted peanuts and then let this cool for about 15 to 20 minutes before pouring over top of the cooled cookie base [Music] so just make sure that the peanuts look like they're evenly dispersed around the caramel so that you know every chocolate bar has the peanuts in it this is you don't have to do this but I have these little clips alligator clips I just tighten the paper so that it doesn't fold into the caramel or anything like that while you're setting it you don't have to do this but just in case just keeps the paper back here all right now this needs to go in the fridge for a good 24 hours what's gonna happen although this seems quite liquidy it does solidify to a nice gooey caramel so in the fridge it goes so I already have one chilled and set obviously because you have to wait a whole day it needs to be firm to the touch where like you're not you can kind of dip your finger in it but not you have to really press if you want to make an indent so lift this out peel away the edges and then were going to cut these into the chocolate bars [Music] so cut these into 1-inch wide bars and then lay them on a wire rack keep them refrigerated until you're ready to coat them in chocolate [Music] [Music] so now we're gonna melt some chocolate to make the coating of our caramel peanut chocolate bars I found dark chocolate melting wafers these are the kinds of things you can usually find at a bulk store where they have like candy making supplies I like these because they melt really well and they stay kind of very smooth and silky long enough for me to coat all the chocolate bars I was finding it a bit tough using melted vegan chocolate chips because they start to get all gummy and solidified too quickly if you have to do that go ahead you could also mix cocoa powder and coconut oil but you can find these they're actually quite good and they make a really good coating so we're gonna melt these over a double boiler basically just put this glass wool over a pot with a little bit of water that's boiling until it's nice and smooth and melted [Music] all right so you got your chocolate melted you got your cold bars here you got to act kind of fast all right look we're not chocolatiers here so we don't know what we're doing but it's a little finicky I found the best way it was to get the top and like one of the sides done and the ends pull it place it down and then put the flaked salt on just before it dries [Music] [Music] refrigerate them or freeze them to get it solidified and then go back in and do the other side in the bottom refrigerate them again and then they're done [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] well I think I did a mighty fine job of coating the chocolate on these caramel peanut chocolate bars you're gonna serve these out a little party I suggest putting a little piece of parchment paper around them and you can tie a little piece of twine or string make it look even more Halloweeny if you want I don't know if these are appropriate to give out at the door for trick-or-treating they're a little fresh they need to stay refrigerated for the most part I mean you can put this out for a while and people can eat them but if you're gonna keep them for longer put them in the fridge you know they're obviously not made in a factory so there's not all kinds of preservatives to keep the chocolate coating from melting in your hands these are you know homemade right from the source by area to the beige holy hell I already told you I've eaten many of these already I can't get enough of this paramount and I get but people want to be healthy and they might not want to eat sugar but just live a little eat a little bit of sugar once in a while I'm gonna kill you if I want chocolate bar I don't want something masquerading around as a chocolate bar I want a chocolate bar I want to taste the sugar the salt the creamy look at this caramel it's gooey it's legit I've tried to eat caramels I keep trying they're not working for me I don't love them they taste like dates there's a weird like sweet non sugar taste about them but I don't like date hater I use them sometimes for certain things they're great for what I was trying to achieve here not so much hmm there's a lick of Snickers I eat Snickers all the time as a teenager like I had a compulsive issue like a problem so this is reminding me of like Halloween getting all my chocolate bars throwing out the lollipops and the chips won't throw them out but gave them to someone else poured it all of my chocolate in a bag in my room and like binge Halloween candy for like three weeks and that was all gone that is what the memory I'm having right now is feels like I'm doing something really bad right now but I'm not I'm doing something so good it's making me happy it's gonna make you happy holy crap your focus the cookie bottom is just the right amount of firmness and then it's nice and creamy caramel I'm telling you I'm actually addicted to this you're gonna want to make these around the holidays too I think hmm it's just the right balance of sweet and salty like it's magical okay if you're looking for other

magical chocolate bar flavour ever with my all-natural strawberry chocolate bars since you guys loved my DIY strawberry chocolate chip video I started thinking about other pink treats I could create that don't exist yet for some reason like strawberry flavored pink chocolate bars these adorable pink chocolate bars are strawberry flavored and these are so easy to make there's really two ingredients and they're all-natural because we're using my secret ingredient so there's no food dyes they're artificial flavors and if you're not already subscribed to my youtube channel be sure to tap that subscribe button to be the first to see my all new videos and I'm adding some edible gold stars to these because I think it does make some extra whimsical and magical and fun I mean we're already making pink chocolate bars so why not make them extra fabulous okay so let's get started and as always I'll leave your full written recipe down below for you guys or you can get it on my website at whimsy and XCOM just place your mold on a baking sheet and then go ahead and sprinkle some edible gold stars right on top of the mold and this part is totally optional just adds a whole nother layer of fun to these then just set this aside and we're gonna take my secret ingredient of antifreeze striped strawberries and we're gonna pulse this in a food processor until it turns into a powder you can also just do this and crush them up in a plastic bag if you want just make sure you get that nice fine powder that's going to dissolve into our chocolate so you can make these using melted white chocolate today I'm doing melted white candy melts because they tend to set a little bit firmer but you can do a combo of the two if you want the firmness from the candy melts and a flavor from the white chocolate either or works great then a microwave safe Bowl just take your chocolate and melt it in 30-second intervals then go ahead and add your strawberry powder right in and mix it up until it's fully combined then just transfer the mixture into a plastic ziplock bag and snip up the corner so it's easy to pipe right into the mold and just squeeze it right into each cavity

discs of strawberry chocolate bars then go ahead and just tap the baking sheet on the counter to release any air bubbles and make sure it's nice and smooth on top and you can also do this with some

taste test to see if we can find out which dark chocolate bar is the best we're going to be judging this on five criteria snap and appearance texture creaminess flavor bitterness and sweetness so we're going to judge these on a scale from one to ten in all of those five categories and then we'll rank them best to least all right we're going to start with seven not a bad snap there all right so for snapping appearance i give that about a three flavor flavor is good it's pretty intense i'll give that a six probably it's pretty bitter so i'm gonna give that probably a four for bitter and it is pretty the sweetness is there i'm gonna give it about an eight for sweetness for texture for that one i'm gonna give that a five for texture okay moving to six all right oh not a very good snap at all not at all probably a two on snap i don't parents not much flavor there probably a three but it's good and creamy but the bitterness not very bitter i'm going to give a seven for that and sweetness about a five all right number six on creaminess and texture man give that a five moving on to five oh nice lovely snap on that oh i'm gonna give that a nine on a snap on that okay oh that's a nice bite to it all right texture and creaminess i'll give that a seven i can tell that that is tempered really really well that's a nice temper on that chocolate flavor it's nice and intense i'm gonna give that probably an eight all right bitterness is really bitter but there's a nice it's really nice on that one i would say a seven on that one and sweetness probably a six moving on four oh a lovely snap on that four uh gets a um i'm gonna give that a an eight on that snap appearance is nice too texture and creaminess mmm i'm gonna give that a seven it's not as it's not as creamy but the flavor flavor is good i'm gonna give that an eight on flavor the bitterness is there but it's not overwhelming i'd say a seven on that and the sweetness there's a hint of sweetness but it's definitely not overpoweringly sweet i would say a five on the sweetness moving on in number three oh not very much of a snap at all to that one now appearance is nice but not much of a snap on that i'm going to give that a 5 on that this one has some orange in it the orange is really nice if you like and a dark chocolate with orange in it this is nice there's a silkiness to it so the texture and creaminess i'm going to rank that at a seven flavor very very good i'm going to give that the dark chocolate is there it's very overpowered by the orange so i'm going to give that five on flavor bitterness on that it's very low on the bitterness i'm gonna give that a three it needs to in my opinion it needs to have a little bit more that bitterness so i'm ranking it lower because of that if it's overwhelmingly bitter it gets a lower score in my opinion but if that bitterness is just right i'm giving it a higher score so that's how i'm ranking that bitterness and overall on the sweetness the sweetness is a nice it's nicely there not overpowering on the sweetness i would give that an eight all right moving on to two oh lovely snap there oh nice snap the appearance is absolutely gorgeous it's really really dark almost black on that color there nice texture it's creamy and smooth on the palette very very evident that it is a dark chocolate so this one oh that this just has such a lovely appearance i'm giving that a nine on snap and appearance um texture and creaminess it is really up there i'm again gonna say a nine on that flavor i'm gonna say an eight on that flavor the bitterness is there in a very good way but it's not overwhelming it seems to be very very well balanced again on that bitterness i'm gonna say an eight on that and the sweetness in my opinion you could probably stand up a little bit more sweetness so i'm going to give that a seven all right moving on to the last one number one nice snap very nice snap appearance it's got just that nice gloss on it okay for snapping appearance we're gonna go for an eight texture and creaminess it's very creamy on the palette again an eight flavor the flavor is good it's different than some of the others flavor i'm gonna give that a seven bitterness it's pretty bitter so i'm gonna give that a six it's got a good a good bitterness there it's almost overpowering in the bitterness so i'm not giving it quite as high as some of the others and the sweetness is a good sweet balance to that one i'm gonna get that one at eight on sweetness all right now we're gonna tally up my producer has taken notes so we're going to tally up and she's going to let me know which one ranked highest okay and the results are in here we go talishy and as you can see my wonderful producer has put out the brands and the and the packages that they came in this is really exciting to me guys because i recognized some of the tastes a little bit on my palette but i truly did not know which one was which so it is surprising to me as well to find out which which one ranked the highest so the review oh yes okay so number one was our number two right here mozar roth that came in at number one with 41 points two thus uh slots for two and three were tied with 37 points and they went to uganda right here and trader joe's over here which was our number five okay fourth place came to valrona fifth to lent sixth to giver delhi and seven to lilies now i to just spend one very quick second telling you about some of these because you may not be familiar with all of these brands especially our top ranking ones mozart raw with this 85 um cocoa in it i get at aldi's grocery store so if you're not familiar with that brand and you don't shop at aldi that might be why because i've not found this brand anywhere

This is a shame, because they are delicious! Today, it's time to look\nat some candy bars from other nations. Try them when you're traveling to other countries.\nAll of these candy bars offer a unique and exciting taste. So get those taste buds ready\nand let\u2019s unwrap 10 candy bars America wished they had. Kinder Bueno & Kinder Surprise These delicious chocolate bars are made by\nthe famous Italian company Ferrero. The word Bueno has Spanish origins and means \"good\"\nor \"tasty\". They come packed with a creamy hazelnut filling, a wafer shell to give the\ncandy bar a wonderful crunch, all surround by creamy chocolate. Similar to Twix candy\nbars, Kinder Bueno come in packs of two. However, unlike Twix bars, Kinder Bueno are not widely\navailable in the United States. Production started in the early 1990's and it was heavily\nmarketed first in Europe, then through out South America and other regions. Kinder Buenos\nhave always been made at both Kinder factories, one located in Villers-\u00c9calles, France and\nthe other in Warsaw, Poland. Kinder themselves however are most popular for their Kinder\nSurprise, which are hollow chocolate eggs featuring an inner shell of white chocolate\nand an outer shell of milk chocolate, and of course, a toy inside each egg. These also\nshockingly are not widely available in the United Sates. Due to outdated rules enforced\nby the Federal Food and Drug Cosmetic Act of 1983. The inclusion of a toy inside the\nKinder Surprise chocolate eggs have prevented them from being sold in the United States.\nThough in 2017, they slowly began to introduce them as \"Kinder Joy\" to the American crowd.\nThat said they are different from the original European Kinder Surprise so while the USA\nmay finally be getting their hands on these, legally, they still don't have the original. Bake 'N Tasty Mini Kit Kats in Japan Japan loves Kit Kats, this obsession lead\nto the creation of what has to be one of the coolest candy bar creations ever made, Bake\n'N Tasty Mini Kit Kats. These are Kit Kats that you bake and make yourself at home! Yes\nthat's correct, no eating this one while waiting in line at the grocery store, you've got to\ntake it home and make it. For this extra hard work you'll be treated with one of the best\ncandy bar experiences you can have. This is not a joke, there were literally line ups\noutside the Kit Kat specialty stores when these were first released. The basic rundown\nis you toss these little Kit Kat bake bars into your toaster oven and within minutes\nyou get a delicious baked wafer biscuit candy bar. The sugar content hardens during the\nbaking process and omits a lovely caramel scent. The only thing you could compare them\nto is something like a toaster strudel or Pop Tart, but these Kit Kats are on another\nlevel. There are two main flavors, Kit Kat mini original chocolate and Kit Kat mini pudding,\nboth amazing. And just in case you're thinking to yourself, hey I've got a toaster oven and\nsome Kit Kats, I'm going to make my own baked Kit Kats, don't do it. Kit Kat released a\nfriendly reminder stating that: \u201cKit Kat Bake has been developed in Japan, specifically\nfor baking; please do not attempt to bake other Kit Kat products.\u201d Sorry America,\nthis is a Kit Kat treat that's only available in Japan at this time. The Prince Polo Is Popular In Poland This candy bar is a time honored favorite\nin Poland. In fact, it's the most popular candy bar in the country. If you ever get\nthe chance to try a Prince Polo, be sure to indulge. You'll love munching on this candy\nbar's chocolate-covered wafers. Each bar has four wafer layers and three layers of chocolate\ncream filling. It's not just the Polish who enjoy noshing on these tasty candy bars. The\nIcelanders are also huge Prince Polo fans. Most residents of Iceland consume a pound\nor more of these chocolate bars annually. In winter of 2018, proud Prince Polo fans\nin Iceland took to social media to show off their own Prince Polo candy bars. Icelanders\ngot really creative when it came to posing with Prince Polo chocolate bars. Some posed\nwith the wrapped candy bars between their teeth, while one Prince Polo fanatic dressed\nup as an astronaut who was discovering a Prince Polo bar on a new planet. Sure, that last\none may have been Photoshopped, but it was all great fun. So, why does this candy bar\nremain so popular in Iceland? Well, it's been around for a long time. During the Fifties,\nthere were stringent rules about importing sweet treats into Iceland. Since there wasn't\na ton of options, Icelanders relied on tasty Prince Polo candy bars when they were craving\nsweets. This candy bar has become an integral part of Icelandic culture. Coffee Crisp in Canada This one might be the most confusing on the\nentire list. Why? Well coffee is global, essentially available everywhere in the world coffee is\nas global as products get. So you would think a delicious candy bar featuring chocolatey\ncoffee goodness would also be a worldwide hit, but you'd be wrong. Coffee Crisp is a\nCanadian only candy bar that actually originated in the 1930's, but has been around as we know\nit now since the late 1980's, when Nestle acquired Rowntree, the original manufacturer\nof what would become the Coffee Crisp candy bar. Nestle Canada has been producing and\nmarketing the bar to Canadians ever since. Many variations and limited edition flavors\nwere released over the years, including Coffee Crisp Triple Mocha, French Vanilla, Orange,\nRaspberry, Cafe Caramel and even a Maple flavored variation called Coffee Crisp White was released.\nAll of these variations have since been discontinued and are even harder to get your hands on.\nThere have been many petitions and general outcry to get Coffee Crisp distributed, particularly\nin the United States and one such petition was actually successful. In July of 2006,\nNestle Canada actually started marketing and distributing Coffee Crisp bars to American\ncities. However, in 2009 without reason Nestle Canada discontinued all marketing and distribution\nto the United States. While there is still some official and unofficial importing of\nCoffee Crisp Bars to the USA, this is one still remains out of reach for most Americans. Ovomaltine Chocolate Bars Are A Swiss Delight The Swiss town of Ovomaltine was once home\nto a pharmacist. His name was Georg Wander. He was a doctor who wanted to do his bit to\nlower the rate of child mortality. In 1865, which was during his time, some children perished\ndue to lack of proper nutrition. To do his part to help, he decided to create a powerful\nsource of nutrition, using malt extract. When the good doctor passed away, his son embraced\nthe same dream. His son was named Albert and Albert decided to fortify the malt extract\nrecipe, by adding cocoa, eggs and milk. By 1904, the recipe was complete. It was called\nOvaltine by those who spoke English. It was a powder that was meant to be stirred into\nmilk and drank down. These days, the Ovamaltine brand is still going strong. It's not just\nnutritional powder anymore. There are a range of products, including Ovomaltine chocolate\nbars, which contain yummy hazelnuts and the classic powder mixture. These candy bars are\na favorite in Europe. They carry the distinctive scent of Ovomaltine powder. The malt scent\nand taste tend to overpower the chocolate, but in a good way. It's also possible to buy\nbiscuits, spreads and cereals by Ovomaltine. Smarties, but not those Smarties While these are technically not a candy bar,\nSmarties are chocolate candies and boy are they good! These little candy coated chocolate\nspheres are indeed also unique to Canada, you will not find them south of the boarder,\nthough that's a complicated subject. Smarties, are already an American candy classic. You\nknow, those little cheap sugary pastel colored tablets that come in a roll with the ends\ntwisted shut, those are Smarties, if you're American. If you are Canadian, those are called\nRockets, and Smarties and brightly colored, candy coated milk chocolate button shaped\ncandies. They are much like M&M's which are sold in the United States, but also sold in\nCanada, confused yet? Here's the simplified version, there is already an American Smarties\ncandy company, therefore the Canadian brand of Smarties candies can't be sold in the USA\nunder that name. It's really that simple and for that very reason you will never be able\nto get Smarties in the USA. That said, this one is less of a bummer if you're looking\nto actually eat these candies, as you can go to any store and buy standard M&M's and\nbe treated to a very similar taste experience! Cherry Ripe Is From Australia Cherry fans in America may wish that they\ncould buy Cherry Ripe chocolate bars in the USA. These bars come from Australia and they've\nbeen around since the 1920s. Despite huge cultural shifts, this candy bar still reigns\nin the Land Down Under. It's actually the oldest candy bar in the country and was the\nbrainchild of talented chocolatiers who worked for a company called MacRobertson Chocolates.\nIn 1967, Cadbury gobbled up MacRobertson Chocolates. Thanks to Cadbury's resources and brand recognition,\nthe Cherry Ripe bar's popularity spread. This candy bar features a mixture of cherries and\ncoconut. The mixture has a texture that might be best described as spongy. Over a spongy\nlayer, there is a dark chocolate coating. While other Cadbury treats, including Crunchie\nbars and Flake candy bars, have also captured the loyalty of Aussies, the Cherry Ripe is\nstill a contender. It's iconic. Some of these candy bars probably seem pretty exotic to\nAmericans. In America, it's about the milk chocolate and the nuts and the caramel. Chocolate\nbars reflect the tastes of the countries that they are sold in. This is why learning about\ncandy bars from different nations is so interesting. If you grew up in Australia, you might find\nyourself craving a Cherry Ripe, rather than a Butterfinger or something like that. Double Decker Bar in the United Kingdom Yes, it's named after the bus of the same\nname, and yes it's from the UK where those very buses reside. The buses were even used\nin marketing the candy bar. Some will even say the very reason why Double Decker candy\nbars are not available to the U.S. market is due to the fact that double decker buses\njust aren't that common in the USA, though that seems unlikely. More likely is that Double\nDecker bars are made by Cadbury who on more than one occasion have created regional candy\nbars that they don't market or distribute elsewhere. But that's the history lesson,\nwhat about the candy bar itself? The Double Decker was first introduced to the British\nmarket in 1976 and has been going strong since. The Double Decker candy bar consists of, not\nsurprisingly, two layers. One layer of lightly whipped nougat, and another layer containing\nlittle crispy cereal bits. The whole thing is then coated in creamy milk chocolate. While\nthese look and taste amazing, it's very unlikely that the Double Decker candy bar will ever\nmake its way to the USA. Horalky Is a Slovakian Sensation The Horalky is a candy bar that was invented\ndue to a food shortage in 1960s Slovakia. At that time, hazelnuts were in short supply.\nTypically, hazelnuts were a component in wafers. Bakers changed it up to cope with the shortage.\nThey started utilizing peanuts, rather than hazelnuts. The peanut wafer was born and it\nwas good. The advent of the peanut wafer led to the creation of the legendary Horalky.\nIt's a candy bar which contains wafer layers, as well as a cream made from peanuts. There\u2019s\nalso a chocolate coating that isn't too thick. Decades later, a bakery called Sedita makes\nroughly one hundred and sixty million of these candy bars annually. Peanuts used in the Horalky\nrecipe are sourced from South America and shipped to Slovakia. Cocoa for the bars is\nsourced from the Ivory Coast of Africa. Peanut fans in America may wish that they could indulge\nin these bars. After all, both the wafers and the filling are made from peanuts.\u00a0The\nHoralky features vibrant packaging. Its packaging is something that many Slovakians recognize\nat a glance. These bars are so popular there, but most people in the USA have never even\nheard of them. Anyone who plans to visit Slovakia should also plan to pick these candy bars\nup at local shops. They're traditionally Slovakian sweet treats. Plus, they have an awesome origin\nstory. Aero Bars Have Stellar Mouth Feel Aero bars are delicious. This enticing treat\ncomes from candy mega-company, Nestl\u00e9. You'll find these bars, which have a unique texture\nthat's aerated, thanks to plenty of air bubbles within the chocolate, in a host of countries,\nincluding Japan, the United Kingdom, Canada and South Africa. Unfortunately, Americans\nonce rejected this classic chocolate bar, back in the 80s. They were launched in the\nUSA back then, but didn't really take off. Americans who have managed to find these chocolate\nbars since then, probably in Canada, often love the way that they taste. While Americans\nsaid no to the Aero long ago, they may be sorry now. Maybe the timing was just wrong.\nAero bars melt in mouths thanks to their texture. The bubbles inside of the chocolate collapse\nwhile the chocolate is inside of the mouth. This creates a creamy-smooth taste sensation\nthat's really awesome. This chocolate bar has been around for over a hundred years.\nIt's had some variations, such as the Dark Cherry Truffle Big Bubble Bar, the White Chocolate\nBig Bubble Bar, the Mousse, Aero Bubbles and others. The original recipe for the Aero is\nguarded with care. It's top secret. Any American who wants to try them should put them on their\nchocolate bucket list. Maybe a tour to countries where fun and different chocolate bars are\nsold would be a good idea? Aeros are available in typical, single-serving sizes, but there\nare smaller and larger ones too.

different like english i've got one american and i think i've got a which i think i'd be dead maybe or like some scandinavian country so i don't feel like um so i feel like i can just mix oh i don't have to have like the same like um into each week anyway maybe let us do a bit of a mix but anyway we've got our topic and this actually reminds me of um on tick tock i never seen the whole family it's like the comedy series to all family and basically i remember i did let's do a tick tock where one of them was like like she was saying okay she's trying to die and just like i've had my um i had my nuts in like like it's healthy like a topic like well i had two topics today she was on her diet and she was like i got was is too tough it's like it's a health food like let's real topic is just still a chocolate bar if you want to be healthy just have houses on its own but i think that was a joke of it you know you know but anyway it was quite just it looks quite nice i kind of like the like stuff within the weapon but yeah but i feel like it might be like um [Music] and i was just thinking that i was gonna try like a snickers isn't it version but basically it was like like six months off so i put it in a bin because i thought i don't know whisk it and get ill because it's like i don't i don't mind having chocolate vibes like a month off but like six months or seven or eight months don't know but i thought this is like they only had a uk version called topic you know anyway let's try it hmm she's got that in it's actually a different kind of like more of a white look like uh it's more similar to a milky way in that sense it's quite hard your hair looks good with that hmm um i think i like how the they've used a white nugget in this actually i think it actually works better then use them to like not the other one because i don't know i think it just i think goes there with healthy nuts and i just i think it's a bit of complication you know it's nice taste it but again it's it's hard to rate it now because i feel like what do you weigh it you know is it better than a snickers is it hmm hmm but it might be actually better than a sneaker surprise so again i like the how it's got our the white nugget in it it has got caramel in it but you know after the thing with the sneakers actually i find i don't mind this but the only thing with it is that i think i would rather have a mask about or voice snickers and this is a whole different thing you know which is what i like about it because it's like this is a whole different bar essentially you don't i think again whenever snickers is like well actually i prefer i'll prefer about the nuts you know even i do like nuts but you know but you know but i feel like this is his own version so i'm not thinking about you know like they had there wasn't really any guess milk away i guess you could say but this it says calm up and it has tails nuts so it does not taste like milky at all but just got the same um no good nugget in it and honestly it's making me like think like it's like i don't want a microwave now cause i haven't had a milk away in a while but i don't really know what i'm gonna wear before we wait it rated a snickers of 3.5 i might rate this at 3.8 somewhere along those lines i don't actually know if that's a bit high or might just be a 3.5 you know i'm going to come back to where i'm going to finish it and then i'm going to come back to you because i really don't know at this moment in time hey and i've just had it topic [Music] like i think it's better than a fart like you know because i think the combination works really well like the coward melanie the soft nugget and the haze nuts really go well actually and i think yeah 3.8 and and i do think i do because i think i do sometimes i am comparing it to most all bars you know like if i think about similar i compare both you know you know and if you know i know what i think this is like a competitor with snickers just because it's essentially quite similar in the sense that it's no but it's caramel and it's got nothing and nothing but i actually think this is better than snickers because i just prefer the combination and yeah i just prefer the combination it's better because i do like peanuts in chocolate but i think it depends in what way if you get what i'm saying but it just shows like everything works in a different way you know and it's that's why i like i feel like there's so many different recipes and so many things you can try with chocolate you know there's so many things you can make some and something can work well and that's the fun of it you know there's so many combinations with chocolate and different things by doing it in such a slightly different way it can be a completely different bar but anyway so i would recommend a topic like because i feel like it's an underweighted bar because yeah anyway i'm gonna go and yeah i don't know i'm gonna do next time but i've got um i've got a couple of i've got then you know anyway thank you for watching hope you're next day and it's like i've had to top it down below what you think of it anyway see", "xNDj6-ZCLPM": "I'm just I'm nervous correct when you nervous back everything all of it dragon last time I heard a dragon that's gonna sound like okay you put I got the record on my cell phone nice if you don't believe all

themselves of it you know sound like that I had a professor in college where he would sometimes if it was crazy like yes or the vault I mean a femur bone hear that go Matthew make a really deeply erotic Wow every time is boys crap yeah that was the biggest lie they told you in the school that your voice would stop crackin nothing yeah or you know maybe I just have a couple more years of puberty left yeah so we just want to get that good because it takes the cream like if you're doing a full batch takes like an hour and a half the ancient American proverb slicin around if you don't have to well I stand read watching your cream get one you can warm it up start straight what's on the dollar isn't it yeah yeah he's quite some her greatest hurts yeah plus he likes Pam so yeah you know he's good I just get a weird really sits further back than the rest so I'm not sure like how close it's gonna be to the edge of the track uh-huh chameleons have to lower it a little bit instead of leaving it up I actually don't lower it it's just the weight of the trade brings a bag down so I'm actually trying to keep it from getting lower so I'll hold it up and just very gently let it down hmm otherwise it will come down crashing down onto the cream yeah it'll actually it'll crack the trays right in half man yeah the building will shake oh yeah we amassed not again put a hole in the floor it's terrible and super scary last time we taught the minivan came through the front it was actually me just dropping us know that was the first time three mags printed in 2020 correct easier

that's what my dad always says years ago I guess we could tell Ian that's an exit tray I mean his inflection is like perfect I mean it makes sense that like if someone had a container xma and with a Cavallo all the time because in Italian you always end with vowels you're like pronouncing about what you're really not you really just like not cutting the end of a sound off you know mm-hmm like I don't know tre yeah tre yeah I don't I don't know exactly how to like articulate it but it just feels like it's like the natural like end of like a word yeah it's just like Americans are really gonna cut it off yeah it's kind of tricky rivers to flow ready here it is gonna you gotta fill in there anyway yes sure does you gotta fill that with raspberry cream now you're gonna do that part of it yes

this tastes too much like what I wanted it stay out what the heck well if there's odd too much I mean that I thought there's like too much because it's a pretty it's a relatively ballpark right it's like relatively ballpark right yeah it's like you know 0.6 of a cup instead of 25 and woke up yeah [Applause] raspberry [Applause] you see all that comes out little temples okay just women log looks like this woman no no never resurface again never again hey what's that metamorphic tip like butterfly intent I like 80s tadpoles better know such a big fan of sedimentary man Joe Dokes rock [Music]

know why that actually might be obviously could you know we keep the aprons over the over the kettle you you know I'm storing them and it was under the dark chocolate dark chocolate spoon table so yeah we're just I didn't see that little blade come off the bottle either way [Music] looks pretty well mixed you're not seen any more oil on the corners I know on the corners of this bowl yeah right what would you call it like the edge I guess Wow Wow make you feel bad yeah I wish I did it's just there's so many words the only me it's hard to like remember [Music] [Applause] all right you're ready he but that slicer move out of the way for you Jim just trying to do my job over here geez well I'm just trying to make your job harder okay like what's wrong with that that's mine I wouldn't want to step on your feet huh [Music] I almost been the audience game call right now oh man yeah it says potential spam well that's good yeah I paid $2.99 a month for that I don't answer spam or I'll tell me who's calling even if I don't have their number and my my phone oh cool oh I think mr. Ferris called me before when I told Nicole was although it didn't say mr. Parris's I like hello Ferris I knew it was you the whole time is he like how'd you go actually that made it easier also he said hey how'd you know who you were how can I trust you how do I know that you're not lying if I the way to be these bastard I'm sure there are a couple you probably will get bastards and like what close to a year 10 11 10 months there's nothing you've done this yeah I mean Easter was kind of early last year so I'm like trying to figure not that it makes a difference yeah just like Christmas birthday every 365 or 366 days yeah yeah what's up with that why do you think Lee here is there oh is that it what I was like like that certain holidays are fixed but otherwise yeah like Thanksgiving is usually the one this year wasn't Thanksgiving earlier or something like that really I think it's always the third Thursday yeah but I thought someone said it was er I don't really pay attention to things so I'm unless maybe they were arrested with it yes Thanksgiving already yeah no that's why the third Thursday November Christmas is the 25th and I'm pretty sure that Easter has to be full moon or something like to see yeah that's what I was gonna say it's like if it's it's like a solstice holiday or not is that what I call something like that I'm sure someone will tell us in the comments yeah I don't know I never figured that out did you ever take any holiday courses in college not too many holidays 101 this is the introductory courses I don't say you be for the yeah yeah or my kinesiology degree that I used to make candy for those well of you if you need a kidney theology degree for candy videos who who's to say you need to know about holidays or not mm-hmm yes Luzi ology that's what heats and yeah oh now you guys found this stuck on my girl oh you are right Oh Vivian you're just like your son Shane yeah I think Ivan says I'm slightly an old man right I'd love to sit over notice either but likes the first one like the first funnel that you fill it never drips and then after that they all do I'll kick it off the hinges funny you wouldn't think it would be so much different just like having a different shape yeah those different science - yeah it just it goes so quick or something you know it's like if we ever have you try these I don't know if I tried these shapes I tried the freeing like just normal traditional cream shapes you did pretty good didn't you I'm gonna say that I did not completely awful that ya know I thought I thought they all came up pretty good like maybe you weren't that fast we got a pretty low standard then yes the best hey man you feel a couple of Korea that's how you gotta do all right I killed it yeah yeah after that it's just the speed but except pretty a little out of its Sweetman yeah speed and then also not overfill and have under fillings and collapsing the Creator thanks to each other isn't it weird that like you know there's like oh wait oh yeah there's the color yeah yeah you're definitely right you can like see the color seeping out yeah yeah I don't know you wouldn't think that you could like drop the cream too hard but you can't drop it too hard hmm candy surgery typically operation when you work it it can't turn someone's tongue red max iodide not hacked what would they do it with a red tongue you'd probably go straight to the hospital you know help my dogs right everyone else yes it is correct it'd be like all right I guess it is $40 copay please I'm so stoked for Easter yeah I'm getting excited man I can't wait to like start doing buddy molds and I think I'm gonna say because it's gonna be over soon haha well I mean that's part of it but it's uh let's just telling these guys it's like I like having like a big list to work on and like you know what you're supposed to be doing how many numbers you need it's exciting trying to see if you can't keep up with it you could probably ask my dad how many days will a 51 not so counting yeah well this morning I was like man I don't know if you have seven weeks or eight weeks he's like eight weeks baby hey Dad how many minutes are left until Easter is over how many minutes yeah yeah yeah he said you got it down to the minutes no eight weeks yeah eight weeks away learn today yeah gives us enough time I'm excited for it I'll be over yeah it's fun very convincing yeah after Easter it's spring so that's good you don't tell the heads yeah how many'd is that so for people new to the channel explain what you're doing what this is this is potato chip bark with all kinds of chocolate of course and then there's patting it down till it gets cold see like right here it's cold now I can knowledge shiny now I don't have to touch it as much anymore now that it's been cold but over here is still a little bit wet so I got to keep touching it so that the cocoa butter keeps mixed will be mixed into the chocolate won't rise to the top if it's a bit warm so that when you do this at home just do it until the chocolate returns like this it's hardened up and then you can let go and always a space an area that is within the roster yeah it must be it's a little thicker here probably yeah we do this home with your kids to make sure you videotape it and send it to us yeah and Melissa you're doing that sneck loans NAT clogs you done snack like before a couple of times right yeah pretzel rods with peanut butter and pull them off in the fridge it goes into the next process which usually your dad is doing Joe you're doing that pantry yep I guess I should go through the girls drop too now we're given a very how long what you doing sugar-free yeah Thank You last bottle sugar-free cannula yeah this is the dark I think it this at eight ounces exactly do you guys do anything other than just the chunks for the no just sucks right now yeah and then there you can we see the token in the Karlin this like that but then I have to double Matt it to make sure that it's there tight at the end yeah sometimes professional both how I just hope that once all messed up a dater three and then this one might need a haircut they're the chinks are cool it down a little more yeah is he dead in the policy most a little bit warm from took you a while to do so I've got a cooler counsel I can go faster yeah and what temperature do you have to temper the Ruby chocolate to now this one I'll do the same 82 agent that seemed the the vegan chocolate vegan chakra can do 85 robust oh yeah now and then this one seems to be about the same as regular chocolate 82 right knowledge they are saving for so it's got the same reaction there's something here telling me they make their own candy as a hobby at home that he got some baby chocolate and he was using a all surprised where he cut yeah yeah I wonder if you can just buy it from Callebaut small mouth yeah I mean took us months would be able to get it yeah well me now hey that recently yeah just dealing yes yesterday or the day before Saturday Sunday we have a lot of people coming maybe now it's more yeah I mean yeah now we can get it all the time yeah yeah is expensive yeah I remember hearing about it before we even moved here yeah then we didn't even get it into like a year after Dean I remember reading about a candy and ice cream magazine for two years before they made it available for everybody was it just cattle bohu you know just cowboy up and the process Volta chalk on everything's a big secret yeah there's won't tell you anything big secret take candy in this way this is cherries and Ruby chocolate and then we're gonna do cherries and almonds and a part - yeah nepeta free and that's better I mean I haven't tried it let's just face off but what a other people said about the refund they they go really well yeah because the Ruby chocolate is kind of I have a touch of fruitiness as it is I was hurt it's that I don't know feels like a large yeah so like three degrees warmer than you want yeah I really can't you gotta be patient yeah it's like you're stacking them otherwise you'll regret it okay yeah a little bit harder per thing to spread out chunks in there I'll just stuff yeah good and cold okay warmer it is flowy it is it's good good work dad proud of you that's net welcome yeah it's net clubs got to do those today - yeah I thought when you do snack clubs they gotta be done the day that they're made right yeah they got to be wrapped up right away cuz a potato chips could go stale if we left on it yeah we don't want to do that as still chips that is all no bueno yeah okay they didn't know I spoke French you got what it was yep first of all we're gonna know this cooled down the chocolate though right yeah serious yep very time we met clusters Knox or raisins are already using close it down how warm do you think it is I think it's 86-82 looks good don't bother taxes I did have a little bit of I always try to leave a little chocolate on there and then add to it so then it cools quicker yeah this is 90 in here yeah then you're mixing 9 deal with like 82 degrees yeah it's all better then it goes down quicker and then the cherries - yep if you dance before I got a sink of these things and you're king when you're King how do you know all these things well you got to know these things right here okay boys vote for you go renegade one day you'll be a professional dad yeah Tocqueville said with false hopes Craig yeah you're wrong and we've been getting worse and worse be Rajan's harasser is life you know rod needs ditch-diggers world needs beer drinking beers I could drink itself yeah I read really dude those people they put all that effort in making it the least you could do is have a few yeah drink some beer yeah relax yeah oh wait I'm not referring oh man I lost count down which one is this this isn't spoon flavored it's a little spoon the secret ingredient spoon just a ladle of it at the inside scoop Wow God fire right of it I can't even keep up don't meddle with me uh I need to get a better handle on this pun tournament [Applause] yeah I want that one I know I know when to call it quits [Music] yeah that's oh no you actually put the confetti in here oh is that the shredded paper yeah well this put more coconut flavor they'll never know yeah I just tastes like paper maybe I did that prayer anywhere I go wait is there actually coconut flavor in there already put it away so but yeah yeah there's just 3/4 of a shot it's a little bit in there nuts [Music] Coco and the get her just look on the membrane or something as it is now I can't think of it will you messing with this it don't you that's loco man and it just says that's crazy man subtitles look you put the subtitles letter that subtitle go of that subscribe pops up no matter why is it it's obsessive joke they should have made more movies I know I was like is that will arnett know the Vortech person way were they both on SNL that's your most of those funny babies going through all right moment of truth here will it drift probably also you doing cream gent in the cream and there with the new girl that acts I'm pretty sure your mom wants cranes no now I gotta go it just says coconut with make sure yeah at this cream I'm so okay cooking cream cream that eggs right I mean if you let's stick with the curry actually not at all so what are you doing mom your tone to get some work done um I was just thinking about makes his mom it would I tell her what I do with my instant pot yesterday but you probably don't to know on this channel no never do you people hate Kade okay skillet potatoes the instant pot you slice your fritters up then you cook them instant pot on high pressure for one minute me cuz with the pressures building that's good and then you take them out with a slotted spoon and you put them your casserole dish and you put your sauce on top of them with your other stuff and you put under the broiler for five minutes it's like things are quick it's life-changing so while the oven was cooking the other stuff I was prepping the taters and I made a nice dinner I've never left work at 5:30 on a Sunday in February ever you know I'm starting coming back together I went home and made a nice dinner for your dad and I he's still happy about it yeah but um I'm getting ready for my taxes okay dinner was way more exciting yeah know what I'm doing in here Ronnie so dad how was dinner last night was awesome Wow it's great what was it it's turkey gravy and tell you those scalloped potato potatoes yeah Oh mom I made the formal pretty gross huh mom made one of the turkey roast yeah great I mean no she didn't no there's no leftovers very convenient last night I was missing spaghetti what's all the ones doing well I decided to just do this one a little early I didn't feel like wait for it to melt it's only 24 hours in the day crack yeah I just got like really loud Karen yeah I really did well I think it's partially like a bunch of people just yeah kara and Sam just walked in they're both walking Melissa and Joe were talking and the TV's on yeah it's just weird what's the type of walking it's like totally silent you know mm-hmm just a friend dad joke and then a string war okay this is probably one of the more difficult kind subtract well fun little factoids for you just for you gotta have you better believe that the proper stance can you go I can go lower let's get back up that's that's the problem that's what happens when you're 28 yeah it's it's really the diapers that's what does it where do you get to oh you know a little bit worse trick things mm-hmm Wow this is what it's like to be me yeah welcome to my life I'm telling you this is the only one like when I first started I'd have to like stop every couple of lines and like shake my hand out cuz you know I'm telling you bad from doing this over and over and over good like gets a little repetitive this is the only one where like it still kinda hurts you want to try you could do the whole next tray no I wouldn't do that to you the coconuts a little tricky it kind of looks the coolest Aneta yeah I like that I don't know it kind of almost reminds me like when you drive through a blizzard with the high beams off hmm yeah and you think it helps and they turn on jack well like that's worse I literally can't see anything I don't like the lights is like reflecting off of snow but it looks super cool yeah you're dangerous and imagine that WS fire hit you or the decisional did you see this spot from Friday that's not the one with Brad in it and they did three spots all right we might see spots I did not see it at all and now this is like night and day with how fast you can go with this risen the eggs uh honestly as soon as you turn the camera off I said we're flying with them yeah you doing any more eggs didn't know where we're doing the raspberry a little early because we'd have a guy what's the order them now and it might get hot by the time you stir comes around so we're just making boy Louie I hope it gets out that time he's jerking around a bit great wasn't it I gotta tell you doing the coconut creams it always makes me think of like suntan lotion mmm-hmm you think of summer all morning and going from here to Ethiopia lived here like man two more months they're gonna be longer than that yeah it really had a super mild water this here you know yeah like usually in February it's like our sub-zero attempts you know what uh well the other day was like what three degrees or something I only saw like a fourteen like eleven fourteen did it get that cold I got in the single digits I'm pretty sure like I wanna walk outside of it oh it's yeah like when you're you're like walking around and like you can like smell freon you know yeah I uh I walked outside of the day and it was like 28 degrees wow this is like nice yeah and it's weird to the lake we'll get used to this like twenty eight thirty and then when it's 40 you'll be ready for shorts but then like you know after all summer August comes around it'll be like 65 and I'll be like oh where are my pants just get so hung over it's free time get used to whatever it is yeah you were the one that told me right you get acclimated to like the heat way quicker than the cold yeah so with the cold your body doesn't really go through any actual changes that's mostly the psychological changes they were like oh I'm just used to this where is like with heat you it takes like three weeks for everybody to fully acclimate to eat so it's a you're like a soccer team and you're going to like a big tournament and it's in a much hotter climate you're gonna want to get there like a month ahead of time otherwise like you know if it's a yeah because it's like physiological changes in there yeah yeah like your your body I forgot exactly the changes because it's been a while since that's like my exercise physiology class but it was some whose would probably like producing more sweat or something or actual changes that are like a measurable and that quick - yeah well I don't know let me know humans are tradition I think like warm weather creatures had a great open base it all came from Ethiopia yeah that's how Lucy and RD when I was in how you see yes that's awesome yeah not a whole lot left of them there's little bits and pieces of their skeletons they're like in a museum somewhere so yeah there's an Ethiopian National Museum a lot of cool stuff there a lot of you guys thing wants to have their Wow that's our experience and grandma is that you all right one more formal now why don't they call her Lucy is their is their plan words or something that goes with it I don't know if they think the reason they called Artie Artie was because their think that the human ancestor whatever was probably the Latin name was are already whatever Archer Pittacus yeah something like that okay mostly I just read that wrong on the lady's opinion thing oh and if it's fresh in your life for that yeah the eggs if there's actually a lot of English in in Ethiopia like everything's like mostly in the marek like their alphabet is much different but there's a lot of like restaurants that have English signs there's like seven lounge there's there's one that was called it looked like it was called Club 7/11 and like it looked like 7-eleven logo did yeah bo but it was bad spelled alveen the seventh oh yes I think that's how they got away with like copyright so me no beans yeah and it's in a wasa a that's awesome yeah how did you guys that hang out there all the time oh we did once did they serve slushies dude that would be like that's the thing yeah but I'm kind of surprising you know there's 7-eleven in Ethiopia cuz yeah so who would II would get the rip I I don't know maybe because a lot of a lot of people seeing like American movies there I've just think it like people from there wouldn't know what 7-eleven is yeah and people from here would be like why would I want to go to club soda low yeah like so I actually saw that and I was like oh could I get like a column card there and that's a club I was like no Walmart and then like we went in there I was like and then like a couple days later I was looking at the picture that took of the sank set that was hilarious I was always said 700 good traveling abroad I've told you you're selling it bad and I sell it often it's a gooseneck love's well over coming weeks yeah maybe every two to three weeks Middle East I are you the designated peanut butter dipper it works for me yeah people are fine Washington thinking won't you just dip it in the chocolate well the reason kids did I got to make sure it's the right temperature still yeah and then you don't want to get to camp butter right yeah say don't you dip it yeah cuz it could come off the chocolate a little warmer than the peanut butter using it right up I don't want to chance it how's that look looks pretty good I would eat it a great great TV show I need that I would eat it mrs. 17:30 just watch what I like ho hey yeah yeah nice keeps walking I would eat that how are you that howdy that not a lot of things I wouldn't eat all you guys been doing snack for oh those back at the house back in the old place the last last couple years before that so I was going in there a year here over a year so like three four years ago I think a viewer mentioned it or something their mom was talking about in something I knows when we started the YouTube panel so we have it have been too long we made three years yeah well actually we did we did these you know without the pants we did that before yeah overly just start getting peanut butter how long have you guys been doing it without the people we do that quite a few years pretzel rods chocolates go he invited all left me everyone leaves yeah it's six o'clock do it we are here yeah you know what else left me but Valentine's candy yeah that's all this love but time you see this video you know what'll be left nothing nothing big zero yes people I don't get too many chances about half-price Hercules candies yeah yeah snap it up there are a lot of regulars who will come in like the day after holidays because they know heck yeah

Celsius turn off the heat add a pinch of salt and 15 grams of butter set aside to cool spread the cold caramel filling on a sheet of parchment paper place a second sheet of parchment paper on top and roll into a half centimeter thick rectangle remove the parchment paper make the chocolate nougat separate 3x we won't be using the egg yolks for this recipe place them in an airtight container and keep in the fridge until ready to use place the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer combine 75 grams of honey 150 grams of glucose syrup 75 milliliters of water and 115 grams of sugar in the saucepan and set over medium heat stirring constantly bring to 130 to 140 degrees Celsius start whipping three egg whites on medium speed in the bowl of a stand mixer until frothy add a pinch of salt turn the speed on too high and gradually add the hot syrup continue whipping for a few minutes until stiff and the nougat reaches room temperature melt 19 grams of chocolate in a bowl over simmering water or in the microwave turn off the mixer add the chocolate and mix gently add 20 grams of cocoa powder and mix gently spread the chocolate nougat over the caramel and set aside for 48 hours to dry after 48 hours place in the freezer for about 20 minutes remove from the freezer and cut into bars of 8 by 2 centimeters place the bars in the freezer to make them easier to work with to cover the Mars with chocolate it has to be tempered first tempering chocolate is the process of melting chocolate and then cooling it down while following specific steps to get the right type of cocoa butter crystals to form chocolate that has been tempered is glossy and has a sharp snap-on tempered chocolate will bloom and develop white spots and streaks in this recipe will temper the chocolate using the seeding method you'll find other than prank techniques on the tricks and tips section on our website videoculinary.com if you don't want to temper chocolate just use compound chocolate which doesn't contain cocoa butter place 300 grams of milk chocolate in a dry bowl set over simmering water and melt stirring gently heat to 41 degrees Celsius the temperature range for this step is 40 to 45 degrees Celsius remove from the heat at about 150 grams of chocolate that has already been tempered a chocolate bar would be perfect for this you could edit in one chunk or in small pieces keep adding chocolate and mixing it in until all of the chocolate has melted stop adding chocolate when it stops melting and remove any unmelted chunks place the bowl over simmering water and heat the chocolate to 29 to 31 degrees Celsius stirring constantly be careful if the temperature climbs above 31 degree Celsius you'll have to start tempering all over again use two forks to dip the Mars bars into the chocolate get the forks against the edge of the bowl to let the excess chocolate drip off place the bars on parchment paper until set you thank you so much for joining us today visit our website

making up some milk chocolate bars from scratch they only involve four ingredients with a twist of three different flavors so let me show you how to make these first up start mixing 113 grams or half a cup of unsalted butter at room temperature followed by half a cup of cocoa another half a cup of milk powder and you can pick this up in just about any grocery store and last but not least a half cup of granulated sugar so you're going to mix this all up until everything is well incorporated little Dave what are you doing there by the way if you haven't already subscribed go ahead and do so that way you'll never miss a video once it's all mixed up go ahead and divide this into three equal sections in the first bowl we're going to mix it up with two tablespoons of walnuts it doesn't have to be walnuts it can be peanuts almonds or accommodation in bullet in bowl number two we're going to add in two tablespoons of rice krispies just for that snap crackle pop and if you're not a fan of this you can use oats or bran but I have a lot of this so I just thought I'd give it a try and in the last bowling that add in a couple of tablespoons of sweetened coconut flakes as I'm mixing here I'm kind of thinking of all the yummy taco bars I'd eaten but I want to know what your favorite is so drop us a line to let us know okay what you want to do next is grab up an ice cube tray I thought this stick thingy ice cube tray in the dollar store I thought it was kind of cool so I'm going to use it but you know you can use a regular ice cube tray if you like for that matter you could use a silicone muffin cup too if you want now what you want to do is put the mixture in and kind of pack it down as best you can and really I don't know why I didn't put the mixture on the left-hand side to make it easier for me I don't look very happy in the shot either all right we're going to slip this in the fridge to chill and this was going to take alight a couple hours after a couple hours removed them from the tray and there you have a guys are simple and easy chocolate milk bars now these are the Rice Krispies so just to give these a try hmm now these are good now for the walnuts mmm I really like these I like the crunchiness of the nuts now for the coconut mmm oh my god these are the best these these ones certainly have my home I mean they're all good but by far I would say the coconut

youtube channel today i'll be making a really amazing sweet treat for you guys they're actually really sexually salty caramel chocolate bars which raw gluten free but most importantly really really tasty so first up let's make that really biscuity base [Music] so as you can see I've just lined this loose bottom and it really does need to be loose bottom rectangular cake tin I'll pop the link below if you want to find one of these online so first up into the blender I'm going to add half a cup of pecan nuts half a cup of macadamia nuts to pop the lid on [Applause] feel free to add a cup of any nut you really like I really like macadamia nuts they got a nice sort of rich flavor and also the pecans just add another nice flavor to so I'm going to get them into this bowl make sure you get every little bit out so next up into this bowl I'm going to add two cups of almond flour or just ground almonds basically that's all they are almonds really helped create that sort of biscuity base that we're trying to get I'm going to add a tablespoon of peanut butter you can use almond butter if you want and this is actually my homemade peanut butter and the recipe for this can be found in my book full of other amazing quick essential recipes like that too next two tablespoons of coconut oil and I also add a pinch of salt now let's give this a good ol mix this can all be done in a blend if you wanted to but I just wanted to show you the sort of texture that I need you to get when making the base oh by the way my book is available to pre-order on Amazon now I didn't mention that before if you just type in vegan 100 or Gaza Oakley into the search bar on Amazon in any country around the world you'll be able to find it I nearly forgot to add a little bit of sweetness I'm adding 3 tablespoons of a gob nectar so when you get it to this texture you can see it starting to combine really well it's now time to get it into our lined loose bottom cake tin so simply just bundle it all in and compact it into the base it's using a spatula you can even bend the spoon if you've got a spoon this is to spare but using a spatula this fine and using your hands as long as they're clean and just so you know this is a 8-inch cake tin you can use it as a baking tray but it's just so much easier using one of these make sure you're pressing down the edges as well keeping everything tucked in nicely this serves well this makes around twelve to fourteen bars so you're going to make a good amount they're really rich you can keep them in the freezer for at least three months so you've got a constant supply of sexy sweet treats I need to stop saying sex once you've got it all level it's time to pop it in the freezer until we've made our caramel to go on top so I'm gonna pop this in now so to make the salted caramel we're going to be using these amazing dates which have been D stoned I'm using medjool dates and I've got 2 cups going into 1 in G cup next I'm going to add 1 cup of almond milk I've got 3 tablespoons of coconut oil 1/2 a cup of just filtered water pinch of Himalayan salt and now let's get this blended up and it'll turn into the most amazing salted caramel blitz it on high for about 1 minute let's see how good this looks oh wow look that golden goodness looks just like caramel looks amazing so I'm gonna give this a little try that is really good but because I'm calling it salted caramel I'm just gonna add a tiny pinch more of salt just give it one more blitz and then we'll get it on top of the biscuit base [Applause] so our biscuit base is mostly chilled and almost set and it's just time to get this amazing caramel on top the go thick that is that's the exact sort of consistency you want the reason why you need the caramel to be this consistency is because it doesn't freeze totally in the freezer because probably gives us a lot of sugar in the dates which is actually a bonus because you know you don't have to wait for it to defrost totally before eating them they're already nice and melted in the center so once you spoon this all over I made sure it's nice and level we want to get this in the freezer and make sure it's in there for at least three hours I'm happy with that so I'm going to pop it in the freezer it's time to get this out of the cake tin and it should just pop out like so it'll pop that on there and I'm going to cut it up into bars and then I'm going to get it back in the freezer whilst I make the chocolate and then we'll drizzle over the chocolate and they'll be ready to serve within half an hour so as you can see I've just been putting my knife in some hot water and that just helps me cut through it so all I want to do is just cut it up into some nice even bars like so just dipping my knife in each time to keep it warm so it just slices through to cut in so nicely and it's really crunchy the biscuit base I can feed it with my knife cut the rest of the bar then cut once through the middle carefully place the bars onto the tray ready to be coated in the chocolate place the tray back into the freezer for 30 minutes or until you've made your chocolate okay guys I've just got these out of the freezer so I'm just gonna put some pecan nuts over the top and as you can see the caramel remains really nice it doesn't go hard in the freezer it's nice and melted basically so you have to work quickly the pecans just add another little crunch another little bit of flavor and they look really nice underneath the chocolate so to make the chocolate all I'm going to do I've got a half a cup of coconut oil which is melted in there and I'm gonna add some raw cacao powder and it's just literally possibly about half a cup of that after really play it by sort of sight and see how it looks and you want to get that nice thick melted chocolate look and for sweetness I will add some maple syrup if you don't have maple syrup decide agave nectar obviously the caramel is really sweet so we're not going to need too much so when there's no lumps just need to add a touch of maple I know just go in with about a tablespoon give that a nice quick stir and that looks really really nice and I'm just gonna pour it over very very gently I actually like it when they're not fully coated it just adds a little bit of a rustic charm to it pour it over and as you can see it's already starting to set look how nice and shiny that is you have to move quite quickly because we've done it to melt the caramel too much I will put the full written recipe on my website and get all the good quantities for the amount of chocolate to make for the full amount of bars I just added the chocolate that was caught by this grease proof paper back into the bowl I'm just going to finally cover these to the best I can you want that nice crunch on the chocolate when they're set it's going to taste amazing so I'm gonna pop those in the freezer about half an hour and then I'll try them for you so guys here's the seven I coated it in the lovely chocolate you'll hear that crunch first look at this oh wow and look inside the car melted that is pill that I just love the shape of the pecan nut there let me give this a try mmm now it's really really good really really really good I think the only way I can really show the cameras how good these look just by cutting them open and holding them a few look come on guys come and have a look over those [Music] [Music] these just look so good I've just got to send the snatcher if you follow me on snapchat you will be seeing this right well then but my snapchat is at a Maga

near new series today's video is on Georgia you guys seem to love me making this series so I just keep continuing and yes eventually I will get through every single state and then I'm going to move on to different parts of the world so don't worry if you're not in the States I will still get to you and by the way if you would like to win this new background behind me all you have to do is be subscribed to this channel so my destiny channel turn audio notification valve and then head over to my Instagram page follow me there and DM me your favorite color in emojis that make sense so it can be any emoji that you have as long as it's your favorite color alright guys so let's get into some urban legends and haunted places in Georgia the first place is Nicky Jack Creek Bridge this covered bridge is located in Smyrna it is supposedly surrounded by what people call the water cuts so the water heads are basically children that have drowned in this Creek underneath the bridge and the legend goes that if you park on the bridge and turn off your car and put a Snickers bar on top of your car the kids will scramble in the car to take the Snickers bar so literally you'd go out by this bridge you take your Snickers bar put it on the roof of your car and that will literally attract all of these children ghosts because I guess they just want candy and chocolate and so that's like a tradition for people to do there but during my research I found that a lot of people actually take chocolate bars with them to old bridges to attract any ghosts that have drowned there and it's such a bizarre thing that a ghost would be like attracted to chocolate but apparently people have doing this for a very long time and I know there's a lot of old scary bridges near my house and now I kinda want to go do this but I feel like it would just look so weird like anybody that was walking past me as I held up this chocolate bar like Pecos is coming at it they would think I was just like so strange they might call cops but yeah chocolate bars and ghosts apparently they just go together like pot all right next we have the four mountain haunting a young man visited Fort Mountain in Georgia and asked his friend to take a picture of him now legend has it that the friend took the picture but as soon as he looked at it he screamed and fainted and then died imagine your friend taking a picture of you and then looking at what it is and like passing out I first thought would be that I looked like super ugly and it or something but basically what the picture showed was this guy standing there looking normal just smiling but behind him was this ghostly figure of a woman who was just staring at the camera now I wasn't able to find the actual photo of this anywhere on the internet so I don't know this is just a legend that was made up or if they literally had to like remove this photo from the Internet so no one else would be like affected by it so if I didn't knows we're gonna find this actual picture please let me know but it's such a creepy thought I would never want to take a picture of my friend and see like a ghost standing next to them alright next we have the Gracie Watson statue I have briefly mentioned this on my channel before but I just want to bring it up again because it is a very haunted spot in Georgia the legend of Gracie Watson was a little girl that died of pneumonia at the age of six and now he loves the statue that was made in her honor people often go here and feel some very strange vibes coming from this statue and they often leave little cute trinkets by her feet kind of just like gifts to honor her and some say that if people move the trinkets they can hear the girl cry and that's time to statue even cries blood so if anyone goes there and tries to steal any of the gifts from under her feet she will literally cry the statue will cry and then we have the statue of Mary Maynard Mary Maynard and her family are said to have lived in a large house near the Marion at a National Cemetery in the 1800s one tragic day Mary hurt her children crying on the upstairs floor when she got up there she realized that the house was on fire and by the time she grabbed her two kids it was too late she could not get out of the house so tragically the three of them passed away and they made this statue in their honor legend has it that this statue actually weeps for her infant twins and the tears are so real that they roll down her face and damp in the bodice of her gown so this is also a very tragic story and there's so many statues around the world that are said to be haunted because the people died so tragically all right next we have the Fannin County ferry crosses those in search of a natural good-luck charm and make their way to Blue Ridge where outdoor enthusiasts often stumble across what's called ferry crosses now these ferry crosses are stones that form what looked to be perfect crosses and these are completely real and their scientific name is story lights people say they're set to bring health protection and fortune and ferry crosses are found in very few locations around the globe and Fannin County is one of the very popular places that these can be found so people go and take one and like keep it in their pocket all the time or keep it in their purse all the time it's said to just bring very good luck in some legends people say that the stones are created from fairy or angel tears I feel like these rocks would be so cool to find and keep all right so next the legend of Bigfoot I know you guys all know what Bigfoot is basically every state in the nation has a Bigfoot legend and Georgia is no exception Bigfoot is said to be a hairy upright walking ape-like creature that dwells at the wilderness and leaves footprints behind he's always just been this mysterious huge creature that wanders forests and in 1997 a giant footprint was found along Elkins Creek in Pike County the cast taken of the footprint is one of the most popular footprints ever found of Bigfoot and people think this truly shows that Bigfoot does really exist because no other animal could possibly make this footprint and Georgia has a museum dedicated entirely to one of the most famous legendary beasts in North America and I think this is one of the biggest big for museums in the entire world if I'm not mistaken all right next we have the Kennesaw house built in the 1840s this building was used as a hospital during the Civil War it is believed to be home to nearly 700 spirits this is absolutely crazy to me the fact that a building could have 700 spirits oh my goodness now there's a very scary report about these guests going to visit this building and when they went into the elevator it unexpectedly took them down to the basement and that is not what this elevator is supposed to do it's supposed to take us upwards so these people are standing in this elevator it starts to go down imagine how scary that would be and when they get to the basement the doors of the elevator open and all the people saw these ghostly soldiers lying in hospital beds they even said they saw this ghostly surgeon walking around between all these people and then quickly the doors of the elevator closed and went back to the main floor and when these guests went to complain about what and the staff in the building said no it shouldn't go down to the basement another story told by a young schoolgirl who was on a field trip to the museum said she saw a woman and a light blue dress the woman smiled at her and then disappeared so this little girl went up to the staff of the museum and said hey I just saw this person in a blue dress and so the staff asks a little girl to describe the face of this woman what her hair was like and they discovered that what this little girl saw was actually the original owner of the Kennesaw house so I feel like that would be so scary to find out and I mean it's so common for little kids to see people that have passed away I've got entire videos on that subject so it's very common for little kids to go to historical buildings and actually see the original owners walking around I know that one of my cousin's when they were little they moved into a very old house and immediately my younger cousin started to see these creepy people walking around it's pretty scary that's for sure anyways so guys those are all of the haunted places in Georgia that we're going to be talking about today obviously there are so many more if I missed any really good ones definitely tell me down below and if you want me to continue doing this series definitely give this video a thumbs up and let me know but I hope you guys have an awesome rest of your day and I will see you in my next video [Music]", "6ezkCrV9YYc": "[Music] it's no secret I love all things Oreo and cookies and cream so when I found out that Milkha and Oreo came out with the Oreo chocolate bar I knew I had to get my hands on one well while these are available in over 20 countries internationally they're barely making the way to US stores which means it's about dang time we just made our own right so I'm just going to prep my loaf pan with parchment paper and then pour 1 cup of melted milk chocolate into the bottom of the pan place it in the freezer to set and then just pour 1/2 cup of white chocolate over the milk chocolate layer and put it back in the freezer now I know that's a lot of pouring and freezing and pouring and freezing but it's totally worth it to get those perfect layers next we're going to pulverize our Oreos in a food processor and then add in our cream cheese [Music] spread this out in an even layer over the white chocolate and press down so there's no gaps pour another half cup of white chocolate on top return it to the freezer and then one more cup of milk chocolate and then back to the freezer I am so excited [Music] oh my God look how amazing this is all those fun chocolatey layers it's so pretty mmm I could eat it right now as is but I think it needs one more chocolate coating next I'm going to place this on a wire rack and we're gonna pour chocolate all over it giving it an even coating so it looks just like a candy bar now let that freeze one last time [Music] hmm see that little trouble squirts a little bit mmm this chocolate bar is making me so happy right now I mean it's really all about the truffle but I love how creamy the milk chocolate is the snap from the white chocolate hon it's the perfect size just per me this is so good I don't need those other bars Oh guys I cannot wait for you to make this at home you're gonna love it and let me know if you have any other suggestions for other candies or chocolate bars you want me to make let me know in the comment box below and if you make this bar post on instagram tag me and use the hashtag Etha trend I'm Randy and I'll see you next time so happy [Music]", "iBoLmf105lQ": "[Music] hi friends it's Carolyn again coming at you today with another taste test video so today's product is a chocolate bar from a company called hue it says in the back hue as a human I got this chocolate set from my older sister at a birthday present last month and I've been patiently holding off until I could record a little review here on YouTube a little bit about the brand on the back it says hue as in human it's time to get back to the way humans ate before industry refined food they're organic they are vegan so no dairy no no soy liftin which I like I like to avoid soy when I can no GMOs no and multipliers gluten-free no refined sugar no cane sugar no sugar alcohols so what is the sweeter organic Fairtrade cacao unrefined organic coconut sugar and organic fair trade cocoa butter so I do like coconut sugar it has a lower glycemic interest lower glycemic index number so that just means it doesn't make your blood sugar spike as high as other sugars still as sugar though it looks like half of the bar has 170 calories and 40% of your daily saturated fat but keep in mind that is coming from cook up not from you know animal products or something like that and saturated fat isn't bad okay so let's dive into it so I did break into this one flavor the crunchy banana choco bar and it got me actually more excited to do this sweets test blind taste test because it didn't actually taste very banana II to me it wasn't as crunchy as I would have thought either the bananas itself actually just tasted if they were drive bananas and had some air in them but anyway I wouldn't have guessed it was crunchy banana had I not seen the front of the label so this is gonna be interesting there are eight bars here and I flipped over six of them I'm not going to taste to the simple chocolate bar on camera because it's just their chocolate without any toppings in it and I need a safe room in my stomach for the six other flavors but I don't know what flavors these are I haven't looked at them in almost a month now they've been sitting in my fridge refrigerator so it is kind of blind and I'm gonna be guessing what the flavor is and then describe it and expose the label to you all after that well let's get into it so this is what it looks like it just comes with let's see ten squares and in a plastic case these outside covers are very much like a paper bag from a grocery store so I don't see any visible toppings on this bar oh there's something inside mmm so something fling me inside oh man what is that oh I have no idea it's very creamy and smooth on the inside it reminds me of I used to work at this candy shop in high school Club Hebert's in Shrewsbury Massachusetts and they would have that these cream layers and they inside some of their bars and each pod has it had its own little pocket cream I have no idea what the flavor is though okay it tastes like it tastes like coffee espresso so I'm gonna call it like coffee cream it's not crazy some crazy coffee flavor love it I know what coffee dates like sometimes I'll have coffee and it doesn't taste like coffee exactly but he's espresso II kind of like a toffee so is it espresso toffee not even okay so this one's called hazelnut praline [Music] hazelnut praline so maybe that easel nut was a talk although the praline was probably the talking flavor but it Hazen that was maybe giving me that chocolatey sense like tell again I wouldn't have known that was he has denied yeah the second ingredient is hazelnut and there's no sort of like praline ingredients just cacao he has a lot coconut or cocoa butter and all of it is organic weird so if you don't love hazelnut still might be a part of it he's like okay here's another one again no visible sign of a topping I'm just having one square per bar and that's so good I mean of having a six squared which is more than half a bar so Oh crunchy topping toffee is just like topping No okay the chocolate is so good that chocolate around it is really really good so much so that's like how does dominate the flavor and then whatever the bar is whatever the flavor says it's actually just a suggestion so it is crunchy - puffed quinoa this one is almond butter puffed quinoa it doesn't taste super almondy I love almond butter I have it and I eat almonds probably every day the puff quinoa is like a little crunch just like a crunch bar would be a puffed rice I don't really teach um buttercup there's chocolate really good [Music] really good okay I'm gonna but our pets quinoa this one's more up my alley because of the crunch Dan the hazelnut one so let me order them as I go alright third six okay so again no visible I stay invisible topping because the banana one was visible you just like see little air dried okay this one tastes like butterscotch oh man how are you feeling sugar high okay I'm not very good at this game apparently because again I'm not getting it right still isn't able to describe the actual sensation before looking at the knees this one tastes like butterscotch e toffee again to me there is a filling and this like the others this one is a screaming the most preeminent creamy feeling was a hazelnut praline this one you can see the filling but it's not super thick the flavor of this one is cashew butter and pure vanilla bean but comes across as like butterscotch toffee not bad I put that plate that's one us third though because it tastes very choppy either it's a little bit of like extra sugar in this feeling in this may be just the vanilla bringing out the flavor but there's no third rank so far I realize the only better team up because the pop the handle not praline I liked the creaminess [Music] when I pass you butter one I love cashews as well and I don't taste a cheese in that oh man guys by the end of this video but beyond such a sugar high alright our number four Oh minty mint there's no cream inside this is like a solid bar and she's like mint yeah yeah yeah I got one right crunchy mint where's the punch though that half a square bite to not have crunch in it oh I just got one pop of crunch in like whole square what is the pop French cacao news and it's just peppermint oil is the last ingredient so that's why I applied doesn't happen are you feeling it's just an oil extract peppermint oil I like this one a lot my mama baked this one second place for flavor again pops quinoa hits the top I like that extra crunch so much texture the flavor of this one is really good I love mint and chocolate I love with one squareness with a cup of mint tea next to the Christmas tree and I am a happy lady the hazelnut friend leaves feel still favorite number three because of the creaminess of that inside okay only to go oh man well there's something on the outside that's Bart so you can see a little bit of a topping on this bar or if it gets to at all it just couldn't looks like it has crystals on it maybe it's coconut though I know my candies and I haven't seen coconut period but with salt to sprinkle the thorns yeah salty mm okay I know likes Wonka's my Peter dancing Sophie sweet is my thing a pretzel in chocolate is where it's at I'm like trying to eat the whole piece because I can already feel the sugar in my stomach the chocolates like anybody's coming not the best of you Marilyn this one is hopping to the front because I would order this on the Reg that salty sweet again all these are so good just one piece would do you in if you have one of these bars and I'm not sure not sure what that cost I will try to insert it here because I didn't buy this for myself I've got it as a gift so I don't know what the cost is on these bars but if you buy one of these bars just one single square we'll take off that edge of I need chocolate at the end of the meal kind of feeling if you fail me and I would get that salty one on the regular all right last flavor whoa you can see what this bar is cuz of the toppings to me that's almond fig I'm gonna try it one of the squares it has baked on it it's out of these big awesomer just buy dried big Whole Foods and dip them in almond butter and one dried fig digital and butter is so I got a piece has a little chunk of fake on and have that corner oh yeah whoa what the fit flavor isn't very strong but that texture of a chunk of fig on a really rich piece of chocolate texture mixed it is very good because there's chocolate again really rich really thick creamy so having that bite of a chewy fig with the seeds that kind of pop in your mouth is a really nice pair I'm not gonna finish this he's chocolate though cuz I am overdosing so it's called crunchy fig I don't call this almond fig because there's a whole pieces of almond you would have to look at the ingredients to see that there is almond huh Oh where do I put this one in the lineup I like a texture buffet but I think I'm putting it toward the end after even the texture that hazelnut praline that first one that I tried it was really creamy let me show you guys what the order is and my favorite to least favorite but they're all really good even that last one which is the cashew butter I would have again and again so these are all good don't get me wrong I hope you found this fun if you're a chocolate lover too let me know and tell me about any other brands that you know that are dairy-free I like to support

"1XUeSYHec30": "Welcome to How To Cook That\nI am Ann Reardon today I am really excited about this video I am going to show you how\nto make chocolate all the way from the cocoa beans to the bar. Now if you can't get hold\nof cocoa beans I'll also show you how to make it using cocoa powder as well. If you want to make it using the beans the\nfirst thing you'll need to do is buy some cocoa beans. And you can buy them raw like\nthese ones that I bought while I was in Mexico. And beans from around the world have all different\nflavours - most the chocolate that you have tasted will have bean from one variety of\ncoca bean only. There are so many different chocolate flavours so make sure you source\nsome cocoa beans from different places around the world. When the beans are raw like this they have\na reddish tinge, they are firm, you can't break the shell off them.\nSo the first thing we need to roast the beans. Spread them out in a single layer onto a lined\nbaking tray. Look through and take out any that are shriveled or don't look good.\nAnd we want to get rid of those and keep the good looking ones. Roasting them brings out\nthe chocolate flavour and smell but it also releases the shell from the bean so we can\nget it off. The easiest way for you to buy a small quantity\nof cocoa beams is to buy from a bean to bar chocolate maker and I'll put a list on this\nweeks blog post on howtocookthat.net of some from all around the world for you.\nPreheat your oven to 54C or 130F and then put the beans in and immediately turn the\nheat up to 121c or 250F Put your timer on for exactly 15 minutes.\nOnce the timer goes I want you to turn the oven back down to 50C or 120F and open the\noven door for a minute to let it rapidly cool down. Then close the door and leave them in\nthere for another 12 minutes. Now they should be done take them out of the\noven and let them cool for 5 minutes. You can also buy beans that are already roasted\n- like these ones I got from a chocolate maker in Australia, these beans were grown in Somalia\nand they have a completely different taste to the mexican ones. Step 2. You need to remove the shell now,\nyou can do this by hand which I think for small quantities like this I definitely the\neasiest way. Gently twist the bean and then remove the shell bits. The other way you can do this is the crush\nthe beans using a rolling pin. then tip them onto a tray or a bowl and gently blow with\na hairdryer to remove the lighter shells. I found that method messy and not as effective\nas doing it by hand. I also found the shells on the freshly roasted\nbeans were much easier to remove than the ones on the beans that I bought already roasted.\nSo if you can source the raw cocoa beans and roast them yourself. Then you'll be left with a pile of thin shells\nand a bowl of cocoa nibs. You can also buy cocoa nibs from the shops\nif you've bought them like that is they say they are raw then you just need to spread\nthem on a tray and roast them for 10 minutes at 100C or 212 f these coca nibs are from\nperu, these ones so we are going to make three different chocolates. Step 3 is to mill your beans and make them\nfiner. I am using a blender for these ones. - unless you're filming keep the lid on or\nyou'll get cocoa bean bits all over your bench. Once it is reasonably fine tip it into a bowl\nand microwave for about 30 seconds. This is going to start to melt the cooca butter that\nis in the beans Cocoa beans are about 50% cocoa butter. Tip that back into the blender\nand add your powdered sugar. This needs to be pure icing sugar with no added cornstarch.\nIf you can't find that use normal white sugar instead and blend that first on it's own to\nbreak it down into a powder. Next step is grinding. Now all I have is a\nmortar and pestle so my chocolate is not going to be any where near as smooth as chocolate\nyou buy in the shops. You can buy a chocolate grinder which has turning stone wheel that\nyou leave that on for several hours to break down the chocolate particle size. Commercial\nchocolate factories use big steal rollers to crush it down to a tiny 20 microns - To\ngive you an idea of just how small that is, it needs to be about half the size of your\npowdered sugar or icing sugar. But that tiny particle size in your chocolate is what makes\nit feel so smooth in the mouth and also makes it taste creamier because those chocolate\nparticles can get right in where your taste buds are on your tongue. So keep grinding until your arm hurts knowing\nthat you are not get it as fine as it is in the shops. The more you crush it you'll notice the moister\nit becomes as you release more of the cocoa butter from the bean. If you had a chocolate\ngrinder eventually it will become liquid on it's own. But because we don't we need to\nadd some extra cocoa butter - just melt it in the microwave and pour it in. Then grind\nsome more and you've got chocolate. At this point the commercial chocolate is\nthen conched - which means it is stirred while it is warm and melted, sometimes they conch\nit for days at a time just to get rid of any acidy flavours to it. We don't have a conching machine, I'm not\ngoing to stand here and stir it for three days so all we are going to temper it and\npour into our molds. I have a video explaining all the different ways that you can temper\nat home. My favourite is using the freeze dried cocoa powder and I'll show you that\nin the tempering video. Tempering makes the cocoa butter set firm at room temperature\ninstead of being soft. Leave that bar at room temperature to set. Once it is ready tip it\nout of the mold and you've got a bar of home make dark chocolate. Now because you are making it yourself you\ncan vary the recipe for the next block I am using cocoa nibs, cocoa butter, cocoa powder.\nCocoa nibs made of cocoa butter and cocoa powder or rather cocoa powder comes from them\nbut by adding them separately you can change the proportions in you chocolate. We are also\nusing icing sugar and the seeds from a vanilla bean. These proportions are about the same as you'll\nfind in a lindt 80% dark chocolate bar. I'll put all the weights for this on the howtocookthat.net\nwebsite for you. Put it all into blender or a food processor\nand blend until it is fine. Then warm up those crumbs up in the microwave and you'll get\na liquid - blend that for a couple of minutes to get it as smooth as you can and then temper\nit and mold it. And you've got your very dark chocolate. For milk chocolate you will need cocoa nibs,\ncocoa butter, sugar and milk powder. Blend it up, then grind it some more and mold it.\nIn my opinion the milk chocolate really needs a proper chocolate grinder. But they cost\nbetween 300 and 800 dollars so if you're just doing it to have a go at making your won don't\nbother investing in that expense. Now if you can't get cocoa beans they are\nmade up as I said of about 50% cocoa powder and 50% cocoa butter so you can swap out in\nany of these recipes. Just melt your cocoa butter and mix in the icing sugar and cocoa\npowder. Remember even this will not be as smooth as your brought chocolate because the\npowders have about double the particle size you're used to when you buy commercial chocolate.\nSo which one tastes the best? We have milk chocolate , mexican dark chocolate and peruvian\nextra dark. I really like the mexican chocolate. It has more of a nutty flavour to it than\nthe other beans do. The milk is of course the sweetest and I think\nit illustrates the particle sizes well because you can see the little dots of cocoa bean\nso they don't have the smoothness of store bought chocolate. Definitely give it a go making your own at\nhome and get a couple of different types of beans so that you can see the different flavours\nthey have.

by researchers this thing could take heat in excess of a hundred degrees Fahrenheit or sixty degrees Celsius and during Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm Hershey's chocolate was the major manufacturer shipping 144,000 these things after American troops and they were used also in the Southwest Asian theater all right so like army spokesman said the bar you know taste was pretty good troops reactions were mixed and the bar was not put into full production and since the war ended before Hershey supplies of the experimental bar was shipped the remainder of the production run was packaged in a desert camo wrapper like this one and it was dubbed the desert bar it proved a brief novelty but her she declined to make more after the supplies ran out so this thing didn't take off probably tasted awful and we're gonna see what it looks like and we're gonna try it out let's check this thing out and God already looking pretty gnarly ooh all right it's definitely oxidized let's check this thing out gosh it's just like Hershey's tropical chocolate from like forties fifties sixties seventies smalls all right hmm hmm that's not too bad it's not very great either I'll say that this chalky it's dry it tastes like some old Hershey's chocolate slightly bitter it's definitely some milk chocolate I mean it's not the worst thing in the world it crumbles in your mouth when you chew it I mean it's not rancid Singh was made and you know probably like the early 90s like maybe 1990 something like that since the thing says it could take Heat an excess of 140 degrees Fahrenheit let's put it in the oven about 150 and leave it in there for you know heck how about ten minutes all right all right I just pulled that out of the oven it was actually in there for about 20 minutes and check out how it looks fresh now you know like looks looks pretty decent and nice and warm has a real fudge appearance to it you know I know it's on a plate but just came out of the oven man um looks pretty decent let's check it out that's good when you warm it up hmm let's taste like fudge mmm still a little crumbly but I really enjoy this was like seriously good mmm I had no idea the Hershey's desert bar would actually be enjoyable all right now here's one that was in the oven for like man I kind of forgot about it it was in there for like 30 minutes at 250 degrees and yeah I see it doesn't hold up that well it turns the like a weird whoa like this layer at the top of it man that's hot - mmm we're not to let that kind of cool off a little bit but you can see it like turn into a weird brownie almost it's like hot fudge brownie fun that just tastes like a weird budge brownie yeah like yeah yeah dude Hershey's desert bar at like 250 degrees which is like impossible to reach at temperatures anywhere on the planet I believe so unless you're like dipping and some like lava pool or something which is way worse but yeah yeah saying like listen can would stand something it would have turned into totally melted chocolate like I mean it still maintain some form it like turns into weird fudge it's like totally different with it actually looks decent doesn't it man I'm gonna eat every little bit of that all right so like here's a piece that's the same stuff man like that's crazy what I'm travel by this ah all right this last piece we microwave for 90 seconds straight and look at it just it looks like decent chocolate it's not like oxidized or anything anymore and let's give it a shot and see what's taste like mmm that tastes like fresh Hershey's chocolate as a matter of fact that actually tastes better than modern Hershey's chocolate I don't even know how Hershey's desert bar menacing holds up to eat like they say I don't know why they stopped making it mmm look it holds up I mean it's not like it melts like normal chocolate - thumbs up for Hershey's desert bar I thought this thing was even gonna be edible that's crazy all right Steve 1989 now if Emory infocom hope you liked this weird little one I know it's not the usual thing but they did put them in rations and you saw that no stock photos at the beginning of the video so anyway yeah cool see ya you", "b6c_NIyrvNI": "[Music] hi I'm Marc summers welcome to unwrapped candy it is a staple in American pop culture over ready for this 14 billion dollars worth is purchased each year and undoubtedly candy bars make up a huge bite of that profit and a preference for candy bars really isn't something new their history goes back more than a century and a major part of that history is the name that definitely put some sweet into the American tooth it's got to be Hershey shake rattle and roll welcome to the Hershey factory in Hershey Pennsylvania birthplace to billions of bars at the Hershey plant here in Hershey Pennsylvania we produce well over one and a half billion pounds of chocolate the candy bar the factory that town all are named for Milton Hershey chocolatier extraordinaire Hershey was born near well Hershey Pennsylvania in 1857 and went into the candy business at age 18 but the sweet taste of success didn't come easy in 1876 for the Centennial he went to Philadelphia started his own company that company failed he went on to build and start three more companies all of which failed Hershey's confection companies finally stop failing around 1900 when he started to make a popular line of chocolate syrups and candies and his premier product was the simple but scrumptious Hershey bar today Milton's namesake is still almost the exact recipe he came up with in the late 1890s a mix of cocoa beans sugar and milk but don't be fooled making it is still a major production so while it seems like a very simple product and anyone can make chocolate it's really very hard very challenging there's a lot of science and technology in there here in chocolate land Science and Technology means enough gizmos digits and gadgets to make Willy Wonka weep big blades first mix the dry blend of cocoa and sugar called crumb then huge mixtures called conscious roll up and stir the chocolate for up to three days then the chocolate paste is squirted into molds pass through tunnels cooled down and wrapped up at one time we received the bean till it's wrapped putting it to wrapper and on its way out the door can be a four to seven days so what's the secret to getting the bars shaped just right we shake that bar to evenly distribute it in the mold so when it's cooled it comes out as a square bar but it's during this dangerous trip down shakedown street that many good bars go bad unfilled corners air bubbles broken edges all will disqualify a bar from making it to the wrappers and cause them to be picked off by the eagle-eyed inspectors and the Hershey bar has to be perfect when you look at it we like a perfect look perfect feel so why do Hershey bars come in that flat rectangle shape like I've never been asked that question in 15 years okay okay so there may not be an answer to how this candy began as a bar but whatever the reason the recognizable rectangle is here to stay rectangle is a shape everybody's comfortable with it's easy to make it's easy to mold and manufacture the shape may be simple but there is a mystery that surrounds this chocolate bar that well known oh so familiar what color is it brown brown brown brown and why and so close but not quite the chocolate may be brown but Mike says the rapper's maroon and silver and always has been the maroon and silver that is used on the Hershey bar rapper has been fairly consistent since 1900 mike says consistency is actually the most difficult part of making those billions of bars if grandma opens a candy bar she wants to taste that Hershey flavor she had as a kid after all a lot of things have changed in the last 100 years but a chocolate bar is always in good taste you", "buiNFpUas_w": "are you here to help are you here to eat my food and I'm not looking your cuteness does not disguise the suspicion I have of your motives [Music] good afternoon lovely people of the internet and welcome back to the best place to watch videos that isn't pornhub today I am very excited it's a little bit late in the afternoon like it's kind of evening so if the lighting starts getting really dark and I just kind of disappear into this white ball you know what it's probably for the best today I am very excited because we are reviewing some chocolate bars that I have coveted for quite a while now but I've never been able to find them in the Scott in the Scotland I've never been able to find them in Scotland until now we're talking about Tony's chocolate money in all of its many shapes sizes and colors so Tony's choc alone Lee is a Dutch company that makes gorgeous kind of Belgian style chocolate I believe a very European affair which we love these bars aren't enormous they are so appealing to the kind of child in you with all of the colours and giant fonts and things like that and I have seen and heard great things about these chocolate bars so I'm really excited to have my hands on these and taste them with you guys today so I picked up these four bars in my local Sainsbury's store I believe that might be the only place in the UK that's stalking them at the moment so I won't lie these bars weren't a little bit expensive but they were two times 75 each but they are huge huge bars like big thick with two C's kind of think we're talking like 180 grams per bar so that's almost double the weight and thickness of your regular kind of supermarket chocolate bar we have Tony's milk chocolate we have Tony's milk chocolate with pretzels and toffee girl we have Tony's milk chocolate with caramel and sea salt and we have Tony's dark chocolate for the discerning adults among us so it only feels right to start with the regular classic milk chocolate so as I said this is just the classic milk chocolate bar made with sugar whole milk cocoa butter cocoa mass and an emulsifier nice to see you palm oil or vegetable oil fillers in here which again could explain rate study pricier but also hopefully a better yes it is beautiful look at that look at it it's a gorgeous bar like the effort they have gone to with that is so cool it's a really sexy enticing funky chocolate bar and we're all about sexy funky sexy yeah we're all about those things on this channel so thick nice and shiny as well actually a lot of conventional milk chocolate isn't tempered very well so it can look kind of dull or chalky this looks like has a nice shine to it as I said nice and thick let's see if Tony's chocolate is any good a big mouthful holy guys it's you know unsurprisingly great as expected sweet creamy and just it's a proper classic milk chocolate it's creamy without being too kind of waxy it's sweet without making you feel kind of too nauseous there is definitely a sweet milk chocolate it's also a 32 percent cocoa bar which is even though only marginally higher than most regular milk chocolates still noticeably higher in taste obviously a bar of milk chocolate is never gonna be the most mind-blowing thing but if we're just ranking it in terms of a plain milk chocolate it's sweet it's sexy its chocolaty it's everything I wanted from a milk chocolate bar it's a 5 out of 5 I think I'm going to move on to this milk chocolate with pretzels and toffee next because basically I'm just embarassingly excited about it so again just a regular kind of milk chocolate in here but we also have 7% pretzel crumbs on 2.7 percent caramel pieces and some sea salt the chocolate the pretzels only being around kind of nine point seven percent of the bar hopefully that means we'll actually be able to taste them so I actually misread this slightly this is a slightly darker milk chocolate this is a 42 percent cocoa bar instead of the 32% cocoa we just had a minute ago so this bar is whoa noticeably darker we can see from the underside that we've got a whole load of thick chunky in this thick chunky bar and it looks with this accidental snapped off piece that even though we're only talking about nine point seven percent of bits inside that those nine point seven percent are quite visible so we've got a good kind of ratio of chocolate to pretzel to toffee and sea salt and everybody which we like so let's stop talking and eat it oh wow that is genuinely some of the best quality milk chocolate I've tasted from a brand isn't like super posh that is incredible so obviously this one is much less sweet then they kind of plain milk chocolate because it has that kind of richness and mild bitterness that comes from good cocoa and a higher percentage of that cocoa the tiny amount of sea salt of those pretzels give a gorgeous crunch to this and you get a little tiny amount of that kind of sweet toffee taste that kind of runs off the bitterness of the cocoa I think personally I could have done with a bit more kind of chunky bits in there but you certainly get the toffee pretzels sea salt effect which I was kind of scared we wouldn't get because it was such a low percentage of it compared to the chocolate but you do get a proper kind of little savory note from those pretzels in there and it's just it's good again the texture of the chocolate is good it tastes good I am very happy again with this bar so I am going to quite happily again give this one a five out of five okay we have two flavors of Toni's chocolate chocolate left to taste let's give this milk chocolate caramel and sea salt bar a taste so this bar has 10 percent caramel and 0.5 percent sea salt so hopefully will actually detect some of that sea salt in there each one of these bars is like opening up a Christmas present it's so satisfying so we welcome ourselves back to the world of slightly creamier milk chocolate again super sexy bar yes I'm going to mention every time so with this one you can immediately smell that there's some kind of toffee or caramel in there you can smell a kind of sweetness okay so you can see or you might be able to see the slightest little kind of chunk of caramel at the bottom there let's get a taste this one's good but it's not quite perfect again at the chocolate is gorgeous it's thick its creamy its sweet you get a good cocoa taste from it going down the kind of salted caramel root personally I could have done with a bit more sea salt in here because it would have just balance out that sweetness and even the caramel and though it is detectable and this part is definitely distinguishable from the first bar I think we do need a bit more of that caramel taste I don't know if we need it actually blended into the chocolate like brands like Hotel Chocolat do or if we need just more kind of small shards of that caramel in there to make this a salted caramel expedience and not just a milk chocolate bad experience if that makes sense so yeah this one though obviously good obviously gorgeous and very little wrong with it not quite as good as the other two so I'm gonna give this one a 4 out of 5 so let's move on to the final flavor of Tony's chocolate only chocolate still water you by the way I'm not like eating these entire bars in one sitting yet and so this last bar in its gorgeous green wrapping is a 51% dark chocolate almond sea salt bar so this is darker than all of the other chocolates we've tasted so far today by kind of an extra 9% so definitely a noticeable amount and this one has 10% almonds and again 0.5% sea salt oh okay and for some reason instead of these silver wrapper that all of the others have been this one is in gold dropper I wonder if that's because it's a certain kind of yeah or just because they kind of got bored silver major major strong cocoa smell from this so typically your kind of classic dark chocolate bars are around 70% so obviously this is less dark than a typical dark chocolate bar at only 51% but it is dark it smells dark I'm very excited so again with this bar you can see from all these kind of lumps bumps and bubbles on the back that we're gonna have some little chunks of those almonds in here so we can see when we snap off a big chunk of this bar that there are proper chunky boy almonds in here I'm excited let's taste it I need to know if Toni's single because I'm happy to be made a wife oh my god right this chocolate is amazing granted like in the other bars I personally would have maybe like slightly thicker kind of chunks of almond in there but you certainly get the flavor and the texture when you bite in and the sea salt is much more noticeable in this bar than it was in there kind of sea salt caramel one there's a lot less sugar in this bar so even though it is obviously very rich because of the kind of cocoa content and just how thick it is it's much less kind of sickly sweet this is basically one of my favorite flavor combinations though so obviously I was going to love this bar but seriously dark chocolate almond sea salt I can't give this bar anything other than another five out of five I'm in love I'm actually really pleasantly surprised a lot of the time when we get kind of big hyped up chocolate products in this country or we import foreign chocolates like American things they kind kind of just be expensive trash and even though I myself fall into the category of expensive trash that doesn't mean I want my chocolate to be that way I love the packaging I love the shape of the bar I love the texture of it another taste I don't love the price but for the size of this bar and the quality and being important it's justifiable if you have ever tasted Tony's chocolate only or if you are Dutch if you've been to the Netherlands and you've tasted this stuff or you've tasted different flavors let me know this might be my new favorite chocolate brand of the moment so I'm very excited to see and learn more about it if you enjoyed this video don't forget to drop it a

and and then we'll be back to the blind taste test this I guess I could have shown you these before I broke them all the pieces but number one is this one and that would make number two this one so here we go in number one okay here is number one okay elmo's very crunchy was good though butter yeah when you're ready forever hey I'm good are you ready no kind of pace like all right you know hmm I know which one I like better okay don't uncover stay covered Andrew you tell me first which one did you like better the second one which was why I can guess what it was okay you owe me - yeah list I think the second one was the heath walk okay what do you think everyone's night I've never you're right and I like the versatile burger I like the second I like that I hate them both of course I wasn't covered up I had above I like the scoreboard better I like - I don't eat Heath bars I've never had a score for the score bar to me first time ever had it taste like butterscotch who does the other one had like a chocolate-covered peanut type flavor man it was really hot peanut buttery or you know roasted type player I love that heath bar compared to the own the score is a buttery toffee like a typical buttery toffee that you have on popcorn or something it does taste a lot like butterscotch but I absolutely love butterscotch so score bars used to be my favorite back in like the 80s and 90s I mean I used to love score bar eat them all the time heath bar being unruly recently the heath bar is more grainy I guess when you bite into it you can kind of feel the pieces in there where is the score bars more about yeah of a solid piece like like a hard piece of candy where's the the heath bar kind breaks up in little I don't know chunks is nothing I cannot really get I mean I've tasted some chocolate but the chocolate flavor on the heath bar was way more fine probably true then in that score as well when way better milk chocolate taste then yeah it's cool so so really it ultimately that's really up to you which one do you like if you like more of a buttery butterscotch flavor score bars of the best if you want a more of a toffee nutty flavor the heat bars the best they do not taste the same so there are definitely a different way well enough for us to get mindful and tell you there's a difference okay natan yeah this one's way though so thanks for watching hope you would enjoy and we'll catch you next time", "lg9lYozWRuc": "I just wanted to show you today how I make my chocolate for when you have that sweet tooth or cravings without really going overboard with a lot of extra added ingredients what I have here is third cup of melted coconut ring and you don't have to really heat it that long because it melts at 78 degrees so this actually spent about 10 seconds in the microwave and then I'm going to use 1/3 cup or 3 tablespoons of coconut or I'm sorry cocoa powder and I'm going to mix this in until it gets liquid you can see it melts really easy all you're doing is just making sure the clumps of chocolate are out and to make sure that it's not very bitter of course this is unsweetened cocoa powder I'm going to add some vanilla stevia you can use chocolate raspberry regular chocolate hazelnut whatever flavors you like I'm going to add three droppers baby because straight cocoa powder can tend to be a little bit better now this is what you would be using to make just a plain chocolate bar at this point you are ready to go now I would like to make this a little bit of clearer so what I have here is a few pecans some walnuts and some diced up apricots that I'm dried myself and to mix this up and to give it a little bit more health benefits you can see this this is puffed quinoa it's the straight-up quinoa that has been air-popped but you can also choice plan quinoa let's kill it and just a little bit I'm not even going to measure I'm just going to kind of eyeball it and see how much it is I really like to punch for it it almost gives it like a rice krispy Thai taste now you can use any kind of mould you like you can if you wanted to just go ahead and stick your container in the refrigerator once it's done break it off into little pieces what I'm going to use here is actually a candy bar mold and all you're going to do spill out your mold and you can fill it up as deep as you'd like it if you want it very full very thick then that's what you can do if you don't want them if you would like them to be a little bit better you can and as I said you can use whatever clay bird stevia some chocolate mint or just the peppermint stevia would have made really really good chocolate mint but I think I may end up doing that with the next batch that I make but these are super easy to make and they will literally just take a few moments in your refrigerator or freezer you want to make sure you cut them relatively even that way it it helps when you pop them out just making a little bit more even you can see a little crispy bits you can add cranberries you can add blueberries cherries raisins whatever nuts you want whatever you like to have in your candy farm but I chose these ones because they were a little bit more healthier option for me in my own apricots since I didn't add any sugar to them it's just straight-up dried fruit all you do is get this stick it in the refrigerator and have a few that we're already made and you can see they break off into nice little squares and it tastes just like regular chocolate you do want to make sure that you keep one referred rated though because coconut oil has such a low temperature for it to melt these will become liquid again so I would keep them either in the freezer or in the refrigerator and it tastes amazing you can get rid of that craving that you have for chocolate without really going overboard and doing something the end up regretting there's so many more bad things that have been added to a candy bar hydrogenated oils with this it's just straight coconut oil and I would use a high quality coconut oil just for that same reason and there you have it that's how I make my chocolate bars", "jqPBp9zxmNk": "today guys I am making the world's biggest chocolate box first place I went to was being cued to try and make a giant mold for the chocolate bar they say they can't draw that for me I'm pulling up and dinner Julie please I would drill it but I haven't done a trillion before I don't want everything was going so well and then and making a chocolate bar and that brand is beta squad come on go subscribe could a channel is flying right now anyways they agreed to help me with the mold and after some big industry tools were being used the mold was complete and it was big then it was time to go to our next destination oh and how could I forget I had to say bye to my big drill it Danny thank you so much I appreciate that so much drilling don't get me singing we then forced the mold into a small car and made our way to Tesco where I

hiding something I started the melting process for some friends to help me and start preparing the mold yes the first piece is done so skip once we do we're back to square one in this videos we need to make chocolate video the bank is running low muy bien get it boiling je m'appelle another couple layers of chocolate some wafers chocolate bars more wafers and I started to get really tired so I used to do Taekwondo back in the day so it's time to bring that feeling dismantle disinfected broken skeptical people always customer hairline so start to show what the head can do you know what cancer this bit real quick brain is away yeah yeah this is good George I'd like to know why you're talking listen he's filming George you need the bag um why was Miss Molly annoyed because her husband chuck was later let's go Chuck it was late subscribe I carried on forcing my slaves I mean employees to work unpaid overtime finished off the last batch start pouring stop caring and the cooling process began all right guys it's been about 24 hours and guess what this is the scariest part I have to remove the chocolate bar out the mall this is how it looks guys oh my that is currently suffering for heavy winds time to take this boy off the mold first strong enough to fit his ass I need my cameraman filming right now okay push we tried loads of different things and the chocolate bar just wouldn't budge so I had one last idea to destroy it by force using a pickaxe a crowbar and a saw this had to work I just realized the screw is there this is useless yeah let's actually work you right now [Music] the world's biggest chocolate bar Oh oh my god I can't even lift this no way of lifting that my back this is definitely gonna beat the world record take a look at this boy oby it's the biggest thing I've ever made on my channel what a way to come back with a DIY B series anyways it's time for a famous montage just look at the size of this thing oh my Wow a big big big this is the world's biggest chocolate bar I'm so happy with the way that looked and now it's time to summon my housemates to see if they like when did you there's a speech [Music] [Music] your fingers I want to taste the waffle cuz I made for some what was inside right it was time to destroy the chocolate bar before the Sun did the sword didn't work the pickaxe almost killed us so I had one more secret deadly weapon under my sleeves a paintball gun the chocolate is undefeated literally not budging I always use Oh there's only one thing they'll put end to all this the chocolate bar wants to act up how about I drop it from the highest point of our mansion so I set up the landing space and it's courted the chocolate bar to the drop zone lovely but now hey Jessica stop you guys been wondering what the inside looks like boom that tastes amazing that tastes amazing always in if I had look would have been nine that we look at - with steamer Donna some point four give you a solid thank you very much guys for watching this video the pinball bats 10,000 likes in this video subscribe comment down what giant food I should make Nick I've got a lot cleaning up to do so [Music]", "JzsbglK0P8k": "hey y'all this is Deena welcome to my channel okay so tonight I am working on craft fair stuff I have a list and I want to get everything knocked out as soon as I can so I've been working on my Hershey bar packs and I am using the same box that I did in the tutorial but I kind of altered it I didn't put the big belly band on I used two washi tape instead and I put it in a plastic clear back and added some twine you can see I just kind of taped it over in the back that way then the chocolate bar stays inside so I wanted to just quickly show you how I did this kind of refresh your memory um if you're interested in making any like this okay so this is gonna be super quick going okay so the first thing you're gonna do is you're gonna need to take your paper trimmer and you're gonna take a piece of paper I'm using 12 by 12 but you can use eight-and-a-half by 11 if you want eight-and-a-half by eleven would work this paper Pat I got it at Tuesday morning with $6.99 is called snowy day okay so I'm so sorry y'all okay so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm gonna cut my paper at eight and a half by simin 1/2 now if your paper is directional make sure that the seven and a half is on the top this being the top so this is a directional this is seven and a half that's how you can keep your direct your your paper going in the right direction your prints going in the right direction I'm gonna take my paper and I'm gonna score it at 2 on the seven and a half inch size two and a half five five-and-a-half okay and I'm gonna do six and six and a half on the eight inch side okay so now you can kind of see this is what it looks like I kind of caught it right there but it's okay I'm going to cut that off anyway okay so the first thing you're gonna do is you're gonna cut on the score lines you can fold first or score first it's up to you I'm gonna cut this little flap that's inside there I'm gonna cut it first then I'm gonna cut off the corner so it looks like that then I'm gonna take this one cut I need to make sure I cut that one all the way into the inner score line my score lines that glue me right now okay so that's how it is I think some what I'm gonna do first is these little flaps right here that's what this over in the little flaps that are down here at the bottom I am going to put some glue just on those little flaps flip it over I'm gonna fold it down fold it in just so it starts to form the bottom of the box that's where the bark candy bar will go I'm gonna flip it over I've made my bottom okay so now this is how this is gonna go make sure you have these folders really well y'all okay so the first thing that we're gonna do is before you glue this one down you're gonna cut it down you're gonna make it look a beat V window it's gonna look like a bee when you're done so I've cut one it's kind of like that let me go ahead and add some glue there I'm gonna put glue all the way up to the top of that little flap and just over here on the corners make it flush make sure it's pressed down really well and then we're gonna do this one so if you have to remember which way to cut just you can fold it over and you can kind of see which way right now so so so easy isn't you can mass-produce he's pretty fast y'all I made this whole basket full in like an hour figuring out how I wanted to change it make it quicker okay so I kind of used my bone folder to press everything down since I've glue in there to make sure that it's nice and flush I'm gonna take a little bit of washi tape and I've just been using all the same color on here cuz it all kinda has been matching okay I'm gonna put some washi tape instead of making a belly band washi tape is gonna make your mouse producing if you're doing these for craft fair go a little faster okay I'm gonna put that and then I have some that say Merry Christmas I'm gonna put one more row and then y'all I'm almost done I just been putting it like this give it a little decoration and it also keeps that box held together and there you go you got your box so fast right y'all I'm just using these Hershey bars I got these two dollars the pack of six and I got them at Walmart there you go so now I decided to instead of doing like the belly band I was gonna do this and then I thought when you pick it up it's full now I didn't one type of choppin I wanted to be sealed no I like clear bags so these are the ones I'm using they actually were a little large for this but it worked out I made it work okay so what I did is I take take the chocolate bar in the Box slide it up inside as far as you can go just kind of take it and you're gonna fold it over and I'm just gonna take the back this is the only scotch tape I had I wished it was a little bit more clear but it's all good not gonna worry about that so I just taped that it'll a piece of tape by the bottom now it's inside won't fall out I just took some twine wrap it around I've done this before on other things I've made but it just makes it and gives it a little decoration I know I'm even gonna worry about putting tags on these I'm just gonna leave these this way let's spread out my twine and that's it how easy is that 5-10 minutes you're done and now I've only got four left to do what do y'all think so yeah I hope that you like this a little bit quicker project way to do this I think I'd still turn acute it served its purpose it was easier when your mass producing you want it to be fast and easy so this way if you change the belly band and start using washi it turns out just fine worked out great so anyway well I hope you'll like this hope you if you're gonna put these in your craft here maybe you'll give this a try and okay so I wonder touch base on before I go one more thing if you are participating in the swap and so if you're participating the swap remembering that the deadline to have it mailed out is the 19th which is Friday so make sure that you get your swap mailed out on time that way then your

and I are excited because we're making a special surprise for David for Father's Day everybody has in their family kind of that favorite recipe that grandmother makes or in this case our grandmama makes and David's mom makes our zebra cake and it is rich and chocolatey and it's one of my husband's favorites in fact when she says when she used to ask him what dessert do you want me to make for you he would say Hershey bar cake and so I was talking with her about her recipe and I decided that we could load car but gross for that so we have a basic chocolate cake recipe that's out and we're using that basic chocolate cake recipe to make a copycat Hershey cake bar and we're in tight about a little bit more as we go on grace has two cups of heavy cream and she's sweeping that keep going she's been putting in she's really messing up for at least a minute or so and she's going to keep until it's a really thick consistency when I got David's mom to share her recipe with me I asked her she told me that she made that and so she used excuse of the chocolate box mix and we didn't do that we made a low-carb chocolate cake so she also uses in the I sing he just like the best part she's as cool hwhip fruity would not use so we're using heavy cream instead she is cream cheese which is great for low carb and she uses powdered sugar well we've got super neelix powdered sugar now it's a low-carb confection sugar made with a recruit all in Cydia blends everybody's in back so grace is taking the two cups and you want it to be thick it's not quite thick enough Gracie you want it to be where it stands up you're almost there so keep going with it she's using a blender and you're going to go for about three minutes make sure your cream is really cold because it whips up better and if you use heavy cream it whips up better than heavy whipping cream actually because in the notes okay and while Bryce is ripping this I'm going to get this ready I have a whole top of the Sukhram confectioner sugar I'm going to put that in the bottom so it doesn't get everywhere like it's notes all really excited about this recipe a hot because there is something that really I say it's David's favorite it's really been one of my favorites and I'm using the super milk chocolate I just made a mess I'm using the secret milk chocolate because it's really hard to find oh that's good grace that's it's hard to find a good low carb milk chocolate look at that as kind of got some almost like stiff peaks going on that's perfect all right use if you will the blender let's get as much of this off as we can at the cream and this is just scream we had to add any sweetener to it yet right the blender the the mixers this is a hand mixer a blenders like the thing that I make um Holly mash on okay so this is the cream cheeses 8 ounces of cream cheese has been at room temperature and it's one cup of the confectioner Sukhram so grace is going to blend that up and the super milk chocolate is low carb Kokopelli makes the milk chocolate that's really good if you can't get your hands on the soup line the secret milk chocolate is a just a really goodness milk chocolate made with a really tall and they were kind enough to send us milk chocolate to make this recipe I'm super doesn't and dirty and money from them but they do send me the products and I'll send you the link on where you can order them with a 10% discount if you're interested get it good and mixed up okay let's add to that a teaspoon of vanilla extract and that wasn't in the original recipe but we're not using Cool Whip so we want that vanilla flavor can you put that in and this is so simple once grace gets that next really well I'm not sure the cream cheese isn't kind of chunky still and I make sure you get it really well mixed and scrape down the sides and I'll add some liquid to here to this to okay I'll add some liquid sweetener to it as well and grace had asked me Mom why not to choose the confectioner swerve or the confectioner soup run use more of that to smooth them with in Italia Oh two more that if I use more of the confectioner's super in it it would make it too dry that's right it would dry it out so we use the liquid sweetener because that doesn't happen all right you think that's nicely mixed all right do you want to add that to this or this to that okay you want to add that okay grace is going to add that to that instead of this to this and then we'll give that another bit of a blend we don't have to worry too much a battle here Gracie I need you to scrape it out and scrape it off the beaters okay you don't have to worry too much about using them it the hand mixer with it because that cream will just keep going are you having a hard time to scrape it out I'll get it you want it here I work on the beaters and you work on the rest of the bowl you don't have to worry about it deflating it'll generally just keep whipping this is going to be more of an icebox cake you're going to have to keep it in the fridge if you wanted it thicker you could probably add some xanthan gum or glucomannan but but because of all the cream really is more of an icebox cake say well I think it's a perfect Father's Day perfect summer dessert because it's nice and cold I don't know how well this would travel probably and in fact I'll be making this next weekend to take to my in-laws and I'm anxious for my mother-in-law to try it the apricot might even like put it together I mean while I'm there all right let's get this down off the sides Gracie we need to spatula even yeah all right and if you'll mix that all together yeah orchid oh and it tastes really pretty sweet you could um put a couple more drops man that is good a little better on my hand I had to clean off I have three drops you can use liquid stevia or delicate superlice whoever you prefer for your note chocolate avocado sour copycat Hershey bar cake it's just a really rich cake now when we made the chocolate cake I got in a hurry and there's a good guy on my thumb how'd it taste that little bit that got on your thumb is that okay you know I hand it off and let dad try it since he's our expert on the Hershey bar cake when we made our chocolate cake recipe for this or made the cake pieces for this we had a hard time with the layers so you know that we always just keep it real around here and so you're going to see it's broken up on top and that's okay we're making layers and we're not even going to stress over it so what I did with the milk chocolate bar how is that David with the milk chocolate bar I took three of the Sukhram bar and chopped them up and so I just chopped them in small pieces almost like shavings and that's what goes it's that texture that gives it a really great taste and my system is going to mix those up and like I said when we are doing the cake so you had a hard time so you're going to see these layers are just a hot mess and I'm anxious to see how it's going when you put it together the good thing is we're going to take it and cover it all with um I see so you know you can't go wrong with that I think this one's in two pieces systems in three pieces we're just going to make it work okay and what we want to do hang on a second Gracie let's make sure we've got it mixed really well we got a bit of a mess don't we yeah you J you did a good job what we're going to do is we're going to take a look so we did three of those bars which i think was like for 4.5 ounces I can't remember I weighed them so I'd remember an hour much has happened but we're just going to put a nice dollop oh can you get that spatula out and we'll smooth it out we're not going to put a ton because remember we're going to have the two inner layers and then the top so we aren't going to do make it too thick we're going to make it maybe four inch thick um Thank You Gracie poo okay there's that small one you know that's kind of overly I'm making a mess you don't worry about getting it on the sides because we're going to ice it with the sides anyway but that's probably about right and you don't have to worry about going too far outside the edges because like I said wolf will be doing the sides and so we'll get any edges and when we put the cake the next layer that weight will squish some of the stand I think that looks about even I hope so can't wait to try this now this is not one of those cakes that we're going to put together and cut this needs to sit overnight or so in the fridge if you don't have time to do it overnight you can do it I would do at least four or five hours you want to be nice and chilled all the way three right I suppose looking at me like he's really worried how this is going to go I'm really worried about how this is going to go we did this all kinds of wrong but that's okay I rule what not to do I really should have done this so differently but anyway well and what why would you do it different well I should have I should have waited for it to cool it wouldn't have inside crumbly and I wouldn't have had such a mess but you know what we're gonna make it work what you think how is it good hmm it's like this is slight the the Swiss cake mix at grandmama would use we'll put that side - you would another patient it does your mom you have devil's food you think all right you can hand that to daddy if he wants to get those crumbs okay let's do this layer and honestly I've never had such a hard time we have been so excited about sharing this cake and I wasn't able to do it I wanted to do it before my surgery and ran out of time so wasn't able to do it then and then had an allergic reaction when I had the arm surgery and say we was a while before I was able to get back to it and so we've been said excited to do this and then the layers have been a mess and I've told you guys I'm enough of a perfectionist that has really bothered me I'm going to make this like I said next weekend for a family get-together for or Father's Day and probably it'll turn out perfect and I won't be videotaping then right Gracie okay if this smells good it has that look I think it's going to be perfect I'm not getting the leaders perfect but what happens once you get it all covered with icing then it's just really all about the taste you think okay ideas for how to do this one it's already in pieces she might want to pick up each oh my lord okay you're going to try it I don't know if that's gonna work ice okay grace is good we're gonna do it like a puzzle all right or it's work inside bark I see don't do this at home i really suggest using the parchment paper and then that's going to help and then we're making in this what are you doing you gonna try some of our chocolate Craig that's the puzzle piece tiny fit just eat you might try some of the cake it does taste a little bit like brownie doesn't it Jonathan we're trying to make Grandmama's a Hershey bar cake do you know that case you'd like that cake how do we do you might try some of the icing you can put the icing on the top and we're just gonna cover our sins and ask for forgiveness later hang on be easy easy when you don't just flop it up in dolloping it yeah well your dial up and rudyard like said we're just gonna have our scene so comforting that's our 3d up under there you know kind of like wearing clothes Oh Lord eBay and we went I have an advice thing to cover all our sins so we just have to pray about it thank my lord this may be a blooper video I think this side of our puzzle piece has fallen off we have to get the toothpicks out okay well every time I've made this and this is not the first time believe it or not I shouldn't admit that I should pretend like we've never done this before um every time we've made it that we've had plenty of icing guess what we don't this time so you know what you could do you could just make it like a torte you know like that and have it kind of artistic yeah I mean good news I said nobody's gonna want to eat it because I work so I got it you're gonna get to keep it all to yourself okay we're gonna salvage this oh my how'd that happen there's a piece of cake in there it's pretty sick guys we're going to salvage this thing we may have to make another half batch of icing um so don't put as much icing in the layers as we did and we're going to have to figure out a salvage this video as well said we're going to work on the sides give us a 5-minute commercial break Nick give us a few minutes and we'll show you how we cleaned it up okay I think we hid most of this in just like a big Spanx kind of job where you put the Spanx on under the dress and everything looks a little bit better we put the icing on top of the cake and I think it looks pretty good we have like I said look forward to making this cake first day long so we have had to laugh at ourselves and the difficulty we've had with it we didn't end up making a little more icing so that we could cover it and David helpfully pointed out that it was a lopsided so we've turned it said that it looks a little less lopsided captain II you guys can probably make this much more attractive and course incarnation is to simply redo this video all over again and I don't think we do that I think we just kind of roll with it because we simply don't time I want to get this out before Father's Day but we will make it again and we'll learn from it will add the tips to the comments this is like an icebox cake as I mentioned before and so our milk chocolate Sukhram bark cake our Hershey bar copycat needs to go in the fridge so we're not going to cut it right now we're going to put at the fridge ideally it would give it every night and grace is like mom do you have to wait that long so we're going to try to wait three or four hours and then we'll be back and we'll cut it so you can see what it looks like hey guys ready we let it sit in the fridge for a few hours Grace's anxious to get a try it we're using our special cake server that Miss Noreen gave us can you fix it it's a high-heeled shoe server we love this thing we always use it for our special cakes thank you Miss Noreen and say grace wants to cut it this is the cake we had such a awful time with falling apart in layers I don't think that would have happened if we had been more careful and let it cold and smarter with it so you guys please let me know when you make the chocolate cake how it works out so grace is cutting a slice this is a huge cake I think it would be really easy to get 18 servings out of this excuse me 16 servings out of this you know I've to cut it quite if you visualize it and 1/4 and then from that forth 4 slices you're fine um the first piece is always hard to stick it out so and you may need yeah yeah okay you want to do it grace I said she wanted to do it so I'm trying to stay back out of it I should have made a cup of coffee this is the kind of cake but I think you're going to want a cup of coffee with Wow that's gorgeous grace and it stayed together this is our secret milk chocolate bar cake looks really good all right wow it does look legit well let's clean hang on I think that part of it was just cutting it but I think maybe that I seen it dig if we dig this part out and I'll put it on the side of your plate right yeah it is so waste Wow okay notice we only have two plates let's turn this around so you guys can kind of see inside of it a little bit and I'm going to try not to lick my fingers but oh well no I poor daddy is standing there with the camera kind of looking at us like where's my piece of cake this is so good this healing jingling I'm sure reminds me of exactly what grandmama Meigs mmm getting me to chill then it gets in the fridge it's cold I know chocolate it's like a little bit crisp and I have it to have another bite the cake is good it's very moist it's not heavy I spit this is not like a low carb cake at all grace likes it what do you think David this is a great texture into what I'm Ronen your face I'm not the chills from Italy I'm really cold I think that's a good chocolate egg David this is your foot one of your favorite desserts that your mom has made for you for years what do you think how did we do during the copycat Hershey bar I'll soon mouth this little mouthful is Malhar peg you can't answer me really is it very much it cuz I know you really don't like the copycat stop is it really very much like what you're used to eating only it is the icing the icing is so rich so sweet it's just a perfect imitation of the Hershey bar cake I mean it is just perfect I'm gonna have to hide this for my daughter I think yeah he'll do well happy Father's Day a little early and we didn't do very well surprising you more not get it surprises around here but we'll make another one for actually for Father's Day so I am so sick what I know that the video was a disaster with a cake falling into puzzle pieces but it really does taste good and I think that if you make it for your family that you will be pleased with the results", "9_BLND2ikxM": "my name is becky keller and i'm the president and executive director of the glory of or just wonder glow

life to her incredible journey here on earth she left the legacy hers and hours to cure colon cancer and to love life and to show gratitude for every day that we have on this earth", "qZ0fZD47WyE": "hey guys I'm here today with a little bit of fun hopefully it will be an entertaining video so couple of weeks ago I went to London and I decided to get a bunch of chocolate so I've never tried British like typical chocolate bars I've tried there Cadbury's chocolate which I absolutely love so of course our hotel there were Sainsbury's there no white skin it just goes back and I just went crazy and bought a bunch of different chocolate bars I don't think this video seriously it's just a bit of fun I don't when wearing a really large bollocks today and a matte one because I figure I'll be eating loads of chocolate so want something that would stay and case you're wondering its next laundry liquid lipstick in bustier and I think it's really kind of unusual color for me but I like it so let's see how many chocolate bars I have five I have ten oh oh my god I'm going to be in a chocolate coma after this video I'm sure about that so I don't even know where to start I don't have any expectations so let's go with this one it's a flake chocolate bar it's by category and I'm here youtubers from the UK talked about these but I've never tried on myself alright a bit crush just obviously Joy's in my luggage draw the link oh my god I'm going to have chocolate all over the floor so it is kind of like a slinky to push up a block it's like made of layers and layers of milk chocolate it's really nice is quite creamy and I'm going to give from one to five stars so this one is going to get five stars I think it's really nice creamy milk chocolate okay let's try this is by Nestle it's your key original chocolate bar I brought the one with raisins and nuts for my brother and he said it was absolutely amazing this is what it looks like all my dollars didn't expect this it's just solid milk chocolate that's good I like it what I have to say I do prefer Cadbury's and just plain Cadbury smoked chocolate because I feel like it's more creamy like melts in your mouth it's so good so this one would get three four start okay so let's go now let's go with this one it's categories this but gold this looks really plain and boring mmm well the point is on the inside - it has caramel inside this is nice because it's like this kind of foamy spongy and milk chocolate and it's for the Karma really good but so sickly sweet I don't think I would be able to eat this whole chocolate bar in the like one bite is enough for me nope Mars chocolate bar it's nice but extremely sweet so this is kind of like that but not nearly as good as Mars um so I would give this the two and a half this on my favorite it's super sweet okay let's try Cadbury crunchy not crunchy chocolate so hopefully this will be nice again looks very simple and boring what look at that it has a very very similar kind of spongy inside like on Maltesers like a honeycomb is it golden honeycomb rats in Cadbury chocolate it won I don't dislike it but again ridiculously sweet I would give this three and a half out of five stars because again it's not something I would buy like I would go and buy bounty or Snickers chocolate bar but this is not something I would be drawn to so this is a galaxy ripple like the flake is super messy and I feel like it's it's almost like they're copying each other trying to be better again that kind of layered chocolate it's just falling apart it's like it's made of chocolate flakes or shavings no I don't like this one at all it's kind of like oh my god I have chocolate all over my head it's a bit soapy notified let's try categories twirl it kind of looks like fix smart hmm and have the same shaped chocolate texture I like this one twirl is a really girl it's very simple but nice four and a half it's nice I like it I have two galaxy ones this is just galaxy smooth milk and this is caramel collection salted caramel so main let's try the salted caramel one a bit of a change again you have two little like fingers oh my goodness is so carmely oh this is nice I much prefer to food with the other caramel one whisper gold this was sickly sweet where is this one it's not that sweet I would give this and four out of five stars because I still wouldn't reach for it let's try Cadbury's double-decker filling all over the place what we're going to shuffle it all over me so messing the double filling bar it says nuga top and crispy bottom in Cadbury chocolate oh yeah I think this gets party car I like it a lot so it has new gun on the top and then kind of like rice krispies puffy things I feel like it's coffee flavored nuga this is definitely my favorite out of them all lastly it's just Cadbury's with spot the tiniest bubbles the biggest state I guess is going to be that bubbling milk chocolate which I personally really like to just melt you don't really need to chew it you just put in your mouth and do this and kind of melt in your mouth I don't know it's nice but just blah you know like nothing special milk chocolate but nothing like revolutionary or something that I would really really want to eat this is okay I would give it three stars not because it's bad but it's just stupid boring looking comparison to double-decker these are all of the chocolate bars my favorites we're galaxy salted caramel one double-decker by Cadbury's and yeah probably a Cadbury stroll personally you don't think I'm able to eat the whole chocolate bar because they're all so sweet like you feel sick in your stomach after eating like even one bite if you would like to see videos of this sort in the future give it a thumbs up do let me know in the comments because I definitely want to try more sweets and chocolates and foods from all over the world maybe wherever go I should get a bunch of um you know loco sweets that would be nice so I hope you enjoyed it and have a lovely day nice okay [Music]", "3f2LwPHN3KA": "welcome builders andy is jordy here in the last episode we built a stonemason and a quarry and a logging camp and we also built a farmhouse as well welcome back to cmp it stands for krusty muppet no no sorry creative multi-player welcome back to our small kingdom 5x5 building system let's start with a sawmill i've been through heartaches i've been to heaven i've done my best and my worst learned my lessons no matter how hard my life would treat me i'd always get right back up never worry cause i got a million breezes [Music] i feel it growing stronger every cause i can feel the energy [Music] all right let's have a look around this brand new building obviously this is the logging house we did yesterday so the person who lives here gets all the logs and then they hand them over to this person who saws them up so have a look at this this little uh design here by shula very cool saw mill to saw up all the logs and what i'm kind of doing over here is um can i get out here please is piling up the sawn logs so we have the logs like this all the sawn dark oak logs piling up kind of in the shade here and i like how kind of cramped this place is i love how this whole city is going to evolve slowly you know just build by build as if the whole community was doing things in the right order you know logging sawing mining smelting i'm going to build a smelter's house later today and maybe just some ordinary accommodation as well so what else do we want in this place i've got some food um on the inside look i made this um little section here um do you know what would be really useful as if those trapdoors were on the outside let's let's put them on the outside it's going to give us a bit more space there we go that's going to give us a bit more space on the inside can i can i sneak in there i can't very good i've got um beehives as you notice on the outside beehives actually a legitimate block looks like little kitchen counters pretty cool i guess it's pretty horrible if the bees come in so we've got some pizza we've got some burgers um and then maybe we've got a little um table and chairs we've got our upstairs for our sleeping arrangements as well what else should we add to this place maybe a little chest or something i don't do too much furnishing in my builds you may have noticed this over the years there we go uh actually maybe they could go right over there that would look pretty cool as well it's just really a question of bringing your builds kind of making your builds seem alive i don't know what else to put in this place um something like that i don't know i don't do interiors you may have noticed i just don't i just don't um look they're spinning some pots on the people we could have a pottery actually we could have a pottery i know this is some clay there's some clay down in the in this pond here so maybe we could have a person who gets the clay out make some pots and maybe even has a kiln and makes some bricks eventually as well put some nice detail into the chimney there and i've put some little stacked up logs as if this person's got their own collection of logs for maybe their own fire as well we can kind of roughen up the roof a little bit as well maybe adding in some sea pickles wherever they're going to grow as if they are looking like a bit of fungus on the roof and you can actually add added a few extra slaps once they're roughing up the roof make it look a bit more higgledy pigglety like that and you could even turn some of these and put a hole in the roof as well so i love the detail that is our sawmill let's move on to the next build many times my mind would wander i'd always dare it to go even farther cause i got a million reasons to keep holding on yeah i got all that it takes to win and overcome [Music] and here we are just the cutest little house you've ever seen let's add a little bit more detail into this chimney as well i like to do that there we go a little bit of detail there um what else can we do in this place we've got a little place to fish little uh fishing pier here we love that kind of detail we could put some old things like that maybe just you know that kind of junk that gathers under your porch who's got a porch who's got a porsche junk i wish i had a porch and just jealous people's portuguese now there's no for no reason so we have a little uh workshops here little workbenches little places where you could do a little bit of work uh we've got um this isn't very good we need to do that and that much better basement here's a teeny tiny little basement linking up to our fireplace as well so again we can put a little little workbench along there very very simple indeed a few bits of junk piled up as well maybe a little grindstone for sharpening your tools whoever lives here maybe just me works on the farm it could be a farm worker this person um let's give them a nice comfortable seat on the porch maybe out of crimson little seat there they can have a little chat have a snack and then on the inside this place is a little bit cramped why there's a sheep in my house yeah i don't know why um i didn't know it was there honestly i didn't know the sheep was there i think nothing was happening to the sheep so we've got a grindstone maybe have some more chairs in front of the fireplace we've got a bed uh do we have a lamp in here we don't really have a lamp so have a lamp and then a chest would do i should work on some more interior details there's a chest there's a chest a little teeny tiny workers house i love this would you like to see a tutorial on this build it's a very very small cute house as well we're going to add a little bit of detail into the roof as well i'm going to use some world edit i think for this so slash rebel air and this lets me just paint and replace blocks kind of automatically like that and just drop them down there like that and then this one maybe you can stick out here and come down and look good and we could do things like roughing up making it look a bit older and one of the things i like to do is just add some coral so there we go we've got some dead fiery coral and it just looks like bracket fungus kind of sticking out of the wood doesn't it looks like you haven't really taken care of your property you haven't got rid of this bracket fungus is growing away something we could also also do to add a bit of character to this place if we add some mossy cobblestone because look half of this is kind of really connected up to this river here so you can imagine the damp leaking up here making this all kind of horrible and fusty and mossy as well what do you think pretty smart i love that little house it's so cute i love the the the levels of it it just comes down here into the water i love that i love the uh the porch as well yeah i think i'll do a little tutorial on this house as well it's super cute really cool and the basement as well you've got a lot of space for storage haven't you i think it's actually pretty pretty cool as well what else can we have up here maybe something like that there we go we need probably some light in here as well light this place up all right so don't look at that because we're about to build that um yeah let's build it now [Music] cause i can feel the energy [Music] so there we go this is of course our hunter's house probably didn't guess that as we were building it maybe he did maybe i put a giant big label yeah let's say i put a big giant label into the edit note to self future editor but yeah this is the hunter's house somewhere we'd come to hunt now again we're going to make this look pretty cool i have got an amazing texture pack if you look i have got better leaves better leaves version for 1.16 and it gives me well birch leaves in this biome are yellow which i absolutely love isn't it really cool so let's add some beautiful detail to the hunter's house the hunter's house so this person would hunt and i think maybe they would be a butcher as well maybe someone who would process the pigs and so on if you had pigs and cows and sheeps that needed to be slaughtered apologies to all the vegans and vegetarians uh yeah in this place we also need to add in um i think another floor up here where we could have some sleeping arrangements as well so yeah the hunter's house has got to be well decorated maybe we could have something like that no we can't have that let's have that and to do getting this right i'm just going to make a little i don't like that as a staircase let's have hmm having staircases the cider is awkward because we've got very low down roofs we're actually going to have to have this one two three this is gonna be my little ladder up to here and we're gonna put that on top so you climb up you get up to here and then we're going to block off the sides you don't fall off if you roll out of bed in the night just kind of a simple bedroom up here like this so this uh was designed by shula this um upstairs arrangement she's very very good at furnishing one of the patreons on my server uh very very good at furnishing indeed so let's make space for two people to kind of sleep up here uh like that maybe three people could live here three people could be the hunting party it could be a hunting family maybe that lives in this house and we'll give them a little bit of storage at each bed something like that would do and that's pretty good for up there and then maybe we'll have some little shelves right here for your kind of all your storage arrangements and something i do like to grab is beehives um because they look like hey beehive yourself get into my inventory here we go they look like little kitchen counters don't they like little kitchen counters where you could do your work and we could do something like that as well so there's a little kitchen counter um where other details can be put in i've got maybe a little smoothing table here we need to put some ladders into our chimney not a chimney our tower the top part of the tower is a bit of a folly doesn't really lead to anything i mean you could put a bell up here you could put a lantern as well and this is going to lead right down into our basement which we'll get to in a minute and then through here oh i need to finish off my fireplace for sure so do i have yep a hot bar for that so i love to finish off my fireplaces just like that and then we have that one like that that one like that that one like that i also like to take away these ones and do full block upside down upside down and there we go we've got ourselves a little fireplace maybe we could have a couple of chairs for furnishing as well maybe you guys are better at furnishing than me you couldn't be much worse that is for sure so we've got little a couple of chairs there and then what about if we have a little table a little table like that you could eat that would that look good a little table a little kind of bench seating table design i kind of like that actually that's pretty cool maybe just change it maybe to something like that that's not too shabby there we go little bench to have your foods and then of course you could add so much more detail to that you could put a door here as well maybe to keep out the drafts so let's carry on furnishing this place now this is going to be where you would prepare all your meats so we'll have a nice big workbench going along there and a nice big workbench going along there very smart indeed and in here is going to be where we smoke the meat as well so let's add a bit of smoke and we're also going to add these as well now i have a tutorial for this hunter's house if you want to build this hunter's house i have a tutorial already on my channel if you would like to build it and we're going to put these chains along here but what you're getting in this video really is some of the uh the detailing um which i didn't do in the video so there we go so this nether quartz looks like big s uh it sure is smoky in here looks like big chunks of meat hanging there ready to get smoked and that preserves them oh yeah and a little bit of smoke can escape out the window that's what i'm pretending there we go so we've got that we could also do this maybe and have that kind of hanging down as a little chain maybe you could hang some stuff some things up on that chain or maybe have some tools kind of hanging up kind of just looks professional like that doesn't maybe have this wrapped around like that um so we've got some really good plug-in on my server my server provided by dedicated mc linked to my server providers in the down below if you'd like your own minecraft server java or bedrock check out the link below use the code andy's order for 15 off um and you can get your own server and run it exactly the way you want to run your server and um i highly recommend you do that so we've got some some some meat blocks here which will just pop down kind of like that so if you're processing and cutting up all the meat what other details could we have lots of blood on the floor of course this is getting gross this uh this build um i don't eat much meat myself i'm kind of uh pescetarian i eat some fish really and maybe have steak about once a year what about you guys are you vegetarians or you you meat eaters i'm um i really hardly ever eat meat these days it's just really fish and maybe steak on my birthday is uh for a bit of a treat um there we go i don't know what else to put in this place um i'm really struggling oh cobweb the cobweb up in the the corner but this is this could be where you'd store all your uh your meat processing gear i guess but there we go token effort i think it is time we've got a hunter's house i think it's time to look at other people's builds other people's kingdoms as well uh around this place now we have connected as you can see across here all the way through let me show you that getting built [Music] energy so here we are at the end of the path leading back to my kingdom that direction we get ookie's swamp village which we saw in the last episode a very quick fly over again he's put on this magnificent kind of stunted tree turned into um what would you call it watchtowers as well beautiful hanging vines and kind of bushies there as well with chains just this place is amazing we'll probably revisit that most times we can also link over to here now i'm not too sh is this i think this is ed chinyoshi's place looks like we've got a massive docks yeah this is ed's crane design as well so he's building kind of a massive trading port or dock area i guess as well and then over here we have a dragon he's building this pretty amazing place as well look at the ship coming in here dragon sky what an amazing place he's built this ship kind of from scratch as well so beautiful place everyone's got their own little kingdom if you want to be part of this creative multiplayer then become youtube channel member or better still a patreon patreon.com forward slash andy is yoda you can get rid of all this blue this uh white wall if it's in your way just if you've already built to the specifications the size of your city then you just get rid of your white wall but look he's got a castle that's starting to get built to little bridges and houses and so on as well now we also have over here to do somewhere over the water we have another place that's being built let me see if we can reach aha so whose is this place again i think we saw this very briefly in the last episode it's again another little five by five town that's being built so i've stumbled across this kingdom and i don't know what to say this tower i think is from one of my seven upgrade videos uh where i paid someone on fiverr to come up with a a tower design seven upgrades to the tower they ended up building one that looks like another youtuber um so we've got some i mean these things happen we've got some balloons we've got the five by five kind of uh grid laid out as well i think this is alfa reno's plot i'm pretty sure this is alfarino's plot right here and he's uh he's gonna make quite an extravagant kingdom we've even got a dragon here as well so we're looking forward to seeing how this one turns out for sure okay so this giant castle is one of the things that's cropped up in our kingdom i didn't really want completely finished set-piece castles like this we'll have to make an exception for this one because it's so good this is by captain dreadspine i would prefer little five by five towns communities that get built up slowly over time and eventually have a castle or a monastery associated with them but it would be better to have less of these set piece builds and more small towns communities and cities that build up slowly using the 5x5 building system starting off from logging and sawing and smelting and right up to more advanced um skills like glass making and so on but having said that an amazing castle by captain dreadspine sorry if my frames per second have gone down this build is insanely uh complicated as you can see it's got some stunning gardens as well so big congratulations and well done to captain dreadspine for for pulling off this quite uh incredible build we'll have a quick look uh on the inside as i say as i said my frames per second have gone right through the floor i can't even walk quickly come on i mean the inside is just insanity itself i mean it's so huge we can try and venture upstairs as well but this does take quite some time can i go up quickly okay yeah i had to edit that bit out there that those stairs were going on forever let's uh fly through here where do we go we'll just keep on going up and eventually start to find some pretty cool rooms in this place we're going up and up and up and up wow look at this place absolutely incredible castle wow reminds me of some of the castles used to tour with corrales on his inspiration series and looks like we can go up even further as well and through here we're on to this place and i th isn't there is this the top maybe this is the very top i can't remember what's the very very top oh no no oh we can go further up i think there's a throne room up here if i remember some sort of throne room at the very very top of this place certainly more acacia slabs and you can shake a stick out for this castle let's see if we can get right to the very top there we go we're up to shield room a throne room yeah this is this is where i want to sit this is wow look at that for a throne oh yeah really cool i don't think you can go up any further i could be wrong no i don't think you can go up any further but what a place what a place by captain dreadspine thank you so much for building that it's uh spectacular actually absolutely spectacular maybe we could have a village around it maybe that's what we could do you could maybe evolve your 5x5 village all the way around this place so that this was maybe served by the the farms and the small villages outside it anyway uh let's go back to my place warp cmp we're gonna do warps for everybody's uh town as well i'm gonna do warps for everybody's town so eventually um everyone's time to have a warp yeah i said that three times don't know why sorry about that right guys we have a farm we have a hunter's house a small house a fishers a sawmill a lager um a stonemason and a quarry what should be the next builds we concentrate in our town thank you so

so in this video I briefly go through what I put in the center of all my cakes to turn them into chocolate bar cakes but don't fret if you want the recipes for my cake fillings just head over to my website at that k cool calm and you'll find them all there ok without any further ado let's get on to this delicious decadent chocolatey goodness I hope you enjoy this week's video first up we have the cherry ripe mm-hmm so to make the cherry ripe filling I take some coconut some glass a cherries and some sweetened condensed milk mix that all together then I go ahead and add some cocoa and some pips gel food coloring just to give it that cherry ripe chilli color mix that all together cherry sweetness I then place that mixture onto a baking tray that's lined with baking paper flatten it all out and chill for an hour once that's chilled I take a circle cutter around the same size as our cake take a hot knife and just cut around that circle and it is ready to put inside our cake so I've got some dark chocolate in it I've got some dark chocolate cake which I'll layer with a whipped chocolate ganache and then place our first cherry paste in another piece of cake more whipped ganache cherry whipped ganache cake hmm I give that all a good - coat her rough coat chill that and then place my board on top like a business all my other cakes to the side and go ahead and give that a final ganache coat smoothing it all out these cakes just end up looking like toothpicks you want to die beauty doing in any other holes that I have and there's our final coat pop that board off the top and smooth out the top making sure we're all level and even and neat I do that with all of the cakes in this video if that cake I then place it onto a presentation board pop that aside to chill oh I'm so everything is my ultimate favorite Turkish Delight okay so to make my Turkish Delight filling I've used white sugar lemon juice some water and then I bring that to a boil I stir it together first bring it to a boil without stirring and then I'm just just a damp pastry brush to rub down the sides of my pot to stop that mixture from crystallizing I then add some corn flour to the mixture stirring profusely so it doesn't go all lumpy a bit of cream of tartar and then you end up with this gluey sort of consistency you cook that out for about an hour and then you add some rose water for that delicious Turkish Delight flavor and a little bit of red gel food coloring to be gorgeous Turkish Delight color pop that into a baking tray lined with foil and sprayed with cooking spray in here then set that aside to chill yes for eight hours putting it together is exactly the same as out cherry ripe cake it's whipped chocolate ganache and then Turkish the light and then whipped chocolate ganache and then cake and so on and so forth Oh I decided to make a mars bar cake and this is how my first attempt ended this is me making my gorgeous chocolaty fluffy new girl which was beautiful this is me making the gorgeous Mars bar terrible and this is what it looked like when I put the cake together because everything was too soft yeah yep no problem in the solutions so I ended up caving and I chopped up some Mars bar and put it on top of my whipped chocolate ganache cover that with with chocolate ganache and layered my cake on top of that we're all entitled to epic fails are only human okay so once all my cakes work in ash and ready I went ahead and gave my trip on all of my cakes now it's all in the decoration to make those cakes look like you just want to jump in mmm the cherry right cake I've used a open star tip and just pipe whipped chocolate ganache all over that cake largest stars then smaller ones then I took some red Juiz and sprinkle them over those pipe stars took some chopped up cherry right this cake don't have an identity problem it's a cherry right cake pop them around the outside and then I decided to pipe stars all over the center of the cake also sprinkle on some desiccated coconut topped it with some maraschino cherries those little things that make those cakes but just thought you just wanted to dive into to decorate our Turkish Delight cake I did large swirls with a large open star tip and then some little stars with a small star tip once again all in whipped chocolate ganache some silver sprinkles in the middle two more is more some little cocoa nibs and then some chopped up Turkish delight on the sides of that cake also I'm getting hungry doing the voiceovers for my own video finally to do our mouths cake that I well my you know revisited mouth cake I just did some swirls on the side once again with the whipped chocolate ganache some crunchy little sprinkles in the middle they're crunchy chocolate sprinkles and some chocolate nibs around the outside chopped up Mars bar on the edges all the way around and then to finish this guy off I use some of the chocolate drizzle that I'd used for my drips and drizzle that over the top of the cake deep inhalation they're the three beauties are in all their glory they really just are the sort of cakes that you've wanted to dive into and eat and it's all about the decoration but the decoration is so so very simple and I hope that I've been able to show you that today okay guys thank you so much for joining me again this week don't forget that the recipes with everything except

to my bake like a pro YouTube channel in today's video we are gonna be making some chocolate bars using white chocolate and we are also gonna fill them with some white chocolate ganache I have a video tutorial on how to make the white chocolate ganache you can check at the end of this video and also down in a description box for our first step we're gonna be using some white chocolate and we're gonna fill our mold a recipe note you don't have to use tempered chocolate to follow my tutorial today so you fill all of your cavities and then I'm using a little offset spatula just to make sure that all of the white chocolate is completely right up the sides right to the top of the mold tap your mold to release air bubbles from the chocolate and then scrape off the excess from the top of the mold invert your mold place it on your silicone mat and leave it there for a few hours until the chocolate has completely set up for our next step we take our white chocolate ganache put it into a piping bag and now we're gonna fill our cavities an important note when you are filling the cavities make sure that you don't put too much chocolate because we are going to be adding more chocolate at the end to close the bottom of the chocolates I'm just evening this out with the end of a paintbrush and then if you need a little bit more in some of them just add a little bit more but not too much to close the chocolates up as our final step we will now fill the bottom of the chocolate mold with regular chocolate and that is our final step give your mold another tap that will settle all of the chocolate really nicely and then take a large spatula and just clean off the top of the mold which will eventually become the bottom of our chocolates let your chocolates sit for a few hours to make sure that they are completely set and then you can place them in the fridge for about 15 minutes and this will help with the unmolding and to finish off our video tutorial let's cut into it you can see the nice crisp outside shell and also the nice soft chocolate ganash in the middle so that's it for this really fast video I hope you enjoyed it if you did please give me a thumbs up subscribe if

"4DZdwEpJSQE": "what's up guys thank you so much for tuning in this week you're going to be making a chocolate bar drip cake it looks so good but it tastes even better so let's get started so for this cake you're going to need lots of chocolate bars I mean the more the merrier and you're going to cut those choco bars at different heights so that way when you stick them into the cake and it look like they're melting at different heights now I know it might be tempting to eat those scraps of chocolate but don't do it you want to chop those up because we're going to sprinkle those all over the filling it's our big two 8 inch round chocolate cakes i leveled off those cakes and then divide them in half and I'm obsessed with chocolate peanut butter chocolate peanut butter anything is like my life I mixed a quarter cup of peanut butter with one cup of buttercream icing and then spread that all over the center of each of the cakes and then sprinkled all those chopped little chocolate bars over top of that layer it up with deliciousness on top of deliciousness on top of deliciousness and for all of my recipes I will leave a link in the description box below as well as all the products

don't miss one - ice my cake I made two batches of my chocolate buttercream icing I apply the icing to my cake using a seven eight-nine piping tip and a piping bags smooth that out with my offset spatula and then use a piece of paper towel and rubbing that over the tops of my cake and the sides my tape until this cake was perfectly smooth now to make the dripping effect over the cake you're going to need some chocolate ganache of using some milk compound chocolate that I just melted I'm going to mix in some warm cream and mix that together until it's the perfect consistency again for the full recipe you can find that in the description box look guys there's so much stuff down there you're going to want to check it out now for the fun part we are going to be dripping this chocolate all over the top of the cake so I'm using a spoon to help guide the chocolate and kind of guide it over to the side so it starts flowing over you can even use a piping bag to pipe on some extra drips here and there just to make it like so chocolatey now while your chocolate ganache is still nice and wet you're going to start sticking in all this chocolate Bart's I can start with the biggest and the tallest ones the big towers of chocolate bars I can start sticking this into my cake and for the ones that are big and heavy I stick a cake pop stick into it so that way it holds up and it doesn't

this is a how-to from our brand new cookbook everything sweet I hope you enjoy hi I'm Alex and I'm Stacy and we're the meringue out these are some of our favorite recipes from our brand new cookbook everything sweet feast your eyes upon unusual edible gifts cool confectionery and delicious things and all colors of the rainbow we've fallen in love with the mass brothers chocolate bars and their beautiful packaging and wanted to create our own mg personalized chocolate bars with marbled our own paper to wrap our chocolate bars at which is deceptively simple and it produces a really cool psychedelic effect man we've also pimped out our own psychedelic splattered chocolate bar we just need a deep baking tray some tap water and some marbling tanks which really is to get their oil base you just spread them all over the surface and they come to the top and you can just get really creative all colors of the rainbow just some thin my cards place it carefully on top when loving coloring my chocolate at the moment so for the spread of chocolate bars here's what you'll need screen check this now tempering is the process that stabilizes the cocoa butter in the chocolate and when it sets gives it that lovely crisp crack if you melt chocolate without tempering and it sets you'll often get a gray streaky effect which isn't very pretty so we used to be scared of tempering chocolate as it seems like a fiddly and really difficult thing to do but that just isn't there are two methods in our book proper tempering and cheeps tempering the original chocolate maker did all the hard work so you just need to keep that temperature low all good quality chocolate bars have been tempered already you can tell if they have there's a nice clean snap we use tempered chocolate drops in the bakery because they heat consistently and quickly but if you are using a chocolate bar or chocolate bars then make sure you drop them really really finely and you can check it in a food processor if you have loads but chopping that was fine basically the finer the bitter because you have to apply less heat to them so to temper your chocolate you just want to add about 2/3 of your finely grated chocolate so plastic microwave for last few that's too much heat you just do this by eye the other third that's left in the bowl is left as the seed that's going to help temper your chocolate now it's melted I'm just gonna add the remaining third and give it a good stir until it all comes together and then that template now it's time to color our white chocolate so you want we've chosen pink purple and blue today so we're going to add a touch of white chocolate to one jar a touch to the other and then leave the rest in our jug for the full white chocolate effect so now I'm gonna add a bit of purple food coloring to my jar and you don't want to add too much you just want to add little by little and it's quite nice to have it a little bit marbly as well not not brought it all the way through and then it's a matter of splattering your Jackson Pollock on yes and you just set that road really quickly it will take about ten minutes in a cool place before you add your way so here's one that's it that we special earlier so we're gonna top all of our molds with our lovely white chocolate and then once that's all in there we're going to set that aside to sit and we've got a completely finished one here and I'm just gonna to the glory moment ah if one laughs you don't want to hold back care get them on there it is the most luxury we'll take your other half", "aaU0OHUqJP4": "we're making the

pretty easily there's a restaurant supply shop so tell us about the white chocolate how do we get it so delicious so when you get your white chocolates gonna be solid and you have to put it in the microwave for 30 seconds every 30 seconds you turn you take it out and you stir it to make sure it doesn't burn and at the end you have these little creamy gooey goodness oh my god I cannot wait first

Crunch when I saw your machi bar I was like this is a dream of mine it's all 90s throwback candy the first time I actually tried the bar it really brought me back in my time like when I was a kid and going to get yeah oh yeah the next step is we'll put some nerds in there all right I'm gonna do this one any color you want but make sure you don't put too many nerds because it is kind of hard that you want so you don't want to break anything you add some sour gummies as accent because it's really chewy apps so we'll probably put like you know one on each corner or something just to make sure

reviews so if you're new here please hit that subscribe button today we're checking out some candy bars from fye so i was walking through the mall and i went by fye if you're not familiar with the fye you'll you see a store in the mall using most malls have this store and they got a lot of cool unique items in in there they had a big sign on it um new avatar last airbender candy bars so i got all four of these and if you're wondering what the price is they were 3.99 a piece so four bucks a piece for these candy bars so not cheap so i got four candy bars here um the last avatar the avatar the last airbender candy bars here um one from each of the different tribes nations um so if you're not familiar with the last airbender it was on you know nickelodeon for three years from like 2005 to 2008 so we have four different ones so we have from the fire nation we have spicy fire which is jalapeno peanut milk chocolate sounds pretty good from the air nomads we have air blast popping candy milk chocolate not sure what that one is but that sounds interesting from the earth kingdom we have earth crunch toffee and caramel milk chocolate that sounds delicious and then from the water tribes we have cool water a mint white confection we'll see about that i'm not a big fan of mint chocolate so maybe we should i think i don't know which one we can do first i think we'll just get this one out of the way first because i'm not a big fan of it uh let's take a close-up look at the candy bar actually let me show you up here it's a cool looking package you know wrapper on there uh three servings per container 160 calories per serving nine grams of fat it's a three ounce candy bar oh it's broken why is it gonna be broken man oh yeah i can smell that mint right away i know i'm not gonna like this one i guess it doesn't really matter there's no no design on the candy bar itself i'm just i'm just going to take a tiny half a piece because i do not like mint at all in chocolate that's actually not bad at all it's not super minty it's not overly minty because i could read that let me take it out of the actual wrapper so i can read it again a mint white confection that's maybe that's what's taste making it taste a little better because it's mint but yet i think it's a white chocolate in here so you're getting that taste of that white chocolate with the mint so at least for me it makes it taste a little better i'm gonna actually go for another bite it's stuck to my finger let me get another piece all right i actually really like that one it's minty at first then you get like a white chocolate taste and then the mint comes around a little bit at the end that's a pretty good one i thought i was gonna hate this one i'm pleasantly surprised i really like that one and i will eat more of that candy bar later that was actually really good earthquake sounds really good let's try this um from the air nomads the air blast popping candy milk chocolate i don't know what that is let's see if the nutrition is any different on these this is 140 calories per serving 140 here 150 so this one was the most calories 160 in that if you're concerned about that i think if you're buying a chocolate candy bar especially this big you're not super concerned with the calories okay this one's not broken take it out of the actual wrapper so i can read that well it is broken and again no design on them so kind of wish there was like a picture of the avatar or whatever on there all right popping candy and just by looking at it i think what this is and i didn't even show you the wrapper i'll get you the wrapper sorry about that air blast i think this is a like a nestle crunch bar you know how is that those little whatever they are in there i think this is what this is it is that's what the popping is is a nestle crunch bar but not as good like something about this chocolate in this bar i don't know maybe it's from going from the mint to that one why it made it taste kind of strange at first it is basically a nestle crunch bar it's just not as not as good as a nutsy crunch bottle actually i think i like the mint one better than i like this one this isn't bad it'll still get eaten i mean i'm not saying it's horrible just like if i want a candy bar like this i would just get a nestle crunch i think a nested crunch is better tasting than this one so yeah surprising right now the one that i thought was gonna be the worst is the best grant it's out of two but we're gonna save the spicy one to last okay so the earth kingdom look at their wrapper earth crunch toffee and caramel so this one i would say i think is going to be the best i hope it's the best i like caramel i like toffee same i don't know it must be something about that chocolate just it just smelled stinky at first but it really isn't it's just the smell of that chocolate really toffee really stands out in it let me get a bigger bite what is going on mmm i'm using water after that i don't know if it's look inside the candy bar like there's a look in the middle it just looks like a normal candy bar like you get the toffee right away you get that toffee flavor then as you're eating it and i don't know if it's the caramel that's coming through but it gets like really oily in your mouth and i can still taste it like and i think that's the caramel flavoring that they put in it but it's almost like a man it's coating the inside of my mouth like it leaves your whole mouth feeling weird because it's like this caramel oily taste in your mouth and it's not good like that's the worst one the airbenders are the airbenders are playing a trick on me right now because the one i thought was gonna be worst is so far the best the one that i thought was gonna be the best is the worst this one i'm just hoping is hot i don't know if i jalapeno peanut i don't know if it's going to be good or not hopefully there's chunks of peanuts in here or something the way these have been going i have a feeling this is just going to be probably nasty but we'll see here's a look at the fire nation candy bar there the wrapper spicy fire so hope it has some good heat in it what is in the ingredients that could cause the heat jalapeno powder okay finally one that isn't broken smell peanuts i don't smell um jalapeno no heat so far no taste of jalapenos so far little tiny pieces of peanut in there as you can see i'm just gonna give it a minute starting to get a little heat in the back of the throat slowly building it's not let me go for another piece it's not overly hot like when you're chewing it you don't taste it that's a pretty decent one actually um i thought maybe the jalapeno taste would throw it off i don't taste the jalapeno on it it just tastes like a a milk chocolate bar with tiny pieces of peanut and then you get a little heat afterwards like sitting here now just the tiniest bit in the back of the throat so just a slight bit of spice in it that's a decent one that's probably my second favorite again the mint the one i thought was gonna be the worst the oh falling out of the wrapper so i'm gonna flip it over here the cool water mint one is the best so i'm gonna rank them here you can kind of see them i don't i can't pick them up because they're they're all gonna fall out so cool mint was number one spicy fire number two um then the last two like this is just kind of blah nothing great about it that was what i thought was gonna be the best is just weird like that what it does the inside of your mouth do not like that one do not recommend it but try all the form up let me know in the comments what do you think of these where do you rank them did you experience what you i experienced with the earth crunch i mean did you get that nastiness in your mouth cool mint i maybe i am a mint candy bar like i don't i don't know like i said at the beginning of the video if you're new here please hit that subscribe button hit that bell notification so you're notified every time i upload new video and i'll see you guys next time i'm gonna have to have a little more mint here a little piece of mint it's actually really good like i said immediately when i bite into it i get that mint taste i'm like i'm not gonna like it but then you get like a white chocolate taste with a slight bit of it that's what makes it good because i'm a fan of white chocolate if you're not a fan of white chocolate you probably won't like that one but i am i really like white chocolate so that's why i really like that one shocked i'm shocked at how these went was not what i thought when i read what was in them i thought for sure i'd really like that one and i hate that one but now i really like that one and hate that one i'll see you guys next time", "bYznjOzvSoM": "I'm Shirley Preston and I'm tutor of chocolate-making here at the school of artisan food and today we're going to make lots of lovely chocolate recipes that you can make at home we're going to make hand poured chocolate bars and hand roll truffles so that you can have perfect results every time I'm going to show you how to make a very very simple chocolate bar in our jug here we have some lovely tempered chocolate and it's a beautiful grenade and chocolate which tends to be quite fruity but also a little bit spicy and it goes very very well with a Japanese citrus fruit called yuzu and in here I have the extract of the yuzu rind in essential oil format essential oils are really wonderful for working with solid chocolate because it's an oil-based product going into the chocolate which you've got lovely fats for the cocoa butter so they're completely compatible they're very very very concentrated so you may need one two or three drops depending on how much chocolate you have I have a few hundred grams in here so I'm just going to pop two drops of essential oil into the chocolate give the chocolate a very very good stir so our chocolate is now beautifully perfumed with a yuzu oil I'm just going to set it aside for one second this is a domestic chocolate bar mold they're very cheap they'll probably last you a couple of years for domestic chocolate making if you want to invest in some more robust moulds you'd look for polycarbonate versions but these do just the same job and you'll get some lovely chocolate bars from this mold pop your chocolate bar onto a scale the manufacturer of the mold will tell you what each cavity is so in this case it's about 80 to 85 grams so very very simply I'm going to pour 80 to 85 grams of chocolate into each cavity now you need to work quite quickly you very simply move the chocolate bar mold left and right and backwards and forwards until you can see the chocolate just starts to find its own level you've got no chocolate running over the sides you can see underneath that the chocolate is all filled so we're going to bang the chocolate bar mold now onto the bench to disperse any stubborn little bubbles that might be lurking around in there it actually helps if you drop it what goes very very well with this chocolate is raw cacao nibs these are just tiny little fragments of the cocoa bean that's being roasted and they are really really delicious so very very simply you can do this with anything you like you may want to put chopped nuts on the back rose petals confit orange candied fruits whatever you like whatever you think goes well with the kind of flavor and it just adds an extra little something to your chocolate bar so that's it you've poured chocolate bars I'm just going to wait for these now to form a slight skin over the top before I put them in the fridge and the way I can tell that is that the surface of the chocolate will become slightly more dull in finish and as soon as that's ready I'm going to put them in the fridge and take them out in about 15 to 20 minutes once the bars of set chocolate bars have had a cooling and resting time in the fridge for about 20 minutes and they're now ready one of the reasons I can tell that they're ready is that if I move the chocolate bar mold backwards and pours in letting on I can actually feel them moving around that means that the chocolate is contracted enough to move away from the mold so we can flip them out and we've then finished our chocolate bars so usually we do this away from us so if you take the mold just up to your board and then you literally just flip an outcome your chocolate bars so now we've got this lovely grenade and chocolate perfumed with the gorgeous yuzu which will impress absolutely anybody you know again very very simple to make you follow the tempering method flavor with oil and there you go beautiful yuzu flavored chocolate bars you", "wFoRL5W8Eic": "Hayami people we are making grow vegan milk

the comments below how does it turn out for you bye bye have a yummy day", "9clDFpcqkSQ": "so we've been sent some protein bars and we are going to put them to the test in that classic old-school game of does the protein bar taste the same as its chocolate quibbling classic game so I suppose the prevailing presumption with with your protein bars is that they're not particularly tasty and what most of you'll notice will operator bars is they actually tend to look quite different to their chocolate counterparts so we thought today we try out a blindfold taste test to see if that really matters yes so I have the standard Travel Mart perfect for blindfolded Taylor sublime perfect and I've got this which is an old musette which we've somehow managed to turn into a blindfold so we'll see how that goes bring in the goods bring in the goodies [Music] I think that I think that's a protein Mars I would say so - pretty much yeah you could just kind of tell well though it's actually when I first Bend I was like he did taste a lot like normal Mars but that doesn't do you realize when you start you can't stop cheering it's kind of realized once you start you can't stop it's true - hmm yeah yeah that that's definitely a muumuu that's a regular Mars bar yeah it's a little sweeter it just kind of like mmm you one of my favorite chocolate bars I'll keep that in mind for what about your birthday present thank you hmm cannot coconut very light and sweet easy easy so chewy Jesus this is not what bounties wish to be no it doesn't really take some coconut no there's like a slight pinch same great way that protein - Hank over on the coconut taste scale that's like two out of ten yeah that's really that's been just dense that is not how my beloved bouncy should taste no no good God are you a big fan of Snickers then Holly Snickers is my favorite yeah not your favorite number favorite nut laughs oh [Music] god not show brings back lots of memories quite active I'll put good money on that being a regular Snickers oh I think what yeah how I don't know I just think I think it might be definitely not Oh - see no there's too many nuts in it not too good for you though there's not so good for you yeah there's protein so it would it would it make it easier to conceal yeah that's true [Music] I would say yeah I would stick and say that's the normal one that's the actual one and the other one was the protein have you have you thrown a curveball reg what is that but the samples Mester everything missing around the samples this is outrageous I would say that was a that was a Snickers with the eyes and the actual Snickers no one before was protein no I think both was actual Snickers Oh contentious yes as he had mix them around I'm confused but you said yeah I said that one so there you go so that's the taste test done and the results were I'm not particularly surprising yeah well then no I would agree and I felt well actually I was slight surprised by how good some were yeah I was also not surprised for how bad some work yeah so let's let's rank them then in order of taste right yeah yeah taste yeah well I was about whether we could tell but let's make it into about takes that's a good good idea good idea so what'd your let's go from the bottom up so what worse one by a mile was the bounty protein I mean it doesn't even look like bouncy I don't know what that is but that's certainly not bouncy no good so that's going down here next for me the Mars protein was just a bit mad okay why why she thought it was quite nice I owners a pleasantly surprised by how much it tastes like the original thing but when you tasted the Snickers protein you're like yeah exactly so it kind of depends like so we put both bounces down there bounces are a bit that's outrageous and then we go with Mars the regular Mars bar no the protein-protein Mars bar in most of our seconds yeah which leaves which leaves as you'd expect what everyone loves the Snickers right so much thank you Snickers go be right there I mean you can see it there's literally none left compared to the others yeah so it went down a treat so the top three from CPE ah the regular snake is it isn't the protein bar the Mars bar which isn't protein and the Snickers Snickers protein protein bar which is actually pretty tasty I mean who needs protein on the right when you have real Snickers I'm ready let's do a Top Trumps of Snickers versus the stickers protein six in here that's a good effort nine point five and salt salts we got dessert way cool Northpoint 3 3 so Craig's the sorbet so yeah if you're looking for something tastier than your regular protein bar but not as how if you say calorific as you know the Snickers bar then it's NYX protein bar is probably a good show I'd say yeah and let us know if you have actually used any of these and how you're getting on we want to know do they melt like you would expect from the normal regular bar in your back pocket presumably during a hot summer's day they just melt into nothing or they could just be like the science you know it just somehow anti melting bars yeah yeah exactly exactly and do you ever sneak a regular one in place of the protein one as a little tree last night yeah yeah yeah sound good is a beauty [Music]", "Zjd40aWNuFo": "Welcome to How To Cook That I'm Ann Reardon\nand today we are making these beautiful filled\nchocolate blocks using simple things that you have at home. We've got s'mores, rosemary and almond, orange\ncaramel and coffee caramel. To make the s'mores block you need chocolate\n- and it needs to be tempered - marshmallows, gram crackers and something to make your blocks\nin. Now you can buy expensive chocolate molds\nor just use something that you already have at home like this container lid which has\nquite nice rounded corners and a bit of line around it, that might make it a bit tricky\nto get it out but we'll see how we go. Pour you tempered chocolate into the container\n- now I have a video called chocolate secrets that shows you have to temper chocolate at\nhome in all different ways and I'll put that video and all the recipe quantities on the\nhowtocookthat.net website for you and I'll link to that below. Make sure your chocolate is covering all of\nthe edges, and then flip it over and let the excess drip out onto some baking paper. By doing this you get left with just a thin\nlining of chocolate all the way around the outside. Smooth along the top edges using a spatula. Add in some gram crackers cut to size so that\nthey fit in there roughly. You want to do this before the chocolate sets\nso the cracker is actually stuck to the chocolate. Place your marshmallows in a bowl and microwave\nthem on high for about 30 seconds until they are melted. And then just put a spoonful on there and\nspread it out over the crackers so that you get a nice layer of marshmallow. You can make this as thick as you like it\njust depends on how thick your container is. Pour more chocolate over the top and gently\ntap to get rid of any air bubbles, then use your spatula to flatten out the edge using\nthe top of your container as your guide. Once it is set flip it out of the container\nand tip it out of your mold. To make the rosemary and almond block you\nwill need salt, water, fresh rosemary, cream, white chocolate, oil and ground almonds. Place the fresh rosemary in the oil and then\nheat that oil up just to release the rosemary flavour. Give it a stir and leave it to infuse for\naround 15 minutes for the flavour to really infuse. Tip the salt into the water and heat that\nup just to dissolve the salt crystals. Place the chocolate, salty water and cream\ninto a bowl and heat that in the microwave for 30 seconds and then stir it really well,\nbecause microwaves heat unevenly. And if you don't stir it will burn in one\nspot. Keep heating it and stirring until it is completely\nmelted. Strain the rosemary oil through a sieve and\nadd the almond meal on top of that. Now stir it really well and you'll see the\nalmond meal gives it a bit of a grainy texture. If you want it smoother you can blitz it with\na stick mixer. And if you have one of those you can also\nadd in the sprigs of rosemary for a stronger flavour. If you're not going to blitz it like this\nyou can just add way more rosemary into the oil so you get that sort of stronger flavour\njust from the infusion. Tip your tempered chocolate into the container\nand spread it out. And then flip it over like we did before. If you have a professional mold you can use\nthat, they are a bit easier to use because they have the flat top all the way around\nthe edge so you can easily scrape the extra chocolate into the bowl. Once the base is set use a piping bag to fill\neach cavity in your block And I am excited to announce the launch of\nmy very own limited edition line of nail wraps in collaboration with Jamberry. I've been keeping this a secret from you for\na while during the design process so it's good to finally tell you. These cute ones are called 'Sprinkled Love'\nand there are several different wraps in the HowToCookThat range and I'll link you to those\nbelow. I've also added an embellishment to this one\nand you can get those online too. Spread the filling out to flatten it so it\nis not above the top of the mold. If you're using a container then just pipe\na layer of the filling into the mold, making sure you don't get it up the sides. Top that with more tempered chocolate and\nsmooth off the top using a spatula. And then once that is set yes that's right\njust tip it out of the container. Now we to make it look different from the\ns'mores one or we won't know what's inside it so take some white chocolate and drizzle\nit back and forth over the top. To make the yuuuummy coffee caramel filling\nyou need sugar, butter, water, cream, glucose syrup and ground coffee. Add the water to the sugar and the cream into\nthe coffee. Tip in the glucose syrup to the coffee too,\nnow you can use corn syrup if you don't have glucose where you live. Heat that up in the microwave to make it hot. Just give it a stir and leave it to one side. And then heat the sugar and water over high\nheat. Once it is boiling wash down the sides of\nthe pan using a wet pastry brush to get off any sugar crystals off. And then once it is browned and bubbling,\nadd in the butter, stir well and then remove from the heat. Strain the coffee through a fine cloth, squeezing\nit to get out lots of that flavour. Now if you'd rather you can use instant coffee. This caramel is quite strong and a little\nbit bitter but once it is in with the sweet chocolate it balances out well. Stir those together and then test the thickness\nof your caramel by putting a small amount of it onto a cold surface. And see how this one is setting very firm\nstraight away, I want it a bit thinner than that so I am just going to add in a bit more\ncream to the caramel and stir it through. And then just test it again. Put a bit more on the counter and have have\na look at the consistency of it and keep doing that until you are happy with it. For this one I am using a chocolate transfer\nsheet to add some colour, now they are just coloured cocoa butter patterns on some acetate\nand when you pour on the chocolate the coca butter melts onto the warm chocolate. And then when it sets it will be in the chocolate. And this time I am using dark chocolate, if\nyou want you can use milk or white that's totally fine it depends what you like. Spread it out, now I don't want to tip this\none upside down because I don't want the transfer sheet to come out. So i am just spreading it up the sides. And then press down your caramel between some\nbaking paper. And you want to try and make a square shape\nthe right size for our chocolate block. Then just pick it up and gently add it onto\nyour chocolate and top it with more tempered chocolate over the top. Tap it to get rid of any air bubbles that\nyou've got in there. Once it is set, tip it out and then just peel\noff that acetate sheet and the coloured cocoa butter is now part of the chocolate. For the delicious orange caramel block you\nneed sugar, one orange, white chocolate, cream and water. Grate the rind from the orange, now when you\ndo this you just want a thin layer of the orange coloured part, you don't want any white\nor it will not taste nice. Add that into your cream and stir it around\nand heat it until it nearly boils, and then leave that for the flavour of the orange rind\nto infuse into the cream. In a pan heat the sugar and glucose syrup\nuntil it just starts to go brown. Strain the cream through a sieve to get rid\nof that rind so we've just got the flavoured cream going through. And then add in the juice from half of your\norange and stir that well. Mix in your white chocolate, stirring until\nit is all melted. Then place some on that on the counter to\ncheck the consistency just like we did before. This one is quite a soft filling, and I'm\nhappy with that consistency so I'm not adding any more to it. I have a pretty striped transfer sheet that\nI'm going to use for this one. Spread the chocolate out along the base and\nup the sides. Once that is set pipe in a layer of the soft\norange caramel filling across the centre. Then top it off with more chocolate to seal\nit in. If you don't have a spatula you can use the\nback of a knife to smooth off the top edge. And then once that is set, tip it out and\njust peel off the acetate. And there you have four hand-made blocks of\nchocolate which are great for gifts and absolutely delicious.

a set of the original chocolate which comes with pistachios and cranberries and then you're also gonna get peanut butter delight 12 of each we don't have to make a choice always tell us there was a great story to Joe Joe you know I grew up loving chocolate so many of us love chocolate but there's chocolate bars we grew up on and then there's really thoughtful chocolate so let me introduce you and take you to Joe Joe Joe Joe is a mom who was struggling with breast cancer sadly enough and she loved her sweets especially her chocolate but what she found is those chocolate cravings in the chocolate that she was eating were just there were so many carbs in him and so many grams of sugar it was just causing her much distress so was a mother to do a mother goes into her own kitchen and creates her own perfect chocolate bar chocolate that we love may I say 70% Casal imported dark chocolate from Germany it is so smooth and so creamy and then if that's not enough she took a plant-based protein mixed a plant-based protein that does nothing except add great protein to this bar and then she started it with roasted pistachios and almonds from California and cranberries in one and then on the other side for the peanuts we've got that dark chocolate and it is loaded with roasted peanuts on here so now what you have you have the opportunity to kick the craving you can enjoy the chocolate you can get the antioxidants that everybody wants them a chocolate bar with now now come with me here okay six grams of sugar for the peanut butter and eight grams of sugar for the whole bar your kitty know a whole bar the highness grams of sugar for the peanut butter delight and eight grams of sugar for this delicious beautiful chocolate chocolate bar and I have to tell you for people who are needing more plant-based diets that are looking for food as nutrition wholesome ingredients now is the chocolate of choice especially at 70 percent level and to be able to find it with such a low sugar content is amazing especially if you have to watch your sugar points look at the bottom look at the box alright think about this a whole chocolate bar and mind you this is so rich and creamy and dense it's something you're gonna break off little pieces to treat yourself throughout the day 160 calories for the entire bar 5 grams of protein and then at 6 to 8 grams of sugar and here look at this this is spring I gotta break it with two hands you hear that okay look at how the fact that chocolate is loaded with peanuts snaps take a bite dark chocolate is my favorite and all together over one and a half pounds of chocolate come together in all of these bars is that not good Wow how about that this is surprisingly decadent and amazing and delicious there is no sweetness missing in this nope not even though it has all these smoger benefits doing mm-hmm and I have to tell you this is so rich mm-hmm I probably only need to eat this portion of this bar to tackle my craving whether it's I just need it with a cup of coffee as an afternoon pick-me-up you had a lot of garlic and a pasta dish and I need that darn lip to offset that for dessert so this one little bar packs a lot of savory in it that you may only eat half or a portion and continue I want to show you what you're getting it averages out to about a dollar 66 a bar you can't be at the checkout every store pick up a traditional chocolate bar for that price and then you get way more sugar in those bars and you do hear way more so here is the 12 of the original chocolate that has the pistachios and the cranberries and you also get 12 of the peanut butter delight they're gluten-free again plant-based proteins they're brand-new for you today you've never seen these before less than $40 if you have a cute card in order with that now you're getting three easy payments to get them home and try for $13 and change Wow satisfy your sugar cravings and rethink what you think about chocolate this is the kind of chocolate Stacy that you would expect to find in a gourmet chocolate house because it's imported from Germany how about a mom a mom who's in distress a mom who's not feeling well but at the same time she has sugar cravings so she takes her own situation and decides to do something better for everybody what have we learned about chocolate what do we know about chocolate we'll rethink the chocolate bars that you had as a kid and then we all love those and think about the benefits of chocolate but at the same time is satisfaction so we go down here in the front and we take a little peek at all of the ingredients that are in these bars they're simple you can read the ingredients on the wrapper check this out look behind the check ingredients it's not gonna be one of these long things for ingredients there's about five simple ingredients in here so look at ingredients you've got and here's the little buds we started with everybody was testing these today you'd be surprised 70% cacao what does that mean that means you've got a really great antioxidant level in there you're not just eating chocolate you're picking a really sensible snack for your heart and for all of you but look at this studded with these fresh roasted nuts so loaded with pistachios total source of antioxidants and minerals and vitamins next to that you've got those big chewy cranberries everybody knows the health benefits the vitamins and minerals and antioxidants and cranberries then you've got fresh roasted almonds and that debt get it shocked with in Germany and then down here on the end roasted peanuts combined with this chocolate because you still get that delicious sweetness makes that taste like you are eating a peanut butter cup alright I don't know my Michael picked this up but snap its snaps like that you did matter it I have to tell you this tastes like the finest artisanal chocolate mm-hmm I also want to point out that I remember there was a time when I was trying to lose a little bit of weight and a doctor recommended cut out the sugar in your diet yeah and I said but so much there's so much hidden sugar and everything he said try to eat anything with 8 grams of sugar or less don't go over eight grams so what do I do I go to the store I start getting oh how about some some Greek yogurt maybe with a little bit of natural fruit in it I looked at the sugar content on something that sounded healthy like a smart choice and it would be 20 grams of sugar 18 grams of sugar yeah this is that eight gram yeah that I was told is that is the good mark of enough sugar for your body and I'm totally eating a chocolate bar but take another bite here's the thing you're getting that plant-based protein all the way through why is it important because protein really fills you up you want to get more from a taste of candy or a taste of chocolate and a protein is gonna fill you up and then the nuts that are studded in here and look at the side this is a nice thick bar a nice thick bar break it into little pieces as you will look at that and so so good rich and decadent there's no way that I could even eat not a mole bar it's it's too much no it's that good I'm gonna go over here dan and Mary are guinea pigs only because it's brand new we've never seen it before both of them are amazing person you are - okay love dog this is phenomenal it is so good and rich and you can't tell that there's only eight grams of sugar right never would have known and the chocolate is so creamy and then with that little crunch and the nuts on top this is amazing yeah this is amazed you think you could even get through a whole bar of this no because it no it is that's fine it definitely that dark chocolate my gosh this would be perfect because I'm such a fan of your meatballs Oh mmm after like a red pasta sauce the meatball Italian meal to have this kind of dog chocolate to top it off with a little spice okay I'll let you guys enjoy thank you thank you I want to show you everything you're getting and I'm so glad after they're gonna see the original chocolate yeah the stash iou's and cranberries hmm I don't have to make a choice because I will never be able to pick between the two because they're both awesome so you're getting 24 individually wrapped bars here is the 12 of the original with the pistachio and cranberries you can see here and then behind that the 12 of the peanut butter delight bars remember a dollar 66 a bar it's a sensible choice it's indulgent either six to eight grams of sugar which is so key if you're trying to cut back on sugar that is the magic number eight or under and you're getting it something that you don't feel like you're sacrificing the thing you think you're you're eating the finest shipped from Belgium shipped from Europe chocolate because it's German inspired chocolate yep and you're just you're kicking the craving I mean you get your sweet tooth satisfied nice key sandwiches bottom okay so let's let's talk about my story for a second here I think a lot of you know I have I have issues with my heart and the first thing your cardiologist says to you is diet diet diet diet you have to kind of watch everything but when you really start to research what it is that it's a good choice for your heart you know fiber is really important you know proteins really important but those antioxidants that letter a that begins the alphabet it's all about antioxidants it's about not giving up the things that you like I have always loved chocolate but I look at it in a new way now but it also has to be delicious when you're getting 70% cacao in an imported chocolate which is delicious it's got to be delicious all of these roasted nuts which are loaded with antioxidants nuts and peanuts and the cranberries in here you get satisfied you get to kick the cravings you don't have to worry about looking at the label and saying oh my gosh the sugar grams I can have one little bite and then I'm out the door the whole bar six grams of sugar and the peanut butter of delight eight grams of sugar in the in the chocolate bark right here and the calorie 160 calories sixty calories can I just tell you this we love when we got to a fine restaurant to get the molten lava chocolate cake yeah the decadent most rich luscious mm-hmm because I need that chocolate craving mm-hmm this has that flavor profile that much of a chocolate impact but I know that he's a lava cake his 160 calories have I ate that whole thing yeah we could easily double if not triple that and then there's the guilt that steps in behind it's loaded with sugar to get that flavor JoJo's gives you that flavor without all the grams of sugar so we're making smarter snacking choices you need to feel good about and individually wrapped with 24 to go keep some in your purse keeps them at the office so when that craving hits boom you just pull out your JoJo's when you're satisfied I'm feeling she is doing great by the way so he's doing great

don't let chocolate at once trick or treat no I know so that's why you made this is the final result you can make big ones and then later on will be harder a little bit harder but will never call really really hard like as you can see all the natural oils of the chocolates coming out so this is all-natural organic chocolate taken from the tree now I know here in Nicaragua they don't mix raisins and nuts with it but do you think that you could probably mix some raisins and nuts or do whatever you want with it hey did you come food so nuts in it might be good mmm almonds or whatever you want it's good just like that - yep so good so now I'm going to eat some chocolate Oh", "5IbBzT0UnEM": "Welcome to HOW TO COOK THAT I'm Ann Reardon And today we are making a giant Hershey's\nKiss We started this Giant Series a couple of years\nnow and I make giant candy bars and give them to people who are doing giant things. We've done a Snickers, Kit Kat, Ferrero Rocher,\nMars bar and a Twix. I'll link to that playlist with all of those\nvideos at the end... You're are going to love who we give this\none to today. To make your giant Cookies and Cream Hershey's\nKiss you will need loads of cookies of course ... and heaps of white chocolate, more than\nthis, I am just going to melt it in batches. I'll put all the recipe quantities on the\nhowtocookthat.net website for you. Melt and temper your white chocolate. If you don't temper it it won't set firm at\nroom temperature. I have a video called chocolate secrets that\nshows you how to temper chocolate so you can watch that one and make sure you get it right. Now for the shape of a Hershey's Kiss we are\ngoing to need a mold. The closest thing I could find is a huge funnel. I got this at a car supply store. It's got a few bumps that we don't want because\nthe kiss is more rounded shape but what we'll do is just shave some chocolate off once it's\nset to make it match. And we obviously we're going to need to block\nthe end. So take some blue tak and place it over the\nend and press it on firmly. Then put the whole thing upside down into\na container to hold it upright. Ladle some of your tempered chocolate into\nthe funnel and along the sides. You want to make sure you are using real chocolate\nthat contains cocoa butter. Compound chocolate just doesn't taste as good\nand if you're giving someone a giant gift you want it to taste amazing not just look\ngood. Add in your Oreos. Pressing some onto the sides so that you can\nsee them on the outside of the kiss. Add heaps of cookies and then more chocolate. The more cookies you add, the less chocolate\nyou will need because it's going to displace some of that chocolate there. Add more chocolate and more cookies. Temper another big bowl of chocolate and pour\nit in - this is going to be a huge Hershey's Kiss. If you need to add in some support to make\nit stand up straight. Then add more cookies to the top and push\nthem into the chocolate. Leave that at room temperature overnight so\nthe chocolate can set up properly all the way through. Then take your heavy chocolate filled funnel\nand tip it upside down. Give a little shake and it should just fall\nout, the weight of it there is helping it come out of the funnel. Now to make it the right shape. Use a knife and gently shave off some of the\nchocolate round the outside edge there. Try not to touch the chocolate with you fingers\njust hold it with some of the baking paper. We also need to get rid of this ridge at the\ntop. And I am going to use a potato peeler to shave\noff a layer at a time and make it smooth. Now we need the top to be rounded too, it's\na bit taller than we need so just carve into it and use your peeler to make it round. The funnel is also quite flat and the Kisses\nare more rounded or dip down, so if you want to you can use a knife to shave off a layer\nall the way around. I'm using the knife to shave it off and then\nusing the peeler smooth it out. Now you can use all these shavings down the\nbottom on top of ice cream or a dessert or on top of a cake. To make the wrapper take some foil and place\nanother sheet over the top, make sure they're nice and long. Fold it down once and flatten it out, then\nfold it over again, this will make our join. Once you've got that flattened, open it up\nand squash it down. Add a strip of Kisses to the middle I'll put\na PDF of this on the website so you can print your own. And position your Kiss right in the middle. Pull the foil up and then push onto the Kiss\nand smooth it around the shape. Then move around pulling the next section\nup and smoothing it on. Keep going like that, pulling it up and smooth\nit around the shape, leaving the paper sticking out on one side. If you have too much foil at the top you can\njust trim it off and then bend it around over the top. Continue all the away around lifting and smoothing. Then trim the paper a bit shorter. And there you have a giant Hersheys Kiss,\nlet's go give it to someone amazing. Today I have with me Lamont O'Neil from the\nNubian Gents. Lamont was a Spanish teacher in New York when\nhe noticed that some of his students were struggling with low self-esteem and had a\nlack of direction in their lives, so he thought he'd do something about it. He started a step dance group and 70 students\nsigned up and now they danced all around the world. Can you say welcome to How To Cook That in\nSpanish? Bienvenido a c\u00f3mo al cocinero que Apart from actually teaching them how to dance,\nwhich they do amazingly well, what are the other priorities - what are you trying to\nteach? Basically how to be men. Men of valour, men of integrity, how to make\nproductive decisions that are going to contribute to the communities within which they live. And that discipline, those things that you\nare teaching them are going to put them in good stead no matter what they are doing in\nlife? Definitely. We'd like to think that because they are so\nyoung that they haven't begun to experience things, negative experiences that are battering\ntheir self-esteem and self-image and their confidence, but it's real. I mean they can be as young as 10, 11, 12\nor 13 and dealing with some really strong things that are just constantly telling them\nthey are not worth it, that they have nothing of value to offer ... and I wanted to turn\nthat around. If you could say one thing to people who are\nsitting there saying that's how I feel, what would you say to them? I would say to them never allow a negative\nexperience to define you or to dictate the outcome of your lives. Choice is a powerful thing and you can choose\nto become imprisoned by circumstance or you can choose to make life work for you. I tell my students all the time, make it a\ngood day, make it a great day. Because you have the power of choice, always\nhave the power of choice. I love that - make it a great day. Make it a great day! That's awesome. On How To Cook That we have a special way\nof saying thankyou to people who have gone above and beyond and are doing amazing things. And so we have a gift for you, there's some\nvouchers in there and a Hershey's Kiss, do you like Hershey's Kisses? I love Hershey's Kisses! Great. And then we also have another gift so if you\njust undo the ribbon you should be able to just lift the box off the top. Gosh I feel like it's Christmas. And then it should just lift off. So this is a giant Hershey's Kiss! It's a little bit bigger than the other one. I want to see it! Wow! Awesome, that is so awesome. Oh man, oh man! It has Oreos in it. I know right. This is so cool. That's the touch right there - Oreos. This is amazing, tastes amazing. You can find out more about the Nubian Gents\non their website and I'll add a link to that below.

is you can put anything in there so anything you put in the cupboard seeds not stroyed food superfoods it's really fun so let's go ahead okay so in a chocolate bar reignited a put some deadline or dates pecan nuts cashew nuts and sunflower seeds the chocolate that I'm using is chuckle mighty war chocklit drops and I've had somebody melted in Banbury so let's go ahead okay so we're going to take some of the joy fruits and nuts and we're just going to chop everything up together you can do this in a blender if you want but we're going to have it quite rough and ready today so I'm just going to get cutting the dates are really nice because they come really chunky but you can also use raisins goji berries you know have fun with it even things like oats dates anything you find in cereal bars that's just fine okay the nice thing about this is you can leave some stuff chunky which is how I want to do it so I'm going to bring the mold here and we're literally just going to throw everything in you can use different things for different shape molds there we go and then we're going to pull the chocolate I don't want to get too thick which is nice and covered it's nice because every bite that you get that is different once that's poured in we're going to put in the fridge okay so we're going to put our mold in the fridge and let that stay for about fifty eggs and let's see how this chocolate bars come out then okay let's get okay so here's our chocolate bar I'm going to tip it out lovely I'm just going to go and hope I heat the knife under the hot tap so that we can slice through it let's cut through this I'm just going to cut some nice slabs it doesn't always cut evenly because of the knots and things oh okay you get a really hot knife you can come at it with me I think what I might do is cut this into pieces chunks what a nice cut down the middle here okay so let's open up see what it looks like you can seal the nutty fruity bits inside gorgeous so let's give

you today how to make this quick little box that's a slider box a pull on the ribbon and your chocolate or whatever you have inside comes out I actually didn't have any chocolate so I used one of my clear blocks anyway we'll get started it's quite easy and quite quick for you to make so you start off with a piece of card which is 21 by 18 which is about the width is the same size as a piece of a4 card if you're doing imperial I'll have those measurements on my blog so on the long side I'm going to turn my camera round so you can score at 8 centimeters nine and a half centimeters seventeen and a half centimeters and 19 centimeters so that's eight nine and a half seventeen and a half and 19 centimeters then you're going to do one quarter turn and you're going to score it at one and a half centimeters and that's the base of your box and then we just need to bring in our bone folder and we're going to burnish all those scores we just got to do a bit of trimming I like to trim a little bit of a be off the edges here bit of a triangle just so that time my box claps sick flat and straight and we're just going to trim that little bit of sir that beard so that's what your template looks like all right the next thing to do is to bring in a water and a pencil and I just eyeball it about a centimeter down and on the 8 centimeter panels you're going to put a mark at 4 centimeters on both of them and that's where we're going to cut our hole now I'm using Stampin ups retired corner II Chantell punch it's because it's handy you could use the cookie cutter pump there's a circle on that we have our holes through our ribbon now we're going to decorate our box now this big here with extra flap on it is going to bring the back of our box so we're going to decorate the front front so that fits they are decorate the next bit alright so what I've cut is a piece of candy cane line designer series paper choose seven and a half by fourteen and a half centimeters you could probably do it sister and that would work too and you could do it long enough if you wanted to and cut your hole through it I'm using also cut a piece of dance P which is seven and a half by two centimeters it's just that two centimeter which because I had that little bit left over from another project so this is a good project to use up some of your scraps is my decoration and I'm going to add two dimensional and I've just simply fussy cut that out of the designer series paper and it's quite easy to do with the hates us you cutting this house was a really quite easy and I chopped the candy canes off it all right now I'm putting that on a slope on dimensionals towards the left because we're going to make our tag next it swings out I just tucked it in under the reindeer photography purposes so I'm just going to put that to one side and I've got a piece of whisper white bead which measures five centimetres by about ten and a half centimetres and I'm just going to bring in the triple banner punch comes out and then the sculpt tag topper punch now stanton ops punches are really great then maybe that's so easy to do and then we've got our tag I'm going to add a bit of this gold Baker's twine that was in the trio pack from the holiday catalog it's on special at the moment seller for DSP so get it while it's around because once it's gone that's it you've got till the 20th of December I think and there are huge discounts at the moment so don't come miss out all right I'm just going to add a little tree that I've cut out also from a scrap from the DSP and I'm just adding this squeeze liquid blue and then I'm using real rich and I'm going to stand for to and from now I choose to add this first because I just find it easier to be able to skip that through the hole and sorry and not those edges up with a pair of snips so that's that bit now we're going to put our box together and it's quite easy so fold this piece you match the flap and this bits just going to go straight over like that so again I'm just using tombow and I like to put it close to the score mark and around so you get some good in there all right well that input that I want done all nice and neat all right then we're going to do the base of our box and I simply just turn those little tabs in put the back one in first and that's the one I'm going to add Bluetooth so just add some tombow to the back one so you need to tombow four and just hold it for a couple of seconds till it dries now I didn't have any chocolate and that's really quite hot today here so I'm going to use 3d block instead just for demonstration purposes so I like to spread my ribbon through the hole first and get the ribbon straight that straight through there and go just pull it through tulips about even just going to pop this clear block inside and this is what you do with your chocolate block or candy bar or whatever alright so slip it right down make sure you've got the goal twine to one side and it doesn't get caught up in your bowl and then you're just going to tie a bow all right nearly half cup chocolate slider box so there I've got two for gifts for Christmas you could put any candy bar it will sleep bar or packet of biscuits or something inside that here in Australia it's bit hot for chocolate this time of year but they make lovely gifts so thanks for stopping by bye for now hey if you

throw it in the microwave for about 30 seconds and you want to grab something to stir the chocolate with and after we do that we need to throw it back in the microwave for another 15 seconds you do not want to do it all at once because the chocolate might burn here it is after 15 seconds more and we made some yummy delicious melted milk chocolate yum yum yum next step fillings let's get some dry roasted peanuts if you're allergic to peanuts feel free to switch it out with anything else mmm one of my favorites looks good some M&Ms pour it all out cuz I want extra let's get some Oreos a fool or you might be a little hard to put into the mold so we'll crush it up like this mmm that Oreo smells so good alright now that we got all of our fillings taken care of let's make our first chocolate bar

and sugar but before I can make my chocolate bars I'll need to make their fillings today peanut butter is considered quintessential American with Americans consuming over 1 billion pounds of it every year but this is actually a pre recent development the peanut plant is believed to originate in South America where was used by the Incas and spread as far north as Mexico where it was known to be eaten by the Aztecs European explorers discovered the peanuts and spread it around Europe Africa and Asia where became key ingredients in many dishes especially in Africa despite being nearly everywhere else in the world peanuts never Lee made it further than Mexico until it was believed to eventually be brought over from Africa by slaves even then peanuts were initially not a very popular food until the 1800s is considered more of an animal feed however as a nutrient-dense food peanuts were frequently included in soldiers rations the popularity of peanuts generally increased after every major American War as soldiers returned home with the new acquired taste after the Civil War World War one and World War two peanuts and then peanut butter became huge commodities in America peanut butter itself made from crushed peanuts is believed to be made and eaten as early as by the Incans however it wasn't popularized until dr. Kellogg developed a version 1895 supposedly as a protein source for older people with poor teeth while the Aztecs had access to both cal beans and peanuts it's unknown when the first time chocolate and peanut butter were actually combined together but this infamous combo was first popularized in 1928 by Harry Burnett Reese's peanut butter cups while peanuts are most commonly grown in the southern US it is still possible to grow them here in Minnesota as well so over the course of last summer I grew my own peanuts and harvest them this fall all right so this is a peanut plant I planted earlier this summer and as you can see now it's growing up and got little peanuts growing out of it which like I know this is how peanuts are growing but it seems kind of weird that it's just a plant at the end of its roots our little peanuts after picking the peanuts you need to be washed insulted and lastly roast in the oven now they're roasted I need to manually remove the nuts from all the shells this took a while with my peanuts roasted and D shelled I headed over to local chocolatier et Miguel Rath for help making the peanut butter and caramel fillings for my chocolate bars so you guys are a chocolatier and not a chocolate maker not a chocolate maker so the distinction is chocolate ears work with chocolate to create confections and chocolate makers make the chocolate from being debar so I have my roasted peanuts so what's the next step in making my peanut butter peanut butters really it's really simple and it can be as complex and as varied as you like you know to move things along you can add peanut oil to make it sweeter you can add sugar you know if you wanted more flavor to pop you would add salt you know for us we add white chocolate and cocoa butter to make a feel a praline filling out of peanuts so my understanding of all of this is you've got to use what you've you can't just you can't throw in sugar or oil you've got to use what you've done so you know the way basically you're just going to put these in and you're going to puree them and essentially the oil should come out I'd start with that so now if you want to stop we'll take the lid off we'll take a look and see if you feel that you can kind of feel some of the oils are starting to come out it's probably and it's starting to smell they aromas coming out so that's good at this point I go ahead and add just a little bit more and it's going to take about five to ten minutes of you holding your hand there on that Robo COO so oil would alleviate this problem where you're starting to see this you're kind of the blades sort of riding over the top of it and it's sort of slowing this down but you can see now it's really starting to become more fluid and it's not fighting you as much yeah yeah that's your call whenever you want to whenever you feel it being fluid enough it's a bit smoother now yep since we're planning on using this in a candy bar do they usually sweeten the peanut butter more than or is it usually just well certainly like a Butterfinger or Reese's is like I wouldn't even hazard a guess as to the percentage of sugar - yeah I'm sure it's scientifically designed to be as tasty as possible do you mind if I taste it sure any glass of milk okay yep you can add a little bit of salt that will bring out just a pinch will bring out some of those notes that you have good yep I came through a little bit more yeah tastes like peanut butter yeah so that's the peanut butter you showed me how to make caramel Nexen yep absolutely so I have the sugar cane syrup I got Mexico I have honey that should work as a substitute you said for the corn syrup I have some of the butter I've made before using cow's milk and heavy cream separate from the cosmic also okay so that should work right uh well disclaimer I've never made caramel with sugar cane syrup but I you know it should work let's give it a try so the pole point of caramel is you're trying to remove the moisture so whatever is left by I don't know what will be left behind but what's left behind after a majority of the moisture is gone is what's going to caramelize so yeah maybe you start with two cups of your yep of the syrup and see what is left behind the larger the bubbles get and the higher the volume gets the less liquid you have in there's a concentration of sugar is getting much higher at this point so need to turn sugar into caramel is like an actual chemical changes happening yeah it's forming a structure so and it's forming chains once all the moisture is gone it's actually going to revert back into like a crystalline structure so it's basically now starting to form a structure there's almost no moisture left in it at this point as you can tell from the pot and it has that kind of caramel aroma that we're looking for mm-hmm it's very frothy right now yeah all right so if you want to pull it off that looks good to me before adding additional ingredients to the caramel we mix a little bit of the pure caramel ice sugar into some of the peanut butter in an attempt to make our butterfingers filling so this is essentially going to wind up being your filling and once that choc wants the caramel hardens up it's not enough to actually be a solid piece of sugar so that hopefully it's going to make the peanut be a little bit more brittle when you bite into it so now you're going to add your honey honey that's good I would go ahead and add your cream in your butter now once that comes to a boil we'll put it into a container and then it'll it takes you know several hours set up so technically all you really need for an actual caramel is the sugar right all you need for caramels sugar just like all you need for peanut butter is peanuts but it's all about the Flair that you're adding to it so it's all the cream and everything is that that adds to the taste and the texture and everything else definitely the cream and the butter is going to make it a little bit more malleable so you have that kind of soft caramel after five minutes of boiling the caramel reached the right temperature and texture so recorded edition buttered prevent it from sticky important the finished caramel looks really bubbly the recipe we just made here it's kind of a softer caramel what makes it something a soft caramel or a higher calm it's the temperature that you bring the caramel to I was talking about softball hardball thread stage hard crack all of that stuff and then the cream and the butter that you add are going to soften the caramel so if you were just to make we talked about you could make just straight sugar caramel you would use those stages that I talked about which are percentages of sugar to everything else to moisture essentially and that's going to determine the outcome of the the caramel by adding cream and butter you're making it creamier and you're making it more malleable by Nature so okay yeah all right so now I've made the peanut butter and the caramel and peanut butter caramel into your help so thanks so much", "dMtfvD2OY3g": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "EhGCm56nf2s": "hi everyone and welcome to Nicko's kitchens budget meals today we're going to be making some homemade bounty bars now the ingredients only cost me $8 sixty it serves twenty so purport it's only going to cost you forty cents so let's get started he's got budget meals Monday what you want Wednesday fast food Friday what is good share so guys the first thing that we're going to do to get started on our homemade bounty bars just into a saucepan over a low to medium heat I'm going to be placing in some butter and to the butter I'm going to be adding in some thickened cream next I'm going to be adding in some sugar and we're just going to mix this around and I want to cook this down for about five minutes over this low to medium heat just until that butter has melted and incorporated with the cream so it's been about five minutes and our cream butter sugar has all incorporated well and now I'm going to be adding in our desiccated coconut and we're just going to mix that well with the butter and cream until it starts to clump just like it is now so that's what we're after just like that when I clumps all together so we're going to turn the heat off completely so what I've got here is a square cake tin it's a deep-dish square cake tin and I've lined it with some baking paper and I'm going to be adding in our coconut mixture and just using the back of the spoon I want you to just press that coconut mixture out to the edges so what we're going to do now with our mixture when we flatten it out and try and get it as even as possible we're now going to put it into the fridge for five to six hours set or preferably overnight so guys I've just pulled out our coconut mixture from the fridge I'm just going to peel this back peel the baking paper off and check that out coconut goodness let me just show you on the side here so that we're looking at that sort of thickness just like that and all I want you to do now is just getting a knife I'm just going to be cutting it into slices and then once you've cut them into slices I'm going to be cutting it into thirds so we're going to cut here and here so this is what we're after in the end a chocolate bar sized bounty bar shaped just like that so I've got some milk chocolate here into a bowl and I've just broken it up into pieces now you've heard me say this a million times before we're going to pop it into the microwave put it in there for 15 to 20 seconds take it out stir it and just keep repeating that process until the chocolate has melted so we've melted our chocolate just check that out isn't that gorgeous okay now for the next step you want to have a baking tray lined with baking paper just like this so you don't need a fork as well and what I'm going to do is just place our coconut bar on the fork and just using the spoon here I'm just going to pour over that chocolate and just dip the bottom in pour it over and just get it coated but make sure you drip that excess off we don't want all that chocolate on there we just want a nice even coated layer now once we've coated them in chocolate we're going to pop them into the fridge for about 30 minutes until they've set until that chocolate has set now I've just pulled this out of the fridge now the next part is optional you don't have to do this and by no means is it legit to the bounty bar however it's just my little touch on it so if you don't want to do this part don't what I've got here is some dark melted chocolate same as before what we did with the milk chocolate and just using a small spoon all I'm going to do is just drizzle that chocolate just over the top and I'm just going to pop this back into the fridge just for another 10 minutes just until that sets so guys they have it there's my homemade bounty bars now from what I understand you can't buy bounty bars or the only place that you can't buy bounty bars is in the United States so for you guys in the US you can give this a go and make them at home for everyone else around the world from my understanding like I said you can compare them with the real deal now I've cut one open and I'm going to show you what they look like inside and just check that out you can see there it's all covered in chocolate and it just looks so yummy and just like the real deal so we're going to give this a try let's go Oh mmm they are exactly the same I'll tell you what they're better and they're and they're better because they're homemade as always the ingredients are below so you just want to try you will love it I guarantee it I'll see you Wednesday for what you want Wednesday so make sure you get your recipe requests either below in

free baking and welcome back to another food review if you're new here don't forget to hit that subscribe button so you don't miss anything today we are reviewing something I am very excited about recently I was strong through home bargains looking for some weird wonderful chocolate because for some reason they almost have weird and wonderful chocolate in there I stumbled across magnum chocolate bars who knew who knew magnum is renowned across the world for making gorgeous chocolate ice creams whether it's in tubs or more famously on sticks they're delicious pretty much every flavor is delicious and you can get them pretty much anywhere nowadays up until now I never even heard of Magnum making their own chocolate bar so I am super excited to try these three flavors today before I do let you know what your favorite flavor of Magnum is in the comments mine is the chocolate and almond one I'm obsessed so as you can see these bars come Infinity's different flavors they today I'm reviewing the white the classic milk and the dark chocolate varieties though I have heard whisperings of raspberry flavors and other sorts of delicious sounding stuff so I think I'm going to try the classic milk chocolate version first just as this is as it says the classic magnum chocolate so I believe these bars were somewhere between 1 & 2 pounds so not too expensive and not super cheap either and but it's very fancy we have this nice kind of cardboard packaging like we do with and lint bars or between the blocks you know something had a posh we have this nice gold foil printed with the Magnum logo I am so excited okay now first of all this is my kind of portion size usually when you open a huge shaving bag of chocolate it's split into like loads of tiny squares magnums like  it you've got two so like your portion one square is this I love it it smells delicious go ahead and try it it was never gonna be bad was it that tastes like seriously good stuff the high cocoa content makes it taste like a really good quality chocolate even though the smell didn't make me think of a magnum immediately usually because the smell of an actual knife and ice cream is kind of lightened up with that vanilla smell from the ice cream when you bite into it oh I'm holding it up when you bite into it you can really get that kind of Magnum taste obviously the chocolate on a magnum ice cream is really thin what is this is quite thick I'm very rich it's almost closer to dark chocolate milk chocolate which I love because I'm a lover of all shades of chocolate let's be honest this is great and so much that I'm already half way to opening the dark chocolate so let's just be iffy magnum dark chocolate get some out of baking Seal of Approval so this one has 50% cocoa solids so it's not a whole lot darker or richer and cocoa than the milk version again it's just an enormous double square chocolate bar this one smells very rich this dark Marvin chocolate bar also contains cocoa nibs or cacao nibs depending on how pretentious you're feeling which are basically the roasted shells of cocoa beans yeah I'm stopped YUM very rich it does taste almost darker than 50% and you get a gorgeous little crunch from the cocoa nibs and nothing to better though this is definitely a very adult tasting chocolate though so like I said it's not a bitter dark chocolate is a very sweet one the main ingredient is sugar so if you're not really a fan of dark chocolate but you feel like you want to be a bit bougie this could be a bottle for you yeah the textures great I mean because it's thin it mounts nicely but it's still kind of creamy you wouldn't need a lot of this one because it is rich and so dark but it is again it's down good let's move on to the most exciting one in my opinion the Magnum white chocolate with a hint of Madagascan vanilla YUM this is some fancy chocolate people home bargains have got their on point again it's just that gorgeous big giant slab with the M and blazoned on it and I'll give you a little close-up of this so you can see there are lots of actual real-life vanilla seeds in there people this is fancy so smelling it the main smell is vanilla rather than your usual kind of super sweet white chocolate smell it smells like posh white chocolate not necessarily like the ice cream but as we found with the first bar it might taste more like it than it smells like it so let's stop talking and why were these not in my life earlier big punch with sweet vanilla flavor there's lots of cocoa butter and then you can taste don't get me wrong it is very sweet it's it's just good you can tell it's a little bit fancier than the white chocolate they have on the actual Mike and I spoons as well just from the little vanilla pieces but the vanilla pieces kind of give you that reminiscent thing of biting into a bite Magnum personally if I'm eating a magnum I eat all the chocolate off of it first but some of you weirdos who bite straight in ice cream chocolate and everything all together that is the taste you would get it's giving you the vanilla from the ice cream as well as a white chocolate and it's just great like let's not beat around the bush here it's it's it's great it's delicious I am super impressed with all of these bars and rather than giving them an in I'm just gonna go ahead and just give these bars collectively a solid 5 out of 5 I didn't expect that either if you can't find them just buy a box of magnums and you'll be just as happy let's be a list if you enjoyed the video don't forget to drop me a thumbs up and hit that

today we're taking a look at another edible this time wonka bar edibles uh i had one of these over a year ago um but when i had it it was a bit fatter this way it was a bit wider and it was 500 milligrams instead of 300 and also they didn't have these um flavors it was just the milk chocolate but now there's a bunch of different flavors mostly based around cereal i think there's some like candy based flavors as well this is the captain crunch it says it's basically like a black market edible i don't think these are sold in any dispensaries that from what i've seen warning contains medical marijuana each chocolate bar contains 300 milligrams plus 300 milligram milligrams plus of cannabinoids i got your nutrition facts right there three grams of protein wow um 220 calories serving size one bar i don't know how some people can just eat edibles like that but i they [ __ ] kill me like i i cannot handle edibles very well anyway if we bust this bad boy open i i swear i'm pretty sure the one way back actually had wonka like on the chocolate but i guess i could be wrong because i don't remember it that well but i'm a big fan of this chocolate to be honest um very potent i would say as well for for for a uh black market not extremely legit edible they're very reliable and consistent for what they are so i would definitely recommend them but i would also be very careful unless you are experienced with edibles i guess unless you eat a ton at a time and know where you know what your limits are if you have any limits i know some people that can just eat tons and tons and tons of these things and i feel nothing my dog's complaining in the background what bud i'm making a review one second anyways in conclusion if you're looking uh for you're not trying to spend a crazy amount of money if you're if you're in the realm of uh black market edible then i would definitely recommend these if you're okay with that pretty cheap only about 25 bucks a bar if you're just buying one 25 30 dollars definitely worth it this captain crunch flavor pretty good and i'm not the biggest captain crunch fan so i'm sure the other flavors um are even better so thank you

this is the oatmeal cookie dough and I got that I have the keto nut butter filled dark chocolate bar we found these at whole foods that were $4.99 each so five bucks apiece that's why we only bought

creamy hmm but I would say that's a cinnamon bar room we're not recently when I read cinnamon and the ingredients I wondered yeah though it's it's um it's different it takes like a raw cinnamon it does have a very strong Susan yes so there's not any added sugar so it doesn't have it's it's not like a churro it doesn't taste like cinnamon sugar because there's the you don't get the show we're cinnamon chocolate no I'm necessary that's a good sweet Katie more it is it's just incredibly creamy I don't get oatmeal cookie dough I might get a hint about me mmm-hmm I think I think it's possible

like three but I didn't know if this could be key do for some people like you know because it says the no sugar added I don't know you're gonna be on it definitely it's it's possible it's not something that I don't want that really strong good right the raw sugar so a washer draw cinnamon flavour so for me it's not one for me but I don't think it's bad at all different little item this is the keto nut butter filled dark chocolate bar it says keto vegan paleo no sugar added the ingredients once again are all organic cacao almonds hazelnuts Jerusalem artichoke fiber cashews macadamia nuts cacao butter monk fruit extract those are all the ingredients in it two and a half servings 1 ounce 28 grams is inert 16 ripping right into this one cuz I know emergence well I bet I did not help it but yes it's present the pieces of birth cookies but it says love on it on the other side - yeah well - Maya when you glance at it the word love just jumps that's his murmurs this is Philip with the basis that same color feeling this gentleman this is why I could never be on keto I can't it's so dark and bitter mm-hmm and no sweetness yeah yeah it is extremely it droppeth it just sucks all the moisture right out of your mouth it's a very bitter it's it's just so drop is pretty drawing and it's just all flat top I thought the dry - the bitterness there's not even a lot of flavor except for bitter chocolate I'm not getting anything else so all of your things a spoonful of baker's chocolate yeah all those other things they put in there it doesn't matter because it's all overwhelmed by them I have the chocolate out of the two I would pick the cinnamon but I don't think I think these are bars because I do think all of them had that no sugar and a thing I think these are bars that you're if you are if you do have that lifestyle that those are the people that are gonna buy these people like us are not ordinarily going to buy these bars people who eat Cadbury and milk I you know those kind of bars of regular sugar bars so just know if you do have that lifestyle these are out there for you and they do have plenty to choose from these are just ones that sounded interesting to us and you might like I said you might on doing keto you might be able to eat that person I don't know don't like if you do it in moderation I don't know um but out of the two definitely yeah that's the only one out of you touch yeah that's the one I would say okay this is no dark that I just can't I do think it's good quality though yeah and I there it is a very creamy especially that parkland it was extremely creamy so I do think it's it's very good quality it's just we are used to having bars full of sugar right yeah so I hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music]", "OekNkvK7Ugw": "if they're welcome to Megan makes cupcakes thanks so much for tuning in today I'll be teaching you how to make your own raspberry chocolate bars so stick with me as I show you how to make them and step by step so here we have 8 ounces of dark chocolate wafers and I pop them in the microwave for 30 seconds at 50% power and now I'm just mixing it as much as I can to agitate the chocolate and what that does is it helps the chocolate to melt without overheating it and so you just want to keep on agitating that chocolate until you feel like it's not melting anymore and then I'm gonna pop it back into the microwave for another 20 seconds and here you can see it's melted just a little bit more and we are going to continue mixing and you can see here that there's some little chunks left in the mixture and that's what we want because that shows that we're not overheating our chocolate and we're just gonna continue mixing until those little chunks get a little bit smaller and then eventually they will just disappear and you'll have some really smooth dark chocolate now it's time to mix in our freeze-dried raspberries and you're going to want to take two tablespoons and I'm just using my hand to crush them up but you could also use a food processor you just want to be careful a bit you don't grind them up too fine because you still want some consistency when you take a bite of the chocolate and then you just want to mix it up until it's nice and combined and all those little raspberry pieces are covered in chocolate now we're gonna take our moles and I got mine from my local craft store but I will leave a link of one that's very similar to this down below and you're just gonna take that delicious chocolate with raspberries and pour it into the mold I was able to make exactly two chocolate bars with my moles and it measures 5 by 3 inches and now I'm just gonna take the back of my spatula and smooth it out and push it into the corners of the mold then lift up the mold and gently tap out any air bubbles that may be in there so that the finished product will be nice and smooth clean up the edges then pop into the refrigerator for around 20 to 30 minutes until it has set okay so we've chilled our chocolate bars and as you can see they are firm to the touch and now we are just going to pop them out of that mold and they're definitely ready to come out and you can see they're shiny and glossy and beautiful let's slice into the chocolate bar so you can see those delicious raspberries thanks so much for tuning in I hope you'll give these raspberry chocolate bars a try if you like this video don't forget to give it a thumbs up and if you want to see more videos like this don't forget to subscribe", "vHFZror3hto": "hey guys it's Kevin Kennedy productions TV welcome back another kendama food review just for you today we are going to be trying six different chocolate bars from the United Kingdom they were all probably made in the United Kingdom although we can get crunchy here in Canada we can get Oreo we can get Maltesers I think we can get this caramel Dairy Milk and I know we can get this there's a company or I guess a factory in Bolton Ontario that makes bounty and I've never tried this before so this is gonna be the first one I'll try but whenever I say I've never tried it before a lot of you guys are like I can't believe you've never had that before so this is called Dame so Dame drops would like this one alright my wife's already said she's going to eat those up once I've opened them up so let's see which one we're going to do first mmm let's do the one we have never tried before first even tells you how to open it looks to me it's gonna be like a score bar so like a hard taffy inside um but let's give it a shot let's get right into it no screwing around we have six chocolate bar to try come on come on yeah so it's got a nice toffee inside mmm smells good nice little texture on the top having to have a score bar in a long time they're very toffee hard toffee flavor the chocolate is actually quite nice crack food makes this and they are rainforest alliance nice ooh a chuck piece of chocolate almost got away on us okay that's a good chocolate bar that's gonna kind of rate them as we go good chocolate bar would I go out of my way to buy another one of these nope not particularly and extremely glad I got to try it so I now know what it is you know what it tastes like Maltesers I've been eating Maltesers and whoppers for a very long time in my life little balls of chocolate and inside it's like a sponge toffee by definitely different from sponge toffee I've always liked the type of chocolate they use very creamy and of course that of course the multis our thing inside is right on again those are mold teasers as I'm going through this guy is going to the comments below and tell me which chocolate bars you like the best out of these six next up is the Oreo so this will probably be your typical Oriole but obviously it's going to have it says love my bubbles or your money back this is from Nestle I'm thinking that it's going to be mint flavor because the color of it what great buns playing a game right now as you can hear he's like oh sorry what's the game call been watchdogs so got watchdogs with his new computer system so he's playing like crazy he didn't know I was recording so this is a very very first time I've ever seen an arrow bar looked like this I haven't had an arrow bar in a while as soon as I open that up the mint smell is this like whoo and I love milk chocolate oh look at that green inside nice because I find cha colet's just chocolate and then but it tastes like mint but they actually went to that next level and made the inside of their chocolate bar green it is really nice green bubbles in there that is better that is probably the best looking aero bar I've ever seen those bubbles are huge oh my god got a good I just miss melted instantly how my trusty glass of water Wow Nestle I think you've won me back I haven't had an arrow in a very very long time I usually only have arrow bars during Halloween when we buy a big box of chocolate bar assorted chocolate bars and give them out to the kids and whatever is left over we eat them and usually I'll have one or two of the arrow bars but I love men I love chocolate so Nestle thumbs up on that one okay we are moving on to cab berries crunchy I've been eating crunchies all my life and this is chocolate with a sponge toffee inside kind of like when I was talking about the Maltesers this is more onto the sponge toffee in Canada for a very long time used to when you go up to the cash register after you bought your stuff a lot of times it actually have sponge toffee in little blocks on the counter and you can buy them but there you go all right off the top adjusts the sweet smell of this chocolate bar is insane just smelling it makes my my teeth hurt mmm nice to eat is all the time mmm I would like to once again thank you say a thanks to Glen Clough he's from the United Kingdom and he sent me all this stuff and it's so nice to do chocolate bars that I just won't buy ever again really I like I said as you get older you start to lose your sweet tooth maybe and go out and buy a chocolate bar it's pretty rare but it's nice to have a treat from somebody and say hey here can try one of these it's like okay you never love a long time also it comes in two two in two separate bars I think the way I remember so this is coconut this is - it says two times bounty so I think it's just it's like a creamy coconut inside a nice milk chocolate let's break that open yeah look at the chunks of coconut in that I don't eat the small piece because always I'm eating a lot of chocolate I'm starting to talk really fast because I'm getting a sugar high here we go ladies and gentlemen right off the top smells like coconut exactly the way I remember when I was a kid it's a good chocolate bar but my least favorite out of the six now having to try this one I already know that's the least favorite out of the six does it taste bad no but when you want to buy a chocolate bar like this is like it's what they call it candy bars for me because it's like candy as opposed to a chocolate bar and well people have different things for different things right so this is the Dairy Milk I don't think I've been like introducing these properly right this is Cadbury's Dairy Milk caramel so it says new shape so I haven't said I didn't know I don't remember what the old shape look like so looks like little mmm we call those things capsules all right let's see how gooey this is mmm as you can see rich caramel runny inside very good there was a probably a stage in my life where I really liked what I can't remember the other Cadbury is milk Capra Cadbury's caramel then there is another caramel I think oh man I can't remember off the top of my head but it had the the caramel and inside all the pods or whatever you want to call it chocolate and that was a good chocolate bar - this one probably beats that one a little bit but there you go guys there are six more choices of chocolate bars please leave in the comment section below which is your favorite like I said this is probably my least favorite which is the bounty right now on all these I think the arrow because I really love mint and I haven't had an arrow in so long that just tasted so good um and probably like that like that like that like that so there you go so arrow first crunchy Maltesers the dairy milk caramel the dane and then the bounty alright guys once again thank you very much glen for sending me these awesome treats i really appreciate it next time on Ken Dominic's food review we're going to do a whole bunch of these marvelous creations by Dairy Milk and then a couple of these like blocks this is like grits and this one is I don't know L you whatever that means I guess it's a type of cookie alright

Hershey made famous before we eat it we are going to learn about fractions let's start by taking the wrapper off remember not to litter here we have one whole milk chocolate candy bar and what is a fraction a fraction is a part or a portion of a whole thing we are using a Hershey's milk chocolate bar as our whole thing if you break this candy bar apart you will see 12 equal sections 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and 12 you can stack the 12 equal sections on top of each other hey it looks different but anyway you rearrange them they still equal one whole candy bar maybe this is the easiest way to understand fractions what would you rather eat 1/12 of a candy bar or would you rather eat 11 12 to the candy bar if you love milk chocolate the answer is simple as you can see during fractions can be fun here is one half of a Hershey's milk chocolate bar and here is the other half 612 is an equal to 1/2 when two fractions equal each other they are called equivalent fractions here is 1/3 of a whole Hershey's milk chocolate bar how did we get to the fraction 1/3 think of it like this our candy bar can be divided into three equal groups each of the three groups has four sections what is left over is 2/3 1/3 plus 2/3 equals 3/3 when the top number and the bottom number are the same the fraction is equal to 1 here is another way of saying 1/3 4 12 s is equal to 1/3 and what is left over 8 twelfths 8 twelfths is equal to 2/3 for 12 cents plus 8/12 equals 12 12 s which equals one whole candy bar here is 1/4 of a Hershey's milk chocolate bar if you want to call this fraction 1/4 that's okay too here is what is left over 3/4 or you could call it 3/4 three twelfths is another way of saying 1/4 did you know that the top number of a fraction is called the numerator and the bottom number is called the denominator now you know let's explain it another way 3/4 is equal to nine twelfths it's time for something different we can still do fractions without the candy bar there are five cows on this page four towels have black spots and one cow has red spots one-fifth of the cows on this page has red spots did you ever wonder why Hershey's chocolate factory was built in the middle of farm country that's an easy answer milk one of the three main ingredients used in making milk chocolate is milk if six cows mood and you mood also your Moo would be one seventh of all the Moo's on this page don't forget to ignore the duck back to the candy bar we need to learn how to put a fraction into its lowest terms if you divide the numerator and the denominator by the same factor you can simplify this fraction to its lowest terms 1/6 is the lowest term of 212 5/6 is what is left over from a whole candy bar after removing 1/6 here is an equation that is easy to understand one-sixth is equal to 212 here's another way to say 5 6 10 12 it is starting to look more delicious after every fraction we show it's time for another break chocolate comes from cocoa pods the cacao tree grows in very warm and moist climates here are eight pods if one pod fell off and bumped you on the head you would have been bonked on the head by one-eighth of the cocoa pods on this page cocoa milk and sugar are the three main ingredients used in making milk chocolate sugar usually comes from sugar cane if you cut down one stalk you will have cut down one ninth of the sugar canes left on this field here is an interesting fraction it is already in its lowest terms the fraction 5 twelfths cannot be broken down or reduced any further the amount left over from 512 is 7/12 712 s-- is another fraction that is in its lowest terms here is a way to get a fraction of 1/10 there are 10 candy bars on this page 1 out of the 10 candy bars is unwrapped here is a fraction where the top number is larger than the bottom number this is called an improper fraction 13 12 is really 1 1 12 whoever made this fraction use more than one candy bar so far in this book we learn that the main ingredients in milk chocolate are sugar milk and cocoa we also learn the fractions 112 2/12 312 for 12 5-12 612 seven twelfths eight twelfths 9 12 10 12 11 12 12 12 and even 13 12 we also did fractions of 1/2 1/3 1/4 1/5 one six one seven one eight one ninth and one tenth if you want to know what fraction of ingredients are used in making Hershey's milk chocolate bar sorry these fractions are top secret", "isDyujbnYkQ": "in five four three two today we're in the dice durango and uh what's it called tell you guys a quick little story time that um about what happened when i took the shumbas over the weekend just um just

with them and um we just cruised around for a bit um we did that boom we went to uh the bros house every day uh you know we did we said what's up you know and where to go um as soon as we got in there he told me if i wanted to eat him i was like yeah yeah i'm done you know freak it um and i ate it so um i only only like half of them he said uh and on the box it said like um for a mild like um i just take like half or something like that by the way it took half um i didn't think i was gonna feel it because um they never hit me but yeah like 20 minutes later i was eating some tacos and um like as soon as i took the last bite and slipped the last um drop of the drink i had no and then 10 minutes later it just went all throughout my body but i could not feel this part like no more like i was i was somewhere i was at that point my body was like where did this bed go but yeah either way um i started tripping out and um what's it called i just uh i just i just went to my phone and just went to a look at myself and then what to come at that point um that would put on a video of i don't know what bro but it was just some some creature dancing i didn't want to look at it that much because i

pretty dumb when it was dark time since it was dark time what's it called i looked up at the stars and um jesus it felt like i was laying down on top of the stars for like a second until i looked back down and then um oh man it doesn't like after that um i had to go so i thought i had to dip so slow by fbi um he went to what dropped me off and uh i said as soon as we got in the car he did a 180 like like i don't know it was like like that so he turned and like it felt like i felt like i was already there but my body didn't know i was already there so it saw like the effects you know when you're like when it's like too fast or something the effects went in the fake stone took in like 10 seconds later i was like oh my god if i like a little roller coaster all of a sudden jesus so the ride back i didn't even know like first day i was uh close my eyes and then uh we were by we were by like this we're by the tree and then by then i was already like going inside my house and then yeah once i got to my house bro i started playing people and it felt like i was the guy and the controller at the same time you know i don't know if you gave me but yeah it was it was a pretty fun experience uh 10 out of 10 would recommend you know freak it get down but yeah um i don't know what they're called let's just call them some narco bars and um yeah there's a pretty damn take a flap

there for the cut too every time I cook something it's the first time I never can get over how easy it is putting salt into a sweet sauce might sound odd but believe me my sweet and salty country nut bars are the stuff of greedy dreams if I suggest you make black rice by dying this quitting please don't show you the horror because I promise you my splint risotto is is spectacular to eat as it is simple to make and finally I like to breathe new life into old traditions by getting a shin of beef braising it with Asian flavors and topping it with a sour hot when she saw this one evening that I remember feared to my mind when I was watching TV praising greeted me as wonders and I had some sort of peanuts in one hand and some chocolate in the other and I have to tell you the combinations just a taste sensation and I've worked on several whispers really to bring these two partners together and I am in their fever excitement at my latest venture sometimes I just feel like going needlessly over the top and when I'm in that mood my salt and Sweetie country nut bar is a must there's something about it is it just addictive and perhaps part of that is that the base of it all it's name is chocolate you can really use chocolate whatever permutation you like does 300 grams of chocolate at the moment I'm using 200 grams of milk chocolate and a hundred of dark but some as I feel like that children's party sweetness and I use all milk sometimes I feel like being very sophisticated and I use all dark to help the chocolate melt and later set simply I need some butter they give me any trouble about this you wouldn't eat this every day even I would do this every day good right on top of the butter just a bit of golden syrup about three spoonfuls to help everything today glossy when it melts and now we can begin cautiously divorce the melting and the help everything on its way so really I am making chocolate bars out of chocolate bars it's worth it now I promised you sweet and salty and I shall give you sweet and salty in fact salty first provided just by regular salted peanuts odd perhaps to have in something that's sweet but for me the balance between salt and sweet is so fantastic when you eat things it's like so Paxson's going off in your head will at once now sweet just in case the guns serve the chocolate when enough is provided by some chocolate coating - honey can bars there are very few certain pleasures in life but this is surely one of them now the chocolate have melted my hair the most fantastic hand for molten chocolate lake in here with peanuts and honey came together so that everything the salt and sweet is dispersed equally so you get a bit of each and every bite and in to the pan and then straight away to another pan I use a throw away foil container one that's actually sold for 12 - in I think but it's so easy it does mean you can get the chocolate bars out very easily otherwise just use a 20 centimeter by 30 centimeter ting and line it with foil now I would say once this is sat in the fridge for about 4 hours it really depends on how cold your fridges I cut these into about 16 they go very fast make sure to get yours in first into

these cute little candy wrapper holders or covers this one right here is a Hershey's milk chocolate than mini ones I still making some treats for my daughter's classes but I wanted to show that you could also do these for birthday parties because my daughter actually has a birthday coming up coming up too and so I figured I'd make a couple of these while I'm making some other Valentine's treats too so I already made a couple because this has been my third time trying to film this so we're gonna actually wrap up the miniature crunch bar so what you're gonna do now this paper is retired I'm trying to use up as much of my Valentines paper as I can because I have stacks and stacks with this so I keep using as much as the retired paper as I can this paper actually measures three and a quarter by one four and a half so three and a quarter by four and a half but what I did is I took whatever I'm trying to wrap up and I measured it and then it just kind of added a little bit because you want a little bit of space to crimp the paper so once you do that you put Taran tape or you can use your ATG gun or maybe tombow I don't know I haven't use tombow I just used the Taran tape because it's the easiest trying to keep this simple and honestly my kids helped me make these two I just cut the paper and they put the tearing tape on and and you know sometimes they put it on the candy bar sometimes they don't didn't you know that way they can feel like they're helping out so I just fold it in half a little bit and then I come over and I smooth that out it's a little bit crooked but that's okay and then you want to pinch the top and then do the other side and you can leave it like that if you'd like to I mean there's something wrong with does it um see there's that little part right there sticking up because it was crooked I'm just gonna go ahead and even that out just a little bit seems fine okay and this is the fun part then you get the crimper this one's from Fiskars I honestly don't know if there's an easier way of using it I kind of just place it in there hope it doesn't fall out and like crimp and do the other side okay there we go I know that one's kind of hard to tell because the paper is black but if there's a little crimp there and there's that so you can leave like that or you could decorate it this one was decorated with the happy birthday and it came from the ready to pop stamp sets right there this other one I'm gonna use where is it oh I lost it oh here it is this one I made love is sweet and I thought that was cute go there cuz of all the hearts love the sweet also comes from there ready to pop stamp set but it felt kind of empty so I put little I don't know what you call those leaves but they came from the bloomin love stamp sentence right here this little teeny one I made one with this heart but it still seems kind of empty I like the way this one kind of fills up the space and I used the the oval framelits this is the smallest scallop this is the smallest smooth and for the happy birthday I use the smallest stitched over one I do honestly don't know which one I like better I don't know if I like the stitched one or if I like the smooth better but there's options you know look what you got and play around with it so I'm going to use um a dimensional put it back there or you know however way you want to attach this and stick it on there and that cute I was thinking of adding some ribbon or you know bling it up a bit but then I remembered these are for the kids and they really don't you know let's be honest they're just going to wrap it up and and throw it in the trash either way now you could also do the same thing for a rice krispies treats you just have to of course use a bigger piece of paper and then you could have you know you could use a bigger stamp set so embellish it but yeah that's it for today thank you so much", "0hlvcnmjc00": "g'day welcome to the simple cooking Channel today I'm

combined there you go easy peasy oh yeah now this is where you've got options you can grab this take pieces out of it and just mold us with your hands into the shape of a bar chocolate bar Pat it down in a cake tin with a push up base and when it's set cut it into pieces get like a these Twinkie Dubey workers put them in there so there's many different ways to do it I'm putting it in there because I'm obsessed with these push up bases and just flatten it down get a saucepan cough and then add 75 grams of butter turn the heat on we want to start melting this at about 200 mils of thickened cream thick and creams got other names basically cream that you can whip and about a cup of brown sugar just stir this until it's completely melted and has become one with itself look at that yummy caramel

anything that you see in this video always consume super spicy food with caution and care I'm currently spitting fire Thank You LA beast yeards day my mission is quite simple and that is to not fire from my bunghole after consuming the Mobe also known as the mother of all chocolate bars created by Willy Pete's Chocolate Company I guess this month we are sticking with spicy things because people keep sending me ridiculous stuff like Brian the creator of the mother of all chocolate bars which is a half pound piece of chocolate infused with two Carolina Reaper peppers which are the hottest pepper in the world and then there's a caramel filling with two ground-up scorpion peppers and that only means one thing for me I am 100% worldly now the challenges been going around the internet between all Chile heads is to see who the fastest person can be to consume the mother of all chocolate bars and so far Johnny Scoville is clocked in at 4 minutes and 58 seconds main event paw ate the entire half pound bar in 3 minutes and 37 seconds and the current reigning champion of the Mobe is joshua smith who ate the entire fireball in two minutes 20 seconds and today since I gave a piss poor effort in the death nut challenge two weeks ago all that I plan on doing right here right now is totally redeeming myself the only way I know how like an absolute titty smoking sphincter dickwad boat

there a plan on entering into competitive eating mode and preparing my brain for the worst pain I've ever felt in my life like when I attempted to eat the most ghost pepper for Guinness World Records and I can't speak right now I just want to see where I stand compared to the other chili heads here on the internet that's all and before I start I'd like to call out furious Pete and Matt's Tony to try the mother of all chocolate bars so here we go everybody could see it we're opening the mother of all chocolate bars yeah and it's like you can't even slip it out to put something else in there it's all stuck together shout out to Brian who's a veteran and I'll share all that information work done yeah this is the mother of all chocolate bars and we'll just snap it in half okay yeah I don't know we can see that but I can see red pepper flakes already my method I know I made event pong small bites small juice fast swallows for me I saw Joshua Smith you brought them into four three two I'm

whole bar and i micro dose so i experienced you know both sides of them shared it with a friend and i also had one for myself and i was tripping my ass off no no lie so if anybody was thinking about getting these are they saw anybody selling them are they safe to take um to me yeah i think they're pretty safe to take and they don't taste bad they don't taste nasty um you can't taste the shrooms

please consider doing so now today guys I'm releasing the recipe for my key turning take on a milk chocolate I get a ton of requests for this in my DMS in the comments section of that white chocolate video which I'll link up here anyways you guys really wanted this so I decided it was about time to make it now as always if you guys decide to make this or any of our recipes go ahead and make sure you tag us on instagram at Black Sheep Edo and use the hashtag black Chiquito for a chance to be featured at the end of every single recipe video but if that sounds give you guys hang on tight and let's get right into the recipe [Music] [Applause] all right everybody welcome to the recipe no you can see you laid out in front of us right here all the ingredients for our delicious milk chocolate so let's go through and step through all of them first of all we have ten ounces of cacao butter I went ahead and broke it into some smaller chunks just to help it melt a little bit more evenly then we have 3.5 ounces of heavy whipping cream powder traditionally you would use a powdered milk but that's pretty Carvey and heavy whipping cream powder can do the same job for less carbs so why not do that then over here we have three ounces of Lakan toast powdered monk fruit sweetener this stuff is two times sweeter than sugar and it works pretty well for chocolate so make sure you are using the LeConte o two times the sweetness powdered monk fruit sweetener and lastly we have two point two five ounces of cocoa powder so that's two and a quarter ounces of cocoa powder it's roughly three-quarters of a cup and with any of these ingredients I will have a link to the recipe down in the description and all of these ingredients will be linked to where you can purchase them in the recipe itself if you guys need to know where to purchase them from so to start things off we're gonna go with our double boiler setup like we did in the white chocolate video so I have a pot here on the heat with just a little bit of water it's where it does not touch the bottom of this bowl now we're gonna take our cacao butter and pop it right on there and just kind of stir it until it starts to melt our objective here is to get it to a hundred twenty degrees Fahrenheit so I'm gonna go ahead and get my thermometer out now all right guys here's my thermometer it's just a cabled meat thermometer you should probably be using a candy thermometer but I broke mine a while back and I've been using this ever since and it seems to work just as well I haven't had a problem with it failing to temper or anything like that so you probably should use a candy thermometer but this is working just fine for me so I'm gonna keep doing it all right everybody according to my thermometer here I'm about a hundred and twenty one degrees so it's about time to pull it off just to note when you're taking the temperature make sure this is not resting on the glass bottom you want it just kind of suspend it in the liquid but since we are right around 120 degrees I'm gonna go ahead and take this and move it to a pot holder depending on the type of bowl you're using you may want to use a oven mitt for this but this bowl is actually pretty good at not transferring heat so now that we have this we're gonna go through and just add in our ingredients so we've got our cocoa powder going in our powdered monk fruit aniversary tall blend and of course our powdered heavy whipping cream and then we're just going to give this a nice mixing and you're gonna want to keep whisking this until you've beaten out all of the clumps so as you can see our clumps are beat now I'm gonna put my thermometer back in there and I'm gonna keep stirring it kind of slowly until it reaches 85 degrees Fahrenheit so let's do that now I'm not going to get into the whole process of tempering but these temperatures are kind of important in order to make your chocolate kind of brittle and have that snap to it otherwise it won't harden properly so make sure you're following these temperatures and if you're interested in the process of tempering you can always google it alright everybody my thermometer has just reached 85 degrees Fahrenheit you'll probably notice at this point that it is taking quite a while it takes about 20 to 30 minutes to do so so what I like to do is just stir it walk away for about five minutes check the temperature stir it again once gets close to 85 then just kind of keep a better eye on it now at this point I'm going to add half a teaspoon of sunflower lecithin is this 100% required for the recipe no it works just fine without it but depending on your humidity levels and various things like that it can cause your chocolate to separate a little bit so in terms of like having an emulsifier in there this is basically what everybody uses and it just adds a bit of stability to the chocolate so we're gonna go ahead and get that mixed in there and get our molds ready alright everybody I went ahead and prep my molds here and put the chocolate back on the double boiler at medium-high heat we're gonna want this to come up to about 90 degrees Fahrenheit before we pour it so keep an eye on it because it can come up in temperature relatively quickly while we're doing that I want to go ahead and add some toppings to my mold so you'll see I have some toasted almonds in here some macadamia nuts some more almonds if you're into salted chocolates this is some flaked sea salt maybe you just go ahead sprinkle a little bit of that in one of your molds this is where cooking gets fun guys you can totally do whatever you want with it in fact let me show you something a little weird when I was in the Dominican Republic I had some chocolate head and red chilies in it so I think I'm gonna make a little bit just like that so don't feel restricted to things you've tried before you can put whatever you want in these chocolates so I'll catch up with you guys as soon as this reaches 90 degrees Fahrenheit we're ready to pour alright ladies and gentlemen we have hit that magical ninety degrees Fahrenheit so I'm gonna go ahead and take the bowl off our double boiler here and begin to pour it hopefully I don't make too big of a mess because I'm pouring without being able to see it but really just get the chocolate in the mold as best as you can now as you guys may have learned in the previous step chocolate takes a little while to harden or cool down in general so you're gonna need to leave these on your counter for about four hours for them to be pretty much firm ideally you leave them overnight for them to be that true kind of brittle snappy chocolate consistency so I will check back with you guys in about four hours and maybe we'll taste them tomorrow when they've had a full time to cool overnight but with that once you guys check out the finished product right here and we'll be back for the taste test all right everybody now that you've seen the recipe it is time for the taste test so I do have a bar of chocolate right here as you can see mine looks absolutely gorgeous here if yours has some little white spots on it it could be two things first of all it can be some water specks on the mold for when you last clean them or even maybe you're tempering with slightly off don't worry guys it's totally fine to eat it's not like moldy or anything like that totally normal if it's your first time doing this mine obviously doesn't have that because I've been practicing a little bit anyway let's go ahead and taste this so I'm gonna set the plate down here and probably just a Gustus gloop this whole thing now I'm kidding you probably want to hear the snap so listen this chocolate guys the mics right there if you were wondering so as you can see we've got a nice clean break it's not melting on my hands it's a very shelf-stable chocolate and now we're gonna give it a taste now this was the salted chocolate bar that I made so I'm gonna describe it as such when you first bite into it it has a nice snap to it and then the chocolate starts to melt and it's very kind of creamy on your tongue very chocolatey and then I get that salt on the finish but remember you can add whatever mix-ins you wanted the chocolate I made some with almonds some macadamia nuts some red pepper some salt so it was kind of a grab bag I decided on a salted chocolate because that's my absolute favorite and if you guys noticed in that video I made over poured a few of the molds and there's some overage on there what I do with that is I break it off put it in the back and use it as chocolate toppings chocolate sprinkles whatever you guys want to use that for so absolutely none of this is going to waste and you know what it's cheaper to make it yourself than to go buy it from the store and you can control the ingredients with that guys I'm gonna go in close to the video if you like this video leave it a like if you have any questions or comments leave them down in the comments section and if you have not subscribed yet do me a favor guys hit that - scrout and show some love and I will see you in the next one you",

delicious thanks everyone's like today so this is pretty much um 13 year old knees dream I'm gonna try to melt it in the microwave we'll be back after a microwave this hi welcome back we've got dip inch bit this is disgusting it's not rude disgusting to you it's disrespectful to you I tried to microwave it and heat it up but this is just kind of what it's boiled down to okay let's just try the chunks mm-hmm huh what flavor did you guys get I got mint Alman mmm I feel like a hard crispy layer mm-hmm might be Snickers no oh my do these tastes stale no I don't even know I don't even know it gives us more vibe you know yeah honey I think this will be a lot better if you put like regular chocolate like actual chocolates inside and melt them instead of like but what would be the fun in just milk chocolate you're nuts with white chocolate mixed with dark chocolate yes you're right so eat it up a little bit I'm going in Hey is it appropriate I'm sorry I'm just saying what everyone's thinking you know it looks like mango did something to a Kiwi um let's get into the story story it's about moms killing their kids mm-hmm that was very aggressive I don't know why I came out like that normally I'm a lot more respectful okay so today's story is really just kind of fascinated about a Mexican in legend by the name of la I'm gonna say wrong love Rona love Rona la Llorona la la this is wrong la la la Llorona la la la la la la Llorona yes but I could be wrong so maybe not yes I'm so sorry okay in order to understand the urban legend that exists of La Llorona that has been around for hundreds of years in Mexico and has now even you know infiltrated for many a years Hollywood the United States everyone knows about this Mexican urban legend it's probably one of the most famous urban legends globally and it has to do with a mother killing their children do you think that a mother killing their own child is worse of a crime than anything else what's worse mother killing child child killing mother mother killing child is worse yes I think noticing I feel like Chad killing mother the child must have a good reason yeah what do you mean a good bigotry like abuse just like go go oh that's no point you go what I'll say on these I mean there is like the rare occasion where you hear the stories of like the children killing their parents because their parents are too strict and they want to like party and stuff there's been like I think I covered like three or four cases where the kids end up killing their parents so that they can have these massive parties at their house they can go to prom and stuff like that right which is absolutely heinous but I feel like in most normal situations when you hear about this I love it typically it has something to do with abuse something like you know like the Gypsy situation right yes so it's very interesting and so I kind of feel like a mother killing their child is like this very very weird psychological aspect to it right because it kind of has to do with the fact that first of all humans are already just born with this primitive nature of not wanting to kill their own babies right baby baby in fact did you know babies and baby animals look super cute because it helps them stay alive I feel like it's one of those friends and facts that people made ugly have you ever seen 12 puppies just staring at you in nature when you see a cute little animals usually they get eaten they see delicious like yeah what were you telling me the other day about dogs that's like hella stupid it don't make me cry what was it there are some stupid facts about dogs it makes no sense it just to make human feel better feel better about themselves look at the humans they feel love like their brains oh no that's that's true but there was something else you told me yeah apparently you study dogs brain when they see you their brain lights up cry but I mean that's so cute tiger yeah and then they said dogs like it when you talk to them and so I've been talking to Tiger a little more here's what happens I'll start taki and manga would literally sharp didn't walk away and then tiger will watch me the entire time so sometimes I'll stand on my bed and I'll make him sit in front of the bed and I'll have like a little concert yeah tick tock songs I like we like the cars the car tech go something yeah and then he's just sitting there like watching me the entire freakin guy do you ever see that in your room like she's doing that to the dog no never looking okay well as I think oh yes so parents killing their children is specifically weird it's just strange and it doesn't happen a lot it is not the most popular form of homicide and there's actually words for it so me a notice I didn't I'm pretty much saying it wrong me Anytus ID is when a parent kills specifically a mom kills their baby within 24 hours of the baby being born right and then you have infanticide in fan infant aside right which means specifically a mom killing an infant up to one years old and then you have silicide which means any mom killing any kid up until they're 18 years old they don't call it a regular homicide because of how interestingly psychologically weird this entire crime has to be now typically with all situations where a mom kills her child it can be boiled down to five different reasons okay okay you have the first reason which is the altruistic reason which is the mom believes that the world is gonna go to  something bad is going to happen and that thing is worse than death and so the mom wants to kill the kids deserve babies to save the kids or the mom has a moment of realizing how evil the world is and so they want to kill the kid so that the kid doesn't have to experience the same type of trauma the mom just experienced right and it's almost like they're doing it for the kid but they're obviously kind of not thinking straight so that's number one yes and then the second reason is psychological a lot of the times it could be psychosis related so the mom is either on drugs or the mom either has mental illnesses that make her hallucinate and hear voices that tell her to kill her kid kills her kit now the third reason it gets a little bit dark now right now the third reason is more of like the aspect of abuse neglect or abuse in the term of like Gabriel Fernandez they probably didn't want to murder their kid but they probably knew that all of the abuse was eventually gonna murder the kid fourth reason they don't like the responsibility this is usually the situation of younger moms who want to go back down and party go back out and date and so they kill their kid now the fifth reason is the most rare but we're going to talk about it today in the case of La Llorona the fifth most rarest cause mm-hmm is to get revenge on the dad oh right Wow because you hate your spouse so much you hate the baby daddy so much that in order to hurt the baby daddy as much as possible you kill the children that's alley specific isn't it what about what about the six case there are not there none it's usually those five reason what if your you took your baby on the on the trip on the boat and then the boat crash and then you and your baby God you know survived on to a remote island just you and your baby and then you got day thirteen you're so hungry have nothing to eat and that baby looking like a sore neck what about having what about a hat would you eat some I don't even want to think about it think about it would you do it would you do it you're on the island is there no food no there's no food nothing the only food resources you have is a strange stranger dude strange strange dude yeah stranger and Tyger Tyger who you got a tiger what is it's that dude yeah is your friend you go you tiger yeah yeah I don't think I would eat the animals before my loved ones but a strange human I would be strange human before my animal but either way it's like limited a mouse so I'll die anyways yeah no you and this okay so let's say you're stuck on an island with your family your sister and your mom who do you eat oh I'm gonna say it okay listen to this please leave it in the comments who you guys would eat if you have a pet let's say your strand in Ireland with your pet and you meet a stranger who would you eat easily stranger stranger right it's a human than then what is the human forgot to dip yeah it's like chocolate fun do you know what if the human was already sick like mentally so weak sick was gonna die anyway but dog is healthy uh-huh yeah then stranger yeah or you guys can talk about something like hey let's rock paper scissor loser like lose a limb okay here's my thinking right after reading all of this true crime and researching all this true crime I feel like emotionally I can never be able to do this I am all about talking the talk or hey listen I'm all about being like alibag you can't kill me but the minute that I look someone in the eye I'm like would that make you happier right I'm all about talking a big game but I feel like logically after doing all of this research here's how I see it you go to an island right you see another person you've got your dog with you here's a couple problems right let's say you do eat your talk you've got to share with this human because you don't want to alienate this human only you guys are on the island together so then you continue to eat your dog but who's to say you're gonna get rescued immediately after you eat your dog because then there's gonna be I know where they're going but then don't you think eventually that that human will want to eat you so shouldn't you rather eat the human first yeah that was your dog and you know what is dog gonna do nothing they don't eat and that's your pet yes they respect you they respect so yeah you're right and their brain lights up because they love you hmm somebody say sir that's what you're saying hmm that's actually smart thank you anyways la Arona la Llorona is a Mexican urban legend where I actually heard about this when I went to Mexico and I was researching all their urban legends because I feel like every single country has a different level of superstitious right I feel Asians typically are a little bit all these Asian countries typically they have a higher level of superstition than America per se right yeah I wonder which country if you had to name it would be the most superstitious in comparison America probably have the least compared to most countries mm-hmm like we have an America knock on wood don't jinx it and step on a crack and you break your mother's bake bake bake bacon no step on a crack break your mother's back did you ever remember that I remember being young and then my mom would yell at me and I'd go outside I'll show her like upstairs next sigh and so la Arona right I look this up when I went to Mexico and it's actually very very scary and I can kind of understand the idea of why it's been a hundred years or 200 years even and this has been around for so so so long and the story starts like this there is a woman by the name of Maria and Maria eventually landed herself a really really nice man he was very sweet very handsome and very very rich right and so she gets married to this man and they end up having two kids and for some reason slowly eventually over time she realized that her husband would come home less and less he would be like oh honey I'm working late tonight and they need to come home and you'd smell some perfume on him and she'd be a little suspicious and you know on the days that he didn't go out and he would stay home he spent all of that time never talking to Maria only bonding with his children and so eventually she got very very superstitious and she thought something weird is happening something not good is happening and she realized that this man her husband her beloved husband and father of her two children was cheating on her and so in a fit of rage she grabbed her two young boys and she went to the nearby river and she'd drowned one what by one and immediately after drowning both of them she started screaming my children because she had just realized what she had done mm-hm and she ended up killing herself because she couldn't believe what she just did to her children just so she could get revenge on her husband yeah and so shots she killed herself and when she got to the afterlife some people say was heaven some people say it wasn't they told her listen you can't come to heaven until you find your lost children and so she said okay and she was back to earth and she was in purgatory which means that she's not like she's there but she's not dead she's in between yeah she's in between and she stays around River is that night in the dark that if she ever sees children she tries to take them with her and you'll hear her at night if you go anywhere near a body of water in Mexico you hear her at night La Llorona and she's saying I think that this urban legend was around for two reasons right and I recently got into learning about the history of urban legends which is just strange in itself right and they say that urban legends all at the end of the day is kind of like a folk tale which means that they are told to tell a lesson and then said that this lasted so long in Mexico for multiple reasons right the first being Matt this is a really good urban legend to tell husbands never to cheat on their wife and this is also another really good urban legend to tell children to never go outside without their parents does that make sense yes one story and two birds story about a woman in Canada who had a organized-crime husband who tried to take in 200 kilograms of cocaine from Mexico to Canada and then she killed her children but yeah you want to go ahead but okay okay so this is what happened in Canada we're gonna be talking about miss Sorella now mr. bulla is one of those people where you just don't understand how she can be like that I think it's really hard yeah okay so here's where I stand right I feel like I really like family relationships where the parents value their relationship a lot right but I think it's weird when one spouse values their spouse more than their children yes on the wife more than beyond yeah like they will literally neglect their children to make sure their husband's happy or their wife is happy I think that's too my reasoning like anybody yeah yeah exactly and so I think that's just very very strange and mr. feller was obsessed with her freaking husband okay now her husband was a very peculiar person he was actually part of a very very famous crime family in Montreal that all the Canadian police all knew about this crime family and for the longest time he was staying out of trouble he wasn't getting arrested for this or that and it seems like maybe he had parted ways from his crime dealing family he had settled down with Miss Sorella her first name is Adele he had settled down with Adele and you know they had two beautiful girls and maybe he's getting together they bought a house in the suburbs he ain't trying to get arrested no more until he went to Mexico for vacation and vacation turned into work and he said hey I have a plan I have a retirement plan I get it I'm only in my 30s or 40s but it's no big deal I don't want to live the rest of my life working anymore so here's what I'm gonna do before I hop onto my Delta flight I'm actually gonna try to smuggle in 200 kilograms of cocaine that are a lot by the way guys to Mexico 200 kilograms from Mexico to Montreal Canada oh my god it's 440 pounds bro they check your luggage you can't even be above 50 pounds how good he's thinking it obviously not well because he got immediately caught in Canada very very straight so he gets caught in Canada and he ends up escaping from custody so now he's on the run and he's a fugitive of the Canadian police now this really pissed off Adele because first of all I mean I don't know how involved she was with this whole retirement plan that he had going on but she was upset because now she you know lost her husband technically doesn't get to see him he doesn't get to help raise their children together their two beautiful daughters and she was just really really annoyed by this and obviously her mom was helping a lot so she had called her mom to help her with the kids and her mom the grandma was packing these school lunches and one day the grandma packed the lunch in the morning left it on the counter went out to run some errands she got back at like 5:00 p.m. the kid should be home by now but their lunches were still there still packed never been taken to school so curious she walked into the kids rooms and they were both laying on the ground dead they had been poisoned and so she's like wow who came into this house to kill my children does this have anything to do with their dad's you know involvement in crime did they come and kill the children as a message etc etc and she starts freaking out and the police say okay what can we do let's find the mom so they bring in a Down Goes never mind also the dad's name was Giuseppe DeVito which that is into crime family name BtoB Demi Torito philemon hi Doreen oh sorry I don't know what's happening to all of us I think this chocolates really getting to us and so they bring in a dub right and immediately they notice that something is off about her because they tell her hey listen we found that inside of your home that you live with your children your children have been murdered and her first reaction was not my children and so they were very confused this is everyday just didn't immediately after looking at all the evidence all the police officers who even went to the crime scene to see the children they said listen this is literally the exact example of the rare case of spousal revenge still aside which means you kill your children in order to get revenge on your spouse so it's just everything fits everything matches perfectly and so they start this 8 hour absolute terrifying interrogation of mr. Vela and they keep asking her questions and she says listen I can be silent now here's the interesting thing in Canada right Canada you have the right to remain silent just like America but I believe it's the same in America they don't gotta stop talking to you until the police for 8 hours they kept talking to her even though she kept saying I have the right to remain silent right and the reason that they do this is because technically they know you're not gonna talk like if you can even last a couple hours they know at the eighth hour you're probably not settling I'm like you know what let me just tell you what happened you know and so they kind of have this understanding but what they do is they want to throw you off guard so the entire time they talk to you about nonsense they talk to you about the weather they talk to you about this and they talk to you about what happened they talk to you about your relationship right and then literally out of nowhere the interrogator is just talking about well I think this is the problem you know talking about the weather talking about this boom slaps a picture of the crime scene of her two children onto the table okay and the reason he does this is because now she does not have enough time to make a fake response because it doesn't matter what she says a mother who sees a picture of her two dead children who has a very special type of response which is hysteria Oh depressed right right yeah hysterical and she just looked at the picture and she slid it back down and she said she had wants the right to remain silent is that a evidence is that is that in trial over and over yes because at the end of the day no one can understand how a mom can look at a crime scene of two children that were like six and seven and not like even anyone that those aren't even her kids would immediately have a violent reaction probably so even if you remain silent they can still use your body language again she's saying and that's why they kept her in there for eight hours and that's why they hold that they said they specifically I don't know I'm pretty sure it's like this in the u.s. - they're a little more aggressive here I feel like Canada is pretty nice right um but I feel like the reason that they do all of this is they said that they want to wear you out until you can't fake a response and you're not on the edge of your seat anymore and then BOOM crime scene picture and they use the video recording of your reaction because they know you're not gonna say anything you're like I have the right to remain silent I have the right to remain silent show you crime scene pictures if you just keep saying I have the right to remain silent you lookin shady in that so interesting researcher and so that's what they kept doing to her so they would just talk to her boom crime scene picture keep talking to her boom one more time crime scene picture they keep talking to her book crime scene picture and every single time she would say I have the right to remain silent hmm and they play this over and over and over and over again at the trial because technically they didn't really have evidence they didn't have evidence that she bought poets poison she they didn't have evidence of this or that and so this is the only evidence that they really really used over and over again in the trial and they found Giuseppe DeVito and so they catch they catch the husband okay okay and he was already in a lot of trouble for trying to smuggle in two hundred kilograms four hundred forty point nine five pounds of cocaine into Canada from Mexico right so she was already in a load of trouble and he testified at trial against his wife and it seemed like the reason that she had killed her children from his perspective was that he kind of stopped talking to her after he went into hiding and so they would kind of meet every now and then but because it was so dangerous even getting caught or putting the children at her he decided to cut some connections off with her uh-huh and that made her so mad that she felt like if she killed her children he would come back to her she's thinking exactly and you want to know what's even crazier mm-hmm he got 15 years in prison mm-hmm and she can get out in ten years why yeah why because that's the way it works in Canada she gets probation in ten years where he stopped telling someone is less than like cocaine yeah so he gets 15 years he ended up dying in jail though like on the first month or something and she she gets life in prison but the possibility of parole is in ten years which means if she's been good for ten years in prison she could get out in ten years yes Wow that's kind of weird yeah and so literally this is what they call the exact most clear-cut example of the rarest form of homicide which is a mom killing their child for revenge or revenge against the dad and that suits our mare and this is the most clean-cut version of it all right there was literally no other motive I mean I guess I'm a Duke I can see some people are so driven by hate or anger of you know what I mean no but your own children I feel like it's like um it's like primitive nature I feel like yeah that when you look at your kid you see your resemblance right so it would make it even more difficult no yeah yeah yeah I just don't understand it it's weird if they're not nice here she's scary yeah and so a lot of people in Canada call her la Llorona adele la their owner Adele I know that's a pretty name though no no no no no yeah it is until she's calling your name from the top bug my child also this is really throwing me out because the candles and under the fondue pot is vanilla and so it smells like vanilla and it makes me really want to eat the chocolate with the chocolates we do we fail this one yeah this one's if it looks like a like a bar I like your it's like a new chocolate bar it's a whole new chocolates or actual chocolate now whole new me a busted I'm busted or something today's video stay safe against Lila Rhoda beats and up I'm sorry about this video I'll be back tomorrow with a better video I promise I don't pinkie swear but I promise I love you guys and I'll see you guys tomorrow bye", "EQacanY5xBE": "[Music] what's going on everyone this is Dylan with manoa chocolate today we're gonna talk about molds this is something that we are continually learning a lot about and we've mostly bought from one company on the East Coast called tamrac we've also bought one other time from a company in Turkey they gave us great molds at a really good price there was just a language barrier and it was a bit hard to work with because we're in Hawaii and they're in Turkey and so that's kind of as far as you can go time difference and language and stuff so we still continue to work with Tom Rick we have new molds coming out right now and when you order molds there's a lot of things to consider one of them is that it takes a while and it's kind of expensive because there's a back-and-forth process and a lot of art work involved this is what initially comes is a one cavity test mold so that you can make sure your bar is the right weight that your design looks nice and so when we receive this this is actually the second single mold that we were received because we've made modifications and so historically we had a much shallower mold where we filled the chocolate up to the very top because we didn't want this cupping effect that would happen in the chocolate now we'd prefer to have the mold deeper because when we run it down our vibrating conveyor when you tap it out and all the bubbles come out it levels off we don't want it running over the side - creating a big mess because there's so much cleaning involved already the last thing we want to do is add more and so now we go at least a quarter inch deep in our molds and don't fill it up to the top because when you're vibrating it it's bouncing around violently and you don't want it to spill over the sides so that's one thing to consider there's we just learned about this but there's a few ways to make molds this one was done in an acid bath style where they've got the designs and then the acid I believe cuts out the mold this gives you really good detail but you have to have a flat mold and when I say a flat mold this one here is our 20 gram molds and it's got a ridge that comes over and surrounds it kind of like a picture so it's two layers whereas the acid bath won't let you do that this is all one layer but we have a really pretty design on it so these are going to affect the types of ways that they make your mold which will affect the cost this can be done with a CNC machine or an injection mold which is a much more difficult process for the mold maker because they have to form two different layers and inject the material that your mold is made out of on the inside to create your shape but they can do pretty much anything it's just a more expensive setup and more extensive material our molds are made out of polycarbonate that's all that we've ever used up to this point that we know of so keep in mind you have a whole bunch of art that you have to do you have to send it to the mold maker they have to then make a sample but there's a bunch of back-and-forth in between that you get your sample you do your tests make sure it's the right weight make sure it feels nice we like going with the thicker type of polycarbonate that they offer I think it's point one two five or point something like that anyway the thicker polycarbonate is what we prefer to go to because they do get beaten up we don't want them to crack so now we would approve that they make another sample this is another we're doing Co packing for someone else this is their mold they send us this we then do another test and you have to make sure that you're depositing ahead of your temporary machine if you have one lines up with the cavities of each mold in the right spot so in this case we had to get a new head a new plate made to go on to our temporary machine so this hooks on to our temporary machine it then goes through and gets distributed through it like a mesh of it's a metal mesh with a whole bunch of perforations spreads out and it'll go through these holes and deposit perfectly into each cavity of the mold we would then this down our vibrating conveyor so this works with our depositing head we had to make this one special I like trying to have as many molds on at many cavities on the mold as possible because if I'm gonna stand there and stick this into a underneath the depositing head I want to mold five bars or four bars if possible if it's a 50 to 60 gram bar I don't want to do three because I'm still standing there spending the same amount of time this one is our 20 grand bars we squeezed 10 on here so we deposit 10 bars in one shot and then run this down or vibrating conveyor so just the economics of standing there for if you're gonna do it for six to eight hours you want to make sure you squeeze as many bars in there as possible since you're just standing there regardless in the same amount of time if you can do one more bar a couple times a minute that'll add up so that's just some economics for you let's see quantity so there's different bottlenecks that you're gonna have in your process in our case we have our bottleneck with our refrigerators that cool off the bars we can use up to about a hundred and fifty molds before we hit our bottleneck where the fridges are full and we have to slow down so we'd love a cooling tunnel which would speed us up but for now we don't have the space or ability to do that so a hundred and fifty molds for us at five per cavity is our current necessity on the amount of molds that we need and so you don't want less moles than you need because then you're just standing there waiting for them to come back out of the fridge so you can rewarm them up and reuse them after they pop out of the fridge we have to put them into a little cabinet it's very simple it's a bakery cart with a cover on it and we have a dehumidifier for the room that's blowing the air the warm air into that cabinet which brings the molds to approximately the right temperature so that we can then use it again and deposit chocolate into it because if it's too hot or too cold you're gonna have problems with bloom and we talked about that in the last tempering episode which is still somewhat of a mystery to us but we're starting to understand much better if you can match the temperature of your mold to the temperature of the chocolate coming out you're gonna have way less problems so yeah so we covered the depositing ahead the amount of cavities and then it's just cleaning these no lint cloth molds that we get from I think these come from Costco but we buy big bags of these and they're great for cleaning the molds they don't leave any lint or anything on the molds after because you you want to check your mold you don't want hair lint in the molds when you're putting it under the depositing head so a lot of things to consider there that's molds for you we had a lot of questions on this one so I hope this was helpful brings a lot of value to you let us know what you think good luck happy chocolate making [Music]", "FI73gfwO1Lk": "[Music] another video today is gonna be a very different type of video as I've never done one of these before so I'm gonna try this out hopefully everything works out the way I have it in my head so let's get right into the video guys without further ado today is going to be actually a edible review so I'm not personally me myself I'm not a huge edible fan just because of how long the effects last how long they take to come on and a bunch of other factors just doesn't really make me a fan of it me personally when I like to use cannabis I like to know when I'm gonna be high for how long I'm gonna be high and you know I can plan my day around that with edibles it's kind of like once you take the edible and once it's in full effect you're kind of just basically useless as a person that's how you know heavy the effects are for metals for me personally I mean I'm speaking from my point of view everyone has a different tolerance everyone has different experiences so that's why I don't eat or use edibles that much but today's review is going to be hopefully you guys can see that on camera they're one of these shatter bars and this one is 250 milligrams of THC hopefully you guys can read that information hopefully it's focused hopefully the camera is focusing but yeah so this is a vegan shatter bar because that's the only one they had left so I just bought that one this one's two hundred and fifty milligrams of THC ten point four milligrams per square so when you open this up I'll show you guys it it's divided into little squares this one is sugar-free dark choc this one is an indica so they actually have a sativa and an indica bar I'm not sure how that affects I might have to try this a tea go on and see the difference but I've actually tried this one before and I know how it affects me so I roughly know what's gonna happen after I eat this but yeah this one is purple kush and there is 24 pieces in this bar so hopefully you guys can see that hopefully you guys can read that but yeah without further ado I'll just read like the ingredients here unsweetened chocolate sweetener cocoa butter soy lecithin natural vanilla flavor and yeah that's basically it it gives you the nutritional value here on the back it says that there is a lab test result so for the THC percentage it is 60 7.5% the THC a is zero point zero eighty percent THC V is a hunt one point twenty percent the CBN is zero point four hundred and fifty percent the CBD is zero point one thirty five percent the CBC is one point sixteen percent and the CBG is one point ninety two percent so I'll show you guys that there it's just on the back hopefully you guys can see that oh yeah let's get right into this review I'm gonna open this bad boy up show you guys what we're dealing in here and as I'm opening this up and showing you guys a lot of people might not be familiar with edibles or how they work and how they affect you I'll give you a brief rundown on how they work basically so what you have to do in order to make edibles is you have to use obviously cannabis or cannabis derived product like shatter I believe actually that's what they use to make these is they actually use shatter from purple kush or whatever it is to make the bar so you'd have to use shatter hash Keef something with a lot of cannabinoids in it obviously and what you have to do is decarboxylate the cannabis product whatever you're using the bud you know how shatter or whatever you're gonna be using you have to decarboxylate it now I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to the actual science and how this stuff works but if you are interested just type in deep decarboxylation on google and it will give you a description on what it is exactly doing it has something to do with removing a carbon atom from the molecules or something along those lines I don't want to butcher the sign so I'm not gonna try and explain it but so basically you have to decarboxylate your cannabis make the edibles and what happens is it's it's different than smoking in the sense of when you smoke cannabis the witch is your smoking the THC the CBD and all the cannabinoids obviously so the THC which is known as Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol is present in the plant so when you smoke that the Delta 9 THC or Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol gets absorbed into the lungs then it goes into your bloodstream and then it gets processed that way and when you smoke obviously the effects come on immediately after the thing with edibles is once you eat the Delta 9 THC when your body starts to obviously break down the food and process it and digest it it turns that Delta 9 THC into 11 hydroxy THC or 11 hydroxy tetrahydrocannabinol so if you didn't know that it actually turns THC into a totally different compound which is why edibles lasts so long and is why like their effects are very very potent so I just want to give you guys that little bit of information if you weren't aware of that and yeah I'll show you guys the bar so this is like the little wrapping that it kind of comes in here I guess that's like their little logo or whatever whatever that means I don't even know what it says but yeah so and here she is there is the chocolate bar that we're dealing with so each square is ten point four milligrams of THC the entire bar is 250 milligrams of THC so now I was thinking about this before the video but I'll just say it to you guys as well I wasn't sure if I wanted to take the entire bar or if I wanted to eat half of it I mean it wouldn't really be an edible review if you only ate half because then you're not really getting the full effects so I'm just gonna leave this camera recording I'm gonna start eating this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour and hour and a half and I will tell you guys how I'm feeling how the effects are how actually I'm gonna start eating it now and I'll tell you how it tastes as well just cuz just kind of giving you an overall review of the product itself because some edibles taste like complete [ __ ] but then the effects are amazing and then some people make like really gourmet edibles that taste amazing and also the effects are there as well so I'm gonna try it now or shut up so there's one little square I know it's chocolate you kind of technically should be sucking on it and letting it melt in your mouth but I'm impatient it's actually a really good holy [ __ ] for being a vegan chocolate bar Wow I know I'm not really a big sweets person I'm not really a big chocolate person either but this tastes really good I mean it you can taste the slight cannabis taste in the background but overall this is like wow really surprised really good job what does the company euphoria extractions really really good job definitely a really good tasting chocolate bar so alright guys so without further ado I'm gonna finish this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour an hour and a half and give you guys the effects and how I'm feeling so enjoy the rest of the video guys peace [Music] so so far so good I mean I'll give you a little bit of information so I got the Edible from a local dispensary here in Toronto and it was about I think $26 for that chocolate bar kind of pricey I mean you have to pay taxes and whatnot which is whatever I mean you got to do what you got to do right the government has to get a cut always so yeah two hundred and fifty milligrams bar $26 I mean the chocolate bar itself tasted amazing tasted like a regular like dark chocolate bar really good taste you could taste the cannabis like on the back end and yeah that's all I can really say is if right now really good experience so far and like I said I'll come back in an hour now in half and let you guys know how I'm feeling so hopefully you guys have been enjoying this video I know it's a little bit different than what I normally post but I know there are edible users out there I know people might want to see these types of videos so I said why not make this video right oh yeah like I said I will see you guys soon and enjoy the rest of the video peace guys hey what up guys I'm back and we're gonna talk about the effects and how I'm feeling after taking that edible that I was talking about earlier so it's been about an hour an hour and a half no I don't even know I haven't even checked the time but I know it's for sure it's been an hour so I'm feeling pretty much the full effects already and holy [ __ ] it is definitely some phone stuff it's just a typical indica high I mean you're just couch locked you're sedated your pain with a lot of pain relieving properties a lot of body effects relaxation no depression no anxiety and yeah you're just having munchies you feel tired you could definitely fall asleep no problem but it is definitely some pown stuff and it will definitely last a long time so that is also a plus if you're looking for long lasting effects for like medical patients as well so yeah I mean that's basically all I can really say about it it isn't edible it's not like it really has like a taste or like you know any other smells and stuff like that it's basically just a chocolate bar so my overall rating I guess for this edible out of five I would definitely say it's a high quality edible I would give it a solid four to five and definitely recommend it if you live in Toronto and you're looking for edibles like that's definitely a good company to go with I would say so yeah that's been an edible review by I'm always blazing the 250 milligram euphoria extractions vegan chocolate bar so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did drop a like comment subscribe if you're new and yeah we'll see you guys in the next video B so guys", "Zywa0EfTJ4s": "me chocolate thank you so much", "5f8DUk-_AkU": "[Music] I've got another quick treat idea for you today need some quick gifts from students for teachers for coworkers these are great you can really do these for any occasion but I chose to do them for Christmas this was one of the projects at my appreciation open house this year what I love is it's just a special way to package up a candy bar you can cut your paper accordingly you just want to make sure that it's right enough to wrap around your candy bar I'm actually steal my candy bar out of this one and you know not all kvr's are the same size so you're really just going to figure out where it will wrap around you're going to add some adhesive particularly candy 106 inches long so my piece is 6 inches long and you don't want to wrap it so tight that my candy bar won't slide out so I got candy bar out we're gonna take our 1/4 inch hole punch which actually is on the clearance rack right now if you don't have a good handheld website it's only 5 dollars and 40 cents and I love the nice soft rubber that person is almost like so it comes on the handle to measure my ribbon it's I just wrap it around my holder and give myself just a little bit of extra room at the top and then the ribbon through and you don't need as more I do everybody but the wide ones really looked nice and they also make for a little bit easier pull then you just slide your candy bar down in bring the ends together and then I just took a piece of the twine a couple pieces of color and added that around the top that coordinate my tank was made using the circle layering circle framelits which are on sale for Half Price right now and the Jolly hat builder punch how cute is that that's on sale two for only 960 instead of $16 so these would be great stocking stuffers but so with the tools that I use to make these so thanks so much for stopping by I hope you'll give this candy bar holder a try [Music]", "ZtMfiWDQHT8": "[Music] this factory makes chocolate in various forums and sells it to companies which manufacture chocolate products for retail sale it also supplies chocolate components such as cocoa powder and cocoa butter most of the coca beans arriving here come from West Africa which grows 70% of the world's crop a conveyor belt moves them through a cleaning system a series of SIVs that screen out twigs stones and other debris next stop is a micronized revolving drum that heats the coca beans to loosen their shells then they enter a shell removing machine called a winnower inside successive rakes drag the beans across screens pulling off large pieces of shell then a vacuum sucks away the remaining smaller pieces removing the shell exposes the inside of the coca bean which is called the nib the factory will roast the nibs to develop their flavour 50 plus percent of the nib is fat which is cocoa butter to make chocolate they'll combine processed nibs cocoa butter and sugar along with milk powder if they're making milk chocolate first the factory processes the nibs by grinding them the heat and friction activate the cocoa butter producing pure liquid chocolate called chocolate liqueur the factory extract some of the cocoa butter to sell it separately as chocolate making ingredient and to use for in-house chocolate production along with other ingredients in various proportions the dark chocolate recipe for example calls for more chocolate liqueur sugar and cocoa butter but no milk powder the recipe for unsweetened chocolate contains no sugar the mixer blends the ingredients to the consistency of a very thick cake batter the flavor is fine by this point but the coarse texture needs to be smoothed out so the chocolate moves to a refining machine passing between a set of five rollers that reduce the particle size so much so that within just minutes the chocolate leaves the refiner as a fine dry powder but now it needs to be real iqua fide so the next stop is a machine called a conch the friction and heat once again activate the cocoa butter returning the powder to a liquid state at this point they add more cocoa butter enough to reduce the viscosity to the exact thickness they need just a bit for example if they're making chocolate chips or much more if they're making a thin chocolate coating for chocolate chips the conch feeds a machine called a drop depositor as the name implies it deposits drops of chocolate onto a conveyor belt the nozzle trays are interchangeable so the machine can be set up to produce various sizes of chips discs or other shapes the chocolate chips still warm and soft enter a cooling tunnel traveling for about five minutes through several temperature zones which vary between thirty and fifty degrees Fahrenheit by the time the chips exit the tunnel they're hard a conveyor belt then takes them through a metal detector a standard food safety precaution the factory also produces 10-pound ball format chocolate bars but depositor fills bar shaped plastic molds the conveyer transfers them to an elevator system which moves through a cold room for about two hours this constant motion ensures optimal air circulation helping the cooling process", "qkAgPUb3hnI": "okay good morning everybody welcome to my little chocolate pod very cozy in here my name is Mark I'm a master chocolatier at school eyes kitchen in this sort of half hour we're going to look at two different design chocolate bars and some different designs on eggs as well so obviously with the with the chocolate we have to temper the chocolate there's all that getting the crystals right in the chocolate okay I have a lovely book down on the book stand for anybody's interested obviously on the tempering of it the space basically we want to look for a chocolate that's got a nice snap a nice shine it has been in a mold or something like that okay so before I ever sort of work with the chocolate obviously things have been tempered beforehand but I just give it a little test so I'll just pop it in the palette knife into the chocolate and just basically pop it onto the side and within 5 minutes that should go from a very shiny chocolate to a very matte shine okay so this one we're looking within five minutes if it doesn't within five minutes then obviously my chocolates to warm and I need to obviously add some more chocolate to it time to cool it down okay so with molt these are poly carbonated molds and obviously then you can get white ones or clear ones as well they're they're great molds obviously they're a little bit more expensive than those sort of flimsy plastic ones but there are a lot better quality they will last a lifetime if you look after it as well they're fine in the dishwasher and what I suggest as well in the dishwasher is when it comes out just when it's finished the dishwasher get it out and give it a buff and shine then well it's a little bit warm there's still a little bit of moisture in the mold and all I use is just a little something quite soft and brush that's like a little piece of kitchen towel something not too rough okay that or a glass cloth is really good and just give it a nice buff okay and then at least when it's clean then I'll it sort of cling film at heart pop it back into your cupboard and you know exactly next time it's ready I'm ready to go so just go around give it a little little buff obviously if you catch it in the light you can see where you've sort of missed bits okay and then obviously go back to those give very nicely if you find that you it's very difficult to get into sort of the corners get cotton bud and just go round they're quite good as well specially in the individual miles if they're square got quite corners or going down okay obviously by buffing a surface you're going to get a better shine on your chocolate as well don't use green scarers or things like that on your martyr clean them because obviously you'll scratch the mold and you'll always get those scratches on your bass okay so a few little things we can do with the rhythm I'll just with a little bit of fruit than nuts I mean some people will pipe in their chocolate you'll see a lot of bars and supermarkets and chocolate shops now where they play the chalky and put the nuts and things on the top so you got the two you got the bar sort of blocks one way and obviously the fruit the other way I prefer to do it this way by putting the nuts in first because obviously this way it's gonna be the more shiny sort of size obviously that on the surface there so you get the best of both you get sort of a few of the nuts coming through but obviously still got that a little bit of shine as welcome from the and from the mold so obviously don't fill out too much because it'll be very difficult to hover see flooding the chocolate and I always use a piping bag you can obviously use a spoon and put it in but it's a lot cleaner by using piping bags okay so let's you just over my my hand pop in some chocolate just cut the end off what about half a centimeter or so and so all I do is you'd actually just pipe around the edge first so I know it's going to go all the way to those corners and then I just work my way down you see I'm not doing a lot of chocolate and either yeah you think that's probably not gonna be enough as soon as you start if I look at this way you can see it over the top if I start doing the end of the Fang you can say just levels out write that off so you look how good I okay obviously don't bang it too much because we still want to see sort of the elements of the fruit on the other side as well okay if you bang it too much so obviously they all come to the top and you end up with it all in the middle so just to learn obviously with these bags guys you can reuse them with chocolate which is great just even if I had all that chocolate in there just pop that in the fridge let it set then you can just give it a good rub and you all come out you'll have pretty much a clean bag again I say to people don't wash them because when you got soap and all that in there and you just degrade the bag and it's all a bit dirty anyway with the with the water so it's a lot easier to clean that way and obviously use again another thing you can do as well is there's some great freeze-dried fruit powders and freeze-dried fruits on the market as well to make nice flavored chocolate bars and obviously giving you more of a natural color as well okay we can color chocolate very easily with cocoa butter colors and also dust colors as well there we've got a new range of cocoa bar colors which are going to come on to you in a second but these are little raspberry fragments which again we can just pop in there in the bottom which are really great and then here we've got some herb Squires fruit lively powder to go with that so all I do is just actually pop it into a little bar to the brilliant mount that I'm going to need obviously leave up to you how much you want to put in just give her her little nips sort of a great color you obviously see little bit more then obviously if it was a liquid color or something like that but I've see it to me looks a little bit more natural you're looking for that more natural sort of feel as well they mix them around again all the way and again just exactly the same is give a little little back in the game this is some of the end to the obviously when we temper chocolate in these machines obviously we create ever was by stirring so obviously just by giving a little little bags of bringing those up off from the surface as well but again like I said not too much because we still wanna see the raspberries again we can do a little bit of sort of marbling as well so we can just use men natural chocolates you get two colors ready at the same time there's a couple of ways you can do sort of different effects with just two different chocolates is I can pipe sort of being sort of very random sort of shapes I could let that sort of completely set and then going with another chocolate and obviously that won't mix together you'll see those lines quite the same basically okay but obviously make sure that sets before you're going with the milk chocolate or I can let you just go straight in with a bit now is that it or not you know Mikey just maybe go in with a palette knife just mix those around against a little bang if you wanted to you could go down like so the other side to tone bar again you just literally go around together or obviously now this is setup and just go straight on with a given milk chocolate and give it a little shake if I put that straight into the fridge now while it was wet okay the normal sort of domestic fridge is too cold for chocolate divided frigid I was working at 10 to 15 degrees that's an ideal temperature but you can still use the domestic bridge just basically let it go from that shiny top to more of a matte finish so you can see now on these two they're just under there all the most gone Matt okay if I still stick my finger through it it's still it's still wet but because it's come from this temperature for a little bit lower in temperature now it's ready to go into the fridge you",

before this video starts only only 2.8 of my viewers are subscribed which is very depressing so if you like what you see scroll down press the subscribe button and yeah enjoy the video hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at another wonka bar uh this time samoa's flavor um if you've not heard of these they are a i guess you could say black market edible brand um they make these chocolate bars in a ton of different flavors a ton of different candy flavors and cereal flavors i did a video on the captain crunch one i believe um but they also make a gummy edible which is more in a uh plastic bag um resealable bag type of thing but this is just wrapped in foil if we take a look at the back nutrition facts i'm not sure if they vary between flavor to flavor but um this is this one and may contain uh traces of nuts so be careful um i actually these are probably one of my favorite edible chocolate bar brands just because uh to me they're very reliable and you can scan right there for test results and i i think they're just they're pretty simple the ingredients simple milk chocolate natural flavor i don't i don't know exactly what that means but um let's crack this bad baby open they come in the outer outer plastic sleeve you could say oh normally this comes with it but i've already eaten a few pieces so the packaging got a little messed up you can see do they say oh they do say girl scouts i feel like that's kind of risky they're straight using the brand even the symbol right there but i'm assuming if it's a black market company they probably don't care very much about uh ripping off a brand or whatever but um so i am not so if you don't know samoa's i think it's like caramel and coconut and i am not a fan of uh either of those but i really did not mind this at all the flavor isn't too crazy strong and i kind of like the textural like the little bits of coconut that kind of get in your teeth and stuff when you're chewing i kind of don't mind that it adds some texture so it's not just plain milk chocolate um i actually think these are pretty high quality for what they are um and definitely probably stronger than a lot of i guess dispensary uh edibles or whatever because you know those are usually pretty limited to a hundred milligrams 25 milligrams whatever it is but in these types of dark or black market edibles i can get it can get dangerous because you really have no idea how much are in these these are advertised at 300 milligrams but there is really no way to tell so you have to be super careful um my advice if you're a heavy smoker i'd eat one of these one square i would wait a while maybe an hour or so eat another one and go from there just be super careful if you have never eaten any sort of this before just be extremely careful um and obviously edibles affect everyone differently some people could eat this whole bar um like you know like a lot of my friends could eat this whole thing and be like yeah i'm feeling good bro but it affects everyone differently i'm extremely i'm very underweight so if i ate you know one row of these um i'd be i'd be maybe bordering some sort of panic attack or something so they very edibles do me horribly when i eat them they oh man i get rocked um so if you're like me and extremely vulnerable to edibles i'd be you had to be careful to start with just this one and even if you're experienced it's always a good idea to be careful because you have no idea what exactly the exact ingredients inside these things so i would definitely recommend these as long as they're coming from a source that you trust um make sure they're coming from a trustworthy source and that's really all you can do from that perspective but yeah there's a ton of different flavors uh one of my favorites is if you forget if it's twix or uh i think it's like snickers or something that was really good but yeah if you've tried these let me know what flavor you've tried and if you enjoyed it i have tons of videos like this on my channel i also have a gaming channel if that is something that interests you i'm going to be posting a lot more now or soon because i got a my gaming computer all set up built so uh yeah maybe stream from this channel every once in a while uh yeah i hope everyone has a good day later", "R5wt7-NO4AM": "Hello and welcome to Todd's kitchen. I have made compound chocolate I have made white chocolate and i have made dark chocolate but theres only one left and everyone keeps asking me for so here it\nis. So join me today as i make my version of milk chocolate To start of i have a pot on the stove, now its on a high simmer and on top of the pot place a clean and dry bowl make sure its dryotherwise\nit's gonna ruin the chocolate. So we are going to start of with our main ingredient and thats  our cocoa butter. Don't get this confused with normal butter as they are nothing alike Now you should be able to find this in good health food stores but if not just google it and im sure you will find it around. So into our bowl place in our cocoa butter I will leave a list of ingredients down below and how much you need to use. and using a metal spoon just so theres no moisture just turn these just stir then until it completely melted. And also as a hint just make sure the bottom of the bowl is not touching the water other wise you can burn the chocolate. Now that the cocoa butter is melted we are going to add in our cocoa powder. Just regular cocoa powder and we are going to stir that through until its completely dissolved. Once that has been dissolved we a going to add a very small pinch of salt and what the salt does it just helps to enhance the chocolate flavour Next we are going to add in our milk powder. Now you might be asking can we just use regular liquid milk unfortunately you have to use the\npowdered milk and honestly that is how chocolate is actually made So stir that through again. So once that has been stirred through finally we are going to add in our icing sugar Now if you don't have icing sugar check out my How To playlist where i show you how to make it and finally we are going to stir that through. Now with all the ingredients before you pour it into the mould just give it a quick taste just so its to your liking if not you can add more cocoa or more icing sugar or what ever you like just to its to your liking. So as you can see this is looking lovely now it's just about completely dissolve. So what we are going to do now it take this of the Heat we are going to let it cool down for five minutes and we are going to place it into our mould. now that our milk chocolate has cooled down we are going to use a mould now i use this same one for the dark chocolate as you would remember So we are going to use that. You can find these at allot of craft shops or party shops so with our cooled down chocolate we are going to pour it into the mould and doesn't that look lovely. So what we are going to do is place this into the fridge and let it set for about two hours So i have taken it out of the fridge and as you can see i filled up the other two moulds because i had extra left over lets just take one out and there we have it, now look at that lovely lovely milk chocolate. So this is incredibly easy to make and the best part is it's homemade so lets give one a try oh yummy. Nothing, nothing beats a good piece of chocolate. But i'll to you what this tastes exactly like milk chocolate and you know why? Because it is. And you can also experiment with the taste if want to add more Cocoa powder or even more cocoa butter. You really can change it to your liking. But no matter how you change this\nhomemade milk chocolate tastes simply delish so give it a go and don't forget to put up a\nphoto on my facebook page so that you can show it of to everyone else\nbecause I know it will be fantastic Thank you for watching this episode of Todd's kitchen. As always the ingredients are listed down below as well as links to my Facebook, Twitter and home handy hints channel Please do me a massive favour by giving this video a thumbs up and leave a comment and I'll see you next time for another delicious recipe.    ", "DzlN7MHiyEI": "[Music] hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is liz if this is the first time you stop by and for all you awesome awesome subscribers welcome back thank you so much for helping me get to over that 50 000 mark i love you love you love you thank you so much so let's keep it going next stop a hundred thousand all right so for today what i am going to bring you is how to properly infuse chocolate yes that's correct so it is very warm in my kitchen right now at nights like 85 degrees so it is melting fairly quickly but this is properly tempered chocolate if it wasn't it would be a total mess i actually wouldn't be able to hold it about 83 degrees in my kitchen right now so as i said i'm going to show you how to properly do this i've seen a ton of recipes i've seen a bunch of people also doing their edibles where they're using coconut oil or butter now they may be using candy melts and if they use just a little bit they may get away with it however if they're adding any kind of amount of oil or butter to even candy melts it's not going to stay solid at room temperature really the only way is to infuse coconut sorry to infuse cocoa butter and then we add our cocoa butter to chocolate and then we temper that chocolate so i'm going to show you how to do all those steps and explain a whole bunch about cocoa butter temperatures and exactly what tempering chocolate means yeah a whole bunch of science and stuff that you probably don't really care about but you couldn't hear it anyway yay so um ingredients wise i'm going to kind of jump right into there there's not a whole lot ingredients all right so what we're going to need here is about half a cup of melted cocoa butter and you want pure cocoa butter so i picked up these um organic pure cocoa butter wafers so just nicer to work with because they're in these wafer forms otherwise it comes in block form not the easiest to work with so a half a cup is four ounces i use about five and a half ounces for a little blossom for a little bit of loss or whatever so i end up with a half a cup which is about four ounces there and you're going to want about two cups of chocolate or the amount of chocolate that you're going to need of what you're working with and you want to use a really good grade chocolate the better grade chocolate that you use um the better your product is going to taste and the better quality it's going to be as well you can also just take your favorite chocolate bar so it's dairy milk or jersey milk or i don't know any kind of type of bar you like lint you can use any of those um to infuse as well as long as you temper it you you can always take a tempered chocolate bar melt it and re-temper it and put it right back to where it was so i'm gonna show you um three ways to actually temper chocolate yay but let's get to the first step of actually infusing our cocoa butter so a couple of things with cocoa butter and why it's really difficult is cocoa butter burns at a very low point it will burn over 120 degrees fahrenheit um so trying to do it on the stove top nearly impossible even if you do it on a double boiler because water boils at 212. that is too hot if you put it on super super low and on a like a minimum and a mine simmer and really monitor the temperature you may be able you've got to keep it at about 100 degrees fahrenheit so it's really difficult to try and do on the stovetop can't do it in the magical butter of the magical butter machine because its lowest temperature is 135 degrees fahrenheit too hot it will be completely burned i know because i did it they liked me on one of those websites the main guy who does it i can't remember his name so the levo is perfect for this because you can set your temperature to exactly what you need it to be so this way i'm going to set it to 100 degrees that's what's really nice about the levo or a machine that you can customize your temperature settings because all oils are not created equal for example cocoa butter like i said will burn over 120 degrees fahrenheit whereas olive oil it's like got like a 200 and something i shouldn't probably look that up it's got a way higher burn point so for infusing you would do that in around 180 mark um butter if it is not clarified will burn at about 250 uh 350 if it's uh clarified so even though they're all oils and fats or lipids they all have different smoke points and that's why when you're looking at getting a machine you really want one that you can customize your heating that's the main part you want to be able to customize your heating so onward and forward enough babbling about that for now trust me again not more science worrying about chocolate a little bit all right so infusing our cocoa butter very simple so i do apologize i have to keep my talk about certain things wink wink um very limited so you kind of have to read between lines on this i do apologize youtube is getting very very very sticky so i have to be very careful about what it is that i say and do so i have got about seven genes of my flower in my pod here i am going to set my cycle to activate and i've got it set to 240 30 minutes pop her in and let her go press start so it'll go to warming up then once it's warmed up it'll say activate and it'll give you the time and it'll count down the time the other nice thing is you can always pause and restart your uh infusion without affecting your time or anything so that's a nice feature of that as well so enough about that while that's activated we'll be back in 30 minutes so see here right now it's an activating mode or it's it's heated up so we've got um 30 minutes of 240 and it counts down and when it's done it says activation complete or something like that okay so our activation is complete now and we remove the pod to let it cool down you can leave it in the machine it's going to take a lot longer to completely cool down so i take it out you can even leave it on the counter for about 40 minutes i pop it into the freezer for about 10 minutes all right so my flower is nice and cool the pod goes back in our little uh rubber magnetic goes into the middle and we're gonna pop in our cocoa butter so this is the thermometer this is what regulates the temperature so once the oil or the butter itself reaches that temperature of what we sent it to it shuts off the machine itself is not necessarily going to be at 100 degrees it's once our oh once our cocoa butter hits 100 degrees the machine the heat will shut off and it will maintain it maintain the cocoa butter at that temperature whereas when you do it on the stove top what happens is is the temperature just stays because it goes by the element and your cocoa butter will just continue to increase in heat until it finally burns tada so that's it for that you put the lid down we now choose our uh our infuse cycle i'm going to lower the temp to 95 actually 100 i'll do it to 100 for two hours hit go because our butter was already warmed up there it didn't have to take time to warm up that's why i melted heat it up first so it's going to be infusing for two hours we'll come back and check that out when that's done but in the meanwhile sorry i will go over the equipment that we're going to need for the chocolate and give you a little bit of science into chocolate tempering and why it needs to be done and what actually happens behind the magical seams of chocolate so the equipment would need far more equipment than we do and do ingredients for our chocolate we only need two for the chocolate for the equipment we need a little lack of it so we're going to need a double boiler if you're going to do the double boiler method or you can melt your chocolate in the microwave if you do melt in the microwave do it in plastic in plastic containers that are microwave safe reason is plastic doesn't heat up so if you do it in glass or ceramic bowls they can heat up and create hot spots and actually burn your chocolate it gets much hotter than what you're doing plastic it doesn't heat up just make sure that it is microwave safe when microwaving start at 30 second intervals do two thirties again depending on the amount of chocolate that you're doing so for the two cups if i were to do that in the microwave i would do two rounds of 30. each time stirring it really really well in between um time intervals so i do 2 30 then i go to 20 seconds 15 seconds and then continue at 10 second intervals until it is completely melted so that's the microwave method way i do find the double boiler is a lot easier because you don't have to keep opening the door and stirring it and this and that just gets done here so totally though your preference so double boiler you can using a proper double boiler or any bowl metal bowl or glass heat safe glass bowl your water you want to make sure that it is low enough that it is not touching the bottom of your bowl again it is it will make your chocolate too hot and it will cause it to burn you'll want a straight edge spatula your chocolate molds so you can get silicone chocolate molds i don't particularly recommend them they are inexpensive but they're difficult to work with they're flimsy they're difficult to smack them down just a little hard to work with as well as they don't give you us a nice shine as the plastic or the best ones are actually the polycarbonate molds they are a little bit more expensive but they do give you a beautiful professional finished chocolate and they're sturdy they're nice and sturdy good for smacking out all the air bubbles we're going to need some parchment paper just for working and catching stuff you can use wax paper candy thermometer or thermometer or you can use a chocolate tempering one now this one other than telling you the um temperatures on the side here it's a pretty useless bachelor because one you have to have your chocolate submerged so far but we're working with chocolate and if anybody knows it's not very see-through so it gets mucked up your um spatula here makes it very difficult to read so really other than these uh spatula part of the edge and just having the convenience of the temperatures right there it's pretty useless but i got it anyway you're going to need a whisk a sharp knife for chopping up your chocolate now if you do if you're going to do the tabling method you're going to need two straight edge blades but that's just one particular method and you want a pair of rubber or latex gloves working with your finished chocolate so you don't get fingerprints all over it so i'm pretty sure that's pretty much all the equipment again you know me i always forget something so we're gonna finish up our infusion and then we're gonna get our chocolate made all right so our infusion is complete uh remember that thing i forgot to tell you you want either a fine mesh strainer or one of those bags those really fine mesh bags that magical butter or brewer has they're really good or cheesecloth they work really handy as well so the pod does keep out most of it but really fine sediment does get through so while that's all there is to it we push our button to to get down to our cocoa butter oh look at that and then you can just use this box not much is left in but you can just use a spatula just to scoop the rest of that down that's what's so nice about this so clean don't get your hands all gross and icky and you get pretty much all of your uh butter back which is a bonus and there we go that's it we now have our infused cocoa butter so we're going to let that cool down to room temperature it's not going to solidify i just want that temperature to come down so that we're working with the same temperature and chocolate and cocoa butter and i just wanted to show you comparison to just regular cocoa butter so there we go check those out isn't that sweet i can't wait to get onto the chocolate portion yay not really i don't like tempering any better all right so on to our little science portion of our chocolate before we actually make it so to explain to you in very simplistic turns i'm gonna make this i'm gonna dummy it right down why tempering is important what actually happens so this chocolate bar i just melted with some cocoa butter and set it didn't do any temperature and you can see as soon as i pick it up and hold it it begins to melt in my hands right away and it's just mushy and yuck so that is that's chocolate that is not tempered which is why you can't just melt a chocolate bar and put your stuff in and then put it back into a mold that's what's going to happen when you when it's tempered as you can see i can hold the chocolate and it's not melting in my hands it's not melting my fingers the chocolate breaks apart cleanly so what makes that happen why what is the difference between this and this when we melt chocolate well i'm gonna give you that right now okay so when we temper chocolate some really cool magic happens um when we're melting and the temperatures that we go between so the reasons why we need to bring it up to a certain temperature bring it down to a certain temperature and then bring it back up that's called our v shape and what happens in that process is there are six crystals that are created when we melt our cocoa butter or we melt chocolate sorry with cocoa butter so as you're melting it these crystals start to form in your chocolate and what happens so we've got all our different colors we've got pink yellow green and all these are what uh crystals one through six let's say the only crystal that we care about is crystal number five which is our beta crystal and those are going to be our green crystals or what i'm going to use as our demo for beta crystals those are the crystals that give your chocolate stability so it gives it its shine and what happens is it creates a chain and and to give your chocolate that stability during during the heating process so as we heat our temperature up all these crystals are made and they're all over the place and as you can see that's pretty unstable that's why our chocolate is really soft and blue because those crystals are just like that when you just melt and go when we bring up when we are tempering chocolate and we melt it to our optimal temperature and there's different temperatures for milk chocolate and dark chocolate i'll go over those a little bit later when we're doing it so these crystals are starting to form so there's a few different methods for creating our beta crystals one is just by adding already tempered chocolate melting that in i'll get into those separate processes so what's happening is we're introducing beta crystals so they said they're going to be our green ones as our temperature comes down the beta crystals start to form together they start to join up make friends while our other crystals are starting to melt away as our temperature is coming down and again if we keep keep working and agitating these beta crystals continue to build a nice solid chain which gives our chocolate our stability like so as we bring the temperature we get down to our optimal temperature then we need to bring it back up what that does is helps to remove and dissolve the remaining crystals remaining five crystals that we don't need essentially leaving us mainly our beta crystals in a nice form solid chain like so and that is very simplified version of what tempering chocolate does like i said people go to school for this and like there is i could get into some serious detail but seriously most of you don't want to hear that so let's get on to the uh tempering techniques and let's actually get some chocolate made okay i'm working forward to the good stuff the real chocolate so i've got here uh two cups of chocolate uh real milk chocolate the way to know the difference if you have real chocolate or compound chocolate or a melting chocolate just take a look at the ingredients if it has real cocoa butter it's real chocolate if it has palm oil or any other type of lipids then it is a compound or a melting chocolate or a candy melt so that's the easy difference real it has cocoa butter real chocolate needs to be tempered as i said you can take your favorite chocolate bar so we put our little candy melts into our bowl turn my heat on to medium low to low keep it on the lower end and i'm going to add in a tablespoon of cocoa butter get the cocoa butter all over your chips again this is going to help with even melting and even heating oh it helps if i actually plug this in that might help good yeah because i'm using the little um wafer chocolates i'm i didn't bother to chop it up i probably should have you should still chop it up oh you should still chomp oh my god even though i'm using i'm using this a nice thin little wafer so they do melt really nice and easily i still probably should have chopped it up into smaller pieces just to help it melt quicker but no big deal but if you're using the block chocolate you want to either grate it or make sure to chop it really really really fine so another very important thing when working or working or tempering chocolate is your uh is your atmosphere you want a very cool and dry atmosphere so around 70 72 is optimal it's really really good if you're getting up into the high 70s low 80s it makes it extremely extremely difficult virtually impossible to temper chocolate because you can't quite get it down to the low enough temperature so so for example it's 82 degrees in your home we want to bring our temperature on our chocolate down from 100 degrees down to 82. well if it's not cooler around us we're never going to get that temperature down so then you can either try doing things like doing it in front of an open refrigerator or over a fan which is actually what i'm going to do because it's kind of a little too warm in my place to call to probably get this correctly tempered but my little trick of what i'm going to have to do is uh do my stirring over my band which i tested yesterday and it worked so yay so as your chocolate is beginning to melt you want to make sure to just continually stir it to bring the warm from the bottom to the top and you're just getting all the chocolate coated again so they evenly melt and you don't want the chocolate to uh get too hot in one spot to burn that burn very easily i'm going to drop that down below now like my heat because i can feel it's getting pretty warm so because i'm doing milk chocolate i want to melt this to between 104 degrees fahrenheit and 113 fahrenheit i'm going for the 104 the lower end so that's for milk or white chocolate if i were doing dark chocolate you would go between 113 and 120 our chocolate is beginning to melt so as this melts as this melting is happening our little scatter our little crystals here are starting to form like so all scattered all over the place our chocolate here is pretty much melted so i'm going to check his temperature now so we're at 104 tickety-boo we're good to go part one to return our heat off so our first method of tempering is you take a large piece of tempered chocolate milk chocolate same type of chocolate and you're just going to dump that in and you're just going to continue to roll this over move chocolate over and start melting this bar into our chocolate we're going to continue to do this until our temperature comes down to as i said to eight between 86 and 88 for our milk chocolate so what this does in this method is we're already taking a tempered barn that has those beta crystals and we're melting those beta crystals and giving our chocolate a jump start by bringing it down to the temperature those beta crystals are going to chain up and um and do our chocolate temper our chocolate honest is probably one of the easier methods of doing it right now i'm at 97 it's going to take a little while so i'm going to do them pulling my fan over here and i'm just going to sit the bowl on the fan this is going to help me get this to temperature otherwise it's probably not going to happen so i'm just going to continue to flip the chocolate bar over making sure to get all the chocolate covered over and keep moving it around and you'll see it'll start to get shinier once you um start tempering chocolate getting used to it you'll actually be able to eyeball it once it's done it gets very you get to know its texture and its look there's no streakiness and it's shiny about at 92 little ways to go a little bit further so we need to bring this between 86 and 88. now normally your chocolate bar would be bigger to make sure that it lasted the whole time i probably could end up melting this whole chocolate bar in but that's okay so if you did have a large piece your chocolate left when you got to temperature you would just remove that piece and as you're as your chocolate is starting to come down in your temperature have a look and see if you see streaking if you see any kind of streaking it's not tempered correctly oh i think my chocolate chocolate is looking good i'm not seeing any noticeable type of streaking or separation color and it looks shiny so because i have some larger chunks of chocolate in there i'm gonna actually run that through a mesh before i put it in as i put it into my mold this is where we want our parchment paper so i'm using this just to catch any of the large chocolate bits that might might come through [Music] take our straight spatula and take your spatula and just move your chocolate that's nice and nice and flat and filled and then you want to take her and clean off the front edge then you want to take her and smack down get out the air bubbles all right so there is our method number one now number two is pretty much the same so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna add in some fresh chocolate into here we'll get that remounted to our 104. so method number two is the v this is one of the um the b method is probably the one of the most used for beginners so this is where we bring the temperature we bring it up to the 104-113 i said for milk chocolate i keep it around 104. we're going to bring it down to between 82 and 85 and then we are going to bring it back up to between 86 and 88 so that's our little b motion our little b so if i was starting from scratch i would be adding in a tablespoon of my can of cocoa butter but because i've already got that in there and i'm just re-melting chocolate and that's why i haven't added it to it the awesome thing about chocolate is that you can melt and re-temper it over and over and over as long as you don't burn your chocolate or seize your chocolate you're good to go just remember water is chocolate mortal enemy so you want to make sure all your equipment that you work with with chocolate is completely dry absolutely no water it's one reason why i don't use wooden spoons or anything with wooden handles because they have a tendency to hold on to moisture and you can be stirring away and your chocolate starts seizing on you and you don't know why because the moisture very little moisture is seeping in from the wooden handle so i tend to avoid wood okay we're definitely attempt so now for this method what we need to do is we are going to add you're going to get some additional of your chocolate that you've got so you were chopping up chocolate if you got your two cups you would split it out two-thirds and one-third you put two-thirds into melting you'd keep one-third on the side and what we're going to do is just add a little handful at a time and continue to stir and you want to stir very fairly vigorously this helps the beta crystals and we're going to continue to do this until we bring our temperature down to like i said to 82 and then those little as those melt in add in some more and i'm probably gonna have to move over to my fan to get this down to temp the temperature that i need i'm gonna add in some more my other ones are melted well that's gonna take a while so i'm just gonna get the last of my chocolate added in here my last one third and continue stirring vigorously sweet all right so we're there so i've got this down to 85 so now we take our pot there should be enough heat just from the hot water there place your chocolate back on and we're going to stir this and bring this back up to between 87 and 89. and what's happening in this process is this temperature is coming up now those remaining crystals that we don't want are melting off melting away and as your chocolate starts to come up into temp you're going to start to see it get shinier so as i said once you start to temper a few times you get to know what it looks like so you um becomes a lot easier so not quite enough heat from my pot here so i'm just going to throw it on the low here on my stove almost there's a couple more degrees and you can see the chocolate is shiny you don't see any streaking layer in the mold spatula then make sure to give her a good smack out for all the air bubbles now our last method our third method here is called tabling so we don't add um additional chocolate and we don't have to worry about temperature it creates the beta crystals by agitation so this is when we are going to use um our two straight edge blades and in order to do tabling you have to have a marble uh stove to work on or a natural stone top otherwise she no work right so pretend i'm starting with new chocolate again i would add in a tablespoon of my cocoa butter and melt that all together so again i'm just going to melt this until we get to 104 that's the only temperature we want to worry about is our what we're melting our chocolate to which is above 104 between 100 and 413 i'm going to stir my chocolate until it gets up to 104 degrees fahrenheit we've reached our temperature of 104 degrees fahrenheit remove your chocolate from the heat now make sure your working table is completely clean and we're going to dump our chocolate out onto our table now you're going to get your straight edge blades and you're going to start working your chocolate back and forth all over through between the two blades and what we're doing is we're creating agitation which is what's going to create our beta crystals doing the tabling method and you want to smear it out nice and flat this will help with the cooling and the temping and you're going to continue to work the chocolate like this until we get to 8 between 86 and 88 degrees fahrenheit for the tabling method you want to have experience with tempering so by eyeball you know it's when it's in temper so you only have to do a temperature check once [Music] [Applause] [Music] my chocolate's looking good so i'm just going to check the temperature and we're good we're at 87.5 perfect and next we're just going to get our chocolate back into the bowl so just use your two straight edges scoop up your chocolate back in the bowl so now i'm just going to be pouring my third method into the mold so we just layer down fill up the mold move her around to fill it to flatten her out and use your spatula to clean off the excess off the top clean off the sides of your mold and then give her a real good smackdown and shake back and forth to get out all the excess air bubbles and last thing we just need to let them set if your place is cool enough you can let them sit on the uh counter probably take about half hour 40 minutes however if not pop them into the refrigerator for about 20 minutes that should be good to set them up all right so our chocolate is all set up time to come out of the molds flip them over and they need a little bit more coaxing there we go looks like we've got three tempered bars look at those don't they look pretty so our test give her a give a hold it doesn't instantly melt in your hands you can touch it doesn't instantly melt good chance they're tempered even though it's cold and just came out of the fridge if they weren't they would instantly be melting okay let me clean this off so you can actually see properly so i can pick up the chocolate and i can touch it and it's not instantly melting into my hands it is going to melt somewhat a little bit because it is very warm but you would know the difference like it will melt melt and the other thing is when you go to break it it actually breaks if that wasn't tempered again even cold coming out of the fridge it wouldn't break it would more just bend trust me you know very quickly if it isn't tempered but as i said if it doesn't temper not a big deal chop her up put her in the pot give the method another try and then for packaging up your chocolate for storing or for um for packaging or whatever again in the summertime don't even attempt to ship chocolate it won't happen so what i like to use are these thin tin foil sheets they're already pre-cut put your chopped tip oils the best thing to use for um for wrapping up your chocolate so it just goes on there you want to kind of pull it tight and again you can wrap it up however you want i am not the best rapper even for christmas presents so i was so glad they came out with bags there you go there's your chocolate bar and then to make inexpensive wrappers you can just make our printouts on uh on your printer on regular 8x10 paper cut them out to fit and just give them a wrap up that's everything for you so i hope you enjoyed that video today on how to make cannon infused chocolate if you have any questions or comments at all please don't hesitate to put them down below i do love to hear from you thanks again for joining me today and you have an awesome and blessed rest of your day you", "xgbHUssibOQ": "hey it's Alex today I'll be showing you what the best chocolate is in the world literally I have data from expert chocolate critics including the brand's the rating out of five and the country of origin so let's see what the best chocolate is I'm talking real chocolate not like Hershey's or Reese's or Snickers these are like real quality cocoa chocolate bars so first I'm gonna run this data through some nerdy programming that I did and here we go it looks like the only two chocolate bars that received a five-star rating were from a company called Emmett immedi and the names of the chocolate bars were chow and Toscano black reviewed around 2006 and 2007 the cocoa percent was 70 in each and they're both from Italy so in order to see what the best chocolate is it's very reliant on their rating so let's dive in to see what the rating actually means and how it's calculated so okay it looks like it's just the expert rating for the bar so these are like real food chocolate critics who rate it from a scale of zero to five and that's that we also see the company and manufacturer the specific bean origin or name as well as the day reviewed the cocoa percent the location of the company rating bean type and being origin and this data has 1,700 different individual chocolate bars from each company to each variation that the company has of different types of chocolate bars and of all the 1,700 chocolate bars it looks like there were only two with a five-star rating and that's very impressive so let's take a look at the the Amadei ciao I'm probably mispronouncing that but we can see here that there's a lot of Google search results first off and this is what it looks like an Italian chocolate bar pretty expensive and apparently you can buy this on Amazon and got some reviews on Amazon but this is the one that the food critics really gravitated to and the other chocolate bar was the Toscano black I didn't even know this but apparently there's like a whole community around fancy chocolate and so yeah this is what it looks like it's 70% cocoa Italian job and if we go down even more we see that a Morin is another chocolate company who has very high ratings a mano mi D but well it sounded very Italian there a Mme and yeah a lot of a lot of these have four star reviews I don't know much about chocolate but I do know it tastes good and these are the brands that professional chocolate critics seem to recommend and gravitate to one question I do have though is which country has the best chocolate so I've created a map of the world that will show us the popularity of chocolate in these different countries the darker the country the higher average rating that these expert chocalate critics rated it so we can see at a glance that the best chocolate bar manufacturers seem to be in Colombia with an average rating of 4 which is really good also in Chile and Australia and it looks like we can actually zoom in here into Europe and we see that Belgium also has a four star rating Germany looks like the pretty good chocolate Italy around three point two five which is okay and down here Honduras and the bottom left you can see they also have good chocolate oh there's also a section here Israel and Vietnam and the Philippines are also some pretty good chocolate manufacturers I live in the US so let's see how the US does we have a three and four some more context on these numbers I'm going to show you what they actually mean a 5 out of 5 means elite transcending beyond the ordinary limit and those are the two Italian chocolate bars that we saw of the 1700 the only two to get five stars transcending beyond the ordinary limits a four star rating mean premium with superior flavor development character and style three a satisfactory or praiseworthy well made with special qualities too disappointing passable but contains at least one significant flaw and one is just bad unpleasant mostly unpalatable so like my cooking so elite premium satisfactory disappointing unpleasant Columbia Germany Australia Vietnam are more towards the premium side of chocolates where is the US and most other countries like India South Africa or more the average or satisfactory and this also made me ask another question what are the best chocolates made in the United States so we've got no five stars but we have a lot of four-star chocolate bars we have companies like Amano at it they let's go Patrick I am butchering these names that day asking Massey and a lot there are a lot of four and 3.75 up here in the United States but a lot of their coca beans seem to be imported from looks like Papua New Guinea Ecuador Costa Rica to Rio a lot of South American countries and the cocoa percent sweet spot seems to be around 70% all this data is from kaggle comm which I'll link in the description I hope you learned something maybe interesting but you never really thought about about chocolate I saw this dataset and I just I just had to explore it a little bit if you learn something about chocolate maybe something small or you enjoyed the visualization on the math and got to see where all the chocolates coming from please leave a like as I'm just starting off on YouTube it really helps me out a lot so thanks again if you have any questions about anything with any itching questions they just want answer I will go out and find data and visualize it for you and see what we can learn from it together so I'll see you in the next video", "OmCCgzwwvOc": "hey guys it's ken from KVD productions TV and today I'm gonna be doing a review on one of my favorite chocolate bars from the United States called Baby Ruth it is made by Nestle it like to promote the fact that it's four grams of protein in it this bar is around 280 calories and I'll put the rest of the information in the video but this is bursting with peanuts rich caramel and chewy nougat and savor the good stuff there's a little bit of a slogan on the bottom so let's open this chocolate bar up and I'll show you what it looks like and I will take a bite of it and tell you what I like about it this is a chocolate bar that I think you can pretty much only buy in the States like in convenience stores and gas stations but in Canada you have to go to a specialty shop like the candy shop just north of Orillia that's where I got this one from oh my this has been banged around a bit in my bag of goodies so I've destroyed it a bit well that's it's a single large chocolate bar it's not broken into two parts let's break this in half oh wow look up chewy that is something breaking apart like a hard piece of and it's I've had it for a couple months because I haven't had time to I do that review on it yet but there is a lot of chocolate a lot of peanuts I'm not sure if it's just the combination of all three things that makes this chocolate bar really really good but the Americans of that got it made because they get to buy this anywhere they want whereas I have to go to a specialty shop here in Canada to buy this so let's take a quick bite and let me tell you what I like about it first thing I taste when I bite into this bar and it's the peanut and that's where they get their peanuts from watch it's like boom peanut flavor in your mouth and then it goes to the nougat on the caramel okay there's four things I mean I said free earlier well I suggest you go out give Baby Ruth a try let me know in the comments below what you think of the baby Reuben Baby Ruth if you've ever had one if you go out and buy one come back to the video make a comment tell me what you think about it so again thanks for watching don't forget to subscribe comment rate and I will be making more candy videos you", "4l9ratKaUuw": "hey guys welcome back I am so excited to show you this brand new toy it's called the chocolate bar maker this is for ages 5 and up and I thought it was pretty cool how all the plastic used in the set is bpa-free it's made by moose toys and I found it at Walmart for $14.97 this set comes with a lot of different pieces so let me show you what comes inside you of course get your chocolate bar maker instructions you get this little tiny compartment and on the inside is where you melt your chocolate and then when your chocolate is fully melted you just squeeze it out and it comes out the side there you just have to take the cap off when you're ready to squeeze it out you also get this nozzle which you can use to make different chocolate designs the chocolate just comes out the very top of it you get several different molds to make your chocolate you get two of these special yellow ones you can use these with those yellow molds and if you put these at the very bottom before you add your chocolate they'll add a special design to the very top of your chocolate bar you also get two red molds this one totally reminds me of a Hershey's bar here's the other one this one looks like the top of like a Snickers bar or a Three Musketeers bar here are some clear plastic molds and you use these when you want to use something like a nougat or a caramel they also give you some stickers and some bags so that you could give your chocolate bars to some of your friends what I like about these bags is that they have a ziplock zipper at the very bottom so your candy stays super fresh I'm going to go wash all of my candy making molds and I will be right back all of my molds are washed and dried this kit doesn't come with any chocolate so let me show you what kind of chocolate I got I got some of these dark melting wafers I got some white chocolate melting wafers and of course I cannot leave out milk chocolate so I got some of the dov milk chocolate candies so milk chocolate is probably my favorite out of the three so I'm going to start out with that so I'm going to unwrap a bunch of these milk chocolate candies and I'm just going to put a whole bunch into my little plastic bowl these are all ready to go in the microwave to be heated up and melted so you just have to put the cap back on the top and also the cap on the side so it doesn't squirt out the side when you melt all the chocolate well it didn't take very long for my chocolate to melt in my microwave so let me show you guys with the chocolate looks like Oh YUM doesn't it look like you can go swimming in there mmm this is going to be delicious so I brought some other ingredients to add to my chocolate so I can make my chocolate really interesting I have here some gummy worms some Reese's Pieces some mint chips hmm some pretzels pretzels and chocolate always go well together some crushed up candy cane and some crushed up mini Oreos well I'm going to get started and make some chocolate bars [Music] when I finish this last one I'm going to put all these into my freezer so that hopefully they will harden up a lot faster let's see if my first one is hard enough to get it out and it is hey it came out pretty good my other ones weren't quite hard enough yet take out the molds so I melted some white chocolate and now I'm going to make a white chocolate bar [Music] I'm going to go put this one in the freezer to to let the chocolate harden really quickly all the chocolate should be hard enough for me to take out of the molds by now so let's take them all out and put them on the plate I'm just going to take the design piece off the top hey and it came out pretty good you can definitely see the star pattern [Music] so I gave each one my own personal taste test and they were all fantastic of course it's hard to go wrong with chocolate well guys I have to say I really like this chocolate bar maker it was awesome everything worked really well the molds worked really well the chocolate didn't have any issues coming out of the molds the plastic squeezer worked really well in the microwave to melt the chocolate and I didn't have any issues with the chocolate getting too hot or getting burnt or even coming out a little squeezer it worked really really well the kit came with enough accessories that I think you could be making different types of chocolate bars for a long time thank you guys so much for watching this review if you guys liked it please go ahead and hit that like button and we'll see you guys in the next video [Music] Oh", "khX1FWdh31s": "hello chucks and chocolates between chocoboots here for a special video review this time it's the cadburys mini x bar well look at that yes yeah look at that very very excited this one sofia thanks for scotty and andrew winston i think i mentioned this one in the discord chat i basically um it's been available since last year i think it came out in some shops somewhere some random ones maybe um i don't know off licenses or something like that but i just couldn't find it i couldn't find it but um luckily it's appeared in the uh yeah i think in the easter section um of tesco at the moment that's where i found it anyway so very small easter season remember they are sort of stocked with good products but they're very not very well advertised they're kind of um well not really they're like half a half an hour or something like rather than the full one or two aisles that they will be towards easter and so you know but they do have good products in there so get in there where you can yeah there's a few limited edition products coming out really terry's um white chocolate eggs i think is mini eggs and you know just regular eggs as well there's kitkat um white bunnies i think it is something like that or you know mini eggs as well i think yeah so there's cadbury's cadbury white eggs as well so there's also what's coming out to me so all those reviews coming up keeping up for those and we've got this one today yeah so interesting one this one i'm a bit um i must say i'm a bit uh yeah i'm excited to eat it you know i mean it looks great but i think it's just i don't know well here we go look it says with micro mini eggs it says there and that's the problem isn't it it's not full mini eggs in here it's basically like it's like when you get mini smarties in you know nestle um you know products you know what i mean they're never quite as good and you know some micro mini eggs are they really going to be as good you know when they're hmm there were jews about the product you know because i don't know whether they'll be any good or not really really sort of you know scratch that miniature so to speak um so i'm not sure basically um so we'll see we'll see so yeah so here's the calories on the back as well also description actually milk chocolate with micro mini eggs inclusions okay yeah milk chocolate micro mini eggs inclusion 16 there's a palm oil in it yes it does vegetable vegetable fats palm shame okay so we've got this kind of information as well says on this another thing there got to read it from here let's say yesterday six chunks 27.5 grams 144 calories 7.8 grams of fats 4.6 of which etc some hundred grams it's 525 calories 20 grams of fat 17 of which is saturated there's 110 gram bar yes if i was saying that between or five hundred calories um tends to be a sort of uh a good amount uh per hundred grams any more than that's perhaps you know getting on excessive i'm well not excessive but getting on a lot it's got 525 so i'm not sure i'm about to revise that because i've done a few that have been over 500 reasons recently but um you know i did see a few where it was below 500 so who knows maybe i'm maybe i've got it wrong it was too weird i was too lucky with the ones i did previously um but it says milk chocolate milk size 20 minimum actual 23 cocoa size 20 minimum because there's visual facts in addition to cocoa water i don't really know if someone knows what this means it says milk solids 20 minimum actual 23. i don't know what that means why if he's why does he just not say milk solids 23 you know and i don't i don't know i don't understand that i don't understand that anyway there we go unless it's just saying you'll always have a minimum of this inside this product but i don't know why i'd say that why not just say it's 23 you know for surely it's it's it's you know if it's not 25 then they're gonna say something else why why evan have to feel the need to say it's minimum of something when it's actually something else just say what it actually is it's always going to be 20 and then there's no just say whatever it is and it will know it's you know i don't know unless unless you know unless it has to say what the minimum is for some reason or maybe to give us some kind of confidence in the product but i don't know when i don't know it seems odd because if i was reading it and it said 18 minimum coco solids and that mattered to me then um i would buy it you know you know to me so you know you're telling us either way what's in it and if it's not good enough for us then we would have it so i don't know anyway we've got part of the fair trade there there we go yes we're gonna cook after all it's got super vegetarians you can possibly recycle it it's got the recycle symbol and it'll be in it i think it's been actually you know it says well it's got recycled bin on it so okay you're passionate about our great cadbury quality products we're passionate about our great quality cadbury products in such you're not satisfied um in model as uk it says all right there we go so yeah so it looks so cute obviously great load of packaging i mean i'm not sure what else it could have done really but just i don't know it's not the best packaging i've seen but i don't know really i don't know it's just not it doesn't it doesn't blow me away the packaging but i guess you know it is what it is i don't know what they could really do um it's not too exciting the squares are the chocolate though too exciting there's just something not really mini egg-like about it isn't really the other thing obviously just have something about minions but i guess because there aren't many eggs in it that's probably why they're not showing them and it's like it's basically mini smarties in there not many eggs but we'll find out for sure um yeah so let's give it an open let's do it let's go also give this a mini eggs bar and open i don't really call it a mini bar but that's basically what it is i guess um yeah so yeah okay interesting one obviously a big purchase here let's give those measures as well so we're gonna lose about three centimeters at least here okay so with the flourishes it's about 18.8 centimeters long it's 18.8 so we'll give it an open that's why i'm opening it by worthless opportunity i've done about 720 reviews now i think so we're in one of the corners there'll be a link to a place of all my reviews after you've liked this video and subscribe to my channel and check those out and then there's been links to the member program as well you can get exclusive content exclusive reviews things like this so let's go ahead and support the chance to check out as well okay so here we go so it's 18 points was 828 was it so that's uh that's what we've got now got a nice day milk smell from it actually 15 point just about 15.2 so yeah so that's about 3.7 centimeters there from the flourishes let's go check that out roughly yeah it was about 80 minutes about 19 now it would have been about 18.8 well that's what i said so so it sounds about right but yeah so that's 15.2 now isn't it yeah just about just about yeah so 3.7 so that's quite a lot when you think about it three six nine twelve fifty seven fifth of the bar there and we've lost you see so there's lots of nice pieces coming through um that's quite interesting which is about seven and a half centimeters and height the lowest from the bottom so the lowest bit in the trough is about 0.6 centimeters the lowest to the top of the peak of the the segment it's about about one centimeter yeah it's got a lovely smell coming from actually it smells very very milky hmm it smells quite damn it doesn't say damn milk on it but it smells like dairy milk there's a nice smell to it and quite um yeah it looks quite nice and it's an eight by three bar not too bad and what's the uh six chunks so there you go so if a quarter of the bar is your um yeah 144 calories simply comes from fats 4.6 of which et cetera there we go okay for a minute the decimal points between the numbers was a comma which would suggest it's a european bar but it's nice so four stops actually yeah yeah okay yep so all right we have a snap then so there you go nice snap there you heard that it was a good snap um so you can steer you up again so they are is literally they're not really eggs as such and they are kind of you can get one out come out can't really get it actually the whole chocolate just gave way there we go so it's like an over oval shape actually get rid of the chocolate we can there we go there we are so almost got the chocolate off it bit chocolate left at the bottom but um yeah so this is what we're looking at so not really even egg shaped you know they're oval shape it's probably to help you know it's probably oval shape really sort of to give it a rough egg shape from that side um but it's probably to kind of assist in just keeping it flat and to help the chocolate surround it that kind of thing so i think i can kind of understand why they've done that and so we'll give it a taste separately in a bit um but yeah the thing is you'd fairly you'd you'd be quite safe so there's quite a few in there and you can see there's a lot in there um coming through the bottom obviously from this dissection this doesn't seem to be that many but um you can safely say there are some from top to bottom as well you can see them in the top of the segments as well clearly uh in this one here and the various other ones so yeah a nice assortment of colors as well so i'm quite impressed with those but um who's in the pudding like they say so we should give it a taste let's do it i think i'm also going to say cadbury's mini eggs bar a taste and yeah so not really officially called the mini eggs brah but i think that's pretty much what it is um yeah so i've got some segments we've had earlier that's a chock full of stuff um probably possibly intended you see yeah lots of yes sort of um mini eggs in there they're not really called them what they call them on the back they say micro mini eggs inclusions it says so they are actually these sort of oval shaped rugby ball things and yeah i feel that's pretty much to give the sort of illusion of that's a bit weird it's very nice for the capstone and yeah so basically to make it look a bit you know it's give these sort of a semblance of an egg but it's actually sort of an over sort of oval shape you'd say that was really but yeah there we go so probably just doesn't say to make it consistent and easy to fit the chocolate around but all right let's give it a taste excited for this one but um dubious at the same time because i'm feeling like here it might just be it really tasted mini eggs having suggested it so let's give it a go say that's doesn't have that powdery feel of a mini egg um okay let's give it a taste hmm you know what it kind of does kind of does it's not quite not quite the same as mini xm in these sections but uh it's definitely better than i expected it it does come across as a mini egg like they're not quite the same there's another sort of powder taste you get on the on the sugar shells of the of the mini eggs but there's not massive flavor to a mini x really but there's something there isn't it that marks the mouth has been slightly different and it does come across [Music] which i didn't think it would the chocolate's not too bad either i don't know if it's damage it had the smell of damaged chocolate and then it's not advertised as being dairy milk so i don't really know if it is or not but it's not a bad chocolate either yeah i mean it's definitely the same chocolates in mini eggs whatever that is it's like a hmm it's definitely a different cubby chocolate than you get typically i think it's a nice chocolate anyway either way so it's not bad at all yeah i think it's definitely um i mean it works you know it tastes of mini eggs basically it's not quite the same as i say but it does give you that taste it's not got the powdered shell there you get the shells are not quite the same but it gives you the same taste in there when you're eating them other than that i say that powdiness let's just give this mini one natural taste yeah at least more the uh the chocolate just gives you that taste and the crunch of the shells in there give you the taste rather than natural eggs themselves or whatever these are that's in them um tasting exactly like mini eggs it's more just the amount of crunch you've got in there um similar sugar shell it doesn't have say that powderiness to it but it's not bad yeah it's not bad actually it's better than i thought it was going to be it tastes more like mini eggs than i thought it would be um it's not exactly the same as i say that sort of the sugar show's not quite the same obviously it's not the same size the ratios aren't the same you know the eggs are different and stuff like that you know i think i think basically it's not as good as having regular cabbage mini eggs they're a nice experience to have there's something a bit different about them again from this um they're just nice so there's something special about those and i said the the shell has that kind of sugary something to it doesn't it's not i don't know it's not sugar really on it's actually but there's some kind of powder on it that gives it some other extra texture that isn't pheasant in this one um and some kind of you know so i'll say that again yeah and there's some kind of sort of powdery and there's not sugar but some kind of powder on it isn't it that's on the shelves it gives it some kind of texture that isn't present in this in this product um you know other than that everything else is the chocolate's the same so the shells give you that sensation of having the eggs it just doesn't quite just isn't that part of it and i don't think that it's more this is more about the chocolate in this case because that's what you'd expect really because there's a bar version of them does my movie to the um eminem's bar as well which was a similar kind of concept really hmm not the same concept which is nice actually i'll say the chocolate's nice and it's definitely distinct mini eggs chocolate taste i mean it's dairy milk but it definitely smells it's not many miles away from it anyway something you know it's definitely distinct cadbury's chocolate [Music] i like it it's not bad i just think um it's hard to justify getting this over just regular mini eggs i just don't know why you would really get this over vineyards i think i think you'd i think you'd be happy with mini eggs they taste more obviously exactly like mini eggs because they are them this one doesn't quite do it and then there's enough chocolate mini eggs to sort of give you that chocolate hit i don't think you need the bar of it um so it does so you know it is a bit of a i won't say a pointless product but i mean if he's something it's a bit of another one it's something that's slightly different gives you a bit of a different way of having mini eggs but i don't think it's needed i think mini eggs are just better and get that mini egg hit in the mini eggs and if you want which is why the only reason you'd buy this is because you like mini eggs so you know clearly that's what you're after and she may just buy the mini eggs you know because this one um it's just not quite as good as mini eggs it doesn't quite have the same sort of shell the same that sort of nice as i say um coated shell that you get in the mini eggs um and it doesn't quite taste it's not quite got the sort of textures and tastes it's just not the same you know it's just not the little eggs you know what i mean it's just not the same but nonetheless it's a nice alternative something a bit different and but it's just not as good so what can you do it's just not the same you know what i mean it's just not the same so if you had if you had proper full coated mini eggs maybe that would be something um but even then would you really need that because there's struggle on the inside i don't know so this is just another way of having the same thing that's just not as good um but it's still a nice bar so i think for that reason it's probably maybe four out of five i think then yeah so a nice bar a good way of you know um really giving you that mini x hit in a bath version but it's just not quite as good um in most ways really but it does give you what it sets out to do which is a bar with mini eggs in it sort of or at least a mini egg taste and that's and that's what it does achieve aside from that as i say that's a little powdery shell that you get on the meninges it doesn't quite get that but everything else it does pretty much get um but just slightly lesser no texture not the not the feel um yeah it's just as i say just not quite the same four out of five okay guys hope you enjoyed that review uh following you to instagram and yeah check out my youtube my program if you can that'd be great to support the channel get some extra content as well leave away leave a comment for free always love to hear from you and i always do reply so take care have a lovely day i'll see you soon bye for now see ya you", "JZ2fRE_nkak": "I'm Amy Guittard and I'm a chocolate expert I can't go away bacon chips otherwise known as chocolate chips which if you're a home baker you're probably super familiar with these right out the gate they both look pretty similar not too much of a color difference they both have nice little tails which is what we call the tip of the baking chip so this one has a little bit of a white note to it it's called bloom it looks kind of like a white powder some people might think it's mold if the chocolate is in a hot environment and then it cools down in a not proper temperature it'll get bloom so since these look so similar let's move into tasting so first I'm gonna try this guy over here so this is a little bit sweeter the grind itself is a little bit coarser the first thing I'm tasting is not chocolate it's sugar so when you're making chocolate first you take your beans and you roast them after roasting you grind them up and make cocoa liquor or unsweetened chocolate much the same way that one would make peanut butter from peanuts you grind your peanuts to make your peanut butter you grind your cocoa nibs to get your unsweetened chocolate if you're refining on a shorter period of time your grain or your particle size is going to be larger which means that the fat that's being released in the mass itself is gonna have larger globules for it to cover so when it's on your tongue it's not going to melt as fluidly as if it were smaller particle sizes with more cocoa butter covering them so in the case of this particular chocolate I'm tasting more sugar which means that not only is the mass have a higher content of sugar but I'm guessing that maybe in the refining stage they didn't refine it as finely as another brand might sugar is probably the cheapest ingredient that you'd be adding so if a company is making a ton of chocolate chips and just pumping them out the door they might be using more of the cheaper ingredient and trying to cut down their production time which would be in the refining stage for instance which is where you're going to have something that's a little bit more sugar and a little bit larger particle size so now I'm gonna go ahead and taste B so this chocolate when I first taste it it's a really nice rich chocolate note it lingers a little bit longer on my tongue I'm tasting sugar much like I tasted this but it's certainly not the first thing I'm tasting and also as I eat this chocolate it melts really evenly on my tongue I'm not tasting a lot of particle size in it this is this is a nice standard rounded beautifully flavored cookie drop I can't go away I think B probably has been refined a little bit more I'm thinking it probably has less sugar in it than a and I'm thinking the origins that they're using are a little bit different than a as well so I'm gonna go ahead and guess that I think B is probably the more expensive one but let's do that make me feel oh it is but just by a little bit huh the shape is the same this has white on it but I don't think that it's due to bloom it might be due to just scuffing and transportation this particular chocolate is very sugar forward and the grains in the chocolate as it melts on my tongue are really prominent so for your bang for your buck you're getting a whole lot more flavor for just $1 more in these guys than you are for these guys so it looks like we've got some milk chocolate here and I can figure that out just by the color and just off the bat taking a look at them the color is pretty similar this is a little bit lighter brown this is a little bit of a darker brown but what I'm noticing more other than the color is just the texture that you have in the chocolate itself in the case of this one you can tell that the particle size is a little bit larger and so when you break it and you've got that rough edge that to me is a clear sign that there might be a lesser quality milk chocolate happening here typically with a milk chocolate you can have dark milk so you can have lighter milk so just in looking at these one might think that just because it's darker it might have more cocoa in it but the only way to find out is to taste it so let's start with a I'm gonna do chocolate you have to let it melt on your mouth so what I'm tasting with this it's a really bright fresh berry note with milk chocolate you're not necessarily looking for chocolate flavor you're really looking for milk flavor that complements chocolate so in this case it's a really upfront fresh dairy note the chocolate flavor is there it's a nice clean palate it lingers quite nicely on on my tongue as I let it melt and this is a really nice even melt as well now let's try beep gosh this is so soft so this is um super almost like metallic II I don't really get chocolate I don't really get milk I get a really sort of burned in the back of my throat flavor so my guess here is that the dairy that's being used in this might be coming from a higher quality dairy farm versus the dairy that's being used in this this could very well be grass-fed dairy versus this although sometimes that really affects the flavour sometimes it doesn't this might be a happier cow than this guy so I'm guessing that with be the processing has probably been shortened a little bit maybe the refining process wasn't as laborious or thoughtful as it was in a but let's do the big reveal as suspected a definitely is the more expensive with be the particle sizes again are quite large which makes it a little bit difficult to melt evenly on my tongue and it's also impacting the total fat that's in the product and how it melts on my tongue which is giving again that waxy note which is all a product of how it's being manufactured or produced in factory my biggest hunch about this significant price difference is not only the quality of dairy that's being used but also the time that's going into manufacture this something with this level of graininess and sort of lack of depth just in the general delivery of milk and chocolate leads me to believe that it's probably more of a commodity that they're just pumping out large volumes of this particular chocolate as opposed to this this is really an art and a science it's being delivered here in the case that maybe you're doing a lot of volumes say with s'mores I would maybe consider going with with the cheaper version but in most cases you're really going to be able to tell the difference from a really high quality milk chocolate versus a lower quality cheaper milk chocolate so if you can handle the price difference I would always say with try and go it to go with the more expensive one okay so we've got white chocolate the elusive white chocolate well first of all you can't call white chocolate white chocolate with the word chocolate in it unless it has 20 percent minimum cocoa butter what does someone maybe replace the cocoa butter with something that's probably cheaper which is oftentimes like a vegetable fat these are both white products whether they're both white chocolate we'll soon find out this is an even white color this is more of a yellowish color which leads me to believe that it might be more natural so when you think chocolate you think Brown and that Brown is coming from the solids that are in the unsweetened chocolate with white chocolate it's white because it doesn't have any of the cocoa solids in it it's just made up of cocoa butter which without the solids is clear this particular product over here is so bright white that it might have an additive added to it to even out the color and drop out any off colors that one might not want in their end product so now it's time to taste I'm gonna actually start with this one over here just because I think it looks tastier um why not so as suspected it is melting quite evenly on my tongue fun fact cocoa butter melts at your body's temperature so this particular product is melting quite quickly I can taste some sugar but for the most part it's a really fresh dare you know it has a little bit of citrus to it and it's a really creamy mouthfeel it's really clean moving on to B let me taste this one now I'm a little scared because it looks a little bright wait it's always scary when it comes to food mmm this is not melting as easily and fluidly as this one which makes me think that this probably is not a white chocolate I'm thinking this is probably has a fair amount of vegetable fat in it alternatively to the cocoa butter so I'm thinking this is probably a compound I also think that this is a fair amount of vanilla added into it it's that's pretty much all I'm tasting is vanilla and sugar when I taste this guy and again the most important sort of cue to me when I'm tasting this is that it's not melting evenly it's really sticky and waxy on my mouth and the roof of my mouth so I'm gonna go ahead and say that this is probably a compound this is probably a white chocolate and I'm gonna say that this is probably significantly more expensive than this one okay big reveal aha so this as suspected is a bit more pricey than this one you don't have twenty percent minimum cocoa butter in your final product you can't call it chocolate and most of the time if something is a pure chocolate it's got a little bit of a yellower hue to it you add vegetable fat in you're replacing the cocoa butter with something that is more stable might not require tempering as I thought this probably has a significant amount of sugar in it compared to this which it has some cocoa butter in it some sugar and just a really beautifully made white chocolate okay so it looks like we've got some cocoa powders here I guess first things that I notice about these guys is that they look like they're natural cocoa powders I say that because most of them are a little bit they're both a little bit on the lighter side if something's Dutch twitch means adding sodium bicarbonate it's a dutching agent which makes the cocoa powder turn a little bit darker I'm also noticing that this one over here is slightly darker than than this one here if they're already natural cocoa powders they tend to have more moisture in them the moisture tends to make the cocoa powder a little bit darker cocoa powder is made by taking unsweetened chocolate and putting it in a hydraulic press and pressing it with so much pressure that you're separating your cocoa powder from your cocoa butter so you're basically you have your solids and your fats they're both sort of light and fluffy they've got some grain to them but I guess the next step for me to figure out which one is better is if I taste them hey Justine thought it a little bit jerky so the first thing I noticed when I taste this one is that it's really quite burned so that means that they were probably roasting the liqueur quite high before they made the cocoa powder and the other thing that I noticed is that the flavor profile on my tongue doesn't linger it sort of sort of hits my tongue and then the chocolate flavor stops okay now I'm gonna try this other one I don't know why I can't do this without my own when I taste this one the first thing I'm tasting it's a nice rounded deep chocolate note it's not burned it's a really sort of light fresh it's still chocolatey and you can still taste it's been roasted but it's definitely not a high roasted liquor that's probably being used in this I'm also noticing that the flavor once it hits my tongue lasts a little bit longer it lingers a little bit more and that's a sign of some of a higher quality cocoa powder as well when you're trying to select which cocoa powder to use your want to have make sure that it's got full flavor full chocolate flavor as well as a nice long lingering flavor profile I'm gonna go ahead and say that B is probably the more expensive of the two yep B B it is so this one's definitely obviously more expensive I didn't think that it was gonna be that much more expensive but I think some of the things that might be happening here is it could very well be an organic cocoa powder it might have some certifications on it as well like a fair trade or rain forest Alliance certified the really important part is that it's delivering a really strong chocolate flavor with Dutch cocoa powders you're oftentimes getting more of a cocoa flavor cooked salty flavored in a the flavor profile of the chocolate isn't super chocolaty it's more burned than chocolate but there's definitely some some uniqueness going on here that's lacking in this one which is probably where the price difference is coming from okay so it looks like we have a super dark chocolate here a chocolate bar the other thing that I'm noticing with this as well is this one over here on it B has a fair amount of air bubbles in it the air bubbles don't necessarily affect the quality of the chocolate but it definitely impacts my perception of the quality of the chocolate so in this case with the air bubbles there it makes me think that maybe there was something that was lacking in the way that it was processed or the attention to detail that went into making this chocolate so let me go ahead and taste this one so I'm guessing it's probably in the 80% range I knew it was a dark chocolate by the by the color of it but it's definitely a really deep rich dark chocolate there's not a lot going on in terms of complexity there's a little astringency at the end of it but the flavor the deep chocolate flavor notes is really coming up upfront and then it lingers throughout as I'm finishing eating it so this definitely tastes like something that I could eat a lot of we call that Moorish where you just want more of it and if it's not something that you can eat a lot of it might be a single origin we call that sipping chocolate where you might just want a little bit and you're satisfied you can't have too much of it now I'm going to go ahead and try this one B so this is very different from this one it's a little bit more extreme it's not a really rounded flavor profile it I think it's probably a single origin I definitely wouldn't be able to have a lot of this so when I taste both of these they both melt rather evenly on my tongue there's not a significant difference in terms of particle size like we are commenting on earlier the main difference is just flavor development on my palate when I eat them my guess is that B is probably more expensive but I really have no idea so I guess let's take a look and see what the difference is oh my goodness why is that say five hundred and fifty dollar the bar I thought there would be difference but I didn't think it would be this much this is surprising I didn't even know there was a bar that was five hundred and fifty dollars maybe they have a direct relationship with the farm and there might be a component like an heirloom cacao component to this I'm not entirely sure I don't think the air bubbles necessarily affect the quality but it definitely gives an appearance of a lower quality chocolate bar I might just want a really delicious chocolate bar that I can eat in one or two or ten bites I might want this for a special occasion where I'm pairing it with something at a dinner party I don't know if I would pay that much personally don't forget this is still a seven dollar chocolate bar which isn't a cheap chocolate bar from the grocery store it's still a really high-quality chocolate but you know the big takeaway here is that you know you don't have to spend an arm and a leg to buy a really good bar of chocolate there's a time and a place for when you would want to buy an expensive chocolate bar whether it's seven dollars or in some cases what is it 550 so I'm hoping the big takeaway from today is that prices and everything that it's really important to taste the chocolate that you are choosing between if you want to go with an 89 cent chocolate bar great if that satisfies your craving if you want to spend five hundred and fifty dollars on a single origin chocolate perfect hopefully you learned something here that will make it easier when you're at the store trying to make some decisions around what chocolate to buy", "hijoB1eYVOY": "[Music] good afternoon on you wonderful waste of space welcome back to magic baking and welcome back to another junk food review today we're talking about something has been a long time coming there's finally not one not two but three brand new daily milk bars and none of them contain Oreo so roughly a year ago Cadbury launched this website in which customers and fans of the brand could click through and they could design their very own chocolate bar basically it had to be obviously the standard daily milk base but you could add three or four extra ingredients to it they said they were going to pick a winner but they've actually picked three winners which means that the British public are being given a chance to narrow down the three best flavor ideas I say best they didn't pick my option I'll get over it so I believe at the moment these are available in pangolins and in Tesco I also find these in the coop so there should be plenty of places where you can get your fix from anyway let's talk about these flavors so the three new flavors that we have today are simply the zest raspberry shortcake and chocolaty so I'm going to taste this simply the zest bar first simply because I think it's one that's the most kind of predictable in flavor this bar is an orange flavored chocolate with almond caramel pieces and digestive biscuit though I must say even though on the front it describes itself as orange flavored chocolate on the back it actually describes itself as milk chocolate with orange flavored pieces of which there are only eight percent of said orange pieces four percent biscuit pieces and four percent crunchy almond caramel pieces enough chatting and complaining let's into this bar and see if Neelam Shah has created a bar worth keeping they've really gone all out on the decoration here I just kind of hope they would prove some extra effort into the decoration because so many companies don't it would be nice to see that but never mind we can see on the back that we're gonna have some of those nice chunky bits I must say the first smell is just Ju milk which is never a bad thing because I do love it nothing overwhelmingly orangey or um deep so when you break it off you can see those kind of chunky digestive biscuit pieces in there just always good because they love a bit of biscuit and we also have hope you can see this we also have a tiny little orange piece or orange flavored piece in there too so let's taste the simply the zest DailyMail bar that's pretty decent so while the chocolate itself is no orange flavored there is a major punch of orange flavor in there so what the chunks of orange in there they're like candied peel and you would get in a Christmas cake or maybe on top of a lemon drizzle cake just that ever so slightly soft and chewy kind of crystallized zesty flavor it's actually really nice in there it's a really nice kind of chewy texture also a big fan of the biscuit pieces it adds some much-needed kind of crunch in amongst the chewiness and the creaminess of the chocolate as well one thing I will complain about is well I definitely got the texture of those almond caramel chunks I didn't really get a flavor of it but overall when you take a mouthful of this you get creaminess you get chewiness you get crunchiness you get super orangie flavor along with a really distinctive daily milk you know they haven't done any kind of cop-out where it's just a more kind of plain genetic milk chocolate it's definitely a big daily milk flavor in there too don't get me wrong obviously very very sweet because daily milk is a very sweet chocolate anyway and the orange kind of amplifies that it's nothing super innovative nothing super exciting but taste and texture are pretty decent so I'm going to give the daily milk simply the zest a 4 out of 5 so sticking with a fruity vibe let's move on to the raspberry shortcake so this bar is milk chocolate started with raspberry pieces white crisp pearls and shortcake yes okay so the more in-depth description is milk chocolate with white chocolate coated cereal balls so pretty much a white chocolate coated rice krispies I think with Shortcake and freeze-dried raspberry pieces this excites me because I bloody love a bit of freeze-dried you see what do I like using in cakes I love sort of seeing it I think that's a gorgeous color it adds a bit of textured again so I'm excited to get into this one again none of the flavors are super exciting but it's a nice kind of summery range of flavors and again it's nothing that cavity have ever done before so I've probably should stop complaining even though the front of the bar is fairly unremarkable well there is a serious serious amount of studs going on in the back with those crispy pearls and that shortcake in there too let me just show you a close-up of this so we can see lots of chunky pieces of the shortcake biscuit those crispy cereal bowls and you can even see just teaching through a little bit some red ruby pieces but that freeze-dried raspberry in there too I don't know if we'll get a whole load of raspberry flavor from this I'm really excited to try it the Daily Mail raspberry shortcake oh wow a surprising kick of raspberry flavor in there I am a big big fan of that so you bite into it the first thing you get obviously is that creamy daily milk chocolate taste then you get this gorgeous crunch and there's two kinds of crunch in there there's that kind of more buttery short tasting crumbly crunch from the shortcake and that more kind of vibrant 80 crispy crunch from the cereal pieces while the raspberry isn't overwhelming it's definitely there and I must say I think it is actually quite evenly distributed when you get a little piece inside one of those chunks you just feel the kind of sour and receiving parts of your tongue just going hello good morning I'm pleasantly surprised it has a real kind of freshness to it you know I'm not the biggest fan of fruit in chocolate bars but the raspberry and this really kind of wakes up makes zingy it stops it from just being the same kind of sickly creaminess over and over again I'm actually a big fan of that taste and texture it's a more exciting combination than the previous bar it's something that definitely isn't being done by other brands that I'm aware of at the moment and the big fan of that as far as daily milk goes this is a huge improvement on the kind of repetitive audio content we've had from them recently I'm gonna go ahead and controversially give this raspberry shortcake to you milk a five out of five finally we have the third fun made daily milk bar flavor to taste this is made by column something so this is the chocolaty this is milk chocolate with coffee flavored Cockrum and digestive biscuit pieces so I believe this bar is going to have a soft filling which is something we haven't had from the other two bars yet I'm intrigued to see if it really is a milky latte kind of flavor or if they have gone quite bold with the coffee taste I love strong coffee so I'm happy either way they certainly love their digestive pieces though I think we've managed to get biscuit pieces in all three bars Wow major coffee smell err so when we open this one up it really does just look like a very unassuming Plain Jane you milk chocolate bar because there's just nothing exciting going on in the appearance but the smell of that while it isn't your Starbucks espresso kind of smell or your artisanal pulled over it's definitely reminiscent of when you open a new jar of instant coffee it just has that kind of cozy dad's cup of coffee kind of smell that probably sounds ridiculous but you might know what I mean so let's get into this and see what this is all about okay you can get a good view of that kind of creamy white coffee filling there I can't see any chunks of digestive pieces so I don't really know where they're hiding but let's taste the daily milk chocolatey yes boys yes that it's what I want from a coffee flavored chocolate it's rich it's bold its creamy it just kind of melts away into this lovely grown-up coffee flavor well it's obviously a creamy tone down milky coffee flavor it doesn't have all the kind of are skyking boldness of a double espresso but it's definitely not one for people who don't like coffee there's a good flavor of it in there the digestive pieces are quite sparse so if you King for a bar with texture this isn't really the one this is definitely a creamy melting chocolate experience to contrast for the other two but there is the occasional little kind of lively crunch of biscuit in there I absolutely adore the smell the texture is actually quite reminiscent if you are from Poland or if you've watched any of my polish chocolate videos this reminds me a lot of the cappuccino bar from an event 'el or vidal the big polish chocolate manufacturer and this is actually really reminding me of that and that's a very good thing because their chocolate is insane I am very impressed with that again you know this one isn't the most exciting a texture but it delivers absolutely everything it promises and I'm very happy to sit and just you know devour the rest of this right now that for me that's another five out of five I am genuinely so impressed I'm so happy if any of these three win the competition to stick around forever I'll be happy personally I think I would be happiest if the coffee or the glass 31 the coffee might just edge it just because it is just that a little bit different from everything else that we have on these UK shelves just now they're all good I would recommend them all they're all like a pound or a pound 50 just now go out and try them I urge you people can't berry need to make more exciting things again and that's exactly what they've done here if you have it tasted any of these bars let me know what your thoughts in the comments below I want to know

don't go so far I don't know if it wasn't we do have one big fire truck let's not be greedy that's not being greedy that's really cool though I wasn't expecting it with that that one was really teetering okay guys so this is surprise area it's the same as all over Hollywood balls a few things different they have the Mario lights up here we've got these candle starburst ones they got like the lol surprise mystery light six they are quite reasonable reasonably priced I personally love these so cute collectibles and then they've got like the lower value ticket items here that one was more

this awesome light-up snowflake for her daughter Bonnie she's gonna love that and then we got the Super Mario light-up little lamp you just put a couple of double triple A batteries in it that is really awesome that was two thousand tickets we won the huge Dairy Milk out of the yeah like American candy that would weigh like a pound this thing is like really really heavy yeah so that's probably

candies let us know what you thought of the video guys did you think that we were actually gonna win that thing I did not but used a little bit of a skill and a little bit of luck there with that claw

"9zTIMH--nWc": "[Music] I mean when you commit this video for you literally years I want to OCD people who get really annoyed when a nice six blocks a shot work like this ends up one like this in this must operate more at work but this is the cheapest way to buy good quality chocolate 250 grams it's about half pounds and it's about usually five dollars for four US dollars what everyone usually does is like why those tiny little tiny little buzzer chocolate that are like the tenth of the size and cost half as much pretty crazy I break up one of these buzzers chocolate so that it's been a little portions that you can use just like a little better profit and grab one out whatever you want without turning in for me how do you do it well it's pretty simple but it takes a bit of finesse but let me see as you can see the text to the fire of duck that kind of Sunni to the scene where the kids eat chocolate I'm not being paid by what it is to make this it happens through my favorite brand of economical chocolate would you say on hand crafts but I'm not recommending it over any other brand of chocolate however they do still have the 250 grams locks which i think is pretty cool everything else seems to have shrunk so all you need is a long grid night of some sort doesn't really matter what kind of nice as long as it's long flat so the packaging as you can see this is the most this is like real wooly wonka kind of picketing you've got the nice outside wrapper and that awesome golden painter that you dream about when your kid now that inside packaging is held on to the outside packaging by little spots of glue so what you've got to do is slide the knife underneath it and prize it up gently from both sides trying not to damage the paper in the process until you can slide your knife right under this now let's talk us made any doing but you can buy it and well as the world and probably a lot of other brands probably a lot of other friends talk about that have a similar thank you so once you've got all the glue out you see the info picking you just slides out so you slide the top out and then you pull up the tab here then you slide it the other way and you pull out the tab at the bottom and that's the reason why will become apparent later so then you grab that top tab again and pull it up the top part is glued like this you can unfold these bits in then surprise that apart gently so you don't rip hole on the paper yeah you get your finger in there when your work the glue on the sides apart nice and neatly like that so now this is where you want to grab the bottom tab and then you grab the top of the chocolate bar and then you just ease it out like that at this point I'm going to get a plate so that I'm not putting the chocolate down anything dirty but don't really need it if you're careful look at that one king-size delicious photo chocolate so now the key is what we're aiming to do is we're aiming to fit the six and then packet and there's all kinds of ways to do that but why I like is to breathe then you can break these myths up in towards mini little bits as you want at a minimum you want to break it like that then you've got a pile of nice neat little portions that you can spit back in here so to reconstitute this picket slide that back over there let's then open that up pop that in there and then you can just fold it over look at that puts back in there and when you want a bit and pull it out without waking your hot the whole packet and then you can bring mini little bits as you want free air again you did it to all of them so then when you reach in your just grabbing out a tiny little piece that's it voila not only that stands up by itself take that way through source [Music]", "X1vpS_AzrzU": "sets quickly and correctly sets quickly incorrectly yeah sets quickly and correctly sets quickly and okay we're gonna aerate some chocolate today what does that mean you're gonna add bowls into chocolate it's a nice super fun I don't expect you to make this at home because I need a lot of such equipment but it's really cool to look at so stick around and watch me have bubbles - my chocolate mix it super melty and it's delicious so what you're going to need is a count of tempered chocolate tempered chocolate means that it will set quickly and correctly so one pound and I'm going to pour it into an is.i container fancy term for adding air into a food this is also known as a whipped-cream cannister now that the tempered chocolate is in the whipped-cream cannister you're going to close it and then you're going to fill up a cartage with no.2 nitrogen so we're gonna plop it in make sure it's right side up point you up screw it on this is kind of fun but also a little scary because it's thoroughly like chemistry class oh and you're going to charge it by shaking it three times okay so that's one charge then you take this out okay then you can't believe do that oh it's cold then take your second one and you charge it again I don't expect you to make this at home I just want to eat I want to show you how cool this is okay this one wasn't as cold and then the last charge [Music] now I'm ready this one okay so now I have a vacuum steel container these are containers that you can put in a special lid and it sucks out all the air and I lined it with acetate was just just plastic okay ready okay white was not the right color to wear then you seal this and then you press vacuum in seal ready some magical separator [Music] so now at doubled in size we can stop it you pull the top off first let it hang so by adding the tempered chocolate into this whipped cream container what it does is add bubbles into the tempered chocolate and then when I transferred it into my vacuum sealed container it made those big ol pickles and made those bubbles even larger so it's super creamy and melting your mouth even faster so now that it's been 15 minutes the chocolate has set I'm gonna release all that air big button okay so cool now remember that plastic I taped it to my container I'm gonna remove the tape this is your friend because it's gonna help you take out the chocolates tada it's really light because it's basically air ahhh so now I'm gonna show you how big the bubbles are it's not dense this is aerated chocolate kind of like a honeycomb a chocolate version it's so smooth and melt super quickly I think this was a major success if you guys have any science project or weird things you want me to hack you let me know comments below blue ribbon you you", "qls7jm-hXgk": "today Kevin and I are going to be trying to very unique chocolates and you will see why they actually say trump on them Liz my good friend in Ohio she traveled to New York in early June and she stayed at the Trump Hotel and while she was there she thought of us and I think that was this is just really special that she did that she picked up two of these gold bars from the Trump Hotel because she knows that we love Celebrity Apprentice and unfortunately there's been a lot in the news lately about Donald Trump and there will be no more Celebrity Apprentice at least not from him not with him so but I think this is awesome I think it's a cool gift I think it's a very unique and the company that made these is de brand and I look them up and I want to say they were in Illinois I did look at the company app and I don't remember what I like to up a few days ago Indiana that was that I knew it was with an AI Indiana they are in de brand fine chocolates they're in Indiana it's www brandy EBR a nd calm these are the same bars they're both milk chocolate one bar is 240 calories and they're small so but I went to their website and they have are you gonna be careful they have all kinds of wonderful looking chocolate truffles oh my goodness they have like a set of six troubles and it's like twenty dollars for six troubles so I can't imagine how much this cost these were not on their website so I'm assuming they are sold at the Trump store only and you can't get them online but they offer all its a gun soft chocolate it's not super super super hard to wear here choco it's good at how about thick waxy field it reminds me of some of the chocolate we have had from England yeah it's good it's a very good but it's not near a sweet that's what you get here which surprises me and that it's made in Indiana mm-hmm because you know when you compare a candy bar here a Hershey's to to an English candy bar like I don't want to say era but to one of their candy bars you just don't the sweetness you just don't get that this is not a sweet chocolate at all it's very good but it's very rich and it's really good chocolate flavor like I said it does have a little it's good though goes down smoothly yes yes I think some of those chocolates I've eaten were American targets that really sweep down was burned going down a little bit because they're so stupid this is yeah this is not like this this is something that you want to eat slowly um yes and they're the truffles that they had online they have all different flavors of those these are just the milk chocolate so if you go to their website you're gonna see a lot more and they have some great pictures but they have sets and they mail it to you of course so I just think that's really neat but this is cool that was good yes and thank you so much Liz we really really appreciate it and this is so unique and I will even though we've cut off the end of this I'm gonna take a picture of it so that you can see it really good for the end of the video so hopefully everyone else enjoyed this and thanks for watching", "R-IHwrRUo-s": "hey guys what's up we got something new here for you more and more states are actually

vortex back with yet another eating challenge today what I'm planning on doing at the request of one of my subscribers is eating an entire 100 pack of mini chocolate bars it doesn't look like there's very many in this bowl and you saw me peel them all earlier however this is an 11 liter Bowl so that's why the volume doesn't look that high so you know this package of 100 mini chocolate bars weighs just over one kilogram and I don't know if you'll be able to see that on the box however there's the closest feel I can give you from where I'm sitting this also equates to 5000 calories so despite the lack of volume two and a half pounds approximately it is 5000 calories it's still quite a bit of food and I'm gonna try to eat this as quick as I can so let's go start my timer start one for myself [Music] [Music] [Music] so I tried to do it - ten minutes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] - we just heard they're the hardest to eat [Music] [Music] we will attract the better be dollar [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] ah whoa okay so a little bit of sweat nothing like when I did the pizza pops and not nearly as fast as I thought it was gonna be here hmm but in my own defense it was the Smarties let's screw me over the Smarties take forever to eat they're really hard they're really hard to chew so anyway that's a hundred mini chocolate bars one kilogram approximately 2.2 pounds 5000 calories eaten in just over 19 minutes so yeah shout out to my subscriber that asked me to do this video this is my first successful challenge I tackled this challenge and I finished it in 19 minutes so I'm counting that as a victory thanks for tuning in and if you like this video please remember to Like share and subscribe this is num navour tech signing off", "OMcjvbyjd2w": "hey guys it's Amy today I'm going to be showing you how to make chocolate bars with the inclusions or textures on the surface alright so first we need to get our mold nice and shiny and clean so the way that I do that is I use a little bit of vodka put it on a cotton ball not too much you don't want it something wet you don't want too much of it in there and then you're just going to very gently clean the mold with the cotton ball make sure you get into all the little cracks and crevices if you're using a mold that has more detail to it do make sure that you get into all the little ones then afterwards if you feel like the vodka has not evaporated yet then you can use a dry cotton ball just to go back over to make sure it's nice and dry the reason that we do this is to remove bacteria but it also helps us get a really nice shine on the chocolate now once that's done we're going to start with putting in the inclusions today I'm using roasted hazelnut halves some cinnamon wafers and freeze-dried cherry pieces [Music] [Music] alright so next up we're going to cover this with us with a little bit of a piping of chocolate now the reason that we do this is to hold the textures or the inclusions as they're called professionally in place so that when we pour the chocolate in it doesn't go directly down to the surface at the moment so you can think of this as kind of like a glue now we don't want to tap them all too much at this point to let the chocolate settle because we don't want to going underneath the inclusion and that's not the point the point is to just hold it in place so that when we do pour the chocolate in it doesn't disrupt those inclusions once you're happy with that you can either leave it at room temperature if your room temperatures not over 20 degrees Celsius or you can pop it in the refrigerator for about two to three minutes and then when you take it out don't add the chocolate until your mold has come more to room temperature so maybe leave it out for about five minutes before pouring your chocolate in all right so now you're going to pour your chocolate in at this stage you can also tap the mold as you can see in the video here I'm using an offset spatula just to settle the chocolate down a little bit into the cavities so give it a little tap not too much again we don't want it going too far under the inclusions but we do want to get those air bubbles out and then use your offset spatula or any kind of bench scraper to scrape away any excess chocolate I like to use my finger sometimes and then we're just going to pop that in the fridge to set about five minutes or if you have a room temperature of about eighteen degrees you can leave it out to set at room temperature full crystallization on the bars will happen after about 24 hours but you can eat them straight away to take them out of the mold you can twist it a little bit like an ice cube tray if it's not coming out straight away turn it upside down if you need to you can give it a gentle tap with the handle of your offset spatula just to release the chocolate and there you go beautiful textured bars with the inclusions on the surface alright guys that's it so if you like this video please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel I'll see you again next time [Music] all right all right", "t8LGPgw0sFk": "this Diwali sharing with you all an easy and shortcut way of making homemade chocolate bars in four different and unique ways and I am also sharing details on the million dollar question of why does my chocolate melt or why does it have some moisture so do keep watching this video till the end if you would like to know the answer for the same [Music] let's start by making some homemade bounty bars in a bowl combine together some desiccated coconut and condensed milk [Music] mix until they clump together you will also need some melted chocolate now I have a detailed video on how to melt chocolate the right way which I think will be very useful for you guys and hence I'm linking it up here or in the description box below you can watch that video to find know in depth about how to melt your chocolate the right way so that it doesn't split or curdle so I am using a combination of dark and milk chocolate in this case because kids generally prefer milk chocolate over dark it is totally up to you you can choose any variety of chocolate for this either dark or milk or a combination like I have done today along with that you will also need some kind of molds to allow your chocolate to set or shape I am using a bar shaped ones today and about a tablespoon of melted chocolate onto your molds and then twist and turn it so that it fills up all the space available [Music] gently tap your moulds to remove any kind of air bubbles and also to form a smooth surface and then let it sit in the refrigerator for about 2-3 minutes under lettuce said not more than that to flavor our coconut mixture I'm gonna add in a drop or so off of a vanilla bean paste and then mix it up all well you can do this right when you're adding condensed milk as well I forgot to add it at that stage so I'm adding it now grease your hands with some clarified butter or ghee so that the coconut mixture doesn't stick to your hands and then pinch out a small portion and shape it into a rectangle or the shape of the molds that you are using place this coconut layer on top of the chocolate one and then spread it so that it fills the entire cavity if need be go ahead and add little bit of extra so that you get coconut in each and every bite top the entire thing with some more melted chocolate so that everything is covered and sealed again tap the molds to remove some excess air bubbles and to smoothen the surface wipe off the excess and let it sit in the refrigerator until set say around nearly 5 to 10 minutes once the chocolate has set slowly and gently unmolded to enjoy your homemade bounty bars [Music] next up let's make some chocolate and caramel pass so the procedure is almost is the same we will fill in a tablespoon of melted chocolate on top of our molds twist and turn it so that the chocolate fills the entire surface and then place it in the refrigerator to set for around two to three minutes once out add in some caramel sauce now this is a homemade one you can also use store-bought if you are looking out for the recipe that I already have one on the channel I'll link it up here or in the description box bit and then we'll just repeat the steps that we did earlier that is to add some more extra chocolate so that everything is sealed up tap to remove the excess air bubbles and to smoothen the surface wipe off the excess and then place this in the refrigerator to set completely say around 5 to 10 minutes one set unmold and enjoying now let's make the most trending flavor of the season rasmalai chocolate bar to our melted white chocolate let's add in some slivered almonds and pistachios [Music] cardamom powder [Music] and finally some rasmalai essence if you do not have rasmalai essence you can also add in some almond or pistachio essence and that wood is also taste equally good but of course it won't be a rasmalai chocolate then mix everything until it is combined and then transfer it onto the moulds of your choice [Music] spread it using an offset spatula so that it covers the entire mold you guys know the drill by now right just tap it off to remove the air bubbles and then wipe off the excess using a tissue or towel in this case though we will allow the white chocolate to set at room temperature itself because it takes hardly any time to set one side gently unmold and your delicious rasmalai chocolate bar is already coming to my most favorite flavor that is paan masala chocolate bar to make this onto my mixer jar I'll add in a tablespoon of chopped mint leaves some pan masala that you can easily get from a local pan voila if you could lay your hands on fresh pan leaves then definitely use that in place of mint leaves let's just blend it all together coarsely just use the pulse mode without adding any water take it out onto a bowl [Music] add in some mock wasps and some desiccated coconut mix it all together and add it to your melted white chocolate [Music] mix them together until combined finally let's also add in a quarter of a teaspoon of pan masala essence in case you are using fresh corn leaves then you can skip this step [Music] combine everything well and before adding it on to your molds just sprinkle in some maquas so that you get nice contrast of some white and green color when the chocolate has set up the steps remains the same that is to fill in your molds using the prepared chocolate mixture spread it out evenly tap to remove the air bubbles my pasta excess if any and then allow it to set at room temperature once said just unmold and enjoy your pan masala chocolate melts many of you guys always ask me that depends your chocolate is out of the refrigerator it starts losing moisture and also starts melting so if you watch my other video on how to melt chocolate the right thing you will get this perfect answer for your question but in brief let me explain you that chocolates are not meant to be set in the fridge because of the temperature difference it starts melting so if you have ample time definitely allows the chocolates to set at room temperature itself that way it would last you for a really long time say around 1 to 2 months these flavored chocolates would stay good I hope you guys enjoyed this easy and

world because we did the live stream we have a wheel of regret and one of those things on the wheel of regret is a review and it landed on it when we spun the V will of regret please follow us on twitch twitch TV slash reckless eating hell yeah oh this item that we'll be reviewing for today please from FYE this is for ghostbusters now it says 3500 is is Ghostbusters 35 years old I have no I mean that sounds about right but I have no idea this is there ectoplasmic residue green white chocolate green slime slime filling so I have a prediction for this candy bar this is going to taste just like the Rugrats Reptar chocolate that we tried before on the channel and I'm glad that they're making another Ghostbusters film and I'm glad they're making it with at least the og cast that's still alive if you long you guys know I hated that last film with the women I'm not opposed to the fact that women were ghostbusters I think that's a fun idea I'm all for it but that movie [ __ ] sucked it was not a good film and this whole trend in Hollywood of if I don't like a film I'm sexist go [ __ ] yourself so let's try this out I'm this was four dollars I believe is it gonna be worth it or is it just gonna be the same exact product that Reptar was from the Rugrats let's find out that's not the Reptar bar for sure your tie hell is that flavor whoa no good they taste like if you want to make the most artificial fake thing of all time that's what this would be cool packaging a little bit lazy but cool at least the item inside isn't a generic item like I don't think I've ever had anything from the company of FYE that's usually in malls by the way how'd it taste like this but it's not very good it's not the worst thing I'm a tired planet but I would definitely give it a high one out of five which means it's a zombie apocalypse luxury item so like I would have to choose if I found this during a zombie apocalypse and I go into a MPM somehow I get it okay zombies are on my tail do I throw this at the zombies to slow them down or do I eat it I'm gonna eat it I'll probably eat it but not that great overall what are your thoughts on that last Ghostbusters film by the way were you

bar dark chocolate fans if you are feeling left out of the stuff chocolate game merges fixing that problem well it's not really dark chocolate it's not milk chocolate let's say a stronger chocolate it's still pretty sweet chocolate awesome Mars chocolate awesome Mars candy kind of like an insider mmm let's check it in and this is what the M&M dark sweet chocolate bar looks like if you can see the candy pieces inside the darker chocolate definitely not very dark it's probably around about 55 to 60% smells great and has a great look let's see those candy pieces and not much luck with that break but you can still kind of see them if you're in the textures these bars are great it's kind of like an inside-out M&M because you have the chocolate then you have the candy I'm all about dark chocolate and I'm all about textures and while like I said this is a real dark chocolate stronger chocolate and sweetness and candy it sounds pretty good let's try out the new Mars dark sweet chocolate bar let's do it I love that texture oh yeah that's I'm not 100% sure if it's just regular M&Ms inside the darker chocolate but it definitely packs a little bit of sweetness along with like a little stronger note it's not a strong dark chocolate so you know that it's not milk chocolate but like I said it's not what I calls dark chocolate but if you want a stronger chocolate with no bitter aftertaste good sweetness and a great texture this is it because those candy pieces on the inside really add to this and it is a cool experience much like to stop Reese's it's good stuff I like that it's a stronger bite as well texture heaven so what is Ron think of new M&Ms dark sweet chocolate bar guys I mean the textures and I'm into darker stronger chocolates I like this one and it actually kind of reminds me of like a crispy bunny we're getting around Easter bunnies are on my mind Ron's giving the new M&M dark sweet chocolate bar eight out of ten I like this one guys I like the added crunch I love the texture of the chocolate I love the sweetness it's sticking a lot of boxes for me I found this at Dominion so across Canada that's your Loblaws chain of stores then a quick look at the new M&Ms dark sweet chocolate bar it's been another quick round reviews in see you guys next time you", "iwa-9ZrseQM": "okay so this is the wonder bar by canna banana and it says on the back highest quality psilocybin chocolate bar on the market and eliminates the upset stomach feeling that users would get from digestion of the mushrooms the product has been known to significantly reduce anxiety stress depression increase focus and stimulate brain cell growth yes we like that and it says start slow and in a safe environment do not operate any motor vehicles while using this product please do not and this does have four grams per bar is what it supposedly says on the back um so it does come with 12 pieces so three pieces would equate to one gram that is what i started off with i would say that that's probably a little bit off because i have taken a gram of mushrooms before and yeah i would say it's probably a little bit off now definitely no upset stomach feeling whatsoever every time i have taken mushrooms i would have to purge after taking them which not nobody likes that um so that's a big benefit my stomach didn't hurt but it does make your stomach like a little bubbly and you have to go to the bathroom and a little gassy just so you know i'm gonna keep it real with you on that but other than that it was amazing um it does the three pieces in my opinion does give you like a nice therapeutic high like it says a really calming and high end of all of your senses feeling really good in general if you want to get into that creative flow state i ended up taking one more piece so a total of four pieces and for me that was perfect just to get into that little trippy zone and able to get into that deep flowing connection for meditation and journeying so i would recommend if you do want to trip hard at least start with six pieces if you are experienced with you know psychedelics or mushrooms in general um for me the four pieces was great i was chilling i felt such powerful healing and loving warm energy coming in and i actually did this on halloween so i had an incredible experience i really anchored in my timeline and i brought in a lot of healing onto the earth and onto all beings and i just felt so wrapped up in love and peace and harmony and so much balance coming in but um the fact that i did it on halloween and the veil is already so thin and plus we had that intense full blue moon i felt like the energies were just amplified so i really didn't need to take any more than that um and i think some people might generally think that taking this on halloween might be like oh you might have a bad trip or you know something like that or something weird might happen but i want to empower you right now to remember that you control your frequency and from each moment to each moment you dictate what frequency and timeline that you're residing in so that should just be an empowering message message to anyone who's listening to this and

peanut butter and then it's a different language somos chocolate peanut better which one do you want to try first come on Ellie why the peanut butter okay so like I said this is called parties I've never heard of this brand before it's made in Vancouver Canada it is 200 calories for the entire thing and Julia I have got it really I forgot you're ruining it Julia knows that I am a peanut butter fanatic there's gonna be no it's small and so Fortuner calories free being that small I would expect it to be really good she knows that I love peanut butter though so I'm sure this is gonna be good it's creamy on the inside I'm also got peanut butter pie that's exactly what it is that's delicious hey really good it's not super super strong but it's strong enough to really taste the peanut butter that's good the texture are on the outside you can tell how thick that chocolate is around the outside and then on the inside super soft it's very very very soft and I wanted to when I first saw it I thought that's gonna be like a milky way or I'm or three musketeers residue but it's really not it's softer than soft it's like the filling it's even soft it's like peanut butter path yeah yeah I mean it's like like um Kevin makes that chocolate peanut butter pie and he is all this filling that's what goes in the pop that's delicious and so if you like peanut butter that would be great and then this eat more a you know original dark toffee peanut to it is one bar it's 240 calories and we're cutting the end off because we're trying to I need to be able to take a picture I couldn't get good pictures before I started or I don't feel like I've got good pictures I took them but I don't know that that's alright so I told I said let's try to be careful and I'll try to get good pictures for you about if I doubt it's okay there are 240 calories in this whole bar but it feels big and it feels dense it's big too soon oh wow yeah wait till you get a load of this this is always the same as long as I'm trying to be careful yeah he's trying to be careful ultimately for you all so that you can get the information if you wanted I know a lot of you like to read the ingredients and now you got a lot of you there's some of you that don't want to know just the calories but you want to know them and the carbs and that's different it's good but it's different it's reminded me of something else and I don't know what I have no idea what that remind you it's good it's the chocolates got bitter a little bit of a bitter flavor tub peanuts are really good I like that it's not as chewy as caramel calculate would be but it's not it's reminded me of like I'm thinking up the texture it's like a brownie mix before like a thick brownie mix before you bake it in the oven when it's really thick and that's what that texture Ramones have that um I actually like that that's good I don't think everybody would like that because I think that texture would put some people off but I actually think that's really really good and I love the peanuts in it the toffee it's not what I expected that's that's really nice I've been a very impressed with everything that we've had from Canada and I wish that some of that would trickle right down this way so so these were really good I hope you enjoyed getting to see them which one did you like for that talk to people I know you can't really compare them yeah what's goodbye it's got too much a bitter flavor for me but you think so yeah see I didn't think it was bitter at all but that you know that wouldn't affect me like that so well they

jellybeans only I can't my freaky jolly that's a pain waterfall who wakes up and thinks of jellybeans I wake up and think oh I have table breath I should go brush my teeth not oh I should eat of the handful of jellybeans you I feel like sugar makes you happy and so when you're eating sugar constantly you're happy and I wouldn't be kids to think I was happy that's a little sad but this girl obviously has had some issues in the past I know this is a problem with people like if people are sad it tended to eat a lot food is come it's totally a normal thing a lot of people have that word you know if they're really sad to eat a lot and it makes them happy and I totally understand her like sweets are so good and they make you happy so it's true but you can't be eating sweets for every meal it's just not good for you it is really not diabetes man it is sad that this girl it has to eat sweets in order to feel happy like that should not be the case I live near the beach however I'm

good time with my friends you know go swimming like of a beach and just thinking have a great time I don't think I would go to the beach if I was afraid of water though that's basically what the beach is it's just water that's what it is I'm freaking thirsty guys I'm addicted to water just noticed I drink water every day I must be addicted I have put some sugar in me so that I could at least be energized because I just can't let people know that I have all this Wow see that was terrible guys if you're ever feeling sad about anything better find someone to talk to about it it's super good to talk to someone about it like get someone you trust get someone you love and just talk to them about how you're feeling if you keep all your emotions inside dude you're gonna go crazy it's not gonna be good and you're gonna eat a lot of brownies and stuff like that in forever dude seriously guys if you are like this girl and if you feel like candy and sweets just helps you there's a lot of other things besides sweets that will make you feel happy there is a lot in this world so she's gotta go out and try new things and don't be afraid to try new things guy you just got to be brave and do it guys you do not want to talk to me I need sugar without sugar oh my gosh without sugar oh my gosh so this girl needs sugar like if this girl does not have a chocolate bar within a one-hour span she's going crazy dude you don't want to talk to her hey Bethenny how's your day do not talk to me I have not had my Twix yet I'm just guessing that's how this girl's like I don't know maybe she's just

it's extremely tough for me to be it's not easy to put yourself out there that can be true for a lot of people honestly for me being more social want to know what helped you to not even kidding like back in high school I was kind of shy all my friends knew me I was like kind of like that shy person I wasn't crazy shy but yeah I was pretty shy and then I got into YouTube and now they don't think

freaking weird I can't imagine eating a chocolate bar every day of my frickin life every meal yeah guys make sure to drop a fat leg on the video if you did enjoy I will see you guys all in tomorrow's video make sure to check out the merch lighter [Music] [Music] you [Music]", "YlUKfxrk0AI": "[Music] good afternoon guys welcome back to my free baking and welcome back to visionary yes we are currently on week two of this four-week vegan experiment a few of you have left me comments with a little bit of concern but just to reassure you this is only for the month we are not becoming a vegan channel or I'm not becoming fully vegan it's just an experiment it will be over very soon I kind of can't wait I'm just kidding it definitely hasn't been that bad yet today we are reviewing two vegan chocolate bars now these are from a brands that I have never heard of until a lovely subscriber mentioned them in the comments or many months ago these two chocolate bars are from no mold as in normal missing out no more shaped chocolate no more milk in your chocolate sorry I picked these bars up in Holland and bought it which is kind of a health shop here in the UK I haven't seen them on many supermarket shelves or mainstream shops just yet so this is their milk chocolate and their dark chocolate today we are going to be tasting them reviewing them and see if they are worth your money whether you're vegan or not I think I'm going to start with their milk chocolate so they describe it as a deliciously creamy chocolate bar it is vegan and free from daily gluten egg and nuts now that's kind of strange because also chocolate just in its nature is always free from gluten egg and nuts and I don't think there would be many people who would actually add gluten or egg to a chocolate bar yes so that's a strange one the ingredients concern me so the main one being sugar is common for milk chocolate but usually a sign that the product isn't great the sugar is followed by a cocoa butter rice powder cocoa mass inulin Shea oil emulsifier sea salt and flavorings now here are my problems rice powder what is rice powder as why is in my chocolate I understand is probably to make the bar stable in different temperatures so that it doesn't mount or it doesn't go a kind of weird texture but that immediately means that this chocolate is very unlikely to be smooth also divided in Ulan which you'll also see on packets as chicory root fiber this is an insoluble fiber that they usually add to make things healthier it's the fiber in those fiber one bars that are awful and should be avoided at all costs anyway I'm gonna stop ripping apart before I've even opened it let's taste it okay it smells like generic milk chocolate obviously this doesn't contain any real milk but they also haven't added any kind of non daily milk let's break off a strip decent snap and we will see how this tastes it kind of looks like a genetic milk chocolate it doesn't look like it's going to be too powdery like that rice powder suggests and it's got a nice kind of pattern on the front there as well and just to make it kind of interesting to look at let's give the normal milk chocolate a taste I'll be honest it's better than I expected but it's still not great it tastes like advent calendar chocolate I taste very cheap very generic the texture is as expected it doesn't melt well it isn't smooth it has a little bit of chalkiness in the same way that I kind of a cheap white chocolate or even some kind of cheaper Cadbury products have because they have that kind of milk powder and other kind of fill and ingredients added it doesn't just kind of melt into your mouth into this lovely luxurious expedience you have to really chew this chocolate the flavor isn't bad I would attribute that to quite a lot of sugar though it isn't the sweetest not chocolate I've ever had but it's certainly sugary and it doesn't leave a kind of consistent cocoa flavor in your mouth once you're finished it it just tastes like sweetness I definitely wouldn't turn this down you know if someone bought me a bar I was quite happily eat it it's definitely not the worst I've ever had it's definitely not anywhere near the best I've ever had considering there is no milk in there the milk chocolate flavor is decent but I probably wouldn't be recommending this to many people so for delivering what it says it's gonna be to an extent and for not being a total ripoff cashwise and for being fairly inclusive to a lot of diets I'm going to be generous and give this a 3 out of 5 if this was a regular milk chocolate bar it would be a 2 out of 5 if that makes sense let's move on to their dark chocolate now this really has no reason to be bad dark chocolate that's anything above 60% is usually vegan by nature and it's usually fantastic rich wonderful I love dark chocolate and not enough people appreciate it for what is but that's a story for another time the ingredients in this deliciously dark chocolate bar from normal are cuckoo mas sugar cocoa butter an emulsifier and vanilla flavoring now that is a much much better list of ingredients than a milk chocolate bar it is only 55 percent cocoa solids so this will be nothing too dark if you do find dark chocolate too rich or too strong so let's get this one open on a tray it does smell rich though you can't exactly pinpoint whether it's going to be you know a fruity or a nutty dark chocolate it's not a kind of tasting experience bar I'll give you a close-up of it just like the last one it has a kind of nice pattern on the front has a decent kind of shine to it which shows they've put some effort in and a very good snap which we like to see and hear some let's taste the normal dark chocolate better than the milk chocolate I'll give them that I'll be honest that isn't too bad now as I said it's only 55% and they have also added a fair bit of sugar in there not as much as the milk chocolate was still a fait amount for dark chocolate which means that even though there is kind of a touch of that bittersweet cocoa flavor it isn't too rich or too strong by any means you would be able to easily smash at least half a bar of this no problem in relative terms it's better both in taste and in quality than a Cadbury's Bournville for example on a fairly kind of cheap supermarket dark chocolate but not by a whole lot so essentially if you like Bournville or you did before you went vegan or daily free you might be quite keen to try this other than that if you are a dark chocolate lover or if you are again or you just want to avoid Danny I can promise you there are many many better dark-chocolate options out there just take a little browse at the kind of range of dark chocolate you can get in supermarkets and chocolate shops even online you will definitely be able to find things of a similar price that are much better in taste and in quality but that being said it's definitely not bad and as I said with the milk chocolate if someone gifted me this I would be quite happy to eat it I think it would be decent to beat with so much like the milk chocolate one this isn't Wow but it's also not meth so I'm gonna give this a kind of middle-ground 3 out of 5 overall honestly this could have been much worse they're both kind of middle-of-the-road so they may not be worth a bind equally you don't have to Snug them either if you guys have tasted either of these bars or you have any vegan chocolate review requests or recommendations let me know in the comments below if you guys enjoyed

"gxWK9d6VEIE": "hi everyone here's another cute Christmas crafts idea these are chocolate bars um I've wrapped up a 2-pack of lint chocolate they were the small version of the full-size Lindt chocolate I actually thought I was buying the full size when I bought the case but once I opened them I found out they're the small ones so I doubled them up and I've done a couple different styles here we have Rudolph we have Santa suit a Christmas snow penguin and your snowman the Snowman is a printable template that you can get offline I'll try to provide the website where got that there's two different sizes that you can download mine being an odd size I had to modify it in Photoshop to make it fit my size chocolate bar so you may have to modify depending on what you're wrapping up you wrap up Smarties you can wrap up full-sized chocolate bars whatever you like if your scrapbooker this would be a very fast and quick project if you're not it will take a long time to do I had I don't have any of the tools except for I had a punch for Rudolph's nose and eyes and a punch for the little buttons for the Santa suit otherwise everything else I hand-cut which was quite time-consuming I made a template for each item in each piece on the individual characters and then I trace them all out and hand cut them so if you're planning about doing that make sure you have a lot of patience and a lot of time to spare otherwise um yeah if you have the tools not a problem and the different characters um you know I just google searched ideas I actually ran out of paper so I just use some of the that I have left over to finish off the last couple I had so I did a couple Christmas presents use some piping and a bow which I used for the sleighs the chocolate sleighs I did which would be in

This is Heather from HeathyVeganRecipes.net. So I\u2019m really excited to share today\u2019s\nrecipe with you, I\u2019ve been working on it for quite a few months now and Phil has had\nthe hard job of testing it for me. His even tried of making it a few times and\nso that he can definitely verified that it\u2019s an easy recipe and he eats an often lot of\nit so I think it\u2019s pretty good and what it is, is some homemade chocolate. I often make it with carob powder instead\nof cocoa powder so I sometimes call it caroblate but however you do it, it\u2019s delicious, it\u2019s\neasy and its really nice to have a treat that you can make for yourself so you don\u2019t have\nto go out and buy a chocolate bar if your concerned about the chemicals, preservatives,\nwhatever else they might put in there. This is totally natural, there are only three\ningredients and if you want the details on the amounts you can head over to HealthyVeganRecipes.net,\nI\u2019ll post it all for you there but let\u2019s get started making this. So, as a base I\u2019m gonna use coconut oil\nwhich is a great fat to use especially for chocolate because it\u2019s going to solidify. So right now you can see it\u2019s a solid and\nwhat your gonna do is start by taking some of it, putting it in a pot on low heat and\nmelting it down to a liquid. This is not by the way a low fat treat or\neven a low sugar treat really. You can find lots of recipes on my site for\nlow fat cookies, low sugar cookies but this one sometimes you just need something that\u2019s\na little more fun right? And it\u2019s really impressive for people when\nyou want to show them that yeah you eat healthy but you eat some really delicious stuff too\nso sometimes you just gotta go for it. So while that coconut oil is melting, you\ncan get your pan ready and I use a loaf pan just like a regular bread loaf pan and lined\nit with parchment paper. This way when you get the chocolate set, you\ncan lift it out really easily and then break it and it will be a nice bar. So I find this size is good for the amounts\nthat I have in the recipe. I like to leave some extra room with the paper\nso that when it\u2019s done I can wrap the chocolate up, put it in a bag and keep it. But you can do this with a muffin tin if you\nwant, little individual chocolates or any other type of container will work. This is just the one that I have, a mould\nwill really be cool if you have like a shape mould but lining it is important because again\nyou can lift it out really easily otherwise I guess you can put some coconut oil on there\nas well. So leave the coconut oil on just a low heat\nuntil it\u2019s fully melted and clear. What this does is it helps the other ingredients\nmix in better so you don\u2019t need to use as much oil. If you use it as a solid you need a ton more\nin order to mix this stuff in. Alright! So other ingredients we\u2019ve got cocoa or\ncarob powder. Just dump that right on in and some sugar,\nnow I\u2019m using some unrefined cane sugar that I\u2019ve ground up so that it\u2019s lot more\nfine and powdery than when it comes to me. I kind of like it actually a little bit chunky\nbut if you\u2019re using cocoa powder, cocoa does not have any natural sugar on it where\ncarob does so when I use carob I can leave the sugar a bit chunkier and use less of it\nbut if I\u2019m using cocoa powder you really want the sugar to be finely ground and using\nthe unrefined sugar so much better than white sugar. Less effect on your blood sugar swings. Not to mention that there are some nutrients\nin the unrefined sugar, not ton but some and definitely more than in white sugar. So get that stirred so that it\u2019s fully blended\nand then you just gonna pour right into whatever pan or mould you are using. Alright! There\u2019s my beautiful little pond of chocolate\nso perfect you can see the reflection. So you just put this in the fridge and it\nwill set. You can put it in as a plain or what I really\nlove to do is put things in my chocolate so it\u2019s like a kind of bark. So right here I got some brazil nuts that\nI chopped up and if you sprinkle them on top so pretty and so delicious. So get those sprinkled in there, another one\nI love is dried cranberries with chopped almonds. Yum! Phil actually he was growing hot peppers in\nhis garden this year so he did a bunch of chocolates with hot peppers and he wanted\nme to tell you all that everyone in the house loved it except for me. I\u2019m not just a hot pepper person. Alright! What I\u2019m gonna throw in here as well are\nsome toasted coconuts, just coz you know we need a little bit of fat with our fat right. Now, you know something I loved about this\nchocolate is that even though there is sugar and fat in here, you know exactly what you\nare eating so you tend not to over indulge, at least not all of the time. So that\u2019s all there is to it. Now all you have to do is play the waiting\ngame, put that chocolate into the fridge and you gotta wait till its set and depending\non how cold you fridge is that can take anywhere from twenty minutes to half an hour, somewhere\nin that range and then you get to enjoy it. And I have a bunch that I made earlier that\nI can show you and so like I said I like the parchment paper to wrap it in and then this\none is with almonds and cranberries so you keep this on a fridge if it\u2019s warm out. In the winter you don\u2019t need to but coconut\noil melting point is 24 degrees Celsius so if it\u2019s warm out it will melt. Just a warning! Really impressive thing to do with this is\nto break off a piece and put it into a little bowl of banana ice cream, mango ice cream\nmaybe, very impressive. So there you go, for those of you who really\njust needs a chocolate fix this is sometimes the only way to cure it. So I\u2019m always looking for other things to\nput in my chocolate that looks pretty and taste good so I love to know what kinds of\nthings you like, what\u2019s your favourite toppings are? Let me know by leaving a comment and you can\nget the recipe again over at HealthyVeganRecipes.net and I will see you guys next time.", "Jl0IDXkYKbk": "[Music] we can smell all the aroma come out when you crush them which is really nice all those beautiful chocolate flavors chocolate is is happiness it's something that can you know really suit your mind and soothe your soul I think for a long time we've grown up with this idea that chocolate is either dark or sweet and that's it chocolate can be a lot more just like wine just like fruits so this is basically how we receive the cacao the beans themselves are already fermented and dried and we bring from different farms throughout Latin America and the Caribbean and we keep them all single origin so chocolate is a fruit it grows on trees it comes from the cacao pod inside you'll find a pulpy fruit that is called Bala it has the consistency of soursop and then the flavor of a lychee in our case what we're looking for is the actual seed part and that's the cocoa bean what ultimately will be transformed into chocolate this variety that we have from Peru is from mara\u00f1on it's considered to be one of the rarest cacao in the world it was thought extinct for about a hundred years and it grew wild in that time it actually looks like milk chocolate because about 40 percent of the beans themselves are considered white beans or kind of caramel colored and then over in Guatemala we also receive this variety which tastes a lot like oranges do they grow a lot of oranges on that particular farm so each farm and each country and even specific regions have different flavors we have chocolates that can be nutty earthy fruity and that's all coming from the soil where it's grown but also the bacteria that plays a role in its fermentation we will hand select all the best cocoa beans for us to use we're really looking to take out anything that's not a cacao sometimes you've got twin beans like these what will happen is they won't roast evenly at the end of the day we're trying to make a better product and what's been commercially available so Trust is is very important you'll notice all these fissures inside the beam and then that means that when the bacteria came in during the fermentation it really broke down the cell walls and it let all those flavors mix in so that's what we're really looking for is color flavor and fissures in terms of quality of cacao so we fought it down just to make sure it's even because we want an even roasting what happens in roasting is something called a mailer reaction the amino acids and the sugars start to interact with the heat and it starts to develop the flavors and also the aroma that comes from the cacao so similar to sort of searing a piece of steak the same is happening with our cacao in that process we let it cool down usually for a few hours you have the shell which is called a husk and the nib is ultimately what becomes chocolate so a lot of people think that dark chocolate is bitter and the reality is when it's bitter it's typically over roasted which means that it's burned that's why we medium roast it's lighter its fruity you can taste all these different things and when we do chocolate tastings people can really appreciate that we have an Ecuadorian that tastes like raisins we have a Guatemalan that tastes like oranges and then we have our Haitian that tastes super earthy so then we let the cacao arrest from roasting and then we'll want a winnow and that process is simply cracking the bean and removing the shell you'll notice as most of the shell goes out towards the outside and then the nib stays in place sort of how heavy it is so this is the machine that we use now how could sort of been monopolized for so many decades so there's not really equipment that we can use a small craft producers we have a champion juicer from Amazon and then we have a shot sack from Home Depot and the way it works is just like I was crushing it with a hammer the Champion Juicer will crush all the beans and instead of blowing air into it we have a vacuum which has that same method as the beans drop down they're crushed as air sucks in it'll take that lighter shell or husk up into here and then that heavier nib will fall down because it avoids the air that's blowing in there fifteen to twenty percent of the bean itself is hot which in most places becomes trash but we actually don't throw out a single piece of husk for one of the big ways that we found a home for them has been in beers it produces a different layer of flavor when they ferment the beer with it you can actually brew tea with it and it tastes almost like this earthy hot chocolate so we're gonna pre mill it in order to make it a little bit smoother on our conjuring machines the friction is creating heat and the heat is activating the cocoa butter that's present in the bean and that's what will cause it to liquify starts to resemble when you start making brownie batter so now that same cacao know suddenly is liquid this is what we would call a chocolate liqueur it's just the nib broken down so it's almost like a very chunky peanut butter very very astringent you sort of feel here the texture is quite gritty so we would need to smooth it out add sugar if we're gonna make milk chocolate add milk in order to transform it into the chocolate we're used to I spent part of my childhood in Barranquilla and Colombia chocolate for Colombians is simply made it's just very very good dark chocolate and that was something very satisfying and something that I really enjoyed and stuck with me for many years and then from there it will go into our refiners so originally these machines are actually nut grinders so they're used primarily in India to make nut butters sometimes with peanuts in this machine you find two giant stone rollers and a granite slab and what they do is two things one refine down so it's smooth it's velvety like we're used to with chocolate the other thing that's doing is a process called contouring and what it does is air is continuously moving in and out of the mixture and aerating it so very similar to when you open up a bottle of red wine and you let it breathe we're doing the same thing with the cacao all of those tannins those volatiles are evaporating as air comes in and it makes the chocolate milder as the process runs and we'll let these run for about four days straight and it'll refine everything down the sugar we'd use it's unrefined has more of a molasses taste to it sweetens the chocolate but doesn't overpower it in this middle machine we're making milk chocolates we added also cane sugar a little bit of cocoa butter for texture and then we added milk powder because we can't add any sort of liquids or anything that's water-based into our mixture otherwise it's sort of like when you add water to flour it will really not work well with the molecules in the cacao and then in here we're making white chocolate the one thing we don't have is any cacao nib so this is primarily based cocoa butter unrefined cane sugar and milk powder so typically when you have milk powder it's this color I'm not a huge fan of that type of white chocolate so we like to do something near carom eyes we actually take this milk and we slowly roast it in the oven it has a nice toasty note to it which is really delicious when we take the chocolate out of the machine at that point in this covert war that's when most places would buy that finished product in order to make their items we use a filter which is actually meant for like honey and it's catching any nibs that we didn't refine and that way we have a final smooth product when you're producing tons and tons of traffic each year you have to buy from a bunch of different places and blend it together in order to sell quantity those companies want the chocolate to always taste consistently the same so when you over roast you can maintain a consistency and then you can mask it with things like vanilla so that that's always what consumers taste in big manufacturing they're typically connected via tubes and chocolate has to travel from one side of the factory to the other so they'll use a lot of times lecithin to help it run smoother from one side to the next so it's really an aid in production we don't use any of those things because you're tasting exactly what they're producing on that farm from the soil from the environment versus just eating something that's blended together that has no different notes or flavor profiles from it that chocolate will solidify and will turn from this into this over the course of a day the cocoa butter that's present in all chocolates we eat is a six phase polymorphic crystal which means at any point it can be in six different types of stages at this stage it's not in its ideal form so that's why it creates these weird color patterns if you were to bite into it it would be sandy because of that textural change it'll alter the way you experience the chocolate it won't be as pleasant but if we're going to make any sort of bars or bonbons we'll have to temper it [Music] we've melted down the chocolate to about 40 42 degrees Celsius to take out all those crystals that we don't want we're going to slowly cool down the chocolate so we're using temperature and movement to form a crystal formation that will create a chocolate that is silky to your palate this is extremely important you can make the best tasting chocolate in the world but based on that texture will not be as good as when you have a good temper so the mixing is just adding the good crystals that we just formed in that batch into the rest of the chocolate that is untempered all the molecules get into formation for my little conga line and in doing so all of the chocolate molecules are in order and look nice [Music] one of the things that's very important is how we source most farm holders live under a dollar a day it's a very difficult industry for us it's really important to support these producers who are investing time money to produce something better they should be compensated for what they're doing we're not talking about fair trade we're going above that which is direct trade and being able to pay them more than that basic commodity price so we're gonna start the process of making bonbons so this color is made out of cocoa butter which comes from the cacao bean and has a little bit of coloring in it and what we've done prior to this is tempered it in order for it to be shiny and glossy just like our chocolate has to go through that process so one of the things that makes us unique is that we're being to bond and that means that we produce all the chocolate that goes into our bonbons [Music] I actually am an organizational psychologist by training I worked as a management consultant I was in Europe in Paris and I had this amazing hot chocolate and it just seems so simple yet well made I just couldn't stop thinking about what a great thing it was and how I wanted to bring to the u.s. something similar to what I had tasted overseas so this ganache is made out of dark chocolate and then some rum and when it crystallizes we're able to do the final layer of chocolate which is the foot of the bonbon I would use a covert or to play around and see how it worked I realized it was either too sweet it just didn't focus on the cacao it was blended it was a lot of the things that just didn't seem to highlight and recreate that experience that I had had with that hot chocolate I knew I wanted to take it all the way back to the bean making a product like this that's so labor-intensive by hands it helps us control the process more from start to finish when we roast and we analyze we have more of a care up to what we're doing as opposed to just everything being fed through a machine and it takes us about a week but it takes the farmers 2 to 3 years to grow the plants six months from the time the flower comes out so the pot is ready and then from when the pod gets cut another two weeks so it's a very long process behind each bar there's a farmer and a story behind all that and we really want to make sure that we honor that we're talking years in the making to consume that final piece of chocolate that you buy and consume", "lz9YVPRglVg": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]", "AoUN2vq__W4": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] avocados inherently creamy right so why wouldn't you add it to white chocolate it kind of makes sense and you think about it most people have never eaten an avocado chocolate bar before but I dare you to try it because you will be amazed last year we made 5,000 avocados chocolate bars with California avocado and they all sold out I hate you this is so good [Music] we had to pair with white chocolate because avocado really doesn't have a super strong flavor it's got that creaminess amazing avocado flavor but if you put it with milk or dark it would almost get Lux so blinding of white chocolate allow us to really create an amazing flavor you can taste the avocado you could see the green coming through in the chocolate bar and then you get that crunchy bit of toast that hitted sea salt and again it's breakfast lunch and dinner you know we've got you covered [Music] I mean I've been watching this we made I have yet to try it so I'm really excited to be a little spoon Civic feel like is dispenser family so this is about piccata toast batter oh my god Cheers [Music] it's a little crunchy they are very much like a crunch bar very reminiscent of like childhood capacity so that's the thing that we always try to do it in partes is sort of gourmet

all welcome back to my youtube channel today I am gonna be trying these new mmm chocolate bars it's been long overdue I've actually had these in the cupboard a week and I haven't opened them yet because I'm scared once I open them they're just gonna go so quickly so I'm vlogging this ah I'm gonna have to get my housemate involve this so I don't eat them all but we have got crispy peanuts regular chocolate and then hazelnut now at first glance I think it's even gonna be crispy or hazelnut but we're gonna give it a go so first of all they're not the easiest to get into trauma bins so idiotic about this let's open one up first all I do - Mel Grover I let's not look at the calories in them 558 calories per hundred gram and is 165 so at five five eight oh god that's a lot five five eight times one point six five nine hundred and twenty calories in a bar and I've got four of them I'm gonna do how are we gonna do this I feel like I so look going first ah okay that's cute right what we're gonna do is break the top it off so we've got four squares and then I'm gonna try bit of each of them and then we're going to rank them in order let's just snap the top it off perfect absolutely perfect still quite a lot of chocolate fat be right back let's get a scale let's see how much we ensure we don't need to remember what the flavors are crispy up top peanut chocolate hazelnut 80 grams the reason I do that is but the reason I did that look because I'm boring but people think that you can't eat chocolate and stick to a diet but you actually can you can work small trees into your day every single day you just need to count your calories so as an example what was that 5:5 a he's a hundred grams if your time's up by naught point two that is only 110 calories so if you just got a bit of a sweet tooth and you want to try something every day we'll have a bit of chocolate every day you definitely can work it in that 111 calories the whole bar 920 so honestly don't open it and smash the whole bar but if you're a chocolate fan you definitely can't eat it every day right so what we're going to go for first I reckon just go for the plain chocolate one first never actually add in chopped it before I don't know who it's made by so this might be very stupid but it tastes like Mars that is very good chocolate I like that YUM what else can you say about it tastes like Mars chocolate it's got M&Ms inside it it's two thumbs up for me right Oh next let's go peanut mmm that's delicious I'm an absolutely huge fan of peanut M&Ms anyway the chocolates actually well nice well done well I guess it is the same chopper that you get inside M&Ms but you don't really get a lot of chocolate do you just taste the crispy stuff on the outside so you never any type that chocolate well nice Oh Hays not a crispy let's go Chris because it'll bit of a nut that's actually the worst one surviving everyone's been guessing me up about this one that's bit you can see the Christian about moaning I'm a bit of crispy bits in it oh can you see that there's more crispy bits in that bit let's go for this bit don't get me wrong the choppers unbelievable but the Chris penis gives you less chocolate it's got air inside it so I reckon so far peanut chocolate crispy on to the last one it could bit hazelnut winner ladies and gentlemen we have a winner oh I love Hazen anyways Nutella unbelievable yeah that is a bit of me that one absolutely delicious and this is surprisingly right because I would have gone I would have thought I'd have gone Krispy hazelnut peanut chocolate B in fact it is hazelnut peanut chocolate krispies so there you go that is the final verdict of them animatronic bars from myself David Templar the temptation let me know what your favorites are in the comments below if you've eaten them if not if you could only buy one chocolate bar I'd say go and get having that one unless you've got a nut allergy then obviously don't get that one but yeah chocolate is also very good so there you go there is your temper tips my review of M&M chocolate bars see you next time for another product review until then goodbye", "VJ27FlXZMmQ": "I love the chocolate bars why they're super high-quality ingredients yes cacao WA and they have CBD in it so remember that these are not for you to consume all by yourself all at one time just because they're

before it's very relaxing", "Y61hnkQoC9I": "hey guys welcome to Rosie's desert spot in this episode I'll be teaching you how to make this chocolate bar and how to cover in a professional way we'll start by making our filling so I've got some Dutch chocolate buttons here and they're compound chocolate adding in some heavy cream in making sure they're all completely coated I'm going to pop those into a microwave for 30 seconds give it a bit of a stir and making sure that it's all submerged underneath our heavy cream and then pop it in the microwave again for another 20 seconds stir until it's nice and combined and melted and once it looks something like that you can add in your desiccated coconut and I have the recipe for this in the description box below stir to combine that completely and then we'll set that aside as we work on our white chocolate some adding little bit of cava or a reconstituted coconut oil into my um white chocolate that's going to help it not to see is when I add in my gel food colors in Fouzia and electric green and the adding about a drop each and if it's a sea is just add a couple more drops of that co farm then combine all that color in then to decorate our chocolate mold I'm adding a little bit of edible gold dust and then using a blush brush I'm just going to dab it in random areas this really adds a nice touch to your chocolate bar alternatively you could always just add in gold leaf as well I'm going to start it's been spinning my white chocolate into the different areas and I'm making sure to aim for the gold dust areas because it all contrasts a lot nicer against the white then fill in with the other colors making sure to make the colors all dispersed and so there's not too much green in one section etc I'm not too don't those colors add in the rest of your white just to cover up spaces and it might not look like there's enough but once you tap it on your counter that all combines and you'll finally actually have a fair bit of chocolate in there moving it to the sides and above the sides it's really important that it okay covers a hole of the mold and then we'll clean up the sides later anyway so you'll have a nice full neat mould then tip upside down tap it up on the top side to remove all the excess chocolate tap it again to flatten it out and also to remove any air bubbles and then run over with your bench scraper for that excess chocolate I'm going to print your bowl and set aside for later then once that's nice and hard coming out of the fridge you can pop in your filling I added about three tablespoons of it's going into this bar and using your spoon just sort of a push to push it around and tap it to make sure it's nice and even now down your chocolate and once that's nice and solid in the fridge and you can add on your extra chocolate just to cover up at the top and close your bar completely again I'm making sure to spread it up and above the sides and make sure there's no air pockets or empty spaces sort of left open using a bench scraper scrape off all the excess again and return that into the fridge and that'll set for another ten minutes just like so then once that's nice and hard turn it upside down give it a bit of a tap and there should come out really easily if it's ready if it doesn't come out it means needs a bit more time resting in the fridge using my little spatula here just to clean up besides I'm running it once or twice along the sides there and I'll take take away and you flick you sort of excess chocolate on the sides that way it's nice and neat and the last step is to cover our chocolate so I've got some regular living in foil and I'm creasing it over the sides and scoring it down so it's nice and sharp and then take the edges and bring it in towards the middle of your chocolate bar score the sides or crease them as well that way it's nice and easy to lift and folder the chocolate button I'm doing it from the edges and pulling it up against the sides of the bar this makes for a much neater sort of am kind of wrapping you get a lot less creases this way square the top and pull it up against the bar and increase at the corners and at the edges as well you can see here when I turn it over it's nice and neat and then attach your logo so sort of am Center on there fold it over one side and flip it over then add some non-toxic double-sided adhesive and just seal it with the other side and you'll sleep and that's who make personalized chocolate bars these go well as party favors at the end of the party to sort of put into Songz goodie bag or probably just as is because it's a pretty big block and the best thing about chocolate bars is that you can fill them with whatever you like I mean chocolate ganash and salted caramel go really well as well be inventive maybe throw in some chili or something will look really well but tastes really nice too and that's Tuesday's tutorial thanks guys for tuning in I

by Nestle and the crackle is made by Hershey's the crunch bar is 220 calories for the whole bar and crackle is 210 per bar these were both bought at just our local grocery store and they were around $1 apiece so I'm gonna open them up and show them to you and just kind of compare how they look so this is what they look like these bars are both milk chocolate with crisp rice so you can see on the bottom there and this one is like that so I'm gonna give them this one first the traditional that one right there am okay here's the deal I don't know how to touch this I just want you playing emails over powering mint-chocolate it's good it's a good candy bar I can probably guess which one it is it's so super sweet yeah alright so now I'm gonna get the other one this is more difficult than I imagined okay hands I'm gonna give you like two separate pieces but it's the same thing that has almost no flavor at all mmm it has up almost like a cinnamon flavor job it does and I get back I've got a gas definitely I think I know which one Yeah right take off your masks I actually liked the the first one had like a little bit of an aftertaste to it the second one had an odd like season like a spice in there I show you which one did you like better I like the first one which one do you offering the first one I think person was the Nestle a crutch I think it was a car I don't I think it was brunch I think the first one was the Hershey's crackle just like the little miniatures I said traditionally I said I was gonna say it's in the traditional Hershey bar block shape but I couldn't say that sounds like it's the traditional which ones you like the most that was almost no it's funny we both thought if I were to yeah it was weird if I didn't have something in it at all but that's what we taste it yeah but yeah I said you like to drive all the best - mm-hmm although I didn't have a little bit of a base but it was it was good it was bad I probably wouldn't buy you one of them because there's so many other panting roars - chin there's not enough there but given the choice if those were the only two choices and I was gonna pick one definitely the crackle is kinda like Andy when it comes to candy bars I like the more stuff in it the better Rocket Snickers or mr. no mr. good mr.

sold with about a third of the sugar taken out and they insist they haven't replaced it with artificial sweeteners the food scientists based here at Bournville in Birmingham have been working on it for two years chocolate is just three ingredients it's cocoa sugar and milk so when you take something out to keep the same structure and test the texture and taste you've got to put something in it we've been managed to replace the texture and structure with a fiber replacing some of the sugar but retained most of the taste it is slightly different but it still retains the great taste of Cadbury Dairy Milk with a little bit less sweetness the government has ordered sweet manufacturers to cut 20% of sugar out of their recipes by 2020 to address concerns over obesity the makers of Cadbury say they started this five years ago and have removed 24 billion calories from their sweets well obesity is a challenge for us as a society there's no doubt about that and it's a really complex one you know and it's all about calories in and calories out its most basic so it's about diet and exercise and health we believe treats is eaten as part of a healthy and overall lifestyle should be enjoyed and chocolate is a treat and there's nothing hidden about the nature of it it's cocoa milk and sugar and over the last five years chocolate consumption the UK's actually declined per person as populations increased so people per person on average are eating less chocolate today than they have been for last few years and it really amounts to about two heroes to little heroes a day is the average amount of chocolate but we do have a responsibility we tasted a junk of one of the two bars available in the UK to test it did taste the same just slightly less sweet will customers go for the reduced sugar option yes I'll try it yeah definitely try it but I think it's a very very good thing because there's that many people now we diabeetus and one of you and they were watching everything they eat so I would think that that is a good thing why not if it doesn't go to taste maybe if it stays the same the regular Dairy Milk will still be made the reduced sugar version is the company says

lab to your game now if you're thinking I want to know how to be a part of the beta that is something I'm not gonna tell you in this video because it was a huge pain in the butt for me to actually get into the beta and to get it working and it's not the sort of thing I can make a tutorial on but you can go look up other guides and if you run into problems you will know the headache that I went through to get this to work but anyway let's go and jump back into our world so we shall start by checking out two of these blocks the first one is the element constructor and look at these textures man I love that it's got a unique texture on each side these blocks are extremely cool we have the material reducer as well we're gonna check that one out second so let's go and open up the element constructor this is gonna require no power no items being put into it it's basically going to give you stuff for free what you have to do is configure the elements and you do that by telling it the amount of protons electrons and neutrons that are going to go into this so let's start by adding a proton and an electron and we've created the very first element which is hydrogen and I can simply just you know drag that over and over again probably can shift drag it for a stack no you can just take one at a time but that's all you have to do it's pretty cool stuff now let's go ahead and make the second one which is helium so if I go and add one extra proton one extra electron and a nutrient we get helium like that it's pretty cool right the third one is lithium which is free of each and there you go we are making the elements now you'll notice the electrons have these rings around outside are going to guess this is all scientifically correct it would make sense that it is because education edition I don't think they're going to half-ass anything here that is extremely peculiar and interesting to me and so is all of this but as we as we drag them around randomly you see it's kind of tricky to land on the correct one so let's go and do one with a different amount you can also click up here for example if I set this to 42 this one here to 42 as well and then that one to 50 we should create moly bdellium oh yeah these these things start to have a crazy names let's go make Ron diem if we put this up to five on each and then it's 58 I believe 58 of those makes Ron diem I'm in and you can make all of the different elements of the periodic table over there using this thing pretty fascinating right now there is another way to obtain these items as well if I just go in here and grab a couple of random items let's grab some sand from down here as well and we go over to this block which is the material reducer we will be able to reduce materials to there the elements so this could be like entirely accurate certain amounts of oxygen and silicon makes sand I know this silicon in sound that sounds like a legit thing okay so brick blocks no stone bricks no I'm guessing that one no as well so maybe we need things that are a little bit more natural for example dirts perhaps grass would make sense as well my friends I have discovered the errors of my ways I have been putting in stacks instead of single blocks if we look at what makes up this carbon oxygen nitrogen not even going to try to say that one right there we can see what makes up dirt block as well but not a lot of blocks actually go into here for example if I try orange stain glass not having much luck maybe regular glass would have been a better try so let's go down here and slap one of those in no doesn't accept it anyway that is the other way that you can get yourself some of these elements let's now check out the next block right here this is the compound create a man that texture is so cool allow this over so much we can use this to take some of those elements and combine them to create other things like Minecraft items like charcoal ink and sugar can all be made in this and then a whole bunch of other crazy items as well which we can use to craft some of the cool stuff I'm going to be showing you at the end of this video so we're gonna start off by do is chucking in one sodium and one chlorine and this is going to create salt as you can see NAC oh it shows you it right there we just we just made some salt I've got no idea if there's any uses for this and apparently I can take as much as I want and then put those back that's very cool now sometimes you're going to need more than just once if I to put in one carbon and one hydrogen we don't get anything but if I put in nine carbon and 20 hydrogen we get ourselves some crude oil and notice again it's the C and the H and then the amounts that we have and I could take as much crude oil as I want ah this is this is insane right here so then we've got some iron and some sulfur to make some iron sulphide ah crazy look at these little items right here they look very interesting and then we've got six carbon and six hydrogen to make benzene I think that's how you say that one now not all of them require just two things and you can sort of put them in I believe anywhere as long as they're in there together right so order and stuff is not too much of a problem I got one down the bottom here that requires four we've got carbon we've got hydrogen nitrogen and oxygen or with different amounts and you can put it together to make luminol don't even know what this stuff is but it but I'm excited by it and now we have the lab table time for some mandatory inspection of all sides of the block well not the bottom side but just like those textures leave me alone in here you can put together some of the things you saw us craft in just a moment ago and and combine those things to make other items of which free of these I think are actually really useful in survival well at least they have a use if we go into here though and just quickly create some a manoa hopefully I'm saying that correctly I'm sorry if I'm not and we mix these two things together we should be able to combine that into something now that just started to animate after I put in that other item right so perhaps that's showing you when you're doing st. corrects and maybe each of these different types animate depending on what type of thing you're creating but if I combine wow I was not expecting that we've got ourselves some super fertilizer now here's what we're gonna do we're gonna put that over to one side in a chest and we'll be checking it out at the end of this video there is more to be made though first of all we've got to make water and this one's a classic h2o and there it is so we've got some water and these things together should make us a heat block of all things so let's just chuck them in there and then see what it says aha look this one on this side now animates oh that is so very cool by the way there are only four things you can make in here as well so hopefully we will see that middle one get animated as well and different particle effects this time that was fantastic and we now have the heat lock we're gonna put it in here for later peeps we're making some more stuff it's sodium Act eight this time and we need four of it to go into here to make an ice bomb of all things there's the animation let's click combined and particle effects now it's time for a little bit of water and the old sodium hypochlorite let's just go tuck that in there and we've got this animation over here so there are four different things you can make and we haven't seen the middle one animates but anyway particle effects time that was really cool and we've made ourselves some bleach so for the next set of items we have to do a whole bunch of crafting so let's start off with some of the easiest stuff first of all TNT mixed with sodium makes underwater TNT and then magnesium and torches makes underwater torches again we're gonna check these out later on so using the compound creator I've made a bunch of different types of chlorides and now what we can do is combine those chlorides with other items first of all torches to make color torches so that gives us a blue torch we can get a red torch a purple torch and last of all a green torch awesome and then the other thing we can do is put sticks magnesium and then each of these chlorides on top of it to create sparklers are different colors so we've got orange and then these are just like the other ones this one's gonna be red isn't it yes so they kind of match purple and last of all it will be green yes awesome okay so we made some sparklers and torches and and you know we're gonna we're gonna check it out later on and now for the last of our crafting we can make hardened glass which simply takes longer to break that's all there is to it you need some aluminium oxide and some boron trioxide and then it makes hardened glass which I gotta say looks seriously cool here's another thing you can make with this polyethylene stuff and don't tell me I didn't actually make enough apparently I didn't make enough overall I did make the right amount I was just missing something so if we do that's look at that an orange glow stick let's make a purple one and a cyan one as well so there are four different types of potion you can brew as well so we've got some awkward potions and with silver you can turn this into antidote which will cure poison the next one has Cobalts in its of all things and that makes the elixir which can be used to cure weakness we then have eyedrops made with calcium and this will cure blindness these are all effects in the game of course we're talking about here and then last of all we have bismuth which makes this tonic right here which can be used to cure nausea so those are the four different types of potion you can make with this stuff as well and now my friends we get to have fun with the contents of this box I'm going to start off by cloning the box and then breaking it if that lets make several clones breaking it so we can get all the items now the torches are probably going to be the least interesting right because they're not going to emit actual colored light because that would require changing the engine so it's literally gonna be a different colored torch each time one of these allows me to access my inventory like survival mode so there's the blue one there's the red one we've got the underwater torch over here so if we go down underwater funny enough down to the bottom of the ocean where it is dark and mysterious and look at that Oh with particle effects as well I like that ever so much that's really really nice it emits lights it's got a nice nice effect as you move away from it as well that's cool and of course it doesn't pop off so that's interesting we're probably going to need to give ourselves that flint and steel for this next one because I would like to let's put the purple torch away I'd like to grab our underwater TNT and place that down here so water usually stops TNT from working right so this time it's just TNT that does work even when there's water going into it let's use more than one block let's put down quite a few and then move away and there you go awesome stuff now we have a glow stick that apparently glows when it's shaken so if I hold down right click we're shaking it and we've used it a little bit is it sort of active now I think it's kind of active maybe we need to go down to where it's darker I've never seen this stuff before peeps okay so we can't shake it anymore let's shake this one ah look at that the stick is glowing that's cool and so's that one actually I didn't really notice did I so give it a little shake oh man and now it's nice and visible so this bleach that we got in our inventory is simply used to remove dyes from stuff is it a one-time use it is so that's probably not worth messing around with but you can convert colored stuff back into normal stuff this next one we're going to go into game mode survival and I've never seen this screen before until today it's really good I like it and now we're gonna break the hardened glass which will take a fair bit longer than usual as you can tell glass is usually pretty quick to break do you know what else we should do we should check and see if it is TNT resistant there we go I reckon it's not going be that resistant oh it is well I spoke too soon there you go interesting stuff ok I need me some some grass or some dirt near some water we're gonna put down some seeds and then we're gonna use our super-duper fertilizer what was it called again super fertilizer I was pretty close there's no duper and look at that basically bone meal that goes all the way to the fullest growth we should we should try that on saplings for trees as well and see if they will instantly grow and under what conditions as well so let's go put like a sapling down just over here and see if we can instantly grow it we can fascinating what if there are other blocks around it or other trees is it gonna grow instantly every time it is no not that time you saw it there X is asking questions and finding flaws with the super fertilizer so it's not that super it's pretty strong but not strong enough alright so the ice bomb is supposed to turn water into ice do we do we throw this oh yes it is a projectile that could be pretty fun for minigames right so we can make ourselves a little ice lake and then what we can do is put down the heat block which should start to melt the ice as well I like the transparency of this and it's animated as well so it says that like a tortured or emit light and melt the ice it could be the ice is created from the ice bomb isn't the same type and therefore it's not melting it Oh No there we go it's it started to melt there in the middle the first one that we placed it's now melting so sometimes they say save the best for last I've got a feeling these sparklers are gonna be the best it's right quick umm that's not quite what I was expecting I was thinking more particle effects although we do get some that sort of follow us as we move around how does that look like in this right here I like the fizzling noise that's cool and is that slowly like burning out okay interesting so our glow sticks well actually now if I'm not holding it and I go back to it it continues fizzling right and we know what the deal is now don't we I should I should be dual wielding this let's go let's go put one in there got me some sparklers feets Wow that is superb I love it awesome awesome stuff right well there it is it's been a very interesting video we've gone through all of the stuff in the chem lab if you have enjoyed the video leave a like as always thank you for the support and in the description box down below you can find the guide to the chemistry lab as well if you'd like to look at that but anyway that's it for me this video thank you for watching I'll see you soon buh-bye", "eo57jcEQPT0": "hey what is up everybody my name is Dave cat and today I'm gonna be doing something that I love doing these are literally my favorite videos to make and that is trying some Finnish candy for those of you that don't know me I come to Finland a lot and of course whenever you stay anywhere for a long time you're probably gonna eat lots of candy which I do but I tend to only stick to like a couple of the ones that I know aren't completely gross there are two which I particularly love here in Finland one of them is called do play actually play this little game where I try and sneak in a two-block to the shopping whenever me and my fiance go shopping it's quite fun it's called secret table it's a game everyone should play and there is a classic bar made by cul fatso which is just thoughts of blue it's just milk chocolate but it's so damn good but today I'm gonna try some chocolate bars which I haven't ever tried before I see these every time I go into the store and loads of people have said I should try these so that's exactly what I'm gonna do today unfortunately my Finnish language skills are pretty much zero so anything that they say on the wrappers completely goes over my head but I'll try my best now all of these bars are futz are chocolate apparently I didn't know that I only chose fights of ones but there we go so without further ado let's see some chocolate first one and this is one I'm a little bit afraid of because I've tried something similar to this before and it had salmiakki kind of paste or something in the middle so this is kismet and Marianne whatever that means okay smells minty so it's kind of just like a wafer I can't really see anything scary inside it just smells like mint fortunately I like mint and mean mint chocolate so yeah here goes nothing it smells way more minty ER than it tastes Oh No there we go little aftertaste of mint but that's pretty good there are several different types of kismat I think like I said as salmiakki one there's this Marianne one which I guess means it has some kind of mint flavoring under what else that for me gets a three out of five so moving on this one this one looks interesting so this is similar to the  our blue except it's got a flavor on this one I think and I've never tried this he says but Omar yogurt dip might the soup club I know that means milk chocolate so we're on a good path there ah in English it says milk chocolate with raspberry yogurt okay oh my god that smells incredible man holy moly I'm looking forward to this one it's incredible it tastes just like you're eating the yogurt with chocolate around it that's strange I've never had that sensation we're having a chocolate bar before my brain is very confused right now it tastes pretty good I think I'm gonna have to give this a 3 out of 5 as well because that was just a bit bit weird but taste it all right okay this one oh my god I've seen this so many times and I've keep meaning to pick it up I don't know why but it just looks a bit scary it's got the finish and the Swedish there and then hidden is the English and it says chocolate with hazel nuts truffle filling doesn't sound too scary sounds delicious actually smelled very hazelnutty that's a good kind of darker chocolate as well mmm this is good oh my god I'm gonna eat this whole thing on it now I kind of want to give the other two like a 2 out of 5 because I feel like this is not quite a four but it's not three maybe three-and-a-half okay this gets three and a half they stay at three they still gets a three-hour battle fine by the way I'm basing this rating system on how much I love foot block because that is a solid six out of five just saying okay here we go next one is so similar wrapper to the funny kind of but not really so this is subtle original and it looks like it's kind of a rice puff nut thing I have no idea is there any English help me out here hey you up let's just eat the thing then we'll find out what it is whoa smells incredible kind of looks a little bit like a lion bar that we can get in the UK let's try it so it's kind of got like a caramel filling and rice krispies type things around it was a bit of a strange aftertaste all in all pretty pretty good so I think suits all has to go in the three out of five pile as well pretty good but not out not out spam oh no I've only one left this has to be a five out of five otherwise I've failed miserably so next up we have Fudd sir mint again I seen these all around and you kind of see them in bowls in hotels and stuff I think clear the miniature versions I've managed to go three years without even trying this he goes nothing so it says the famous Finnish mint okay I can say I quite like mint chocolate so I'm surprised I haven't tried this yet it's got the signature fat sir stamp on the front smells kind of dark chocolate mm-hmm that's good I don't know if it's just because I've eaten so much chocolate already my kind of feels a little sick that was really good if you like mint chopped down I'd definitely suggest picking up a fox a mint when everyone will buy it because that was delicious that was great I'm gonna give that a 4 out of 5 feel like that has the perfect balance of like mint enos and chocolaty know sometimes mint chocolate can be pretty hit or miss that was good very good haha now I feel a bit sick all that different chocolate mixing around in my belly it's not good though I feel a little bit sick I'm very sad to have finished all my chocolate so that is all the chocolate I have for guys if you've tried any of these let me know which one is your favorite in the comments below and if you haven't tried them and you just like watching videos of people eating chocolate so you know which one you think you'd like guys thank you so much for watching this video if you've enjoyed it please give it a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe to that this is Finland YouTube now I'm gonna be making a bunch more videos for this channel so yeah subscribe it's gonna be fun once again guys thank you so much for watching and I see you in the next one see ya", "i5lPqifLl-I": "chocolate bars everything you need to know from tree to tree over 70 of the world's chocolate comes from west africa and the fruit of the cacao tree the cacao tree produces large colorful pods directly on the trunk and larger branches cracking open the pod reveals the slimy white seeds inside the seeds are fermented giving them their brown color and rich flavor then dried for several days and roasted they are now officially called cocoa beans next the beans enter a machine called a win-work this process separates the outer husk of the bean leaving the inside which is called the nib over 50 of a nib is fat which is cocoa butter so when the nibs are ground up the heat and friction activates the cocoa butter producing pure liquid chocolate now it's time for flavor ingredients like sugar vanilla and more cocoa butter are added to the mix for milk chocolate add condensed or powdered milk the flavor is right but the texture is too thick so the chocolate moves to a refining machine passing through a set of rollers that reduce the particle size so much that the chocolate actually exits the machine as a fine dry powder the powder is then re-liquefied in a mixing machine called a conch more cocoa butter is added to reduce the viscosity so the chocolate is silky smooth to finalize the chocolate bar the liquid is poured into molds and then cooled and there you go a delicious chocolate bar worthy of mr wonka himself what no not that one ah there you go chocolate bars everything you need to know from tree to tree", "0A63sTTcUlk": "hey there it's steve from serious keto and in this video we are going to make another fantastic keto candy bar fat bomb now i've kind of teased at this recipe ever since i released my candied toffee almonds which i will link to right up there not only does this recipe use that it also uses blanched almond butter now if you want you can use regular almond butter but if you want to use blanched i would recommend not buying it but rather making it yourself and saving about eighty percent i'll link to a video on that in the end card on this video additionally i use this six cavity silicone mold to make my candy bars i will put the amazon link down below in the description but i want you to be aware that the price on this varies radically i've seen it as low as 10 dollars i've seen it as high as 26. don't pay 26 for this if you're dying to make this and you don't have one of these molds look around see if you can find a different mold cheaper but if it gets down in that 10 to 15 range i would call that a good price not only is this mold great for candy bars but i suspect it's probably going to be the mold that i use when i perfect my hot dog bun recipe but with that out of the way let's make some candy bars we'll start by taking our mold and putting a tablespoon of our almonds in each cavity in total that's about 60 to 65 grams and let's give it a little bit of a shake get it fairly uniform and then we'll set this aside while we get our chocolate going i recommend using a double boiler i'm just using one pot with some nice little pory type edges over another pot this allows you to control the temperature a lot better and keeps you from potentially scalding anything we'll start with one half cup of sugar-free milk chocolate chips this can be lilies this can be chunk zero if you like chalk zero i will include a link for 10 off from their site that's like 10 less than amazon in the description below then we'll add six tablespoons of almond butter and for really sticky stuff i kind of recommend one of these variable measuring cups right here so you just plunge this right off look at that nice and tidy did i mention that was also 90 grams we'll bring up the heat and stir until melted if the chocolate is still looking a little bit thick you can add a tablespoon or 15 milliliters of mct oil to thin it out a bit i wound up adding a second tablespoon of mct oil to get this nice and smooth and if you want to add a little bit more toffee flavor you can add a squirt of english toffee stevia drops i think i'm going to do that stir that in then we'll divide evenly between our molds then i'll use a butter knife and just sort of drag it back and forth a little bit to make sure my almonds get all incorporated and that the chocolate gets into every nook and cranny then i'll give this just a couple of little taps on the counter to make sure everything settles you can see some little air bubbles popping up that now are going away i think we're good this is going to go off into the freezer for probably the next half hour to hour and then we're going to be ready to have some candy bars [Applause] it has been right about an hour so i'm going to pop these guys out of the mold should have been a little bit more gentle on that one now the taste test i'm gonna eat the one that i broke very good and certainly not too sweet this is a grown-up candy bar right here so one thing to be aware of with these candy bars because of the mct oil and the almond butter these are not going to be stable at room temperature they'll probably be fine in the fridge if you really want to make sure that they don't melt at all on your fingertips i'd recommend keeping them in the freezer they also come in at four net grams of carbs so essentially the same as like a keto bar or a pack of keto cookies but i'll include all of the macros along with the printable recipe down in the video description below if you enjoyed this video hit that like button if you're not a subscriber already why not hit that subscribe button and if

channel trying to figure out what is that best dark chocolate brand and I've got one here today that I'm going to share with you guys we're gonna do a little taste test and see what we think about it first of all hi hi doll the new dads out there this is dad reviews is where I give you my unedited hopefully more authentic look at the products we like to use and have and not bite up putting my body because they're delicious so if you're interested in that you might want to consider clicking that subscribe button so I've been interested in like the health benefits of dark chocolate recently they've got a lot of polyphenols in it and they have a little bit of caffeine in it too which I try not to eat dark chocolates that is one thing that keeps me awake if I eat it too late in the day so I decided though I've really really really liked our chocolate though so I wanted to try out some different brands and figure out what that best brand is so today we're gonna do a little taste test of this guy right here it's the endangered-species strong velvety dark chocolate this has 88 percent cacao and it looks really it says bold cacao with hints of fruit and spice the ultimate and strong smooth dark chocolate and 10 percent of the net profits to save our wildlife that's why it's called the endangered species brand there so I started getting getting interested in dark chocolate whenever I read that bulletproof diet book because they were talking about you know how chocolates good for you and the benefits of it and all that type of stuff sauce like them maybe I could just add a little bit to my diet whenever like one little square a day or something like that not nothing huge and so I I'm interested in what's out there and this one has the ingredients are cacao sugar and van no that's not the ingredient ingredients bittersweet chocolate which is chocolate liqueur sugar soy lectin and vanilla so as far as far as a health considerations here this one may not be like the top top healthy in fact I did just in a video of this book right here called rich food poor food and chocolate is one of the things that they talk about in this book and I would be curious to taste out to test out some of the chocolates that they recommend in here because they look really interesting and I know that there would be good it's the Lucien's sugar-free 83% dark chocolate bar the cocoa polo 70% dark chocolate bar and then that's a hazelnut bar so let's get into this one today and see what we got here let's see it three grams of sugar by the way if you care about the home man look at how rich that thing looks just opening that up why don't they put like I feel like they should put that on the front like whenever you open it it's kind of like opening an envelope you know whenever you open an envelope and you pull a letter out and you like oh it's like the front of the letter and you see it and it's like all nice you know they should do the same thing with the chocolate here why don't they do that to where the pretty side is faced up like that so it's like you're opening a package and it's like oh wow this looks really nice and you know maybe some branding or something in there instead you get a flat back that didn't make any sense to me alright so it does come with the foil wrapper I guess that's foil it's a inner layer right there if you want to utilize that for you know why I don't know if that's like a preserve to help preserve it or what nice break on it here you go got a nice crisp snap broke straight right on the edge right there so that's awesome as I'm touching it my hands are a little hot I'm getting a little bit of residue on the finger there I don't know if y'all can see that there you go a little bit of residue of the chocolate melting in my fingers the it's got a little emblem in there it looks like a piece of bamboo since this is an endangered species thing I think they're going after the kind of panda thing right there let's uh let's taste this thing and see what it tape comes up if you guys are ready for me to taste this you just smash that thumbs up button yet I really appreciate it when you guys do that alright let's see we have mmm-hmm Wow mm-hmm so if not super duper sugary which is nice but surprisingly it's not very bitter either it's like a nice balance of sugar to to bitterness I really really like that actually cuz sometimes whenever you get chocolate and it's like way too bitter it just doesn't taste that good and you kind of get it hits you like right here and then if it's too sweet it's usually because they put too much sugar in it and it's not that healthy for you but this stuff is delicious you guys want to check this out I'll link it up down in the description below I'm gonna go read other people's reviews about it if people write reviews about food on Amazon sometimes I do sometimes they don't but uh 488 percent cacao that is amazing I think that the highest I've seen is 93 I need to get a 93 percent to see what that tastes like if you guys like any particular brand of chocolate let me know down in the comments below what that is and I'm gonna see if I can get my hands on some of that so that we can try out a whole bunch of different chocolates and we'll have a big series of videos here on the channel about the best chocolate and we figure out which one we like the most if you guys are liking what we're doing here on that reviews make sure to click that subscribe button I've tasted some other chocolate stuff before if you guys want to check that out I'll put that right there you guys go and click that video and whenever I get that full playlist going the whole series of chocolate I'll put that right there click those videos I'll see you on those videos Thank You dads for watching that thumbs up as always appreciated and dad out", "XigFOb0THWQ": "I'm gonna buy all of the chocolate bars here we are again with another installment in the chocolate bars we miss series and if you didn't think we'd be able to find more you would have surely been wrong as there are quite a few tasty candy bars out there on the old timeline that we all wish we could have one more taste of so here's 10 discontinued chocolate bars we miss part two which brings us to part two mint crisp and do I detect a hint of minty freshness who doesn't love a nice sweet treat that has the slight taste of mint there are probably a few that feel that peppermint should be reserved for toothpaste and sugar-free gum but many love the taste of mint added to chocolate and yes even ice cream after all the slight yet powerful taste of mint present in a dessert is actually really good for the digestion had a really heavy meal well that's nothing a mint candy or chocolate can't solve for newald remedy the wonderful people over at Cadbury offered the Dairy Milk mint crisps for a time and it was hugely successful we more than understand that not everyone likes mint flavored chocolate but that didn't really affect sales here it makes us wonder why certain products get discontinued even when they did well on the market for some the taste of mint brings along with it the essence of freshness and sometimes that essence is all that's needed to take a sweet treat like chocolate from being simply good to being great in this case many felt that this was definitely a fresh idea and with the nifty easy to reclose packaging it was something that could have been enjoyed sensibly a little at a time we named ourselves before learning we were small fuse there's no other way to fuse come on the word fuse just conjures up images of fused elements or ingredients to achieve ultimate levels of taste explosions for years shops and creators of food products have been fusing one ingredient with the next in hopes of creating something so delicious it could make them billionaires seemingly overnight in some cases the fusing of ingredients worked famously and although they didn't become billionaires before the Sun came up they did really well regardless but of course all that toiling in the kitchen lab or assembly line didn't always pay off as is the case with many creations found on the market in order to have a payday case in point the fuse bar here it's simply fused nuts chocolate and a few other ingredients but the combination didn't exactly catch on all that much with most seams it wasn't given a fair run as many remember this bar and wish for its return to market shelves sometimes the creation needs to be given the time necessary to get enough of an influential buzz something that the fuse bar didn't manage did cavalry drop the ball with this one you be the judge 40 years Cadbury's Tiffin sometimes what makes an epic chocolate bar is all in the combination of flavors much like the fuse bar it's here that the mad scientists responsible for the creation of such treats really either make it or break it so to speak it's just gonna be another crazy experiment that crosses a line man was not meant to cross with Tiffin the combination was a medley of familiar ingredients often found with chocolate but rarely found together in one bar the Tiffin from Cadbury combined both nuts and the Wonder that are raisins now chocolate-covered raisins are indeed a crowd-pleaser but not all who love chocolate adore the combination of chocolate and dried grapes when it's time to get their munch on and to each their own of course nuts are a tad more successful overall while raisins are a little more rare but here Cadbury decided to throw a party and both nuts and raisins were invited and the end result was a pretty delicious treat worthy of any and all praise although it saw its end in 2003 many still wish to have this back and maybe one day it will make its return but until then keep dreaming friends maybe this is a dream Nestle alpine white that's cuz it's mountain rules man oh yes the Nestle Alpine white chocolate bar a sweet dream you can't resist this chocolate bar also comes with a few very very very good throwback commercials the sweet dreams a dish ran in 1986 and provided viewers with everything they needed a woman standing on the edge of a cliff and running her hands through her hair a figure skater a god-like male figure and music really this commercial shows us what we did not know we needed but now realize that we need hey we were watching that not only are we now longing for a nestle Alpine white bar but we are also craving some 80s advertising if only Mad Men made it all the way into the 80s Nestle Alpine white take me away take me to this magical dreamland you advertise so enticingly yummy anyone salivating is it the white chocolate that is making you drool or the actors and the sweet dreams Nestle Alpine white add this white chocolate chocolate bar also had almonds in it extra delicious let's all now go out and find the best white chocolate weekend and sit back and watch old ads and simply remember this chocolate barf may it rest in peace and remain a lovely time capsule of the 80s forever you see the guys in charge of this stuff lack creativity and are completely out of ideas Cadbury's time out Kadri time out everybody can use a time out every now and again sometimes there's nothing like a good break to recharge the batteries and get ready to face the toil of yet another two or three hours of hard work can someone else do it Kit Kat chocolates already have the market in that department as they are definitely the candy bar of choice of many while on their break so to speak but the Cadbury time out bar was definitely running along the same lines the question is was the market big enough to support two chocolate bars that promoted taking a much-needed rest from work see the KitKat bar markets directly to that demographic as we all know from their very popular and enchanting jingle that said the timeout didn't exactly do all that well with such a giant already taking space on the market especially since that product promised an epic break from your day at work but many do miss it and yes they even preferred it to the KitKat bar the two didn't have the same taste or consistency and all we're getting at here is the similarity in their similar sales angles but still sometimes that's enough to throw a consumer off which is what happened here KitKat senses and speaking of KitKat the brand has definitely released its fair share of flavors over the long years since its inception and a lot of them have done pretty well no matter how odd the flavor pairings may have seemed the company can definitely brag that it has the most flavor combinations sold worldwide than any other candy bar around and that's a pretty bold statement so kudos to them but a lot of their products haven't done all that well especially in North America now this particular offering by KitKat was interesting and really aptly named celebrity chef Chuck Hughes once said the culinary arts are the only art form where the five senses are used and we'd have to agree with his assessment smell touch sound sight and of course taste so we absolutely understand what the good people at KitKat were going for with this one the only problem here is that the chocolate bar known as the KitKat senses was almost a direct copy of an already existing bar that coincidentally already had a pretty good market value and was doing quite well of course we're speaking of the Kinder Bueno the recipe is almost exactly the same thing with a few minor changes so if there are any of you out there that miss the senses bar just go ahead and pick up a bueno at your local corner store it's pretty much the same thing after all I called a process science Cadbury's amazing raisin some nuggets solar babies we've already mentioned that there are some people out there that positively love themselves some chocolate-covered raisins Plus that seem to have the market on that little recipe and for good reason they've been around for what seems like forever so yeah we'd have to say the gloss sets pretty much have the upper hand in sales here but at one time Cadbury launched an actual bar that contained raisins throughout and here lovers combination were able to enjoy the taste they loved in bar form and not as individual raisins covered in milk chocolate a pretty good idea if you ask us what genius is it's almost frightening but at the same time it didn't really catch on and the bar kind of fell off the face of the planet our sympathies go out to all of you who love raisins and chocolate and this one hits home for us too as we're part of the same camp let's say it together loud and proud please bring this one back how many scoops told glaze snaps as far as chips are concerned many around the world seem to be in love with Pringles as they should be Pringles are indeed awesome and they tend to be a bit crispier than your average chip and a little less oily to boot which all-in-all is a pretty good thing at the end of the day even lays stacks are pretty popular and some even prefer the Lay's stacked chips to the Pringles we all know and love but why are we talking about chips when this is a video about chocolate bars that are no longer with us what should I do well Cadbury snaps definitely make this list of ours hence the whole foray into the world of stacked chip brands this chocolate was actually very similar to those chips if you remember if you don't well feast your eyes on these just don't get too attached as they don't exist anymore sorry they were thin and actually pretty crispy very reminiscent of a chip they even came in a few interesting flavors caramel orange mint and of course hazelnut which is always a winner Nutella anyone these two were pretty popular but once again not enough to keep producing them it's sort of like eating a bag of chips you know it's never gonna actually make you full Astros jaggery Astros these tasty little morsels of chocolaty biscuit goodness were launched in 1997 and while the Spice Girls and the Backstreet Boys were taking up the airwaves and telling the millions to show them the meaning of being lonely and to tell them what they wanted the world was responding with a loud chorus of tell me why Astros Astros to say that these were successful would be an understatement which makes the fact that they've all but disappeared all that much more unbelievable what's more unbelievable is that they are still available somewhere on this planet and you won't guess where if you guessed South Africa you win the prize a lifetime supply of Astros not really the morsels of chocolate were airy and light but what they made up for in density and they sure didn't lack in taste these were some pretty tasty pieces of chocolate and many would want them back we got an extra run for the Spice Girls so why not these B Spice Girls conspiracy Texan Joe's let me finish this here Texan now what could sound harder than a morsel of food named the Texan probably nothing on earth as when you think of Texan cuisine you think of ribs barbecue tex-mex cuisine all these are hearty meals that'll stick to your ribs any day of the week so why not name a chocolate bar after the great state as good a name as any actually it's a great name when we think about it they were produced by Nestle and the slogan of sure is a mighty chew was really appropriate considering the tasty punch these bars offered they contained nougat toffee and of course chocolate but just as quickly as they were introduced they were taken away and when they were reintroduced back in 2005 they were once again ripped out of the public's hands how cruel could they be kids can be so cruel we can stick around

made with coconut milk now it also happens to be on roasted cacao so what does that mean well let's first look at why do you roast chocolate some makers choose to roast it because they want to change the flavor a bit like maybe a chocolate is really acidic and they want to tone it down maybe they roast it in a way to preserve the acidity or fruity flavors or maybe they want to roast a little higher to bring out different more chocolatey notes or hey maybe like you know the taste of burnt toast so you really put the heat to it but i'm not here to judge now other makers like raka choose to go the unroasted route and in particular raqqa is kind of looking at more like if the acidity exists in the cacao or this certain flavor exists i want to just keep it i don't want to mess with it i want to keep it so that's what you'll find with them and i will say with raka they're definitely uh really know what they're doing when it comes to the unroasted cacaos it really they managed to really have some complex bars so it is a good maker to try if you're looking for unroasted perhaps even for the first time now this one is made with coconut milk they also do one with oat milk and some other makers will do ones with those and like say like dormouse does um ones with almond milk and there's some makers like zotter that have one with rice milk so there's a lot of really cool varieties out there now made with alternative milks so if you need dairy free or vegan chocolate those are good ones to look for also even if you're not vegan or you don't have to worry about dairy it's just fun to try bars like this made with other milks because they taste differently and it's fun to have that experience and this is definitely a good example this particular one tastes uh well in the nose you get like coconut you get like chocolate dip coconut macaroon and there's like a little bit of white pepper going on as well and even some condensed milk in the nose with flavor i'm getting coconut i'm getting cocoa and then on different days i get a little bit of a different spice variation but i always am tasting clove to some level in it but there's no clove added that's just one of those flavors that happens to come through in the cacao itself now in the comments below let me know what's your favorite milk chocolate bar be it dairy milk or a different type of milk or what's your dream chocolate bar but do leave me a comment i'm very curious to see what your favorite stuff is thanks for watching and if you look below this video you'll see stuff like my links for

using for a base on this is actually just some cardboard and then I've covered that with cling film and then side by side I'm putting two 12 inch square cakes I'm gonna leave just enough of the cardboard at each end because this is where the end of my wrap is gonna go that's what I'm leveling them both off so it's level right across and I'm just gonna make it perfectly square as the tins I used were rounded at the corners once that's done I'm just gonna carve each end down so I'm rounding out the corners all along the sides and down both ends I'm only rounding slightly at the top and the bottom at the right and the left I'm carving right down towards the base now I'm going to cover the whole thing with chocolate gonna I'm gonna do a few layers of this and make sure I've got it nice and smooth at each end and keep the edges nice and sharp while that set in I'm gonna roll out some white sugar paste I'm using this sugar paste and this is what I'm gonna use to create the text on my chocolate bar so first of all I'm cutting this sort of waved shape then I'm just cutting the letters out freehand so first of all I'm cutting them all into squares I find this the easiest way and then I'm gonna cut the letters out using a small scalpel one by one [Music] I've just got a reference picture up for this and I'm just taking my time to try and get the shape of the letters right [Music] there's a few more other little shapes on the dairy milk bar and the two glasses pour and there's a little flicker at the end you're gonna create them also with some of the flat pieces so the base to have left that's the two glasses for it what I've done now is I've colored the sugar paste using spectrum flow water-based colors for this I used royal blue and some pink water-based colors to create this color i meanwe airbrush afterwards but first of all I'm gonna roll this out of roll it over the top I've smoothed it all to the surface and now I'm just trimming along the sides with some of the excess sugar paste I have there I'm gonna make each end so I'm just rolling out a long strip of that cutting it into a nice sharp rectangle cutting it in the middle and it's smoothing it down on one of the sides I'm showing a seam along here and then using my Dresden tool little dashes to create that rippled effect on the edges to give the illusion of the end of the wrapper now to attach the letters that are made earlier which should be nice and dry by now I've just steamed the whole surface and I'm going to place them on in the correct position [Music] I've colored some of the sugar paste brown here I'll just cross out the shape of this part that's on the front and then using some powder based gold painted on the Cadbury logo and this strip on the side there you can also add names to this name of the person whose birth the ears or the name of the person whose event it is that would be a nice touch under the dairy there so then just using some spectrum flow water-based colors again some Browns some reds and some yellows and just painting the details on this part and then the Cadbury logo just to finish off I've got some purple spectrum flow airbrush clothes in my airbrush I'm just gonna give this a load of shadows and that is it that's how you make this Dairy Milk supersized chocolate bar cake [Music] [Applause]", "2Efcqi3e_R8": "today we're gonna be doing Canadian versus American chocolate bars having grown up in the States and now living in Canada I know a lot about the chocolate in both countries now there's really a lot of overlap we share most of the same candy bars but there are a handful that are just Canadian or just American and I'm not taking into account here that these chocolate bars might be found in other countries outside of the US and Canada I'm just talking about the ones that are in either Canada and not the US or vice versa and when I say Canadian or an American chocolate bar I mean that the manufacturer that makes that chocolate bar widely distributes it in either Canada or in the US but not the other but this doesn't mean with the exception of one that we're gonna talk about this does not mean that it's illegal to sell that chocolate bar in the other country so it can be imported but in general it's either a Canadian chocolate or an American chocolate bar and I've also included a few here that can be found in both countries but I'm just gonna be using them for comparison sake because they're similar to one of the candies and I want to show you and there's even two that are not chocolate and you can probably guess why I'm including those first we're gonna do a little brief overview of each chocolate bar then we're gonna take a closer look into it and then you and I are gonna be doing some taste testing first up is Smarties Smarties were first launched in 1937 by a chai roundtree company but now they're owned by Nestle and they are a Canadian chocolate there's small little chocolate buttons very similar to M&Ms both have a candy coating so that it doesn't melt in your hand M&Ms can be found widely in both countries but Smarties are only in Canada because of course a different company owns the Smarty trademark in the US these guys Canadians lardy's versus American Smarties but then of course the smarty candy company who owns these guys wants to sell these in Canada too so they sell them here as Rockets but rockets and Smarties American Smarties are exactly the same they just have different names and these two guys are the only non chocolates in the list today but I've just included them so that you can see the difference between American Smarties and Canadian Smarties [Music] [Music] Smarties versus M&Ms Smarties are a little bit bigger and the M&Ms have an M on them they do taste really different but I don't know how I would describe the difference between Smarties and M&Ms Smarties are maybe a little bit work and do you like sometimes are slightly more chocolatey chocolate of course depends on the mood the non chocolates rockets versus Smarties they're literally identical in theory these actually should be the same thing literally identical no difference between the two they're just sugar the next American candy bar is the Milky Way a personal favorite it is nougat and caramel covered in chocolate and it was developed in 1923 and is owned by the Mars confectionery company and if you're Canadian it might look pretty similar to this guy which is called a mars bar it is also chocolate surrounding some nougat and caramel it is also owned by the Mars confectionery company but this one was developed in 1932 a little bit later pretty much as a direct copy of the Milky Way bar now there was something called a mars bar that was sold in the US until about 2002 but this was actually a different candy bar than what this one is and then to make things even more confusing Milky Way is apparently sold in Europe but it's more like the three musketeers that's here in both Canada in the US so it's not the same as this one but these two the Milky Way and the Mars bar both space themed both the same type of candy the American version and the Canadian version both owned by the same company [Music] now the Canadian Mars versus the American Milky Way they look I mean pretty darn close Mars bar they're pretty much almost identical slight favorite flavor differences that I wouldn't be able to explain better pretty much the same Mars and Milky Way tie another Canadian candy is the crispy crunch this is a peanut hard flaky inside covered in chocolate and it was developed in 1930 and is owned by Cadbury and it's pretty similar to a Butterfinger which is available in both countries butterfingers were developed in 1923 and is owned by Nestle and it's also a peanut flaky hard inside covered in chocolate even though it's available in both countries I've included it here just for comparison sake against the crispy crunch because they're so similar so here's the Canadian crispy crunch and here's both countries Butterfinger now I do see Butterfinger literally everywhere in the US and I see it a little bit less often here in Canada but it's definitely in many places here it's just got some competition now the crispy crunch was actually available in the US for a while too it was distributed there in the 90s but the company that took on distribution went bankrupt so it's no longer there [Music] this is a Canadian crispy crunch versus the Butterfinger in both countries they look pretty similar the Butterfinger is a lot like here and softer than the crispy crunches and the flavors are similar but also the outside of the Butterfinger is more melty than the crispy crunches and it's softer just all-around softer and the flavor is maybe a little bit richer in the Butterfinger I would say Butterfinger wins over the crispy crunch whatchamacallit are an American candy bar they are peanut flavored crisps covered in chocolate and they were developed in 1978 and are owned by the Hershey Company and I would kind of call these a more vintage candy because they're not as popular as they used to be but they're still around and mr. BIG's are a Canadian chocolate bar they're developed by Cadbury I can't actually figure out when these first launched they are a vanilla wafer and caramel rice crisps covered in chocolate actually they call it a chocolate like coating so maybe not real chocolate and they are actually starting to be distributed in the US as well but not very widely so I'm still qualifying these as a Canadian chocolate bar [Music] kind of taste way free so these two are pretty similar actually these next ones don't actually follow the rules of this video because both of them are distributed in both countries but I'm including them anyway because they're essentially the same exact thing and I would definitely consider one of them as being the Canadian version and one being the American version in Canada they are Maltesers it's malted milk balls covered in chocolate owned by the Mars company launched in 1937 and these used to be more Canadian but they started being distributed in the US in 2017 so now you can find them in both countries but they're essentially exactly the same thing as whoppers also available in both countries these were developed a little bit later in 1949 and are owned by the Hershey Company also malted milk balls covered in chocolate and here they are up close Canadian versus American of course the whoppers do come in a smaller package but this is just what I found at the store at the time I went to look for them [Music] [Music] the whopper is a way richer taste on the insides you can see a difference the Maltesers a lot more Airy versus the Walker that is thick it's a much much richer taste than the Maltesers so I guess it depends on what you like better I like the walkers better I feel like I'm definitely a little bit more biased here because I grew up in the state so the u.s. candies are what I grew up eating they probably have memories attached to him remember at the beginning of this video when I said that one of these chocolates is illegal and not able to be sold in one of the countries well you probably guessed it it's the Kinder Surprise egg so the kinder egg is a Canadian chocolate its chocolate egg with a milky coating and there's a toy inside of the chocolate egg itself which is inside of a little plastic case and it is owned by Ferrero and was launched in 1974 but this one is illegal in the US you're not even allowed to bring it into the US so the FDA does not like this because they don't allow non-food items to be inside of a confectionary unless they serve some sort of purpose but this one does not so it's illegal and one of the fun facts that kind of goes around about kinder eggs is that in 2011 over 60,000 of these were seized at the US border coming in from Canada because that's how badly Americans wanted these kinder eggs but in 2017 Ferrera launched the kinder joy in the US and they look the same on the outside but the FDA still does not like this egg so this one is quite a bit different only half of this is chocolate and the other half is a toy so the chocolate itself is also pretty different it's got a creamy filling and some chocolate crispy wafer circles in it and the toy is not inside of the chocolate at all it's totally separate so well they look the same on the outside they are not at all the same on the inside this is the Canadian kinder egg and this is the American kinder egg [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] kinder eggs so this is the Canadian one this is the little toy inside or it's inside of this case definitely too big to be swallowed by a kid probably but still FDA's worried about it I mean I've had this before it tastes like really cheap Easter candy I'm not a big fan during never had the American one before the American one came in two halves completely sealed from each other a little cool car toy definitely couldn't mistake the toy for food and then it's got this inside the little balls are crunchy and then that's me I actually don't even see me chocolate other than the balls I kind of like the way furry things they're like those wafer cookies but I don't know actually it's better than the Canadian one I would say American kinder egg we both the US and Canada have chocolate caramel bars they're chocolate filled with a creamy caramel filling in Canada we have Keira milks they're owned by Cadbury and were launched in 1968 and in the u.s. we have caramel O's these are actually owned by the Hershey Company but their brand is Cadbury caramel O's so these are pretty close to the same thing except one is Kara milk and one is caramel Oh [Music] [Music] the Carmelo is really leaky all the caramel comes out the sides when you break it open and that's not happening and happening in the caramel the caramel Oh is a lot runny ER and it's more parts caramel to chocolate but I don't know if that's just the size of the Carmelo bar that I got versus the size of the caramel bar that I got I kind of like the way that that caramel Oh tastes better but the Karem milk is way less messy so I would the caramel the US has an almond joy now an almond joy is basically the same as a mounds which is also an American candy they're almost exactly the same thing they're coconut and chocolate except for the almond joy has a couple of almonds on top of it and this one's milk chocolate while mounds is dark chocolate mounds were launched in 1920 and almond joys were launched in 1946 and then for coconut lovers in Canada we've got the bounty bar in his coconut covered in milk chocolate it's owned by Mars and was first released in 1951 and this was actually available in the US for a while but no longer is [Music] the American I'm enjoy I don't really want to try because I hate coconut I'm sure the almond joy is good no offense to almond joy I just happened a hey now for the Canadian coconut one the bounty not looking forward to it well I'm unfair to these because I just really hate coconut but actually I got to say the bounty is slightly better than the almond joy slightly less coconutty I don't know in the US we have got a toffee bar called the heath bar it is English toffee covered in chocolate it's owned by Hershey Company and was launched in 1914 and I'm going to compare it to Canada's crunchy barn they are slightly different but they're both talkie bars the crunchy bar is sponge toffee covered in chocolate it's owned by Cadbury and was launched in 1929 and I'm also going to include in here a score bar so a score bar is actually available in both countries but I'm including it just because of how similar it is to the heath bar the score bar is butter toffee and not English toffee but it's also toffee covered in chocolate owned by the Hershey Company and launched in 1981 and here's what all three of these look like American Canadian and the middle one is well these are definitely gonna taste different the different types of top this top it kind of melts in your mouth you can't fart you have to crunch through they're both very sugary the crunchy maybe even more sugary and this is the score bar available in both countries similar consistency but slightly different flavor than the huge bar I actually prefer the score bar out of all three of those one that's available in both countries now we've got a bunch of chocolate bars but don't really have a good comparison between one country and the other so I'm just gonna show these ones Solo in Canada we've got the Wonder Bar the Wonder bar is peanuts that are pretty crushed up so it's actually smooth peanutty and caramel covered in chocolate these were developed in the 1980s and are owned by Cadbury but this one's actually Cadbury Ireland though they distribute it in Canada and not really in the US and I could not find a great American comparison to this one [Music] [Music] it is like a chewy peanut buttery caramel a texture with some crunchy crunchy bits inside you're a little bit too chewy for me they're okay they get a middle thumb the US has a mr. Goodbar which is owned by Hershey and it's just chocolate with peanuts in it mr. Goodbar tastes like a Hershey bar would probably ever been tried before with peanuts in it I mean there's not a lot to explain it pretty much tastes as you would expect you can take your limit in Canada we've got arrow bars arrows owned by Nestle and was launched in 1935 he's actually made it to the US for a little while in the 80s but they were pulled back out it's aerated milk chocolate and these actually now come in a bunch of different flavors but milk chocolate is the most common and traditional flavor the arrow bar see how the bubbles inside I like all the bubbles the bubbles and arrow bars aren't cool because you just bite through them super easily it's not a hard crunch it's very soft and it's kind of a cool texture and then it just takes tastes like a milk chocolate Canada has gloss sets which are chocolate-covered raisins they are owned by the Hershey Company and I can't figure out when they first launched and the u.s. also actually has chocolate-covered raisins called Raisinets they're owned by Nestle and were launched in 1927 but I went to several stores maybe 7 or 8 stores and I couldn't find Raisinets so maybe they're just not as popular anymore I don't know if they're not being distributed maybe I would find them at a movie theater but I couldn't find them so we're only looking at glosses they're basically the same thing though [Music] I've never had glasses before I have had Raisinets before it's been a long time since I've had Raisinets but the glasses taste I think it's been a long time so I can't remember a classic Canadian candy is coffee crisp in his vanilla wafer with some coffee in between and surrounded in milk chocolate it's owned by Nestle and was launched in 1938 coffee and wafer like as one might expect coffee crisp is probably the least sweet of all of the candies today which is kind of good right now in the US we've got the 100 grand bar this is owned by Nestle and was launched in 1966 it is chocolate and caramel with crispy crunches inside [Music] I mean 100 grand tastes like caramel with some like Rice Krispies in it it's about what it tastes like easy to explain I like I like the rice krispies one that I have never tried before is the Canadian big Turk this is Turkish Delight covered in chocolate it's owned by Nestle and I cannot find what date it was first launched [Music] I really don't want to try the Canadian big Turk I've never had this before turkish delights or not it's like magenta colored on the inside it's quite a weird color for tastes kind of like a gummy worm or something covered in chocolate which some people could like not me big turk big thumbs down but if you like Turkish Delight or fruity candies you probably like it now that was a lot of chocolate analysis and even after all that I know that I'm missing some being an American living in Canada it's a lot easier for me to recognize candy bars that are new to it than it is to recognize candy bars that I can no longer find so I'm guessing that I'm missing far more American ones than Canadian ones but I don't know you tell me what did I miss and thanks for watching bye you", "kwrxhAtcuyg": "hey what's going on everyone welcome to the 9malls gadget review channel today i'm review a product that i found in my local kroger store and this was found in the halloween section i saw it i was like i need to try this out this looks delicious i mean from the packaging and just the packaging alone looks amazing but you have the m m milk chocolate bar mini not just not regular m m's but mini m m's and almonds 3.9 ounces in here let's see what the whole car is and i think i'm going to eat the whole bar actually so yeah get ready all right so maybe not on camera but uh calories 150 grams four servings and yeah so this is the milk chocolate with almonds and you got the mini m ms which just sounds delicious it kind of takes the whole regular chocolate bar to the next level so let's open up see what's inside see if it's any good i thought i'd do kind of some candy some halloween themed reviews let me just show you the whole bar actually before i eat it yeah you got a pretty interesting you got a little pattern here you got little places you can break off you know you could break up a whole square here you can break off this little mini m m little bite size pieces which is kind of cool you don't have to eat it all at once yeah you can eat this little mini so here we go taste test three two one milk chocolate so let me just show you this is interesting so this is one of those what you're expecting and then reality type of situation so you think with many m m's right and then almonds you'd get a crunch but check this out so look at that hardly any almonds already hardly any many m m's let's break it off here actually look at that so that's really really disappointing i mean good concept execution wise total failure all right let's try that again i almost see zero many m m's three two one taste test once again there was some crunch but not as much as i expected and definitely they are skipping all the almonds in this so i mean you can just see visually there's some but i mean for two bucks you can get a high-end chocolate bar that's on sale at kroger for like 250. so i would say pass on this really disappointing i was expecting a lot i was expecting the crunch of the mini m m's and lots of almonds it just didn't deliver so pass on this really disappointing i was excited to have this uh and i'll still probably eat it but there's a lot better options out there there's so much competition when it comes to chocolate get the premium chocolate bars you'll never go wrong you know spend 250 three bucks for a bar and they're always on sale so yeah pass on this all right thanks for watching until next time i'll see you later you", "yS4eW5im6mY": "hi guys today I want to review the picnic bar that I purchased on Amazon I first tried it as part of a sample pack and I liked it so much that I bought it separately this is made by Cadbury and the weight is almost 50 grams it is absolutely delicious I can say that this is probably my favorite chocolate bar so it has as you can see over here some rice krispies or some some something of similar nature caramel peanuts and reason and it is just delicious I'll show you so remember to forgive me I mean look at this isn't it absolutely amazing it tastes so so that if you want to make it a little bit harder just put it in the fridge for 15 minutes maybe even less and enjoy your snack I believe that this bar is only 230 calories and and probably the best thing you will try if you like nuts and raisin combined have any questions or comments feel free to submit it in the comment section right below", "dTXAbRtzTsQ": "hi i'm angie and today i want to try out my airbrush for the fourth time but not on my chocolate bonbons i really want to try it out on my chocolate bars on my moulds for my chocolate bars and um see how this goes um right now i'm using um a couple of different techniques but i'm only using brushes now i want to try out the airbrush um and yeah create a little bit of sprinkles and coyotes on my bars let's see how this goes and also another thing um because i get this question a lot what kind of chocolate am i using for my bum monks or for my chocolate bars and so on so i make my own chocolate i'm a beach bar chocolate maker so i um start out with the raw cacao mean and then yeah transferring it over into chocolate and yeah so that was a question i really wanted to um get into uh really quickly and um and so yeah here we go with another trial of my airbrush okay so i prepared a couple of molds i added a couple of sprinkles so i have a couple of bars with white sprinkles and i also have bars with gold sprinkles and the combination um and i want to try out my airbrush on those um on those bar molds um i've never done it before so it's just like as usual i have no idea what i'm doing and hope for the best and i will start with the white molds and i thought about using a green mermaid um a yellow and a purple and yeah that's what i'm going to do so the plan is to drop um a couple of um yeah colored cacao butter drops into the mold and then spread it with um yeah my compressor with my airbrush um yeah that's the plan let's see how it goes oh that's i don't know if that's too much or not i have no idea what i'm doing okay okay obviously this one here was too much color i quite like this one um because i really want to have like just a different um yeah splatter technique um and this one is almost a whole bar so yeah that was too much color but let's see how it will turn out [Applause] so cool now i'm adding a little bit of purple in the remaining spots i okay that's it that's it for now that's it for those molds i'm not sure if the dark purple was the right color choice here but we see how they will turn out now i have two molds with like gold sprinkles so i just added them with a brush i think we do something lighter now so i have a green that's a green um it's called peridot or something it's also from chef rubber and i also want to use the orange garnet from roxy and ridge and let's also try the green mermaid with this one yes i can definitely tell you um i tend to use too much of the colored cacao butter that's why yeah i look like that and now i just want to add a couple of really small bits of this orange well i'm trying [Music] to not add too much one more one more okay that's how it looks right now i'm not sure if that's the right approach to color my molds i think i need to try something different i have one mold left let's try what can we try i actually really like the combination of the mermaid and the green perry dough and so i think i will just use those two colors yeah let's try that okay that's something i like way more just because it looks more like as a unity or i don't know how to say um but let's fill this with chocolate and then we see how they turn out i have just tempered my chocolate and now i will mold ah yeah mold my chocolate into my molds now i'm trying to release all the air bubbles and i like to use two uh tablecloth because otherwise my neighbors would hate me thanks for watching my video i hope you liked it and hit the subscribe button follow me on instagram my chocolates feel and yeah have

perfect as a Halloween favor or to give to a trick-or-treater before we get started these are the items you will need to get started you're going to first get a piece of tape and tape your crepe paper to the back of your candy bar like this and then you're going to gradually wrap this crepe paper around the bar overlapping so that's very close together when you get down to the end lip it over tape it into position now the last thing that you need to do is find two of your little layers separate them and we're going to glue our eyes in there press those into position and there you are we've got

if they can eat this thing in one sitting because I think it's impossible you might die oh good I think each bite is like probably more than half of a regular purchase candy bar but I just wanted to show you this there's no way that I'm going to even attempt to eat the whole thing because it is huge and delicious but challenge some competitive eaters try to eat this thing and once it does I don't think it can be done I've had my fill of it for now I'm gonna wrap it back up back up fingers but I thought serious with you I bought it because I thought it was cool and I hope you enjoyed the video so I'll talk to you later take it easy", "CtxSIsfSVVg": "our body welcome to another great episode of hillbilly select reviews today I got something cool something different something you're gonna love maybe not as much as I'm gonna love it but you know maybe but because I'm actually getting the taste the hands we got go on let me show you what we got going on now see that Jack Daniels original recipe Tennessee honey and Jack Daniels old number seven Tennessee whiskey one says finest Swiss milk chocolate with Jack Daniel's Tennessee honey liqueur syrup center and the other is finest Swiss milk chocolate with Jack Daniels Tennessee whiskey syrup Center now they actually have proof stone okay this is nine point five percent this is 8.5% ABV it's the both of them it is the cess filled with them with the whiskey with the whiskey syrup and one two three four fourth ingredient listed is the liquor so what is the difference now of the taste between the honey and the regular Jack Daniels are they both good is one better than the other should I do one review at a time get to reduce out of that and that's what everybody else will do but this is hillbilly selective use well what do I do here yes of course I go above and beyond all right let's see we got going on here so you all want to know if this delicious don't do that nice in foil that is the regular here is the honey what color will the tin foil be tinfoil is the same let's open up the honey which sealed up pretty good right enough to tear it tearing it there it is look at that look at that we smell that click research breakthrough that delicious milk now this is the regular get off the tear the foil here it is nice bar some broken little big deal hmm smells different that one smells like a wood barrel with the whiskey row does let's try the regular first it's delicious it's absolutely delicious there's also like a crunch like a Nestle Crunch somewhere in there and the milk chocolate is delicious and that bourbon syrup is absolutely out of this world and when you put the Bourbon and that wood and that smokiness in that bourbon with that chocolate it is fantastic that's fantastic it's good they didn't skimp on it all right it's gonna be the honey Wow Wow hmm again there's something crunch in there like a race car now Rice Krispie a YUM Nestle Crunch what the milk chocolate is good for he's always like dark trouble but always but this milk chocolate is delicious that Center is strong it's even stronger than the jack the regular Jack it was a higher proof percentage it's good man I'm telling you I think people who like candy would like this and I think people who like whiskey would love this this is a great whiskey man this is a great whiskey to sip with with whisper great candy to sit with whiskey especially Jack Daniels but any kind of bourbon it's going to be great with coffee unbelievable it would go great with a piper cigar okay because it's that strong it's not over pets good it's really good I don't want to eat it all but I'm gonna eat one more I mean one let's look let's see what the inside looks like all right look can't really think you can really shape up and tripped out it's a clear look mmm I'm really good that's a really good man if you know any person I'll get it yourself you know any whiskey rubbish and I'm thinking about 10 up right now that I watch on YouTube I think he'd like this man Oh I are both outstanding guess you are not birthdays that I think they sponsored then you give it to me okay good real good I will buy it again I love it they hit a homer with this I've done a couple of coffee reviews with bourbon and some of them are really good and some of them were you know you couldn't taste the flavor the bourbon didn't come through so I hope he's okay but I want to taste that Burman I did one with wine so the beans are soaked in wine actually can't do that was really good that's on my Sunday morning coffee juice anyway I don't throw in a chocolate review because of the liquor aspect of it and I'm gonna tell you something it's good it really is good I'm surprised I didn't think it would be this for a night but it is that that chocolate is really good and that that done the liquor taste is really good and when you combine the both of them they've done a a great job they've done a good job with this so that's all I can call you said no search it out this was the jack down I'll look for other ones and see if they've if they've done well you know what I did do I did do bourbon balls I think with three or four Bourbons and now that I think about it I have those videos on there and it was like can't remember what Bourbons maybe Evan Williams maker's mark old fuscia I'm not sure I think was three maybe four Bourbons than I did the bourbon balls and they were good but they weren't this good this really came through the bourbon ones I think I did four and there were different bearing of how much the Bourbon came to the Bourbon came through and all they were really good but I think this is better and I'm shocked and bourbon balls are big thing in Kentucky but yeah this is good so anyway from Hill

cup of dried shredded coconut 3/4 a cup of agave nectar 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract 3 tablespoons of sea salt the first step to this recipe is to combine the coconut oil a Gulf nectar pure vanilla extract and a pinch of sea salt in a small blender once you're done with that we're going to then take our dried coconut and a half a cup at a time we're going to add it to the mixture and blend that until it's smooth now that the mixture is smooth we're going to slowly add our dried coconut about 1/2 a cup at a time and we're going to continue to blend this mixture until it's nice and smooth now that our mixture is nice and smooth we're going to take it and add it to the cocoa powder and continue to mix evenly now that our batter is nice and smooth we're going to go ahead and put it into a glass pan and spread evenly once the batter is spread evenly in the pan we're then going to top it with sea salt now that the dark chocolate has been evenly spread in the pan and sprinkled with sea

bars first of all we're going to Twix don't know if you get these in your country or if you get different types let me know in the comments there's quite small in a lot longer the fingers were longer it's 50 grams now 25 grams each so that's that they've got a cabbage twirl not support three grams and weird and you've got a ton of caramel wait for biscuit last but not least a KitKat you come you probably get them in your country so I know that they they get around a bit and then notorious b.i.g so now I'm gonna add a dash of milk it's really hard to film I'm a build house or a lot more team very strong it's a little bit too strong for me well there you have it I didn't show you me squeezing the tea max it's hard to hold the camera and film right so first of all we're going to find the classic I know this works all this weed is oak why are penguins good at racing car drivers because they are always in pole position I know this one works to the twice before and also it I think most people tried it you can get me in Australia they're called Tim Tams usually the way people do it is you bite the corners off Usopp DT through it hmm oh yeah office has dropped an old inside Wow hmm

chocolate side a bit like a flake if you've ever had a flake now this should work mmm nothing work quite well chocolate next up I'm going for Twix and one of the seen habit you know what I mean since I'd twitch a bit like a bit of biscuit top with caramel wrapped in chocolate and this one should should also work because it will should tea should time between the biscuit he goes mmm oh that one works surprisingly well oh and a biscuit inside is just disintegrated I feel quite sick and I'll push forward for you guys next up and going for you want to do whispered oldest Caroline as well come inside a whisper solid chocolate but with air bubbles in the chocolate I don't think listen see no next one and the last one KitKat Butantan good probably used to the thin slender fingers but I like a

loved by all ages and that's doctored bars from mmm these dockland bars have been recently launched by eminem and come in five different variants which are peanut milk chocolate crispy almond and crispy mint we all know Eminem for its candy shell chocolates and now they have these chocolate bars I got the three variants out of five and these are almond crispy and peanut then by milk chocolate and mint as I already have a pack of milk chocolate candies and I don't like the mint flavor the packaging is colorful attractive and has a brief description of the product basically these are milk chocolates with M&M minis and almonds peanuts or rice crisps the cost of each bar is two dollars and forty-seven cents the almond chocolate bar is off-white in color and is of 110 grams with 200 calories for serving there are three servings per back the back of each bath has a nutritional information and the ingredients list it also states imported by Maas Canada but does not mention where it was it manufactured which is weird the second pack is milk chocolate with rice crisps and it is of 107 grams with 190 calories per serving the back has almost the same information like nutrition including lists and the customer care details the third is mint chocolate with peanuts and is of 110 grams and 200 calories per serving if you see the packaging it's very attractive with cartoon characters and vibrant colors the color combination and graphics are appealing the off-white base has blue graphics the blue base has orange graphics and the yellow has the yellow graphics with different expressions you can't miss them when going through the store and that's what happened to me the plastic wrapping is also of good quality and pretty thick and I'm going to open the pack and show the contents Wow the bar looks too good with pretty cartoon character or visible M&M minis and bite sized chocolate blocks with M mentioned on them the milk chocolate seems to be a very good quality and it has started melting while I'm holding it it's soft and smooth the almond bits are all over the bar and you can see their presence from the back now you can see the bar from inside it has almond bits and M&M minis let me drive one of these the chocolate is sweet and a proper milk chocolate it simply melted in my mouth next is rice crisps it has a lot of crisps on the back of the bar the front is same as like almond bar the minis are of different colors and here you can see that the bar actually has got a lot of minis inside I'm trying this now it's crunchy because of rice crisps and tastes good the third pack is peanuts and you can see peanut halves all over the bar I'm not trying this one the peanut is of very good quality they have placed peanut halves and they are quite fresh they give a crunch and taste good the male chocolate is very smooth milky and somewhat similar but better than a milk Abbar also the M&M candies are of this size and those in the bar are minis which are quite smaller than the regular ones now if you ask me which one is better then it's a difficult choice maybe because I like nuts I would rate almond one then peanuts and rice crisps if you love rice crisps then you would certainly like this peanut lovers should definitely try the peanut bar I wish they also come up with a dark chocolate variant hope you liked this short colorful chocolatier if you do like and subscribe to my channel if you still haven't and I will see you soon with a new video till then all you need is love but a little chocolate now and then doesn't hurt bye

party ideas with you guys I've got a winter wonderland theme and a really cool brunch theme I've also got a very sophisticated wine and cheese party coming and of course we'll wrap things up with a fantastic New Year's party all of these parties have a crepe menu tasty drinks and of course a lot of great DIYs that you can do at home so be sure to stay tuned because I'm going to be sharing inspired entertaining ideas for the rest of the month and today I'm kicking things off with my take on a hot chocolate bar and I think it's pretty epic it's cozy and cuddly and snuggly and the theme is all about warming up so I thought it would be fun to start with a nice knit blanket instead of a tablecloth no of course this is not a blanket that I am particularly attached to because anything could spill on it but I do love how it kind of sets the stage for this party I'm also adding some plush cushions that I think looks super cute and to add a little more character I also put out some mittens and some earmuffs because I think they work really really well with our cozy winter themed [Music] next to stick with my cozy theme I thought it would be fun to incorporate some Nordic patterns into my decor so what I did was actually purchase a pair of kids tights you can definitely do this at a thrift shop if you wanted to or just an inexpensive pair of tights will work I simply snipped off a piece of the fabric and then stretched it over a dollar store bought then I just filled the baws with some pretty festive flowers I found at my supermarket and there you go how adorable is that for a little illumination I also added these cute red lanterns after all I didn't want any exposed candles around all of this fabric once the stage is set it's time to get started on my hot chocolate bar I started by pouring some hot milk into a carafe so it stays warm throughout the party next I put out some traditional hot chocolate powder but I didn't want to stop there I really wanted to make it special so I added an assortment of chocolate chips and let's be honest I didn't just stop a chocolate I also added some butterscotch chips and some peanut butter chips for good measure if you find yourself short on mugs like I did you can go ahead and use mason jars with these cozy little sleeves I'm just using some socks that I found at the dollar store I just cut off the top of the socks and then shimmied them down these are so super simple and I really think they totally work with this theme then I made these festive stir sticks by cutting out these adorable labels and taping them to some wooden stir sticks these labels and all of the fun signs you see in today's video are available in our Etsy store so if you want to find them you can take a look the link is in the description box below and then it's all about the flavors and of course the possibilities here are endless you could go traditional with things like peppermint sticks or get a little spicy with some cayenne pepper cayenne and chocolate or a match made in heaven if you haven't tried it yet I highly recommend you do the variety here is what it's all about I also put out some more traditional toppings like chocolate sauce and caramel sauce and whipped cream and for the adults in the room I thought it would be nice to put out a few flavored liqueurs I like some hazelnut coffee and Irish Cream Liqueur ''s all go really really nicely with a cup of hot chocolate but you know what goes even better with hot chocolate cookies a whole lot of cookies once again variety is what it's all about here you want to use lots of different flavors and textures I love all of these cookies but I am especially fond of these adorable snowmen and of course because I'm all about options I thought it would be nice to round out all of that cookie goodness with some milk speaking of cookies I did want to mention that I will actually be sharing a brand new cookie recipe every day this month on both Instagram and snapchat so if you're not following me I really think you should because there's gonna be a lot of cookies I've also compiled all of these tasty recipes in my brand new 25 days of

all about it coming up next on the sugar geeks show so what is chocolate chocolate actually consists of two important things cocoa solids and cocoa butter cocoa butter is the part of the chocolate that turns liquid when you heat it and when chocolate is tempered it has a crystalline structure that aligns perfectly and makes chocolate have that shine released from mold has a snap when you bite into it and when you melt chocolate that crystalline structure gets demolished and as chocolate cools that crystalline structure is gonna start developing again but we want to control how those crystals come together so let's imagine that this is chocolate it's all tempered and everything is aligned this is the cocoa solids and this is the cocoa butter this is what we want our chocolate to be but when you melt chocolate we're separating the cocoa butter from the cocoa solids so as the chocolate is cooling the cocoa butter and the cocoa solids are gonna want to come together and recreate a crystalline form any way that they can but we want to control that and only let it form the crystals that we want it to form at a hundred degrees at 90 degrees at 95 degrees all of these different temperatures these crystalline structures are going to start forming and we want to control that and the way we control it is through agitation so as those crystals start forming at a hundred degrees nope not the right crystals let's stir stir stir stop those crystals from forming and then when it gets to 95 degrees that is where the right crystals are gonna start forming the tempered chocolate crystals and magic crystals so it's really important that you add you get your chocolate up until the point that it starts developing these crystals and then we want to cool the chocolate all the way down to 79 degrees to give time for those crystals to fully develop and to grow the stronger these crystals are the better your chocolate is going to be tempered now how do we get those crystals to form properly I'm going to show you three different ways that you can for your chocolate important thing to note when we're talking about this form of temporary and chocolate we're talking about semi-sweet or dark chocolate if you're working with milk chocolate or white chocolate that you're gonna work at very slightly different temperatures those are listed on the blog post so what type of chocolate is best for tempering well basically you're going to need something that is real chocolate what do I mean by real chocolate I mean it has to have cocoa butter in it there's basically two types of chocolate compound chocolate and real chocolate compound chocolate is gonna have other things in it besides cocoa butter like vegetable oil hydrogenated palm kernel oil basically things that aren't cocoa butter and the reason that compound chocolate exists is because you can just melt it and it will harden up all on its own but it's not going to release from a chocolate mold like real chocolate is going to release so you can use it for cake pop so you can use it to make water ganache you can even use it to make ganache to frost a cake but it's not going to be good for using in candy molds the other thing is real chocolate melts basically at body temperatures so when you put a piece of beautifully tempered delicious chocolate in your mouth mouth is watering it's gonna melt on your tongue and just like have that really great mouthfeel compound chocolate melts at about a hundred degrees so you actually have to chew it to consume it so it doesn't have exactly the same sort of like you know mouthfeel but does anybody else notice that me probably not so you might think that you can tell if chocolate is real chocolate or fake chocolate like if it comes in a candy bar oh it must be real not necessarily always check the ingredients if it has cocoa butter in it it's real chocolate hahaha alright so for a tempering or chocolate we need some very simple tools the most important one being our spatula this spatula has a thermometer built into it so it's going to help us keep an eye on how hard our chocolate is at all times secondly we're going to be using a silicone bowl or a plastic bowl is fine just so that it doesn't trap any heat in the bowl and we keep all of the temperature controlling in the chocolate if you're using any method besides the microwave version of temporary and chocolate you're going to need a double boiler and then lastly you're just going to want a knife to chop up your chocolate into small pieces or you can use a grater if you're using a bar so the first way is called the seeding method this is the most common way of tempering chocolate and is the most difficult in my opinion because it takes so long basically you take a large amount of chocolate and you melt it down usually over a double boiler until it reaches about 115 degrees no more than 120 you don't want to burn it and then we want to start cooling that chocolate down and the way that we cool it is by adding in more chocolate that hasn't been melted this first part of the chocolate is just to help cool it down we're stirring we're stirring st. crystals don't develop yet we're just cooling cooling cooling cooling this can take a little while which is why it's not my favorite method but once you get to 95 degrees you want to make sure that there are a few bits of unmelted tempered chocolate in that bowl because those tempered crystals attached to the untempered crystals and make everything tempered again at 95 degrees so it's really important to be agitating your chocolate until you get to that point and then we're going to cool the chocolate all the way down to 79 degrees still continuing to agitate occasionally to just make sure the temperature of the chocolate is consistent inside and outside and then once we get down to 79 degrees you're gonna take a little of that chocolate place it in the fridge let it cool for five minutes and then do a test okay so this is our hopefully tempered chocolate when I peel it off the parchment it should release very cleanly no residue so if this is tempered it should have a snap oh yes you see how how sharp that break is that is tempered chocolate it's shiny that way I know it's going to release from the molds if it's not tempered this is chocolate that I know is not tempered I just melted it and poured it on to the parchment here when you peel it off it leaves a residue it's not clean it's a dull it's not shiny and then when you go to break it it literally will not snap it just bends very sad so this is a good way of knowing if it's tempered or not if it's not tempered just heat this back up to 94 degrees add in some more chopped chocolate to reseed it and cool it to 84 if it is tempered then you want to go ahead and heat it up to 85 90 degrees no more than 95 degrees otherwise you are going to ruin all of those crystals that you just spent all that time growing method to is using something called beta crystals which is something you can buy on Amazon and I'll put the link on the blog post but basically what this is is a freeze-dried tempered cocoa butter so you can just melt down your chocolate cool it to 95 degrees and add in a couple of scoops of these beta crystals and it will immediately start forming those crystalline structures and because it's freeze-dried and like this powder it just melts really quickly and it's kind of like a foolproof way of tempering your chocolate but the same process heating to 115 cooling to 95 adding her beta crystals cool all the way down to 79 and then heat back up to 85 90 degrees for workability boom boom boom the last method the most important method the method I literally just learned so yeah now you know my secret I learned something and then I just teach it to you tempering in the microwave so I didn't even I've heard of this process I didn't understand it because it just seems so easy that I'm like there's no way that this was possibly work and I tried it and it did I couldn't believe it so we already know that crystals develop at 95 degrees and they get at 95 degrees in theory you can melt your chocolate and as long as it never goes above 95 degrees you do not ruin those crystals that make the tempered chocolate tempered but how do you melt chocolate without ruining you know those crystals the microwave so I'm going to show you how to do that so to temper in the microwave we're gonna place 12 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate I'm using Callebaut I'll put the link to the type of chocolate that I'm using in the blogpost and we're going to chop this chocolate up finely this is important especially if it's a big bar you want to grade it the smaller the piece is the easier it's going to melt and the less chances you will have of accidentally heating it to cockt we're going to put this chocolate into a plastic or a silicone bowl so that it doesn't get too hot usually you would melt chocolate on a double boiler but the glass really holds on to heat so that's gonna ruin our temper we don't want to use glass so we're gonna start with 30 seconds and then stir and then 30 seconds again and stir and then we're gonna do 15 seconds and then we're going to do 10 seconds and the second you see that most of your chocolate is melted you don't heat it more just keep mixing until it's all melted I'm using my spatula it has a thermometer in it that's gonna help me keep an eye on the chocolate to make sure it's not getting above 90 degrees this is like my safe zone because inevitably you might accidentally go up to 92 so if you don't get past 95 you're probably going to be okay but I say stay under 90 for your safety because if it's above 95 and that can happen very easily then the temper is ruined so what happens if you accidentally overheat your chocolate which definitely will probably happen at some point don't worry your chocolates not ruined it's just that the temper is broken so go ahead and use one of the other two methods like the seeding method or the beta crystals to get your chocolate back in temper so once your chocolate is melted its tempered it's already tempered we never ruined the temper one thing to note is that this really only works for small amounts of chocolate if you need to temper a huge amount of chocolate you're probably gonna have to use the seeding method or the beta crystals but for little small molds and little simple candies this is the perfect way to temper chocolate once you're done making all of your fancy chocolates and stuff you might have leftover chocolate what I do is I take this tempered chocolate and pour it on to some plastic wrap or some parchment spread it out thin let it set up and then break it up into small pieces so that I can use this tempered chocolate again so now that your chocolate is tempered you can go ahead and use it for candy molds to make chocolate spheres or you can use it to just pipe out fun stars and hearts like I do for my daughter Avalon to use as treats or being a good girl hey everyone oh look what I got you want a chocolate star yeah I don't know did you get did you feed the guinea pigs yeah did you give them their pellets did you eat all your breakfast yes okay well then I think you get a chocolate star oh of course you picked the big one she knows what she's doing yeah good job so that's how you temper chocolate hopefully you guys have enjoyed this video new videos every Tuesday don't forget to subscribe", "Ij5LJIEmc-I": "Welcome all!  Papa G here.  Today I present\na different and unique way to make your own chocolate.  Using only three\ningredients, this very easy recipe can be used as chocolate chips in your\nfavorite cookie or brownie recipe or enjoy it on its own it's a delicious\nchocolate candy.  It also has a fraction of a net carbohydrates as some of the premade\nlow  carbohydrate chocolate found in stores.  Let me show you what I mean.  Now I love to\nuse Lilly's chocolate when I bake, but it can be a bit pricey and when we look at\nthe macros, you'll see that 14 grams, which is just about a half an ounce, has a\ntotal of eight total carbohydrates; and when we subtract the fiber and the sugar\nalcohols we end up with three grams of net carbohydrates.  while low, it's more than\nthree and a half times the net carbohydrates in this recipe.  As I said, we'll only need\nthree ingredients... coconut oil, unsweetened cocoa powder, and a liquid\nsugar substitute.  You'll also need a silicon mould for shaping your chocolate. \nAny size and shape mold will work.  I'm using one here to make some chocolate\nchips.  I find using a pourable microwave safe measuring cup to be very helpful\nwhen making this recipe.  Put a half a cup of coconut oil into the measuring cup\nand microwave for about 20 to 40 seconds, or until the oil is melted.  Add a liquid\nsugar substitute equal to 3/4 of a cup of regular sugar.  This amount of\nsweetener will give you a sweetness level on par with semi-sweet chocolate. Add a half a cup of unsweetened cocoa\npowder and mix well to stir.  I like to run the spoon against the sides to help\nbreak up any clumping. This recipe makes just a little less\nthan 5 ounces or a total of 135 grams of chocolate.  Once the cocoa powder has\nfully been incorporated into the coconut oil, test for sweetness and add more if\nyou desire a sweeter chocolate.  Pour the liquid\nchocolate into the mold of your choosing and place in the freezer for 30 minutes\nto help set quicker.  When the chocolate hardens removed from the mold and place\nin a container for storage in the refrigerator.  There you have it folks!  My\nvery simple, three ingredient low carbohydrate homemade chocolate.  A recipe that's easy\nto make and can be used for any recipe that calls for semi-sweet chocolate - or\nsimply enjoy it on its own.  I hope you enjoyed this video.

doing welcome back today we've got a big appointment to check out the ender dragon we got at a point but we got to visit the ender dragon the ender dragon needs a big favor it wants to be extincted removed from the world gone forever i think i can actually help better drag it out so today that's the plan welcome back to the minecraft guide everybody episode number 20. today's the day the world is changing forever we're going into the end if you couldn't tell yet and taking out the underdrag and after that the end is opened up and actually uh this base is goodbye this right here is the final glimpse that you will ever get oh okay that's not true we're gonna probably be back here in two hours and stuff but after today everything changes we're moving from this base we're gonna do different projects it's gonna be sweet ender dragon fight today now to open today's episode we're actually going to start with a tiny bit of crafting we've never made an ender chest in this world quite yet which is kind of weird i feel like now would be the perfect time we could actually probably use an ender chest to lay out all of the dragon removing supplies pretty cleanly so ender chess what is it well this is what it is right here an ender chest is basically a portable chest it's also kind of like a backpack so check this out i put a sword in here i back out of the under chest then i mine it now if you're gonna mine an under chest and you want to pick it up which you probably do you need silk touch um this iron pickaxe is my only silk touch pickaxe okay don't judge anyways i picked up the under chest i place it back down boom the sword is still in the chest we can use the ender chest to basically double the size of our inventory it's pretty sweet but today we could also use the ender chest to cleanly lay out all of the supplies for taking out the dragon first though before we talk supplies let's talk dragon fight what is it well the ender dragon fight is basically minecraft's end but actually no no not at all once you take the ender dragon out the game is over kind of the credits rule but there's more content after taking out the dragon fight after you beat the ender dragon in your world your world is literally not over definitely not after we beat the ender dragon a gateway will appear which is basically a fast track to the outer end inside of the outer end we can find end cities and inside event cities shulker boxes elytra good loot so to advance your world you need to take out one of minecraft's bosses the ender dragon it's honestly not that bad like i said once we take out the edit dragon we're moving on to bigger better things now let's talk supplies i'm going to go ahead and put all of the supplies in this chest so everything is nice and organized first things first a good armor honestly this armor is way overkill for the ender dragon fight but bonus points if you can get feather falling on your boots feather falling will help um the ender dragon fight some of it could happen in the air like you could get thrown up into the air and you could fall it would be really really bad so uh yeah feather falling will help protect you from fall damage but of course you shouldn't just have good armor you're also going to need good weapons too so this sword right here that's pretty sacked that should definitely be good this bow right here it's not exactly stacked but it has everything that we need now technically you could cheap out on the up close weapon you could take out the dragon without landing a single up close hit and that's actually usually how i do it so if you don't want to take the time to build a really good sword just get a really really good boat like we're talking about even better than this bring a mining tool into the end with you big bonus points if that mining tool is sped up there is obsidian in the end and just blocks the dragon is going to be attacking you at all times so if you can mine a little bit faster definitely a good thing bring a bed but don't take the bed into the end you're going to want to put the bed inside of the stronghold and set your spawn if something bad happens which nothing will happen to us but if something bad did happen and you were already at the stronghold you could jump right back into the action potions totally optional but if you want to be over prepared potions now if you're going to only bring one type of potion i highly recommend the potion of slow falling if you drink this thing you will fall slower and be immune to fall damage that is huge in the dragon fight potions of strength might also help and night vision potions so you can see a whole lot better any kind of health potion is also a good call water bucket definitely bring a water bucket with you to the end fight you can use this water bucket to keep both enderman and fall damage away building blocks bring at least three stacks of building blocks with you into the end could be literally anything but building blocks definitely have some on hand and then finally the last two supplies that i recommend bringing with you into the end are both optional glass bottles if you want to bring dragon's breath back home with you then maybe uh consider bringing some glass bottles if you want to bring this stuff home this is the only way and then i actually kind of embarrassingly the final supply which i didn't want to have anyways i don't have any of pumpkins if you're afraid of endermen and you don't want to fight them then wear a pumpkin helmet now a big downside to the pumpkin it puts a big giant like blur blackade thing in your screen it makes it really hard to see you could use a texture pack to remove that though if you're looking for a pumpkin try checking any planes biomes usually pumpkins generating clusters inside of the plains biome i have pumpkin seeds but i never grew pumpkins so i'm really not that worried about it so one final look at all of my ender dragon supplies this stuff right here plus whatever is in my inventory too so that's what you should probably grab if you get all the stuff you'll be way more than prepared for the dragon fight after that it's time to find the stronghold stronghold check i want to play a game elites go down to the comments right now take a guess how many times am i hitting that respawn button during the dragon fight spoiler alert zero zero is gonna be the answer i can't fail today now i forgot two things um i a vendor if you want to go into the end which you probably do if you want to take the dragon out you need these things you have to activate the portal these are the key the ticket to activating the portal also kind of goes unspoken here but uh arrows if you're gonna bring a ranged weapon which you need to you need ammo so don't forget your ammo now once you've gotten into the stronghold place a bed down somewhere near the portal uh the portal is right down there we're gonna put a bed up here that's perfect uh sleep if you have to definitely at least set your spawn in the stronghold though this is just in case of emergencies i don't need it but we're gonna do it anyways okay yeah now i have this chest i'm gonna put this chest down leave the extra food in here and the extra blocks after that we're going to go ahead and organize the hot bar we need the weapons on the hop bar the food on the hot bar extra blocks for sure the mining tool i'm going to put this over here definitely keep your hot bar organized water buckets should definitely be on the hot bar at all times during this fight finally we're going to put our eye a vendor right there and then we're gonna put potions on this hot bar as well so uh no more delay elites let's go we need to move into this room watch out for the silverfish spawner take it out if you want or keep it if you want i like to keep spotter so i'm gonna keep it if you keep it they're going to be annoying so move fast fill in your portal let's go let's go let's go let's go boom okay extra eye i don't want to bring that with me so we're going to go ahead and leave that there and now it's time now we need to be ready to move right off the bat if we get unlucky we're going to be over the void let's get lucky oh we're lucky okay nice so two options here option number one you end up getting lucky if you're lucky you're inside of a box that looks like this to take on the dragon dig up option number two if you're unlucky you're out over the void if you're over the void you know you need to build right away get over to the island asap don't stand on this platform if you're in the void but we're not out of the void we got so lucky so let's go ahead and start things off with a potion of night vision now we can see a whole lot more clearly we'll have the glass bottles ready the rest of the inventory totally forgot to organize that actually we're just gonna do that really quick blocks over there potions over there okay now we need to dig up let's just dig up right here and as soon as we hit the surface at the end we're gonna see a lot of endermen and we're gonna see pillars we need to dodge the enderman don't look at them and move inside of the pillars asap stat when fighting the dragon stay inside of the pillars at all times uh the pillars are those things right there why should you stay inside of there well easy the void is on the outside of the end island and yeah inside of the pillars usually you're farther away from the void if you fall into the void everything is gone you've lost it all you're done fighting the dragon for the day don't fall into the boy now the dragon fight has two phases and phase number one we need to take these crystals out so the dragon can't heal itself after phase number one we need to take the dragon out but the dragon has landed already we're gonna go ahead and just preemptively drink this thing after the dragon lands every time it will charge you and when it charges you sometimes you're thrown into the air potion of slow falling makes it easy we don't take any fall damage perfect so uh like i said phase one we need to take out the regen crystals the end crystals these things up there are the end crystals take them out with a bow just shoot the crystals out all you need to do is hit the crystal once and it explodes if the dragon is near it the dragon will take some damage which is pretty cool and crystal number one boom there will be a crystal on top of every single pillar now the dragon will be shooting at you while you're doing this this breath is terrible dragon's breath right here if you want to bring this stuff home glass bottles you need to pick it up just like this now uh this is the only way to get dragon's breath so if you want it think about it get it now we don't have any use for it though so we don't need to keep it on the hop bar stop shooting at me dragon stop shooting at me one more bottle thank you very much there will be a crystal on top of every single obsidian pillar you need to take out every single crystal otherwise you're gonna have a hard time also don't look at the enderman avoid the enderman's eyes at all cost uh hi crystal can you please go away let's go crystal i know you're hiding up there let's go let's go let's go boom you're gone okay perfect next one this one right there almost so close so close let's go away always while you're fighting the dragon keep tabs on it always know where the dragon is at all times you need to know if the dragon's in the middle because of the dragons in the middle that means the charge is next no two of your crystals will be caged in boxed in to take the crystals out you're either gonna need to a have like crazy aim and hit a really really tight angle uh you can actually shoot in here or just climb up here take out the iron bars now it sounds like the dragon is actually landing so we're gonna go ahead and jump off of that thing and go back towards the middle because after it lands it's gonna charge why did i take damage that was weird all right any minute here let's go let's go let's go we dodged the dragon oh okay it doesn't matter now if i didn't have the potion of slow falling water right there enderman's mad at me dump water down stand in the water and take the enderman out come on over here enderman let's go let's go bite me bite me what's wrong enderman you don't like the water oh that's for you poor you you don't like water that's too bad oh yeah my sword has fire aspect so the end of it's not burning great oy buddy you want to leave me alone you want to leave me alone i'm trying to get stuff done here leave me alone enderman let's go let's go uh who's mad at me is it just you i think it's just you and the dragons landed okay we need to eat actually we can't have our health that low when the dragon charges me water come back with me enderman not a problem dragon little problem oh thanks for taking that out dragon you're you're my best friend hey anyways so back to this crystal let's get rid of that boom there we go any iron bars free iron bars please uh okay doesn't look like it no iron bars that's fine not a big deal hey next crystal let's go let's go let's go let's go you're high up boom not anymore okay perfect now i have one over there on that one uh not anymore and now it's just that one okay perfect my aiming is on point today this is awesome the better your aim the faster this is going to go now we're gonna go ahead and tower up again and just break a couple iron bars on the corner and then we'll jump down and shoot this crystal it'll be gone then the dragon will basically be gone too here we go take two out two is always my secret we land over here and boom amanda boom i meant boom i meant boom wait for it but the dragon's gonna charge me any minute here yep yeah nice dodge though come on dragon you're better than that i think an enderman is mad at me again though maybe um okay maybe not but anyways impressively all of the crystals i think are actually now gone which means dragon fight phase two dragon goodbye either a shoot the dragon with your bow if you're going to do that lead your shots off or b wait for the dragon to land run up to it and hit it with your sword many many times the dragon will take off again then basically just repeat the process over and over and over again now when the dragon does land in the middle be careful don't get too close to it it deals a lot of damage also bow doesn't work while it's in the middle so i want to show you another way to dodge the dragon really quick we're gonna back off and wait for the dragon to realize that we're standing around over here come on dragon come on come on come on i'm not doing anything i'm just standing out in the open oh no all right so post of the soul following actually ran out we'll drink that just in case but watch this ender pearl dodge the dragon uh don't throw a headed enderman though that was a little bit of a fail admittedly that didn't go as planned me and you enderman let's go get back over here what's wrong with the water every time you charge the water you teleport what's wrong oh yeah you're weak to the water that's right come on i dragon's breath in my water though that's not good we're gonna take the water and we're just gonna move now dragon you have to go away you're causing me like problems big time let's go stop spinning stop spinning the potion of slow falling is honestly like huge clutch here it really uh takes out all worry about like being thrown into the air because it's really not a problem you just need to make sure your health isn't too low when the dragon charges you because sometimes it can pack like a lot of punch it can deal a lot of damage let's go dragon come on come on you're making me miss all of my shots dude not cool not cool dude i'm gonna run out of arrows oh wait that's right i can't run out of arrows because infinity bow infinity bows are better than bending bow no matter what you say you're just wrong if you say anything else infinity bow it's always better all right let's go dragon let's go let's go let's go we land a couple hits nice nice nice now we want to stay away from its head definitely don't go near the head uh you all right we jump up and hit it nice and i'm just gonna back off i don't know when it's gonna charge we're gonna use the pearl though this time for real and dodge it uh the night vision though it's gonna go away you have to go away right now come on come on come on come on come on not now not now we'll just drink that boom problem solved let's go dragon charge all right pearl easy away from you nice dodge too easy and it's time to take the dragon out again with the bow now honestly i prefer taking the dragon out with the bow because there's like almost no risk involved if you want to you can run up on the dragon and hit it but honestly honestly i feel like the sword doesn't do as much damage as the bow the bow can take a pretty decent chunk of the dragon's health away one hit at a time meanwhile the sword yeah it's just not worth the risk really to be honest to be 100 real i feel like the ender dragon fight needs a revamp i mean it's kind of like predictable and actually not that like difficult at all i mean the better your aim the easier the fight but yeah it's really not that hard for a boss fight potion of strength we brought this let's go ahead and just try this out we'll charge the dragon right here and try and land a hit don't go to the head the head is dangerous definitely dangerous here we go we land a couple hits on this guy and now we'll go ahead and give the dragon some space should charge any second here come on come on don't make you regret backing up all right it's charging this time we'll just do this boom okay come on dragon really that's all you have come on this is a boss fight let's go dragon all right here we are the final leg of this fight couple more shots on this dragon and it's gone forever it's go time dragon it's now or never come on if you want to do anything to me any damage at all this is your chance land in the middle right now beast land in the middle and take me out come on i'm standing right by the portal right in the center come on and i'm not even hitting you these are all warning shots dragon i warn you these are all warning shots oh where'd you go come on come on not out of render distance no let's go dragging right to the middle come on come on let's go come on dragon me and you just me and you land in the middle come on it's definitely worth it definitely safe i'm not gonna do anything to you no i would never definitely wouldn't run up here behind the dragon just jump up and hit it a couple times no way no way i wouldn't do that never i'm friends with the dragon oh wait that's not the case here that's not the wait what's happening what's happening what's happening oh enderman come on this is like a really bad time it was meant to be a special moment come on like seriously you had to ruin that moment i don't get that moment back that was like really no just go yeah exactly and so that right there elites is the ender dragon fight that's right zero death so yeah zero in this world ever yep exactly don't think about it now after you take the dragon out you're gonna get a ton of experience run around and pick up that experience oh yes look at that that's amazing now on top of this portal right here we have something special that special thing is this egg right there that egg is the ender dragon egg i want to bring that home with me so we're going to go ahead and hit the egg it's going to fall and oh my gosh it actually fell into the portal that means it's over in the overworld already usually that won't happen normally it'll like teleport somewhere and then you have to like mine out a block under i'll show you in the overwhelm but wow no way that's crazy that's the first time that's ever after me endeavor then all of my years of playing minecraft oh ho but there we go the ender dragon fight ender dragon done and now we can definitely respawn the dragon we'll do that later but we're gonna leave endermen are mad at me because i was staring now uh here we go roll the credits so we could sit and read through the credits they're actually kind of cool it tells the story but uh we could also just skip the credits boom there we go we skip it now we have to go find that dragon egg i have a feeling i think it went back to the world spawn i'm not 100 sure though because that's never happened to me but it should be back over at the world spawn i i think hopefully let's go to spawn the ender dragonfight if you're prepared or even better over prepared the fight is gonna be really really easy it's gonna be a breeze full netherright way way over prepared with all those potions too yeah that dragon literally never even stood a chance that was easy after taking out the dragon when you jump into that portal like we just did a second ago you'll be sent back to your spawn wherever it was set last if it wasn't set anywhere or if it was missing you'll be sent all the way back to your world spawn now our world spawn is right over here hopefully this is where the dragon egg is because if it's not here honestly i'm not sure where it's going to be uh dragon egg are you gonna be in this field anywhere uh and there's pumpkins right there if i wanted those for the dragon fight nice all right uh dragon egg where is the dragon egg please don't tell me i'm gonna have to hit the respawn button myself there's no way i'm gonna do that no way not a chance in the world come on dragon egg where are you where is the world spawn actually i don't remember the exact spot hmm i know it was over here was it maybe maybe on the other side of this forest it might be it might be even farther this way i can't remember i don't think i ever marked it and i've been there twice world spawn were you over here i think it was over here i feel like this is probably more like it maybe um yeah there's sheep over here okay yeah and and the grass blocks tell me the sheep have been busy which means the sheep have been loaded in which means spawn chunks right i think this is the spawn why do i always forget the compasses are a thing if you can't find your world spawn no big deal craft a compass and follow the compass the compass will lead you to your world spawn ha-ha-ho world spawn hello ender dragon egg perfect exactly what i was looking for now we are definitely going to mark the world spawn let's do it with these end stone bricks i don't have a map on me that has world spawn so for now we'll just do that and then later when i do have a map i'll just come back and mark it i did name the banner now the ender dragon egg how do you pick up the ender dragon egg well to pick up the ender dragon egg all you're gonna need is a torch and your hand so uh find the ender dragon egg usually it'll be in the end mine the blocks out underneath it but not the block that the egg is sitting on and set the block right below that block so right there then place the torch down after that mine the blackout the egg will fall and boom item form dragon egg perfect now the dragon egg it actually does nothing it's just a decorational item but it's still cool to have it's sort of like a trophy and you know what just because why not i feel like it's a good idea we're gonna leave that bed right there uh we're just gonna have to hurry to get home but the bed at spawn probably gonna like that later today's comment of the day is a simple yet crazy complex one what build are you most proud of waddles uh huh so i really uh honestly being real love this starter house i'm like obsessed with this thing i really seriously think this build turned out like exactly like my vision which honestly doesn't actually always happen and i feel like it's just like perfect i'm gonna miss it a lot but i also loved that bamboo farm from the first season of the minecraft guide like a lot that build was probably one of my favorites ever the big pyramid was cool too from that season and then the storage building from last season but honestly maybe seriously here my starter house this time i really really am in love with it but elites that is the dragon pipe the first one this season i definitely hope to respawn the dragon later on and take it out i also plan on going back to the end and setting up a little end base too that'll be pretty cool but uh next episode will probably be all about moving somehow that's kind of a big episode so thank you all so much big time for supporting the series and watching it so far today big shout out to my patron neve thank you so much for the support until next time stay fresh i'll see you in the next episode it's been me your boy dragon deleter good bye everyone [Music] [Music] you", "LuULelZaf6Q": "subscribe to my channel and hit the bell icon so that you get notified first for all my new videos hi my lovely viewers today I'm gonna show you one of my kids favorite chocolate recipe which I'm sure even your children will love it that is Oreo dear Emily or your daily milk is very very simple to prepare at home and the end result is truly satisfying and amazing and you won't believe this is homemade I simply tried this recipe last week for my children and it came up so satisfying and so amazing so I thought to share the same recipe with you guys so over to my kitchen to see what you need for this to prepare Oreo chocolate or dairy milk here I've got this chocolate plastic mold this is very easily available in the market at any baking Supply things store and at very reasonable price also so I'll be using this today to prepare the chocolate bars next you have got this milk chocolate which have chopped into pieces in the microwave safe Bowl which I am going to melt in the microwave for about 30 seconds first stir it and again melt it for another 15 to 20 seconds or until it becomes melted smooth and glossy like this so this chocolate is nicely melted I am going to fill the chocolate molds with this melted chocolate pouring about one to two teaspoons of it support this melted chocolate into the mold spreading it a bit and if you want you can also use a brush to spread this chocolate evenly to cover the molds you can also do this with the help of a spoon but make sure the coating is not very thick or very thin so keep brushing it all around to cover the mold nicely so this thick base coating is ready I have ordered the walls as well so make sure you coat the walls as well and this coating should be slightly thick but not very thin and this goes into the refrigerator to set just for five to ten minutes meanwhile we can start preparing a stuffing so for this in a bowl I have taken this Oreo cream so this is off about 15 to 20 Oreo and removing the cream and separating the biscuits out of it so separate all of them and to this cream I am going to add just one to two teaspoons of milk if you want you can also use some cream over you mix it really well to make a thick cream paste out of it it should be slightly on thick side but not very thin so keep mixing the milk as required to make a thick paste out of it that is thick creamy consistency base this is how it looks you can see this creamy base because if you make it very thin you won't be able to stuff it and it won't set inside and to this thick cream base I'm going to crush you know very few Oreos so I'm adding just four to five of them I am going to break them roughly into small bites and add it into the cream do not add too many of them otherwise you will not get the feel and bite of the cream mix it well to combine them together so this creamy Oreo filling is ready remove the chocolate molds from the fridge and these are set enough as you can see I am going to fill it with this Oreo cream filling with a spoon and flatten it a bit to even it out to fill the gaps or the cavities of the mold so keep doing this for all of them and flatten it with the help of a spoon to cover all the molds and cavities nicely do not keep any spaces in them once it's filled well I am going to again top it up with some more melted milk chocolate over it to cover the top so pour some more melted milk chocolate over the mold to cover the top and then even it out and after filling tap it a bit on the flat form so that it's well coated and gets a good even surface on top so keep doing this and coat it well to avoid any spaces or gaps so it's coated well on top I am going to again refrigerate it for about one to two hours so that the coating is set along with the filling it's set enough now you can see let's turn the moon upside down to remove the chocolates you can see how easily and cleanly these chocolates are coming out of the mold and these look quite finished with some gloss on them with a good shape retained just like the ready-made Oreo Dairy Milk you can see the gloss on them they look so beautiful and gorgeous you can simply wrap these also for gifting options so this entire batch is ready likewise I prepared all of them I'll break it show you the filling from inside wow you can see it looks exactly the same the ones you get in the market with the Oreo filling in it and it's quite creamy this is really worth trying at home specially for children so do try this Oreo chocolate at home and let me know how it turned out for you and if you enjoyed watching this video today do give it a thumbs up share the videos with all your friends especially those having children and subscribe to my channel happy cooking", "WpDdxdFXSJ8": "[Music] today we are making this fun two-tier birthday cake out of candy from Dollar Tree this took about ten to eleven different types of candy because I used all the different brands that they carry along with the little mini three musketeers and Snickers along with kisses to decorate in between our tears and then I just used some Dollar Tree bows or the ribbons that they have already like this curled so what you're going to need to do this project is either cardboard or foam board okay so here is foam board and you can also use just a box for cardboard and that's what I'm going to show you how to do with the cardboard and you're going to need a ring or something similar that you can use as a template to cut your hole up okay so this is the size I used for my bottom layer and that to get my top layer I used a lid from butter so you can figure out if you want to make a smaller one like this and then you want to use a smaller plastic lid from something you can do that so I just figured that this would fit perfectly when I double stacked my cardboard okay so this was the one set of cardboard this is the other so this just made a good template for me to do a double stack tear and that's where I came up with that so you just need either arraigned with this and that's how that's gonna work and all you do is you take your ring and you trace it on to your cardboard and you need two of these you need one for the base for the bottom one for the top so that you can double stack it even if you don't double stack it and you only make a single layer you're still gonna need a top to put on there so that you can put your other chocolate around it okay and what you're going to need is some poster board and it doesn't necessarily have to be new i have something written on the back and what this is going to measure out to is the size of your candy bar okay so what I did was I took a candy bar and I put it on to here and it comes out to be about two inches two inches and 7/8 like that and you want this to overhang just a little bit so that this covers up the base of your cardboard or your phone okay so that's what you the size you're gonna need so you need three of these if you're making a two-tier because it doesn't go all the way around so here I have one ready for you so this is what it looks like you just take your base on the bottom and then what you do is this part here is this long strip and you're just gonna glue it around the base of your cardboard like this this is the small one and you take hot glue and you hot glue this part right here and you go all the way around the base like that and cut off your extra and then it gives you the inside of this okay so that's all you have to do and that what you're gonna do is you need either a paper towel roll or this is from the mesh that we use and you're going to cut these just a little bit smaller so you're gonna go about maybe a quarter smaller than what we have for this so you want to go like two and a quarter and the reason you're doing that is because you need something when you put this down for it to support the weight of everything and then what you're gonna do and you're gonna hot glue this whole seam around here okay just so that it's nice and sturdy and if you go with just this and you don't do another tear like say for instance you just want your cake to be like this you still don't want this wobbling or anything like that so you want to take your hot glue and you want to hot glue all the way around the outside of this and then once you have that done you can take this one that you did okay and you're going to hot glue this onto this okay so if you're gonna make a two-tier and that's how you do a two-tier hot glue this all the way around this and now you have a two-tier it's ready to be done okay so you have a two tier already now when I'm going to show you how to do is candy which is so simple and I just mixed up the lawns of candy between the chick cats and the hundred thousand dollar cars I use Snickers I use butterfingers I used all of them all you have to do is take these glue strips and you just take one for the top here and put it on there and one for the bottom so you need two per candy bar okay and the best part about this I'm really proud of myself is I only ate two candy bars it took me two days to do this because I ran out of candy and I had to come back and get more so what you're gonna do is you're just gonna glue this on to here with those glue that's all you have to do you just go all the way around with the candy so just keep going all the way around like this and it sticks fine see I'm shaking it in the Candy's not coming off and then what you do is when you're when you have your second layer on so say this is our second layer what you want to do is you want to have chocolate and like I used kisses to fill this part in here okay so I put a piece of candy and two pieces of chocolate like this so like that is how I did the second layer where you're just adding these miniature ones in there and that's more than enough space in between here and here see how I have this okay see the candy here and then I use the glue dots in there too so I just use the miniature candy bars the real small ones right here and then I added two chocolate kisses then I did another small piece of chocolate and I did that all the way around and then on the top I used Reese's Cups and I thought it was cute to add the little miniature Kit Kats for candle like the candle looking effect and then when you're all done you just take these and you cut this off of this stream here and you just do one at a time with those glue tabs and this is your outcome so it is really really easy to do all you have to do is remember is to find what you want as your base and make sure that you have a top and a bottom and with something here to support this so if you even wanted to put another one or four off together just it supports the weight so the bigger this is the more support you're going to need and then once you have this whole base done you just can't glue this whole thing and then you'll find something just a little bit smaller to make your tier and we did that with this right here and you just take and you hot glue this all the way around okay so what's hot gluing this all the way around and if it's a little bit short then you can just add a level little piece and then you're gonna do the same thing you're gonna add your either paper towel holder or the roll from your mesh your leftover and you're gonna put that in the center to give it some support because you still have that top layer that you need to put on so that you can finish the very top part of your cake okay because you don't want this to be empty up here okay and then what really covers up any spots you're showing are these little curly ribbons and then I just threw some up here extra as they like I had some that we're leftover and I just threw them up here there's a little accent and it came out really really cute so that is how you make your double tier chocolate birthday cake it doesn't have to be a double tier it can be a single tier it can be just the smaller one and maybe just use a smaller lid off of something for your template but this is really cute it cost me about I'm gonna say $20 to make because I had a lot of chocolate on here I probably have about 12 and I had to buy I want to say four of these so it was like sixteen seventeen dollars to make this whole chocolate cake and you can do them all one flavor of candy or you can do any type of candy you want the only thing that I would recommend is use wrap candy don't use hot glue use these because you're going to melt the chocolate on the backside that double-faced tape that they sell I don't even think that's good enough because it's going to pop off this has a little bit of like height to it so that's what makes it where they stick and look at all this candies on here and nothing is falling off and that is what I use to make this tt chocolate cake so make your own and have fun and just remember to make your base like this make sure you add your Center paper towels in here and then decide how you want to go up with your second tier should look the same as this just a smaller version and then look at our chocolate is still hanging on tightly and all you do is take these miniature ones to fill in that gap between your larger one and your smaller one and you are ready to give your birthday gift to whoever that lucky person is so until our next video we will see you then bye",

upcoming new feature server galaxy and everything we know so far about it but Before we jump into the news I like to just say I hope you're all having a fantastic day and staying healthy and if you do go in to enjoy this video be sure to drop awaken anchors that are subscribing to the channel to help us reach 40,000 subscribers and if you have an extra second as well go follow our twitch twitch.tv slash cat man jewel but whatever further ado let's get right into the news so for those of you don't already know what Galax is allow me to introduce Li confirm that next upcoming sex featured server for all minecraft baroque edition platforms if you don't already know featured servers our community servers from minecraft baroque Edition which are partnered with mahjong studios and are accessible from the end game server list and the console versions are the only servers accessible besides realms and although the barrel Edition lacks the minigames of the legacy console edition some if not all feature servers have their own minigames to play online now Galax I initially first popped up way back in January 2019 with the official black site Twitter can being create however is sat quietly in the background until his first tweet in January 2020 a year after its creation simply saying hello world after the first tweet will Galax site once again slipped back into the background presumably due to the careers of the server Alex bellavita and Jonathan black also the creators of blo exception by the way still working away and not wanting to start the hype train engines quite yet six months pass and not a single peep is harriet about Galax i Alex and Jonathan are keeping tight-lipped so they don't sing any bloody ships when suddenly on June 9th 2020 the 1.16 point 0.66 minecraft beta for the nether update gets released and within it some players for the first ever time get to see the new featured server and all its gorgeous glory after this incredible site players start researching we find out that the server is coming soon and had only just recently been registered on the Minecraft Pocket Edition server site On June 7 2020 nonetheless nothing was mentioned officially and things went quiet once again three days passed and another minecraft beta update comes out the one point sixteen point zero point six seven of the which now fully shows a glocks a server and the server list area but more importantly our most importantly a quake soldier in is video talking about the it shows us the official not yet public Galax a website which although we can only see a select amount of things we can see that this server will actually have some sort of bypass system with a explicitly seeing battle past season one now most likely due to the hype train engines now starting to get kind of heat up and warmed up we get an official tweet from the actual black site server Twitter account on June 16th with this caption tease we've had our friends Sam and Danny join us today as we get things ready for y'all to enjoy and for the first ever time we get a picture of the server itself since June 16th the Galax a Twitter account has been pretty much active daily in fact and they even started their own official discourse server which by the way I'm actually n because it's pretty damn smack see if I do say so myself what do I have to do what do I have to do I not look like I'm good for the influencer rank listen discord humans are a to run the galactic site server on desk or tour that disk work like say it's ever you need to give me that rule I don't powder his could influence a rule but listen he you know he's a shining example am I not I I'm artistic I I deserve it I just have it now please says Katmandu hashtag 2039 that's my discord using get me this please I you got an hour from watching this you got an hour layman legs matter I will do it I will squeeze him yeah I better get my rule I'm influencer material remember yeah now let's talk about gameplay what exactly can we expect well so far there are only sadly three game was available but don't worry there is more to come and I'll speak about this in just a minute how we know that for a fact the first one being folder gaps a fresh new but similar take on the hives mini game mode code just both however in this game mode you have to fill in the mess in blocks on a prebuilt structure that you get to see quickly at the beginning of the game the second game mode is called planets planets as Glac sites take on the popular bed wars game mode however in this version you're protecting the core and on a floating planet slash asteroid and last but not least there is prop 1 which I mean there's pretty much a problem you know but we all know a prop 1 it is but yeah that's that's the third game would each of these game modes are not only easy to learn how to play and also have a sense of similarity to them but they also are unique fun and honestly with the planet / space themed refreshing to say the least now I've gone to the liberty of choosing the 5 most important questions I think you guys are gonna want to hear and get to know and there is more questions that were answered and if you want to check them out or hear them or you know be able to see the entire full list of all the questions that they go ask them the answer I'd recommend go check another test court and actually joining it because the answer that they're and you guys can always see them for yourselves but yeah these are the most important five and my opinion for you guys to hear so the first question we've got is when is this ever being released the answer they gave was there has not been a launch day unknown so this could basically come at any given time but there is no official launch date so don't believe anybody that's saying or that is saying there actually is the second question was how do I access the server / what is the IP the answer they gave back was Galax it will appear in the minecraft server list no IP as needed or no IP needed the third question you gotta ask was can I get waitlist to the server - Tash / takes screenshot / etc the answer galactic team gave back was know if you want to get access to the server you should wait for another test or until the server itself as launched the fourth question waswas well there be more minigames in the future and the answer was most likely as I said already there's criminally three but in the future there will be more obviously to come the effect and final question that they go asked or at least I chose was do custom skins work on this server the answer they gave back was we will be discussing it and the future right now it's an absolutely no during the test and for a short time being afterwards we're not we're not opposed to custom skins were opposed to react needlessly sorry exposing 90% of our audience to graphic images that we need to find a solution to solve that and we don't have one currently yet or we don't have one yet so custom skins are disabled so after all that I personally think so far this is getting exciting and I honestly can't wait to clone this boss server especially because my favorite theme for any game is space so this is easily going to steal my heart before in this video the like to just say big thanks to powder HD he gave me full permission to use the game playing as from his video from him playing on the galactic site server which I definitely recommend you guys go check out because it's actually pretty boss and pretty cool to be able to fool ec+ he is overall just a gen of a guy so I just recommend you guys to go show him some love his channel will be linked down below I'd also like to just say I wish not only Alex and Jonathan the careers of Galaxian blow exception the best of luck with us awesome new server but also the entire Glac site team it's clear to me on to everyone else that this has been in the works very very long time and it's something that means that considerable money to the team so I'm personally genuinely excited to see where it goes and I want to see new things come from it overall though the Glocks a server so far has got my complete attention and respect [Music]

watching today's video hope you guys all have a fantastic day or Anna wherever you all are and you guys peace out [Music]", "CrfDZ5LBBcY": "Welcome to How To Cook That, I'm Ann Reardon\nand today we're making a giant Toblerone. In this series, we make giant chocolate bars\nand give them to people who are doing giant things. And I'll link you to the rest of these videos\nin the series at the end of this video and below. To make our giant Toblerone first we'll need\nto make some honey nougat. And for that you'll need egg whites, sugar,\nglucose or corn syrup and honey. And I'll put all of the recipe quantities\non the HowToCookThat.net website and I'll link to that below. Place the glucose syrup, sugar and honey into\na saucepan and place that over a high heat. Stir it, now at first it will seem quite dry\nbut you don't need to add any water. As the syrup starts to melt, the sugar will\ngo into that and it will become thick. But if you look at it you can see it still\nhas grains of sugar so keep stirring it until it's all dissolved. Turn the egg whites on to whip up and add\na candy thermometer to the side of your pan. And when it reaches 250F add three big scoops\nof the hot mixture into those whites with the mixers still running the whole time. Return the sugar to the heat and let the temperature\nincrease up to 300F. Then immediately pour the rest of that hot\nsyrup into the egg whites, obviously being very careful not to get any on your skin. Now this will become very thick, very quickly\nso remove it from the mixers, you don't want to break your beaters. And then mix through the roast almonds. You can add in whatever you want but this\nToblerone, I'm just doing plain almond. Pour that into a tray lined with non-stick\nbaking paper and then top it with another sheet of baking paper and use your hand to\nflatten it out to the corners of the tray. And then you want to leave that at room temperature\nto cool so that it can firm up. Once it is cool, you can peel off that top\npaper and the nougat will be quite firm, like this. Now we just want to split that up into pieces\nthat will fit in our triangle mould. Use a knife to push down and cut through it,\nyou will have to use like a rocking motion to get through it. And there you go, doesn't that look yummy\nwith the almonds all the way through. Keep cutting it up into smaller pieces until\nyou have bite-size chunks. For our triangles I'm using real milk chocolate\nand a stainless steel triangle and I'll link you to where I got this one from below. Place the triangle on a sheet of acetate and\nthen line the outside edge with more acetate, just cut into strips. Pour in some tempered chocolate and then if\nyou look at a Toblerone there's lots of nougat pieces spread through the middle but you can't\nreally see much of it on the outside. So I want you to add a triangle of chocolate\ninto the base, just push it down there. I just cut this piece from a block of chocolate\nand then pour some tempered chocolate onto that and spread it out and add a generous\namount of nougat over the top. Now because we've got that block chocolate\nthere, they won't just sink to the bottom of the triangle. Pour on some more chocolate and use a spoon\nto make sure the chocolate is covering all of the sides and the nougat hasn't just gone\nto the edge there. Add another triangle of chocolate and more\nnougat so this triangle of chocolate that we've put there is just stopping the nougat\nagain from just sinking to the bottom and being one clump. We want it spread through the whole block. Pour on more tempered chocolate and make sure\nyour acetate is going right into each corner and then place another sheet of acetate on\ntop and something flat on that. And then leave that to set. Once they are set, lift off the triangle and\npeel off the acetate from around the outside. And you will need 12 of these triangles so\nI suggest you buy more than one of the stainless steel triangles. I only have one so the thing that took the\nlongest was waiting for each one to set. Next we need to make a frame so that we can\nput the chocolate in between the pieces. And you see how it needs to be angled in like\nthis so it fits around the triangles. And then I've just covered the whole thing\nin tape so that the chocolate doesn't stick to it. Arrange your segments in a straight line and\nthen put the frame over the top and then move those along so they're evenly spaced. Put some tempered chocolate into a piping\nbag and pipe the chocolate in between each piece trying to get it roughly the same in\neach one. And spread that out just using a knife so\nit goes all the way to the edge. In the middle, the frame might tend to push\nout a bit. Just use some tape to tape it across and keep\nit together. And then leave that to set. Once it is set you can remove the frame and\nthen neaten off the extra bit of chocolate, see how it sort of oozed out here a little\nbit further than the triangles. Just use a knife just to shave that off and\nneaten it up. Then you want to cover the whole thing in\nfoil, you may want to put it on a strong base because this thing weighs 8.7kg or 19 pounds\nof Toblerone. Then I've just wrapped the whole thing in\ncard and stuck the letters on the front. Today I have with me Jordan Bartlett, a 24-year-old\nmusician and basketball enthusiast who has an interesting job. Hey. So Jordan what we're going to do is some rapid-fire\nquestions today, so let's start with ... Cats or dogs? Dogs. Coke or Pepsie? Coke absolutely. So what's with the beard? I would say it's a conversation starter. One that I can't do. What do you do for a living? I'm a youth worker, a creative director and\nI love to innovate as well. What sort of youth do you work with? I work with homelss youth. I have read that 50% of the homeless are under\nthe age of 25, what are some of the causes for that? Yeah so, in Australia the top two reasons\nfor homelessness amongst youth is relationship and family breakdown and unfortunately the\nsecond top reason is domestic violence. So they have to leave home? Yeah they have to flee that scenario. So you're not just feeding them, you're giving\nthem somewhere to live and what else are you doing? So we run a 6-month program. We have 4 goals in our program and that's\nfor them to get back into their own independent accomodation, employment, training and we\nwould say a link to the broader community, maybe back to a soccer club or their local\nchurch or something. And how do you get the money to run all that,\nI mean housing's not cheap and food's not cheap? We get the majority of our funding from community\ndonations as well as an event that we run called Ride Around teh Lake and we use this\nride, as a charity ride, to raise money for our program. Awesome. Can people donate? Yeah, they can just on our website. I'll put the link here. And on your Instagram I've seen it says up\nthe top \"I believe in everyday people and their potential for greatness\". Have you got an example of a success story? Yeah absolutely, I won't name the guy, but\nI work with a young guy and he had come from a very rough background and suffered a lot\nof regret in his younger years and it just began to change my thinking actually. When I started working with homeless youth\nI used to think I was working with rebellious youth but I began to discover that I was actually\nworking with long-term survivors of abuse and that they actually needed my attention\nand my time and I needed to view them just the way that I would view myself. They are just as worth it as I am, the time\nI put into myself. I like what you said there about how everyone\nis worth it. I think a lot of people don't feel that though,\nespecially if they're in that situation. They're homeless or they're in a rough patch,\nthey feel worthless ... what would you say to them? Yeah I would say that they just have to lift\ntheir horizons and they have to begin to look beyond their current situation and begin to\nsee some of the good things in life. And if they can't see anything good around\nthem, maybe they could find within themselves some of their own strength and things that\nthey love in life and begin to take a look at that. I believe that everyone has something unique\nto their own life that's worth fighting for. Definitely, that's awesome. Well, I think that you're doing a great thing\nfor these people and on HowToCookThat we have a special way of saying thank you to people\nwho are doing giant things as a way of encouraging other people to go and do giant things with\ntheir lives as well. So ... as a last question, do you prefer Snickers\nor Toblerone? Ah, Toblerone absolutely. Great, just as well you said that. Oh good. We just have a little gift for you. Oh my goodness! That is massive. We have a giant Toblerone for you to eat. How am I going to eat this all by myself? Oh my gosh. Do you want to open one end and we'll get\nyou to take a bite. Oh wow, oh my gosh ... Holy Moly look at the\nsize of that! You might need to snap a piece off before\nyou take a bite. I don't know, I think I'm going to have to\ntry my strength, see if I can snap one of these things, oh yeah. My goodness how do I even approach this? That is the biggest piece of chocolate I've\never eaten in my life! That is very heavy. Tastes like a Toblerone. A real Toblerone. Be inspired to do giant things.

They're going to love this, it'll be awesome.", "QmLPShwa_TQ": "today we are taking a look at the most popular melee weapons the sword and the axe and comparing the two and finding out which one is the superior weapon to use so here we are inside of Minecraft at our own little arena I've upgraded it since the last time we were here looking at all the enchantments for different combat things so today we are taking a look at just at swords and axes and I've honestly had this debate myself which one is better to use an axe or a soar well right off the bat you kind of think okay combat I'm gonna be fighting creatures other players as sort of stuff definitely the sword that's what it is made for but there are some crazy advantages to having an axe so first let's just start off by looking at enchantments that you can get on each of these then we're going to take a look at some of the base attacks and then what happens when you combine the two so starting off this is a wooden axe and a wooden sword so what are the differences if you hover over it in your inventory you can actually see a few stats about them and the wooden sword has an attack speed of 1.6 and an attack damage of 4 then the axe has an attack speed of 0.8 and a damage of 7 so right off the bat you see a big difference we have a dummy here with his health indicated above his name here or above his head under his name and so with the sword if you do a critical strike you will get 6 points of damage if you do a normal strike you will get that 4 points of damage so you can see the attack damage for it will always be that 4 assuming that that player or mob or creature is doesn't have any type of enchantments potions effects or armor on so that is that attack damage of 4 then with the wooden axe you can see that attack damage of 7 so every time that I hit this player then their damage goes down their damage points and their health goes down seven every single time if you use a critical tech then that goes down 10 so you have 10 points of damage on a critical attack by the way if you don't remember critical tech is when your player is falling and you attack at the same time so you have to get that jump up in the air and you can tell the difference because a normal attack will just be a normal attack but a critical attack will have particles coming off of the player so that was a normal attack critical attack oh my gosh and they died so you can see just off of the sort of the wooden versions of these weapons that the axe has a big advantage attack damage of seven versus four now we are talking about wooden items here so that should be taken into account but attack damage seven that's pretty good that means that with two hits if you hit the critical which I didn't just then then you could kill another player with an axe and this is also all before the combat update which we should get a new type of enchantment chopping so there may be even better things for the axe in the future now let's take a look at enchantments you can get sharpness 5 on both weapons so that will change this is just a wooden remember so that changes your critical from the and by the way it says right here tech damage 7 so sharpness 5 is what you need in order to get the same attack damage as a unenchanted wooden axe and the sharpness 5 on that wooden axe is attack damage of 10 so no critical that is the 7 no critical on the axe that is that 10 and then if we do a critical attack with the axe what I am is crazy 13 and then the sword that is 9 so you can see that the damage is quite a lot moving on after sharpness then we're going to talk about fire aspect and fire aspect is not available on a axe it's just you can't enchant even with commands you just cannot get that fire aspect so fire aspect will add seven points of damage over time assuming that the other player does not heal themselves it will give that 7 points of damage so you can see that we're it we our original attack was four four so that brought us to thirteen health and then that missing seven is from the fire so fire aspect could be a big advantage to a sword if you really want that damage over time and it's just not possible even with books to get that on an axe so you should keep that in mind when deciding between the two next is knock back knock back also cannot be enchanted onto an axe knock back all it does is knock back the player mob or creature too far far away this is knocked back too so this is the most advanced knock back and you can see it pushes the player back about six blocks there around six blocks in order to get that crazy amount of knock back and this would be great if you had a big group of mobs that you were fighting or a large group of people you could keep them away from you and off of you so that they wouldn't hit you next is smite and bane of arthropods now I'm fighting a player here and so those enchantments don't actually apply but you can get both of those enchantments on both a sword and an axe so really the only two enchantments the axe is missing is fire aspect and knock-back so those are something that you need on your weapon then you are gonna go and choose a sword now let's talk about the base level of attack damage start off with swords you have your wooden and your golden swords those both have an attack damage of four and what am I talking about I'm talking about when you hover over it says attack damage and when you attack something that's the amount of points damage points that it applies to that player or creature next is a stone sword and that has an attack damage of five then an iron sword that has an attack damage of six and a diamond sword that has an attack damage of seven but what else has an attack damage of seven a wooden axe that's right a wooden axe has the same attack damage as a diamond sword so you can really see if you're playing early game why a wooden axe makes a ton of sense because it does the same amount of damage as a diamond sword an unenchanted diamond sword mind you but still a diamond sword also you get the same thing with the golden axe moving on to a more rare type of material you have stone iron and diamond that is all attack damage 9 so it does pack a punch to have some of these more powerful items now you may notice that these are in two groups tech damage 7 attack damage 9 and if a stone axe does the same damage as a diamond axe why on earth would you spin to the diamonds to get a diamond axe well the reason is because a diamond axe is going to attack faster than a stone axe so inside of the axe is really its attack speed that matters so you can see that the attack speed on the stone axe is 0.8 then it goes to 0.9 with iron and one with diamond the faster the attack speed the better and you can see over here on the sword the attack speed is 1.6 so it's much faster than the diamond axe even and so really now that you're up into the damage aspect you're really talking about speed because one the sword is gonna attack a lot faster and the axe is going to attack a lot slower when it comes to swords all of their tax speed is the same it's one point six for every single sword it's the same but then when it comes to axes and let me grab let me actually get rid of this sword and then grab a golden and a wooden axe so in between the lower level axes so wood and gold you got attack speed point eight on wood and attack damage of seven and then attack speed of one on Gold attacked image of seven so with your attack damage of seven you go from point eight to one and then attack damage of nine you go from point eight to one as well with the iron axe in the middle there so your wooden axe and your stone axe are gonna attack at the same speed just a different damage and your golden axe and your diamond axe are gonna attack at the same speed just different damage so you can sort of see how that works out now practically what does that mean so I'm gonna attack with a wooden axe here and you can see I'm gonna try to attack as fast as I can so one two three and that's about as fast as I go then with a sword we got one two three and you can see that it is much faster and you can kind of see this if you just look up into the air and see that little reticle underneath your crosshairs counting up you can see just how slow a axes this is the 0.8 X and then how fast a wooden sword is so what we should be looking at now now we've checked out the slowest axe let's look at the fastest axe so let's compare diamond and diamond so here is the slower of the two the axe so you can see that reticle sort of popping up boop-boop-boop and then with the sword one two three so you can see that it is much faster with the sword so really this matters only whatever your preference is so all all that it matters is are you going to be someone who needs to attack faster and that attacks the moment that you can so are you going to be span clicking or are you gonna be holding off on your attacks or you the type of person that can hold off oops sorry that can hold off from attacking and wait until your weapon is fully charged can you do that well then maybe you should be using a axe because if you can and then it's gonna have a better damage so let's also take a look at these diamond level when it comes to attacking a player we do know that the axe will do nine and that the sword will do seven so the app that makes sense but what about your critical hits so the sword does seven but on a critical hit it'll do ten and the axe does nine but on a critical hit it will do 13 okay now let's take a look at some of the enchantments and because the only enchantment that really it affects players and the only enchantment that both the axe and the sword can have together is sharpness both of these are both this sword and this axe are enchanted with sharpness five by hovering over them you can see that the sword is an attack damage of ten and the axes attack damage of twelve going back and forth between unenchanted and enchanted unenchanted it is seven with sharpness five it is ten unenchanted the axe is 9 and then enchanted it is 12 so both of those add three extra damage points let's do it without a critical hit obviously it's gonna be 10 then with a critical hit that will be 13 so remember that our diamond axe unenchanted with a critical hit was the same 13 so a critical hit with a enchanted sword is more than or is the same as the unenchanted axe but well let's look at the enchanted axe critical hit 16 that takes the damage it's just incredible I I'm just amazed 12 damage if you are not getting a critical hit and then 16 damage if you can manage to get that critical hit that's pretty astounding now one thing to mention is their crafting recipes and that is because a sword will only take two diamond and then an axe that will take three diamond to craft so if you are in a situation where your diamonds matter possibly how many diamonds it takes to create one of these will will change what you decide to use so like if you're in a UHC or a PvP situation where you're mining for your own resources it may be better to stick with a sword because that's all you can craft or if you are in a situation where you are enchanting but at a lower level of Enchanted where you're only enchanting sharpness one or two and combining them in an anvil well you can basically get three swords for the price of two axes so it may be smarter for you to aim for swords / axes if you get more chances to enchant with those with that those diamonds and just for fun because you must never fight a player that's completely naked let's add some armor onto the player so with sharpness 5 a critical hit with diamond armor that is for around for 4 to 5 because armor sometimes takes like a extra I'm out and sometimes sometimes it rounds it in one direction or the other and then so 4 to 5 and then with the diamond axe with critical hits at 6 that's another 6 and that's another 6 so 4 to 5 versus 6 with diamond armor if we enchant with protection 4 so this is fully enchanted protection for Diamond armor with the sharpness 5 diamond sword and a critical attack it looks like we're getting one to two yeah that's another one that was 2 to 1 so 1 to 2 points of damage remember it takes 2 points of damage to equal a whole heart so that's between half a heart and a heart of damage and then with our sharpness 5 acts that is 2 that is 2 looks like we're getting to every single time so with the sword you got oh wait that was one that was 1 so you have a better chance of getting a 2 point damage hit with the axe over the sword and finally before we close out of this axe vs. sword debate there is one more thing that the sword has that the axe does not and that is sweeping edge so if you have a large group of any type of enemy and you attack multiple enemies can get hit with the same attack well I guess not if I'm flying up here but you can see that I'm hitting multiple of these enemies but with an axe you're only ever going to hit just one enemy at a time so this is an advantage or a disadvantage because whenever you're playing and maybe a multiplayer pvp situation if friendly fire is turned on and you can hurt your own teammates then a sword if you're in close battle may be bad because you're you may have some collateral damage whenever you attack the person you're trying to attack and they're nearby and you actually hit them for damage where it an axe you're only ever gonna hit one of whatever you're hitting it's not gonna have any sweeping edge attack and so you're only ever gonna hit that one thing that you are attacking so take that however you want it on one hand you could attack a big group of plate things or players and some people maybe plan on single-player watching this video so that doesn't matter at all you're never gonna have another person in your world or you may be in a situation where you're learning because you're gonna get into a PvP situation and you want to make sure that your own team members are safe so then you may want to choose an axe there you

the United States means someone who is kind of not on their game they're they're kind of a little flaky so that's what flake it's not really derogatory or bad in any way but it's a bar and this looks like the crumbly Estela kiyose milk chocolate so here's another intriguing packaging with you had this weaving of chocolate in here there's some information I can't read it another thing I can't read well in some ways I think it's better so then I don't know exactly what I'm eating till I try and I kind of had that perspective so there you go let's get in huh let's get in to the flake okay so not as nice looking at the picture but you know it's traveled pretty far let's just break it oh it is really flaky looking made a big mess hey you made a mess man what's a flake I'm gonna try it no it's definitely not flaky when you bite it it's a very rich tasting chocolate and it's good it's very creamy so the way it's all like folded in there I don't know it's it's not bad it's not bad you don't get a crispy flaky bite though but it sure is good so I'm gonna say if you really like a strong chocolate taste the flake is for you hmm nice lucky I got to try that one and thanks for watching remember check that description starts a channel for a playlist of UK candy and snacks hmm I can't get over it thanks for watching later the UK's snack video you are now watching is over if you want

walking the candy aisle we find out if chocolate is better with em hey guys I am Jeff and today we have the M&Ms chocolate bar up for review that's right M&Ms in a chocolate bar who would have thunk it well I guess a lot of you would have this has actually been requested once or twice before on the channel I've done a lot of Eminem's reviews but not the chocolate bar in fact I haven't had this M&Ms chocolate bar since back in the olden days when it was called the amazing bar that's right Eminem's chocolate bar actually launched first in 2004 as the em-dash a zing chocolate bar and essentially is just a milk chocolate bar with mini M&Ms embedded inside it it lasted from 2004 to 2008 and then it was discontinued and in 2013 they relaunched the M&Ms chocolate bar with this new branding as just the M&Ms chocolate bar as you can see very cute there's red all upset about being trapped in some chocolate oh boy oh boy adorable isn't it let's let's get into it I've heard tell that these ingredients in the chocolate bar not exactly the same as in the M&Ms themselves and like I said this is Minnie's M&M minis so we're not getting the full an M&M as normal but I guess that makes sense oh thank god sorry I got a little broken as I was turning this home from the store available in United States Canada roses rebel this available in the UK I don't know could be I did not see that actually sorry so there's the there's the bar that's a cute design right look at the Hat it's got a red falling into the chocolate again and look at that mm-hmm smells pretty good um and right there you can see them just just hanging out with the M&Ms wow that's pretty cool looking it's it's cute I like the design work I like the graphic on it and I like that the M&Ms are just like prominently right there well let's give it a shot and see let's see how it tastes hmm hmm that shell adds a nice like Chris penis to it kind of you know what I mean like um just a little nice crunchy texture I gotta say for my money even though it may be slightly different I'm not really tasting any difference in the chocolate here and the chocolate on the inside of them and Emmas versus the outside not that I don't believe that it is different I'm sure it is but all I'm really tasting because there's so much chocolate on the outside even with like this is not a bad ratio of M&Ms to chocolate considering you know how big an M&M is but other than this like maybe slight sweetness and the crunch which I like this is basically like eating a straight chocolate bar and the chocolate itself mm-hmm kind of middling it's um it's not blowing me away nothing wrong with it but nothing super great about it either I don't know I mean I don't mind this it's not that I wouldn't get this is that I would probably just get just that I would probably want to get something else does that make sense like I wouldn't be opposed to getting this and it's neat as kind of a novelty doesn't taste bad but I don't know our Eminem's like known for their chocolate specifically I don't know that they are really and I don't think that this chocolate is necessarily that great if it is the same as what's inside an M&M so walking the candy aisle digs it but it's certainly not blown away I'm going to rate the mmm chocolate bar I'm gonna rate it a three out of five you know nothing wrong with it but nothing you know amazing about it good design work though and a neat idea so yeah that's my take on it you guys let me know why you think this is the best chocolate bar in the world or the worst

While many chocolate bars may seem rather basic,\nthere are some out there that are trying to stand out from the crowd. Here are 10 crazy\nchocolate bars you should try right now! Compartes Chocolates Vegan Kale Dark Chocolate\nBar Scientists have proven that chocolate is actually\nreally good for you but there are a few caveats to that. The darker the chocolate means the\nmore health benefits there are. Dark chocolate is the result of more cocoa beans being used\nand it\u2019s in those beans that the benefits stem from. Benefits of the cocoa bean include\nits high levels of antioxidants, improved blood flow, lowering of bad cholesterol, and\nreduced risk of heart disease, among other things. Apparently there's nothing that this\nlittle magic bean can\u2019t do (if only Jack had traded his cow for cocoa beans instead\nof those beanstalk beans!). Some companies, like Compartes Chocolatiers, have taken these\nhealth benefits to the next level! Compartes added some equally healthy ingredients to\ntheir dark chocolate bars like kale, pumpkin and sesame seeds. The company makes these\nvegan dark chocolate bars by hand in Los Angeles. So while you're satisfying your sweet tooth\nyou're also getting the aforementioned benefits as well as some great vitamins and minerals!\nWho says you can't have candy for breakfast! Vosges Matcha Green Tea and Spirulina Super\nDark Chocolate Bar Now there are dark chocolates and there are\nDARK chocolates. In most cases, the darker the chocolate the more bitter the chocolate\ntastes, which is why people started adding things like milk and sugar to their cocoa\nbeans. For those who loathe that bitter taste, there is a helpful percentage system that\naccompanies most fancy dark chocolates these days. The higher the percentage of dark chocolate\nthe more bitter the chocolate tends to be. There are 100% dark chocolates but those are\nreally only used for baking as they're way too bitter to be eaten by most people.\u00a0Vosges\nMatcha Green Tea and Spirulina Super Dark Chocolate Bar (say that ten times fast) is\nabove 70% dark chocolate. Luckily they offset the bitterness with the sweetness of green\ntea. This bar has been described as having a \"grassy aftertaste\" but in a good way. It's\non brand, though, as this is another in a line of \"superfood\" chocolate bars that are\ntargeted towards health nuts who also love chocolate. It seems to be working as they've\neither won or been runner up in a lot of health food chocolate competitions, as well! Chuao Chocolatier Pop Corn Pop Bar One of the larger conundrums in life is deciding\nwhat snacks to get when we're at the movies. Luckily for humanity, there's the Chuao Chocolatier\nPop Corn Pop Bar, that combines the best of both worlds by creating a Frankenstein's monster\nof things you'd typically find at a movie theater. While there are other chocolate-covered\npopcorn products out there, this is a bit different and thus unique as it's a candy\nbar that is a mix of puffed whole grains, toasted corn chips, popping candy and sea\nsalt! They take those ingredients and cover them with milk chocolate. It's apparently\ndelicious and takes advantage of the sweet and savory flavors that so many people enjoy.\nThis chocolate bar must be pretty darn good as this Venezuelan product was featured on\nthe Oprah website! As we know, everything Oprah touches turns to gold, and while it\nmay go against her newest venture as the part owner and full-time spokesperson for Weight\nWatchers, we\u2019re sure she would agree that it's worth the 5,000 Weight Watchers points\nto give this a taste or two. The most interesting aspect of this bar is the popping candy. I\nmean, chocolate, popcorn and pop rocks don't sound like they'd go together, but if Oprah\nsays it's good who are we to say otherwise? Divine 70% Dark Chocolate with Ginger and\nOrange As we've established, the higher the percentage\nof dark chocolate the more bitter the chocolate tastes (but also, the higher the percentage\nof health benefits derived from the cocoa beans in the chocolate). That means Divine\nis pretty healthy, bitter and dark. So, like most high-percentage dark chocolates, Divine's\nbitterness is offset with something sweet which is, in this case, both ginger and orange,\nwhich have their own health benefits. Divine is also one of many \"fair trade\" chocolate\nbars, meaning that the company behind Divine (and the companies that it does business with)\nwork only with suppliers that are fair to it's workers in the countries that their ingredients\nare supplied from. Considering that cocoa beans come from developing countries, there's\na high chance for exploitation, and thus fair trade companies have helped change the game\nin those countries by forcing the powers that be to increase wages and provide safe work\nenvironments. So when you eat Divine, or any number of the healthy chocolates on this list,\nyou can be rest assured that not only are you doing something good for your body, you're\nalso doing something good for the developing world! It's hard to find a candy bar that's\nfair trade and also tastes good, and apparently Divine bucks that trend. Not only is the bar\naesthetically pleasing but it's apparently both crisp and delicious, a chocolate concoction\nthat is fruity, deep, woodsy, zesty and tangy! Yum. Compart\u00e9s\u2019 Avocado Toast Chocolate Bar Avocado toast, love it or hate it, it's all\nthe rage these days. But if you fall on the \"love it\" side of that equation, boy have\nwe got a chocolate bar for you! The fine folks over at Compart\u00e9s\u2019 are known for their\npremium chocolates and of course their extremely creative flavor options. With chocolate bar\nflavors like Donuts & Coffee, Birthday Cake, Fruit Cocktail and Campfire S'mores, you shouldn't\nbe all that surprised that they concocted an Avacado Toast flavor to add to their stable.\nThe bar is, of course, the same light green color that one associates with an avacado\nspread. Heck, even the ingredients feature \"California avocados\" in them, so it must\ntaste like the real thing right? Well, not really. Must people who have tasted it say\nit tastes nothing like avocado toast. That shouldn't be surprising but also, that doesnlt\nmean the chocolate bar isn't super tasty non the less! It has the taste of rich white chocolate,\nwith a side of salty bread bits if you will. Whatever that may sound like, believe us this\none tastes amazing and needs to be tried! Even if it doesn't taste anything like it's\nnamesake. Marie Belle Cacao Market Rosemary Truffle\nSalt Bar One of the newer trends when it comes to candy\nbars is the addition of herbs to the chocolate. A lot of\u2026 what we call 'Artisan' bars\u2026have\nmostly used dark chocolate. The Marie Belle Cacao Market Rosemary Truffle Salt Bar is\nno different. This bar falls in around the 60% range which definitely isn't the darkest\nor most bitter on this list but is up there compared to some others. While most people\nare used to really only eating Rosemary when they're scarfing down sweet potatoes (or sweet\npotato fries) they might very well start ingesting more and more rosemary as the Marie Belle\nCacao Market Rosemary Truffle Salt Bar has been called a slam dunk by critics online\n(and online critics hate everything!). The fact that this chocolate bar also contains\ntruffles just adds to the taste. Truffles are delicious but typically also means more\ndollar signs. Truffles are expensive for a reason, they are super hard to find (unless\nyou have a trained pig and a large forest with just the right temperatures and a certain\ntype of trees at your disposal). So while this is one of the more pricey entries on\nthis list, it's definitely worth the extra money to try this bar. Alter Eco Deep Dark Quinoa Crunch The most famous example of adding grains to\nchocolate comes courtesy of one of the biggest players in the chocolate bar industry, Nestle.\nTheir Nestle Crunch bar is a mix of milk chocolate and crisped rice that's been a staple since\nit was introduced in 1928. It also has one of the worst slogans in the game, \"Munch now.\nMunch some later\u201d. As outside of 'Munch' rhyming with 'Crunch' it's basically just\nsaying \"eat some now, and then eat some later'. But that's beside the point. Alter Eco is\nthe next logical step in the grain and chocolate game as it includes something instead of puffed\nrice: Quinoa. Quinoa is found in the Andes mountains which is grown and cultivated for\nits edible starchy seeds. Alter Eco Deep Dark Quinoa Crunch is also GMO-free, which means\nthat it doesn't use any genetically modified ingredients in these puffy masterpieces. Give\nthis bar a try and see how it stacks up against the big boys. \u00c9clat Chocolate Porcini & Thyme First off, Thyme is an herb that is known\nto be very powerful, pungent and strangely bitter. As we've established, dark chocolate\ncan vary from kind of bitter to very bitter, so adding another bitter ingredient, especially\none as non-typical as thyme seems like an odd choice. That is, of course, unless it's\noffset by something sweet like oranges or apples, or really any fruit. That's where\nthe \u00c9clat Chocolate Porcini & Thyme Bar takes another left turn as the 'porcini' in its\nname refers to the porcini mushroom, which definitely isn't a sweet fruit. Now, there\nare some mushrooms that taste sweet, which could definitely offset the doubling down\nof bitterness between the chocolate and thyme, however, that's not the case with porcini\nmushrooms as they actually have more of a nutty taste. That makes them great on things\nlike steak or in brown sauces, which makes the \u00c9clat Chocolate Porcini & Thyme bar one\nof the more interesting chocolate bars in the world! Chocolove XOXOX Chillies & Cherries in Dark\nChocolate Speaking of different ingredients, there may\nbe no stranger combination of chocolate and other stuff than the Chocolove XOXOX Chillies\n& Cherries in Dark Chocolate bar! As the Carolina Reaper challenge has shown, hot peppers have\nbecome increasingly popular over the years and some question why people would subject\nthemselves to the inescapable horror of eating a really hot pepper. It's been found that\nthe body releases endorphins when it's introduced to super hot peppers, and it's that \"high\"\nthat it is thought to keep bringing pepper enthusiasts back. The \"put peppers in everything!\"\nmovement has reached the chocolate bar industry and the Chocolove XOXOX Chillies & Cherries\nin Dark Chocolate bar is the best and most delicious example of that. Not only does it\nhave something spicy and sweet, but the Chocolove is also \u201conly\" 55% dark chocolate. This\nstill makes it relatively dark but it's definitely less bitter than other entries on this list.\nIt's also relatively inexpensive as you can nab 12 bars for a little over $30 dollars,\nwhich for a non-GMO bar is quite the steal. Because the bars aren't bitter the cherries\nactually compliment the heat, and it's that combination that has made the Chocolove XOXOX\nChillies & Cherries in Dark Chocolate beloved in the chocolate bar community. It's made\nmultiple top 5 and 10 lists of best candy bars in the world so perhaps they're on to\nsomething with their mixture of sweet, savory, spicy and fruity. They seem to have gotten\nthe XOXOX part of the name right as clearly people really love this chocolate bar. Dylan's Candy Bar Pizza Bar There are strange ingredients and then there's\nDylan's Candy Bar Pizza Bar. While we've covered things like cherries, peppers, thyme and mushrooms,\nit's Dylan's Candy Bar Pizza Bar that definitely takes the cake \u2026 or pie \u2026 or pizza pie?\nA product of Belgium, Dylan's Candy Bar Pizza Bar has a rather strange name for a chocolate\nbar. Perhaps there was a miscommunication when printing the wrappers and someone mixed\nin their lunch order with the typeset and due to a limited budget the company decided\nto just roll with Candy BAR Pizza Bar. If you have reservations about this bar being\nanything other than an abject disaster, you're not alone. Sadly, it turns out that most people\nonline have said that the bar ranges from being \"pretty bad\" to \"so bad that it's fascinating\".\nThat's not hard to believe as a combination of chocolate and pizza just sounds gross.\nWhile sweet and savory works, this doesn't even sound good on paper (let alone in reality),\nso it's not a surprise that this bar, while interesting, is just a bad idea. According\nto critics online there are two things wrong with this bar, tomato and garlic. Yes, tomato,\ngarlic and chocolate. It's actually a high-quality bar (made with high-quality chocolate) that\ntastes a lot like pizza, it's just that the combination of chocolate and pizza is not\na good one. However, it is marketed as 'unique' and it definitely is that, and perhaps the\nmost unique chocolate bar flavor that exists. Maybe this is the nudge that Domino\u2019s needs\nto get onboard the chocolate pizza craze. Stick around.

show you how to wrap a Hershey candy bar one point five five ounce candy bar first we want to take our coil and flip it upside down if you notice most the candy bars because they're in cases they have a natural fold to them they they fold up on the sides or down whatever way it naturally folds don't fight it just fold it just wrap it that way because we're gonna pull our wrapper up we want the folds to go up there's no need to tape it or anything you can just fold over it I'm gonna fold one for you the way I do it to show you how once you get used to doing it how quickly it goes that's how fast you can get once you get used to doing it so it's very very quick but I'm going to do one slower for you so you can see how I did it so what I do is I take both my sides and I pull them up taut I wouldn't make them tight I take my thumb's and I push the wrapper in just a little bit because it just looks a little neater folded that way and I use my thumbs to fold then I take my other fingers and I push it in a little bit too now you see how there's a little bit of fold here it's not going to matter you're not gonna see that and you take this side and fold it up and then just flip it over and then I always I'm always on a hard surface because then I rub it there's no need to to tape it then I take my my wrapper and you want to only have to glue along the bottom edge so here's the bottom of the wrapper so you only have to glue around on here so I either use permanent or you can even use removable if you want to but I use double sided tape or I use tape that I can roll on there's different manufacturers for those I'm going to use the roll on so I can demonstrate it for you so again this is the bottom so I'm just going to roll on some tape here and then I want to make sure that the side I last folded over is the top and I'm going to line up the wrapper like that and then I'm going to put it down and then I'm gonna bring my back over and line up my sides and just press and you'll see that it's wrapped and it has two two even edges and the back stun so thank you so much for watching the demonstration and we look forward to your order", "LqpBX8Xdtxc": "so do you

this channel but here we are after my last video of possibly making something that was a little bit too necessary i knew i had to turn the dial and go to the complete other end of the spectrum so today we are tackling the smash hit by cardi b and megan the stallion  when you're zoomed in you'll really get a look at my mustache here how's it coming but let's get building because i am hungry and we got to get this project started so it's been a while since i created a project making custom candy about a year ago i made the human centipede gummy worms which had the exact mix reaction that i wanted from one of my inventions so today we're going to be making chocolates inspired by wap using two brand new machines in the unnecessary studio let me show you them first up i have a brand new 3d printer the elegoo saturn and then the other thing that we get to use today is a vacuum forming device so we'll 3d print something over there put it in this vacuum former and make our chocolate mold so if you have been living under a rock for the past few weeks is a song by cardi b megan the stallion what does it stand for ben shapiro wet ass p-ward thank you very much but we're going to make four custom chocolates based on the song the first one is going to be a recreation of the cover art the second one is going to be the wap earrings that they have and then the last two are going to be inspired by the lyrics that little dangly thing that's swinging in the back of my throat and i want you to park that big mac truck right in this little garage so i'm going to take those four things as inspiration and turn them into 3d models let's do it okay so we have all four of the models completed instead of showing them to you now let's just go ahead get them set up on the 3d printer and we'll check out each one of them in their physical form after we're done printing them so let's get the resin that we need for this 3d printing project [Music] from the top make it drop let's check out the prince i was only able to get three of the models on here but i'll go ahead and print the fourth one but let's get these out of here but here we have the first three models of the chocolate bars looking good we just got to get rid of all this excess resin let me finish these things up and we will take a deeper dive let us take a look at the four different molds for the chocolate bars that are fresh off the 3d printer and looking spectacular as always let's see the first one we have here is of course the little dangly thing that swing in the back of your throat i think this one might be my favorite of all four of them let's see this one had one little mix up but here we have the earring that they were wearing in that cover art i think this one should come out looking pretty good third one out of four is the big mac truck trying to park inside of the little garage i sketched out what looks like the front of a large mac truck trying to park itself inside of a little garage and last but not least the very own cover art featuring cardi b and megan the stallion herself in their tongues out braided hair looking absolutely gorgeous so now let's take our four different designs that we have break out my brand new form box and make the actual molds that we're gonna use to pour in the chocolate and make our chocolate bars for the song that was so white so with our four designs in hand let's go ahead get the form box and get this all set up so this machine here is called the make you form box i'll throw a link down in the description if you want to check it out for yourself but basically all it does is make a vacuum form mold of all of our 3d printed parts that we have i just got it in the mail last week and i haven't really had a chance to play with it might be a little bit of a learning curve but let's set it up so i just need to put my piece of plastic right in here slide this section up into the top lock it in so now we want to put one of our models into the machine here and i think right here in the middle should be good and now i just have to form this heated up plastic over our models let's do it okay i gotta see how this looks not too bad okay we've got the first mold it's not perfect but it's a good start see we got a little bit of webbing in here so i gotta figure out exactly what i was doing wrong and what caused that but let's get the mold out of here 3d printed model now chocolate mold of 3d printed model but the best part of this process is now i can make a whole bunch of these molds using this one 3d printed part all i have to do is keep putting this in there and i can make a whole bunch of these molds for the chocolates and that is exactly what i'm going to do i'm going to get all the rest of the parts get all the rest of the chocolate molds and then we will buy some chocolate and make ourselves some whopped chocolate bars [Music] wet ass p word and we have made it to the unnecessary kitchen to make our final candies i cut out all of the molds so that they'd be easier to deal with than the big entire sheet i've got all four of them here they're looking pretty good so now let's go ahead and bake ourselves some chocolates i got myself just some classic semi-sweet chocolates but wait the best part is i also picked up myself some maple cream i thought we should have something on the inside of the chocolates themselves to make them a little bit wet and gushy and i think this is gonna have just the right texture oh yeah yeah that's gonna be good all right let's bake these things up okay so now i'm gonna go ahead and fill one quick small layer of chocolate in here and then we're gonna throw a layer of the maple cream on top of there we'll let those freeze for like 20 minutes or something like that and hopefully we have some wet and gushy maple cream filled delicious chocolates seven days a week certified freak wet and good should we make that here is a look of what i have going in the freezer so far we have a few with the maple cream on them few with the base layer still hardening but next time i see you i will be eating you chocolates chocolate chocolate chocolates who wants some chocolate okay let's demold these pop the sides a bit flex it oh there it is that little dangly thing that's swinging in the back of my throat it looks good let me get the other ones out four whopped chocolate bars ready for consumption with that wet and gushy interior check out all of that detail from the molds though hey cardi b hey megan don't want to forget about that big mac truck that's parked inside of that little garage they're still kind of frozen okay i could have done a little bit more cream on the inside but still pretty good how can you go wrong with chocolate look at all of that detail in the hair but overall i gotta say the chocolates came out much better than i thought being able to do those vacuum form molds made it so much easier to make just a whole bunch of molds so that we can make a bunch of chocolates i've got like 20 more in my fridge and cardi b if you're watching this let's bring these to market because i think the world needs to see them and eat them and enjoy them every single day if i keep doing videos like this i bought two cakes for the last one i got like 30 chocolates in my fridge now i'm trying to lose the weight i gained this summer not add more onto it put them up over on my instagram i'll throw a link down in the bio for that but i'm gonna go finish these things off and i think i will just see you at the next invention subscribe and like and do whatever you need to do for algorithms whatever all right bye wet ass p-word", "86krmaRj1BU": "Welcome to How To Cook That I am Ann Reardon\nand today we are making a giant 3 kilogram or 7 pound MARS BAR In this giant chocolate bar series we have\nmade a snickers, twix, kitkat, ferrero rocher and of course at the end we give them away\nto someone who is doing giant things. So keep watching to the end so you can see\nwho gets this one. To make the caramel part you will need. sugar, 2 cups of glucose syrup or light corn\nsyrup, milk and cream. All of the recipe quantities are written out\non the howtocookthat.net website in grams and ounces and cups, there is a link in the\ndescription below the video. Pour all of the ingredients into a saucepan. And then stir it over high heat until the\nsugar is dissolved. Add a candy thermometer and continue to heat\nwithout stirring until it reaches 245F And this will take a little while so while that\nis bubbling away choose a rectangle container with straight sides and line it with non-stick\nbaking paper. Now it is at 230 and you can see it is starting\nto change colour and get a little thicker. Now it's at 243 it is a bit darker again,\nbut it is hard to judge without a candy thermometer so I'd suggest getting one. Pour it into your container and then place\nthe whole thing immediately into some water. This helps it to cool it down rapidly so the\ncaramel doesn't keep cooking. Because if it gets hotter it's going to get\nharder when it is cooled down. which means it is going to be too hard. We want it to be that nice ooey gooey mars\nbar caramel. While that is cooling let's make the nougat. You'll need egg whites, glucose syrup and\nvanilla extract. Place 1 teaspoon of vanilla into the bowl\nof an electric mixer and add the egg white followed by the glucose syrup, if you don't\nhave glucose you can use light corn syrup instead. Then just put that bowl to one side. Measure out your sugar, water, glucose syrup\nand malt extract - and this is just for flavour. You will also need cocoa powder and some chopped\nup milk chocolate. Place the water, sugar and the syrups into\na saucepan and stir those together. Then just like we did before you want to stir\nthose over high heat until that sugar is dissolved. Then keep it on high heat but you don't need\nto stir it. And just watch the temperature with a candy\nthermometer until it gets to about 240 and at that stage turn on your egg whites to whip. Once they are whipped check your syrup and\nit should beat about 260F. Remove from the heat and pour in a steady\nstream into the egg whites while they are still mixing. That will thicken up and then turn it down\nonto low and add in the cocoa powder and chocolate. Then turn off the beaters and continue to\nfold it in by hand until you have a smooth even colour. Pour this on top of the caramel this nice\nnougat and then smooth it out so you've got a level top. Leave to cool completely. Place a layer of chocolate over the base. Then I'd suggest you chill it for a few hours\nin the freezer so it is firm enough to hold it's shape while it gets covered in chocolate. I didn't put mine in the freezer and as you\ncan see here the thick layer of soft nougat not quite strong enough to hold itself without\nthe chocolate on it. Once the chocolate is on it it will be fine\nat room temperature. Pour the chocolate over the top and then once\nthat is set you can add a second layer of chocolate if you want. And I have rested the card here on a thick\nlayer of card covered in non-stick baking paper. And then place that onto three cups. And that just lets all the chocolate drip\ndown. Then once that is second layer is set just\ntrim off all those drips from the bottom. You can leave the top plain or you can add\nsome more chocolate to the top of the bar to make pattern. Once it is all set cut a sheet of plastic\nbook cover to the right size and precut a strip off the backing on each side there but\nleave it in place. Wrap it around the mars bar and stick at the\nback. Then remove that precut strip of the backing\nthat we cut. Line up the two edges in the centre and stick\nthem together then fold in each corner and flatten. Use some scissors and just trim of any uneven\nbits using scissors. And repeat that on the other end. I found this was much stronger than using\njust wrapping paper and considering the weight of the bar you do need some strength. Print out a mars. Add then add that word mars word on the top\nusing some glue. On todays show I have with me a professional\nathlete, Topou Supoaga plays for the Penrith Panthers Hey guys how's it going? Topou I'd love it if you could tell us what\nlife was like for you growing up before you became a professional athlete. Ahh ohh I wouldn't say that I grew up in um\nI guess wealthy or anything I was you know most like most of my neighborhood friends. Umm we didn't have much but we were really\nhappy. We were really happy. Big family, small family. Yeah big family I've got ahh 3 brothers, 2\nsisters and my mum and dad so um you know there was a lot of us to fend for. My mum and dad and I'm just thankful that\num you know they were a good inspiration for us to I guess try and achieve my dreams and\num I guess pursue them. And I heard that you wrote in your end of\nprimary book what your dream was for in ten year time. What you'd like to be doing. What did you write in that. Well in ten years time which is so ten years\nago from this year, I said that I wanted to play for the Penrith Panthers. And who would of thought that ten years later\nI am living my dream and playing with the team that I grew up loving. So and in a different country too so. Yes and your dream has come true. Which so many people so many of my viewers\nwould have dreams that they want to pursue. And I know so many people who would say oh\nyeah I had a dream when I was a child and it never happened. Yep. What's the difference do you think. How did you get from it being just a dream\nto it being a reality? Ahh I guess for me I just had a big sense\nof drive and umm when you have a lot of drive you know when you have an obstacle you know\nwe had a few obstacles coming up when we were young and ahh we didn't hold onto the obstacles\nI'd rather hold onto my dream and my drive. And I guess that is what made me and a few\nof my brothers become professional athletes. Umm Yeah I reckon drive is a big thing and\nit doesn't matter where you are from and how old you are you know what background you are\nfrom. It's all about how much drive you've got and\nhow bad you really want your dream to come true. Back then I really wanted it bad you know. I didn't have much, we didn't have much just\nlike the local community but umm you know we always said if we want to make it one day\nsomething has got to change. That's amazing. And now you have reached that dream and many\nprofessional athletes who have reached the stage that you have would spend their spare\ntime I assume having with mates and partying but I've heard you spend your Friday nights\nnot doing that. What do you usually do on Friday night. Yeah on Friday nights I usually go to a local\nyouth group and ah you know I just hang out with them. These kids from different areas of life and\numm you know it's just good to be around kids and i guess helping them out. You know sharing stories with them, you know\nI am listening to their stories and just umm encouraging them and stuff. You know some kids got problems and you know\nI'm just another ear to listen to an you know. It makes me feel younger too hanging out with\nyounger kids. Achieving your dream and going after that\ndrive passionately enough to get your dreams is amazing and then also once you've made\nthat going back and giving back to the community is awesome as well.

so when I was there not too long ago I finally said you know what I just decided on a whim I'm just gonna grab all of the ones that are on display six total of six chocolate bars and they are dupes for name-brand candy and I want to see if they taste good I have done other tasting videos here on my channel and I always tell myself I don't want to do another one but I end up doing it because I have so much fun doing them so I'm going to when I do show you the chocolate bar and what their actual what I think it's supposed to be a dupe for and if I can find the pictures I will insert them of each of the chocolate bars when I taste them and then just what my take on is is it any good and does it taste like what the chocolate bar is like because each of these I have enjoyed I don't eat them necessarily all the time but I know what they taste like and I really want to be able to see if these are truly just as good or are they or are they like holy run for the hills don't try it just because I have had some of that experience it's not usually the chocolate it's usually other types of candy and usually chocolate has been a safe bet so I thought this would be good so let's get right into the video I hope that you enjoy it and if you do make sure you let me know in the comments out of all of these chocolate bars if there would be one that interests you and you would try so let's get in guys so these aren't in any particular order as I said I have six and I don't even have the receipt but I believe they were $0.50 yeah I think they were 50 cents apiece which isn't bad but this one's called island bar yes it is and this one's description is milk chocolate coated coconut bar Welsh wealthy mm-hmm and says it has three separate ones of the bounty chocolate bar and even looking at the packaging looks a very similar that's what I think is hilarious is the the packaging looks just the same very similar to the original so let's give it a try okay let's open it up people now this doesn't affect in my opinion it doesn't affect the taste it just means it's there's like a I don't know there's like a little coating on it - I don't know if you can see that but there's a little and I think it has to do with the quality of the chocolate but it other than that so it came up okay well we're gonna wish me a lot people but even has the little with the chocolate that I know okay let's go mm-hmm that tasted pretty good I tasted exactly like a bounty bar and had the delicious coconut had the milk chocolate I didn't see anything bad tasting about chocolate bar to be honest it makes me want to finish it but because I have six here I'm not going to but that actually tasted really good I'd have to say that tastes exactly like a bounty chocolate bar hmm I'm pretty impressed that is pretty pretty good and you get three in that package for like fifty cents fantastic let's move on to the second one okay so the next one is this dual letter now this has is a milk chocolate coated wafer with hazelnut cream it's a pack of two and this to me is a dupe for Kinder Bueno which it this looks exactly like it is well it has the same type of kind of bumps with the hazelnut in it and it's shaped exactly the same so let's give this one let's open it up see your first impression well well each one in here this is impressive it's wrapped individually so you don't have to open the whole thing and there's four pieces but I like that this is wrapped like that way to go do do a letter okay well this one doesn't have the weird little powder coating on the like the other coconut one but it is but it is kind of broken but you there is some wafers and I'm going to give that a try oh my the hazelnut cream is subtle it's creamy and then the crispy wafers it's not - oh that was seriously really good Wow I love this this one's really good Wow ooh it's so crispy okay I'm gonna have another piece oh that hazelnut cream just melts in your mouth wow I'm impressed - four - that was delicious oh my goodness what is next so the next is called titan' and this to me is a dupe for a Snickers a bar there's two in here and I think most of us if not all of us know what a Snickers bar is it usually has a nougat with peanuts caramel and milk chocolate on top so this looks exactly like it and it even says conquer your hunger isn't that what Snickers has all those commercials so to me it even has that on there okay well I'm impressed with that and their loom there's no weird coating I just think that one maybe it bloomed or something the chocolate got on tempered during shipping that's all I think that was because the bounty tasted great this one I don't see any issues of that it actually looks pretty impressive has the little ridges from the chocolate and there's two bars in here so I'm gonna try this one so with this one I don't like it as much and it's not as good as the other two in my opinion now when I first put into it I didn't taste any peanuts I tasted the kind of nougat that was all in there and this isn't just thick as a Snickers bar it's a lot thinner because I think a Snickers is a lot thicker so there's this one's a little quite a bit I think it's a quite a bit thinner so it took a bit to get the peanut and there there's definitely peanuts but it's not packed with peanuts does that you know something you bother you I don't know but finally I got that taste but it's okay not that it doesn't taste all right but I feel like it didn't taste quite like a Snickers cuz there's way more peanuts and a Snickers so I feel this one was close but no cigar to a dupe for that so we're just gonna and it was okay but I don't think it tasted quite the same now the third is for those that may not know to me is a dupe for a KitKat and they have different types of Kit Kats there's tons but they have a specific one that is like this thick or chunky style KitKat and this one is called for fun it's a milk chocolate coated wafer --m when it does I think they call it for fun because it has four wafers I love me a KitKat yes this is feeling like the same kind of style of a KitKat and even you know the chocolate looks really good I'm smelling this one and it smells so fresh oh that one actually smells good so I'm gonna give it a bite no there's definitely wafers in here but it doesn't taste like a KitKat I just taste the milk chocolate which actually tastes pretty good you get that initial KitKat layer like the wafers but it goes away very quickly and kick cat is very distinct deaf dead the feeling that's in between the wafers is very good it's very creamy I can't taste any much of the wafers to be honest and I don't taste any real filling and between the wafers so to me I just taste the chocolate I'm really nothing else so I mean they made it look like a KitKat but I don't think it tastes as a cake this one's called Lupo Lu PPO and it's a dream bar that is a milk chocolate coated cake with caramel no I was thinking originally and the packaging looks like almost like a Dairy Milk or an arrow here in Canada that's kind of the feeling I'm getting with even this packaging so those are the two I'm kind of comparing it to because arrow has very light bubbles and they do have arrows with caramel so I'm gonna open this up and see that's what I was thinking it was more like so I want to just see what this is like and now this one has actually dark chocolate drizzled on the top it smells pretty good so I'm really interested to know what this one's like so let's give it a try hmm no no no no the caramel has dried up completely it's not even a caramel you probably won't be able to see I'm not going to eat that but it looks more like peanut butter the caramel it doesn't even look like caramel it doesn't taste like caramel this is like a very strange dry cake kind of thing so it's neither an arrow or a dream bar but on the packaging on the front that's what it looks like to me so if people that's why I bought it because I thought it was like an arrow to be honest but it's nothing even like that it doesn't even taste good at all it smells good the chocolate looks good the packaging good but the cake thing I'll call it is very dry and the caramel isn't even caramel it looks like peanut butter this one's a complete dud and my opinion and nothing duped I've never had any chocolate bar but I can think of that this would even remind me that I've had nothing at all like this so I'd have to say loop loop oh you suck oh now the last one this one is called meteor and it has two bars it says it's chocolate nougat and caramel so milk chocolate coated bars with caramel and nougat that's what it says now this reminds me of a Mars bar even the packaging looks like a mars bar it's got two in here so all of these are like a king size almost type for most of it that would be if you're gonna buy a chocolate bar these aren't even like they're more than the full size so I think for 50 cents you're getting a good deal for basically two chocolate bars if you want to share so I'm gonna give this one a try thumbs up again for packaging as I open it up it's thin it's exactly thin like they would the Snickers doop one and again Mars bars are a lot thicker then what this is so this is very thin and otherwise it does look like a mars bar but right away like I'm let's see now this one tastes like a mars bar the caramel looks like Carmen like the last one it has a bit of the you know when caramels stringing us with it and then the nougat is actually very fresh and the caramel is very soft and the chocolate so this one actually tastes very much like a mars bar again it's not quite as thick but I like it so much I'm gonna take a bite mm-hmm I will say the nougat flavor or the nougat filling isn't quite as soft like when you break a mars bar it just breaks apart like nothing this one has a bit and you see there's it's a bit more tough to so but it tastes good it tastes fresh it's not hard or anything it just doesn't have they give like what a mars bar but it tastes it does taste like a mars bar i'm impressed with that so i had a lot of fun i had I think out of the six dupes for were pretty decent and I have one favorite that I absolutely loved and would finish eating the chocolate bar and then I had an unfavorite kicking that outside I don't think anyone would even want to eat it so I think you probably already guessed that my favorite out of this was the dual let'em delicious if you're if you see this it tastes amazing and it's 50 cents I don't know it was so good from the packaging to even inside I think that's really amazing I think they nailed the dupe perfectly for the buna for this one I think this one's pretty amazing I loved it my least favorite which you already know is lupo or however you say it I did not like this one whatsoever I wouldn't recommend it don't even go near it mmm-hmm and that caramel was showing on the packaging how it's all stringy in that now it looks like peanut butter oh no that one was totally a no-no so I hope that you enjoyed today's video I had a lot of fun sharing some dollar store dupes as I call them and I always if I find things that I like to try and I'm willing to do it I think it's a lot of fun if you have any questions or comments please leave them below for me guys I would love to know what you thought of this taste test I've done a few now and they're always fun I never know what's gonna happen are they gonna go well but I have to see out of six chocolate bars for were pretty good I think that's pretty amazing if you only have fifty cents or whatever and you're your local dollar store and it's right there you're in the checkout and you're doing an impulsive buy for the most part except for a couple of them I think we're good I think it's totally okay I don't know I still like my name brand chocolate call me crazy that's just how it is for me I'm very picky when it comes to it but this did I was pretty impressed I might have to pick this one up again because I don't see this as a name brand chocolate bar at at my at the dollar store and I know this isn't expensive regularly it's an expensive chocolate bar so I would totally pick that up and share it and eat it with others because I know it's that good so I hope you guys have a fantastic day and let me know if you've ever tried any chocolate dupes chocolate bar dupes from your local dollar store and what your thoughts were if you ever have attempted that so I will see you in the next video bye guys [Music] [Music]",

"ufnx0uzPOUY": "you are now watching a Lucky Penny shop product feature hey it's Lucky Penny shop and we've landed on a Nestle arrow candy bar and it says new bubbly bar in the top right corner in red and I'm a guessing I'm guessing I'm guessing it's uh mint smooth milk chocolate filled with minty bubbles you would think that I would spend some time researching but you know once you start researching then you start seeing other people's ideas concepts answers in opinions and I just want to go in on my own and learn about it and see what I see so I do like it I do like the packaging I like all the bubbles let's take a look store cool and dry for best both best before date in milk chocolate right some little information there there was a label there we had to peel that off so it's Aero chocolate dot co dot uk' and you know a lot of people have been well not a lot of people a few people complain that I say dot co and that dot company dot UK UK but to me it's that co dot UK alright that's what I'm gonna go with company's not spelled out I don't know why I went on that little soapbox there but it's just amazing actually know why I went on the soapbox because no matter what you think on a video there's always some type of comment that you would never ever expect like hmm I don't like how you held that package or something like that or I don't like how you say Co you should say company but you say dot-com don't you anise no one says Lucky Penny shop commerce right ok enough of that let's see peel here alright peel here I'm gonna do that my bars crushed it was handled so delicately let's see we can save it as Wong now it's now it's exposed itself to me the insides and now I know what it looks like so I'm even more anxious to taste this now so I don't have to cut it but I will bring in something to store it in so look at that hmm from here I could smell the mint we break it again and again and let's see if we can extrapolate this green layer I think it's tool time look at that it definitely looks Airy let's give it a shot whoo I'm missing the bottom hmm I like it mint flavor is really good it's creamy there's no crunch it's just a soft creamy consistency see now I got to eat that that's a good bar now I'm not a big fan of mint and chocolate I don't know why I like I like mint in vanilla ice cream mint chocolate that is but it's not my favorite I'll eat it so there you go it's the new bubbly bar the Nestle Aero and it's hard not to keep eating it so as to not annoy anybody I'm going to end it there it says arrow arrow on the bar itself I'm ending it there and I'm going to eat this and say thanks for watching it's really appreciated and again lots of green items this week so this was the arrow bar with the green packaging so

Foxy No-Tail's minecraft adventures, here inside of my minecraft\nbedrock Edition survival world and as you can see behind me I have many many\nzombies and this is my Zombie spawner oh whoa lag and I don't know whether you\nremember but it just used to sort of come out here and I didn't get very many\nzombies in it the reason for that is they used to back up until the point\nthere was still inside this square and when they're still inside that they\nwon't spawn anymore for some reason this little area here around this is so laggy\nbut as soon as I pop out that whoa there we go it's fine so who don't know what\nthat's all about but yeah I went a bit low crazy the other day and decided to\nbuild this of water stream system to transfer the zombies further away and\nthen bringing them back round to the beginning back to where I was stood so\nthat I could sort of just sort of stand here in afk and the reason this is\nuseful although it's going crazy laggy it's like my mending pickaxe if I just\nstand here and hit them with that it mends itself which is fantastic or if I\nwant lots of levels I can just stand here and punch them all so I'm just\ngonna get rid of these zombies quick and try and get rid of some of this lag and\nI'll be back with you in just a second well that's all of those out the system\nI've got a few more in the top here that I'll get rid of quickly now just to get\nas much XP as I can then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna cook very quick\ntime-lapse I'm sure you're probably sick of all my time lapses by now well out of\nbetween episodes I've been doing a lot of stuff and mainly mining mainly mining\nquite a lot of fishing and yeah I just want to show you a lot of the materials\nthat I've managed to get from mining because it's absolutely insane so it's\nnot a mining time like time-lapse just a very very quick time-lapse of me\ngathering the materials that I got well I hope you enjoyed that time-lapse\nwhere I've just been organizing some of the stuff I've been getting from my\ndrops in this and it's gone crazy I've got all of that rotten flesh there I've\ngot chainmail armor I've got gold armor I got leather armor I got enchanted\nchainmail armor enchanted gold armor enchanted leather armor and I've got a\nbunch of tools and I got a little bit of food as well and one ironing got from\nthat particular session there so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna head back home\nand I'm gonna show you a couple of bits that I've been doing with my fishing\npond first thing I need to show you is this bridge and I've come up the\nstaircase the old staircase do you remember this from a long time ago this\nis now the quickest way back from the zombie spawner and it's the only way\nback up from my mind because my little minecart elevators broke and I've lost a\nminecart in it somehow and I built this bridge I've only got one door I need to\nmake some more doors but I'm out of wood not completely but I really need some\nmore wood but yeah I built this this nice little bridge over here instead of\nthe horrible messy cobblestone one that was there before and that leads directly\ninto the back of my castle which is very very handy and another thing I built\noutside the episode is that little box there which hopefully he is look you've\ngot chuck inside you were okay Chuck yeah good are you fishing for me again\nyeah that's amazing thank you so much if you caught much yeah great well can you\ncarry on doing that just like for as long as you can please okay the fact if\nyou did it for the whole episode that would be amazing\nokay brilliant thank you so me and Chuck have been taking it in turns fishing as\nyou can see I built this little hook we've got three streams of water with\nthe air above it just to increase the speed in which the fish will bite got\nhoppers below here hoppers below these books and if chuck stands there and he\nthrows his fishing rod in when the bubbles come out he picks the fishing\nrod back up the fish will or whatever he catches will\n- those hoppers and they'll go down here into this little storage room and this\nis our fishing storage room it's just part of our downstairs area and the\nhoppers come down here behind that water and they go into these chests so while\nchucks just been stood there now at the beginning of this video he's caught all\nof these fish and outside of the video we've got a lot of stuff a lot of stuff\nand this is my favorite box because I've got two more mending books I actually\ngot another two and I managed to make both of my pickaxes really good oh sorry\nanother one and we've got all of these cool ones as well we've got efficiency\nones we've got looting three we've got fortune three we've got a break in three\nand silk touches well so they're gonna come in really handy and obviously a\nbunch of other stuff as well lots of fish lots of saddles lots of all sorts\nso we're not sure of anything apart from the one thing that I really wanted which\nwas name tags name tags they should be here according to the wiki they should\nbe on the loop tables just like everything else is but they're not\nworking and what I've noticed and I also went on to the Minecraft bugs website is\nthat there is a little bug in where you should get a name tag and your fishing\nfishing rod acts as if it's caught something and it loses durability but\nyou don't actually get anything and I believe that's when you should be\ngetting the name tag so coming back up the top then that's pretty much it\noutside of the episode other than an absolute turn of mine in which you saw\nthe time lapse for and look at this we've got now I've got 20 blocks with\ndiamonds six blocks of emeralds 15 blocks of gold and a load of other stuff\nas well and my redstone box is absolutely well I keep spinning those\nitem frames around which I they want to do is tons of redstone in there I've got\nmore lapis in here I've got all sorts of stuff and I've also got a three-tiered\nbeacon downstairs now instead of two tiered which is great that's fully iron\nthe beacon that doesn't pop up over there anymore don't know why I'm going\nover there it goes over here now because I moved it and I also have another beer\nwe can elsewhere which has got two beacons on it but I'm not going to show\nyou that today because that's going to be for a little surprise project that\nwill be coming up at some point in the future right down there right at the\nbottom is another beacon and that's where I've been mining everything out so\nthat's all of the things that I've been doing outside of the episode now inside\nof the episode is going to be building hopefully a tree farm because\nat these tree farms which you think you've already got a tree farm what do\nyou need a tree farm for the problem with these is that they take forever to\ngrow because they're a little bit too far away and also when you chop them\ndown you don't get all the saplings back because the trees the leaves merge\ntogether so you get a lot of ward but you don't get many saplings back and I'm\nslowly running out of saplings I had a stack and a half of oak saplings before\nI've only got 31 left and when I chop these trees down I'll probably only get\nanother maybe 10 or 20 which isn't enough because that means it's costing\nme more saplings to regrow and grow the trees and then get him back so I want to\nmake a water system one but before I do that I've got a couple of questions for\nyou guys okay and I need you to tell me the answers if I remember to I'll put a\ncard in the top right hand corner for you to click on an answer and if I don't\nremember to do that I'll buy trees a big chicken I'll see you then yeah if I\ndon't remember to do that then you guys if you can remind me or no even just\njust reply with a comment your answers to the questions because I got some\nanswers so first question the first question is to do with this fishing now\nwhat we're actually doing here and what I've been doing is I've spent about 24\nhours just afk fishing and the way we afk fish is a little bit cheaty we're\nnot doing anything outside that we shouldn't be doing we're not using\ncreative mode all we're doing it is because we're on the Windows 10 version\nof Minecraft we can use the an auto clicking program which basically we just\nset to four and a half seconds and every four and a half second Chuck will throw\nout his fishing rod and another four and a half seconds he'll pull it back and on\naverage that is roughly what time the fish tend to bite the hook so we get the\nmost drops that way so because it in bedrock Edition we can't just hold our\nfinger down and keep throwing our rod out like we can a jar or addition we've\nhave to use an auto clicker in terms in order to afk fish now you might think oh\nthat's a little bit cheaty shouldn't really do that you know it's you using\nadditional software to allow you to get more items in the game which I get I\ntotally understand that and I think in a lot of ways that's probably cheating now\nyou could use this auto clicking program for all sorts of stuff that would be\nreally really Chiti but just to do something that's\nalready in the game and bearing in mind don't forget that the bedrock addition\nis supposed to be getting to the point of the same as Java addition so I don't\nthink we're doing anything we shouldn't be doing but I really would like you\nguys to tell me do you think it's okay for us to do this and what my main\nargument for it isn't just the Java addition thing it's also because and I'm\ngonna have a heart-to-heart with you now as a busy youtuber / worker / family man\n/ have my own house and after saw everything now I have very very little\ntime to play games and in order for this series to progress quickly enough for us\nto actually do anything and get all the blocks and enchanted things we need we\nneed to speed the game up a little bit which we can do in Java edition but I\nlike playing in bedrock and you guys like the hello llama you guys like me\nplaying in bedrock so there are a couple of little GT things like that that we do\nthat isn't technically cheating cuz we're not using commands or we're not\ngoing into creative mode or anything like that we're just you know bending\nthe rules a little bit in order to speed the game up so that we can play a little\nbit better and I think that's okay but I want to know what you guys think do you\nguys think that's okay I hope so anyway yeah let me know about that the\nsecond thing is where we're going to go from here so we've been build in we've\ndone a few farmy things we've done a furnace room I'm going to do a wood farm\ntoday but I'd really like to know from you guys what you want me to do next I\nknow we've got the challenges that need to do it so that's one option we could\ndo challenges or we could do more farms and more building things like that in\nfact we'll separate those so we got challenges number one more automated\nfarms and things like that number two more building number three oh I think we\ncould just about get on with going for the Enderdragon now which is number four\nnow I'd rather delay go enough for the ender dragon at the moment because once\nyou've killed him and you've got sugar boxes and everything like that the game\njust becomes a little bit easy so I want this is skeleton over there behind me if\nhe doesn't see me yes I I kind of want to put that off a little bit and\nconcentrate on building like this because I like the fact that I have to\nwalk everywhere and I can't carry much because it makes the game a little bit\nmore challenging so I would prefer to do more\nand building and things like that but I want you guys to be entertained that's\nwhy I'm making these videos for you not for me although I enjoy doing them but\nI'm making the view so I want to know what you guys think so number one was\nchallenges number two was building number three no\nlet's start again number one was doing challenges number\ntwo was automated farms and things like that number three was buildings and\nnumber four was going for the Enderdragon those are the things I want\nto know which one you want me to do so obviously today I'm gonna be looking at\ndoing some sort of tree farm it won't be an automatic one it'll just be you'll\njust be similar sort of thing but with lots of water underneath to catch the\nsaplings the other thing I suppose number five could be exploring because\nwe haven't done much exploring in this and one of the reasons I don't like\ngoing too far away from the base is that sometimes when they create and do an\nupdate of the game if they add a new block or something like that\nif you've already loaded the world chunks in you won't get that block in\nthe chocolate you've already loaded but if you go to\nnew chunks that haven't been loaded you get that block like the magma block so\nif I go to the nether you'll see there aren't many magma blocks around but if I\ngo to areas I've never been to before you'll start seeing magnet blocks\nspawning in so that's one of the reasons I don't explore too much but I suppose\nwe could do so let's add number five is exploring and then number six what about\na woodland mansion because the other thing that we might need to do is get\nsome villages over here and get a cartographer and he'll be able to give\nus a map to a wooded mountain oh oh there's so many choices\noh this is the ocean Monument let's Club all of those together the ocean monument\nthey would love mansion and the Enderdragon as fighting bosses let's add\nthat as one option so fighting bosses so we've got number one is challenging\nnumber two it's automatic farms and things like that\nnumber three is build in and before is fighting bosses and number five is\nexploring so here you go what five options which one do you want to see the\nmost of in the next few episodes of my videos so I'm going to leave that to you\nand I'm gonna get on with building some sort of wood farm because we need wood\nI'll show you how much wood we've got we've hardly got any wood look this is\nmy wood box I've got just over a stack I've got no birch I've got a little bit\nof spruce and I need what we need water for bill\nso I'm gonna have to go get some oh no no no no no there's a creeper down this\nhole how did he get in there but he come from\nhaha why I think sporting in holes stop it\ngo away you nearly blew up then that frightened the life out of me all right\nI need I need something to block this little hole up how do you get it yeah I\ndon't understand and I've got no blocks other than wood which I really need Oh\nnuts all right suppose first thing we're gonna have to do is chop all of this\nstuff down so let's get rid of all this and the good thing about this is we'll\nget plenty wood from doing this and hopefully we'll get plenty of saplings\nas well all right that's everything knocked down\nI've built this little house here just to hide in while the yeah well\neverything was falling down Fitz takes a tease Chuck's up there he's gonna do a\nlittle time-lapse video of us in a minute I know you're lovely up\ntime-lapses oh that's another thing I wanted you to let me know that the\ntime-lapse is okay or are they getting on your nerves I really like doing them\nI love doing them I love seeing my little character running about really\nreally fast sort of breaking blocks and placing blocks I think it's ace and the\ntime-lapse I want to do next is preparing this area for a tree farm so I\ncould use this area which I like but it's very close to my house and I think\nwe probably want building so at some point so I was planning on basically\nsmoothing out this area here because it goes quite a long way back and sort of\njust flattening all this out and then using this so I thought that would be a\ngood area for the tree farm that way it's not too close to the house but it's\nyeah it's close enough to make it easy access so let me know what you think\nabout these time lapses I am going to include them today and I'm gonna get\ncracking as well but I need to get these saplings because we need as many\nsaplings as possible I'm gonna need a new diamond spade because this one's\nbroken or shovel or whatever it's called so let's go and use some of my brand-new\nbunch of diamonds and some of my enchanted books and do that and\nobviously chuck is no longer fishing because he is now ready to watch us do\nsome mining I definitely want efficiency now I don't think it needs to be\nefficiency five on a diamond shovel because they're pretty quick anyway so\nwe'll just go efficiency four will go for unbreaking 3 and we'll get a diamond\nshovel on once you see what we get on the enchanting table anyway silk touch\nwould be good I think I might have a silk touch one in here utter yes\ndo but it needs fixing so I could just put mending on this and fix that but\nthen that's a waste of a mending book I think I'm gonna do that that's only\ngonna cost three XP that's pretty good so we've got mended on that now I need\nto go and fix this so I'll be back in a minute after I spent some time at the\nzombie's border fixing this spade shovel whatever it's called you know what I\nmean there we go it's completely repaired good right we can get rid of\nthese last couple of guys and let's get out of here it's nighttime Chuck is\npatiently waiting for me at the top of his tower although I did have to move\nhim we had to get him down from there which wasn't easy I had to break him\ndown because he can't break blocks and then he built himself another one back\nup there again I think when he comes off that one we might just get to jump off\nand hope that he survives because it's such a pain ever to go up there and\nbreak him down each time but that's that's the problem with prob Chuck\nbecause he can't break his own blocks bless him right let's grab a crafting\ntable and I'm just gonna make a load of chests quickly to put all the stuff in\nthat I'm going to gather cuz they don't want it all go to waste so let's grab a\nchests and let's put these down over here on two three four five six seven\neight like that there we go let's get digging\nokay so there's a little bit of a problem with this hello can you see me\nsee there we have lot o have fallen in the water hang on I want to explain\nsomething I want to explain something area and back up look if I just hop over\nhere oh let's gun and now back again add a\ngun and then back again yeah we're gonna have to move Chuck\ncloser cuz he can't see me hey you Enderman I want your ender pearls come\naway give him a but he go where'd it go but he go where'd he go there he is get\nhim get him get that Enderman and the spider get the spider as well need to\nkill spiders don't know why I just like getting them come here Enderman\nyou be bothering that sheep Tamia stop making my grass blocks thank you hello\njoke we're moving again okay you happy about that yeah good\nthink you're gonna have to come over here and do it choke just careful though\nokay okay just be careful so you need to walk backwards remember don't fall off\nthe edge cuz you useless yeah he's so useless keep going back keep going back\nkeep going back that's it that's it I reckon that's a good spot there\nokay just that's it there you go there we go that's it good light well done\njust say can you see from there yeah good right hopefully shook I'll be able\nto see me a bit better now that would be useful wouldn't it right let's get\ncracking again then there was this big tree I was going to sort out no joke no I'll save you ah-oh was close\nyou okay choked yeah good watch out for spiders man I'll climb up things how did\nyou get round I don't know there we go then that's a bit of a\nbigger area for us to play with and we got quite a few resources from that we\ngot a load of grass we got a load of dirt we got a load of stone a little bit\nof the new well say new blocks have been in the game ages now haven't they and\nquite a lot of coal which I'm gonna now lay on the floor like I did in my time\nlaps earlier I want me to get with my fortune pickaxe and get some XP and some\ngo o gold coal I know what I mean that word there we go nearly two stacks of\ncoal as well so that's pretty good hold really I'm quite happy with that and we\nalso got lots of wooden bits and bobs as well fantastic right I suppose we best\nget building this thing then hadn't we and I suppose I ought to put chuck to\nbed oh no you can carry on fishing for me cut you chuck yeah\ngood lad let's get you down again okay okay I've got a little bit off track\ntidy in this area up I built a little wood Shack which needs some needs a\nlittle bit more colour but I quite happy with the look of it and this is where\nI'm gonna keep all of my saplings and things so that we can come in here and\nwe can just sort of afk while all the trees and things grow and we're not\ngonna lose any saplings or anything like that so I'm gonna grab all of my woody\nstuff out of these chests and go put it in there where it'll be nice and safe\nokay so who her at loads of eggs inside the chicken machine again so I thought\nI'd come and like hatch them in here so they can grow up and then obviously I\ncan get chicken and they're all the babies look this if you can get these\nsheep out the way they're all following the big chicken that's in here long look\nthey're all following it that's not your real mum there we go got loads look at\nall grow up in four nice big tasty chicken yum-yum-yum-yum\ndon't tell big chicken will you a job yeah sorry I sneezed sheep I didn't mean\nto do that was a complete accident and you little sheep you're not allowed\nto go into my wood house my little cottage of wood nurse okay so the idea\nI've got for this tree farm is going to be relatively simple I'm just going to\nhave sort of an area with water inside that leads to a few hoppers that puts\nthe saplings in the chest and then just sort of a few floating bar blocks of\ndirt that we can plant the trees on but I've got to find\na way of making it easy enough to plant the trees and also to stop them growing\ninto giant trees as well so in a way I've got a few designs and then I'll see\nwhat I come up with I'll let you guys know spider spider spider dad dead\nspider spider spider right this is the sort of layer I'm gonna go for it\nsixteen blocks by 16 blocks we're going to have four rows of four so sixteen\ntrees in here altogether and they're going to be planted on here underneath\nis going to be water rushing towards the middle unless no I'll get the water to\ncome down this side and then water down each side of there and collect into a\npoint in the middle here somewhere and then I just need a way of making it easy\nto actually get on there to break the trees now I could put a little Pat\nplatforms across like that but the whole idea is this is once the trees gone the\nsaplings will fall into the stream below which will allow us to get it so I don't\nreally want to have things that's going to block the lease from falling although\nI think I might have to have some just so we can get to the middle so what\nabout if I do I don't know the best way of doing this if I was to do maybe a\nline down the middle something like this maybe I could reach both sets of trees\nfrom there we'll have to see we'll have to see how it goes well for the water in\nthe wrong place but this is kind of the idea that it will come down here we'll\nhave another layer of Rove water going that way and then it will come to the\nmiddle at the end what I'm gonna do cuz this is very difficult to be running\nabout I'm gonna go and get some depth Strider three on my boots\nand while we're going this way we can have a look and see how Chuck is getting\non with his fishing here we are in the fishing room how while my boots are they\nnearly broken probably a good idea to to get a new pair of boots then and yeah\nhe's not a brilliantly he's getting a few things but it's ER he's coming\ntogether fairly slowly so what do we want on our boots then we definitely\nwant on breaking three we want feather falling if that's in here somewhere I\nthink it might be Depp Strider three we definitely want feather falling for\nwould be good we'll go for those four now we won't\nbother with any protection enchantments on there at the minute we'll just use\nthose I see how much this is going to cost\nfirst of all in breaking 3.then feather fall in four and that's two out of three\nand they are quite expensive I've used quite a lot of levels there but\nfortunately I've got plenty of levels there we go spread the falling forward\nthat's two out of three and breaking three that shit'll hours so just do a\nlittle bit better in the water because it's very hard work when you don't have\ndepth Strider playing in water streams there we go so all the waters running to\nthe end now we just need to do exactly what we did in our zombie spawner which\nis to push everything to the middle and then hopefully if we break well there\nisn't a middle block it's a middle two blocks so hopefully this will work\nyeah we can push them down into the center there so that's where our hoppers\nwill be so that's the basics of it now we just need to put a little bit of a\nroof on to stop the grease trees growing too tall all right so I've put those\nfloating blocks which it looks a little bit odd\nI think there's seven blocks above each one hopefully that's going to work they\nare half slabs so they're technically invisible which won't block the light\nbut I'm not sure if that's going to stop the crew trees from growing too far so\nwe're gonna have to do a test but before we do that I need some hoppers there we\ngo that's it so we just got these steps\ndown here to the chest where hopefully all the saplings and things will end up\nnow we need to plant the saplings we'll grab a bit of bone meal as well and just\nmake sure these aren't going to go too big so we can plant the saplings just\nlike this which is pretty simple and I think from standing on that block there\nwe should be able to reach all the way to the top to cut those down as well so\nthis should be relatively efficient there will be some blocks are saplings\nour end upon the walkways but not too many and this should work with birch and\nalso spruce as well I believe oh we've got a little bit about Mill\nonly six here I might have to go to the house and get some more in a minute\nlet's just try it though come on no nothing right let's go grab some more oh\nit looks like all the chickens have been growing up this is good news we're gonna\nhave some nice tasty dinner soon I've got nearly three stacks of bone meal\nthere so let's go and see if we can get some of these trees to grow there we go\nit's grown but I think is that a big tree I don't think it is I think it's\nokay let's try this one as well let's just make them all grow so that we\nknow we don't get any big come on how much bone meal do you need\nthere we go there we go it was easy that was better\nall right well mine I'll get all of them to grow they cost so much bone meal some\nof them are so easy and some one take ages so there we go that's half of it\ndone let's do the whole thing right that's the whole thing growing it\ndoesn't look like we've got any giant trees which is great now we're gonna\nchop it down and see what happens right that's the inside two rows they were\npretty easy to chop down let's try this outside row then so if I stand on this\ndirt block here I should be able to get all the way to the top there we go yes\nso we can get all of the trees relatively easily ah I found a problem\nwith the design I can't get my log so I think I'm gonna have to build a cross to\nthese as well which is a bit annoying because that's gonna be even more room\nfor the stuff to miss falling down in the water so let's try it and then we'll\nsee how we get on with it all right then I'm gonna go and hide in my little Hut\nfor a little while I'm gonna come back hopefully all the leaves will have\ndespawn or whether we'll be able to see what we got but we can already see there\nare some things coming down here let's have a look inside the chest so yeah\nwe've got an apple and a torch some reason and we've gettin some other\nthings falling down so that's working sort of let's go let's see what happens\nlet's see how many sappers we get from all of this right well I think you've waited long\nenough for those leaves does he spawned they still go in they're taking forever\na sheep went in and then finally got himself back out again and there were\nquite a lot of things on the planks I don't know if you saw that through that\nquick little flip through that we had there but there were quite a lot of\nthings it was an apple over here I was really tempted to jump down and get it\nbut I wanted to just stay still and just see how it all went well as long as\nwe've got 16 or more sample saplings in here we're winning oh man if we got no\nthat's that's a Nitin hopper why isn't it letting me in the chest huh 17 oh\njust only just we did pick a few up while we're chopping the trees down\nthough so that's not too bad so I think altogether we got just over 20 saplings\nfrom ones that did manage to go down and ones that I picked up while I was\njumping the trees down so that's not too bad that means this thing does work it\nmeans that we can refill it and we don't have to keep going and chopping other\ntrees down to replenish our sapling supplies so that's good that means we\ncan also do this with birch and spruce as well now you get just over a stack of\nlogs from this as well which is good because the 16 trees they all grow\nbetween four and five blocks high if they all grow four blocks high that's\nexactly 64 blocks if any of them grow five blocks high then obviously that's a\nfew more as well so that's not bad it is quite big and yes I know you can do\nsmall ones and automatic ones and ones with pistons and things like that but\nI'm just going to keep things simple for now we're not gonna go crazy with piston\nones because it costs too much iron basically that's that's the main reason\nand we got a whole bunch more resources from doing all that digging and\nflattening so what I'm gonna do outside of the episode is I'm going to copy this\nanother one here and perhaps another one here and then the nav mole hopefully\ncoming over to the same points and everything's going to be coming into the\nsame chest and then we should be able to plant lots and lots more saplings which\nwould be great now before the episode is finished\nobviously the unclear going out through outside of the episode is how to tidy up\nall these boxes but before the episode is finished I'm gonna firstly go and\ngrab me some dinner from all of these chickens in here we need to sort that\nout cause it's far too many of these guys running about for my liking just\nthink of all these eggs are gonna get laid down here and I don't want to kill\nany sheep if I can avoid it but I think it's gonna be fairly unavoidable to be\nhonest so I'm just gonna go round here and get all of this nice tasty chicken\nfor my dinner we don't want you guys hanging around in here taking up the\npassive mobcap now do we come out the way you little chicken and you and you I\ncould see you hiding behind the sheet thinking I can't see you I could see you\nI could see you and you yeah that's it anymore all there's loads of Amir come\nhere you little chickens come up here we go oh sorry she ate one too any more\nchickens any more hiding yet there's another one hide in here another one\nhiding there another one hide in here anymore\nI saw one scurry off into this corner I saw you I saw you you hide it in here\nsomewhere I'll find you don't think you can hide\nfrom me forever areas sneaking off this direction any more any more chickens\naround here I think I think I got them all good okay so where oh look at all\nthat chicken job youngnam oh and unload more eggs as well right I'm not gonna\nbother about the eggs let's set go or creeper creeper in the cow farm and all\nI'm a sport with the pigs I think he's been there a while I'd be fine oh you\ndidn't die yeah let's get that guy let's get that grump outter that's gonna be\ncoming in usefull soon hopefully hopefully at some point are you gonna be\ntaking on the end of grant dragon and getting myself some elite rasayana need\nall the gunpowder I can get to make firework rockets got a little bit more\nchicken in there right and let's go and see how Chuck's been getting on with the\nold dam oh that's not the way down yeah fishing job I know what I mean all right\nwhat are we got in this chest then oh we got another mending book well done Chuck\nyou're amazing okay thank you perfect that's awesome and we got some\nmore fish got another mop a knock back to book here that's not that great\nreally or less Chuck let's put that in the rubbish books box oh the rubbish\nbooks box filled saddles fish puffer fish doing a good job he's doing a good\njob let's pop up and see him through this water stream it's very slow going\nup here because all the water is pushing down but there's not a lot I can do\nabout that so open up this little trapdoor\nhey Chuck you okay yeah good you're doing a really good job\nfishing by the way do you like fishing yeah good good well you can just carry\non doing that then you're doing an amazing job okay um yeah so I'll see you\nlater mate it's it's the end of the episode so I'm gonna go and say bye to\neveryone you carry on in there and I'll see see you later okay\nWow he's doing a good job fishing he's doing a very good job as if he got me a\nmending book it took me ages and ages hmm not again that's another creeper\nspawn in here why why creepers spawning in here and how how are they spawning in\nhere where are they coming from how on earth did you get look how light it is\nit's ridiculously light in here and it's all carpet on the floor there is no\npossible spawning spots in this room maybe on top of the furnace what\nor maybe the crafting table that's crazy can we put a torch on the crafting table\nand can we put a torch on the furnace maybe there we go what I don't\nunderstand I don't understand how he gets in here and on the bed that's the\nsecond time that's happened the first time it happened I didn't notice in the\nwhole thing went bang and so yeah I'm glad that didn't go banging that time\nI'm gonna go and put all these eggs

into a bar wasn't possible until several key discoveries during the Industrial Revolution in 1800s in 1828 a press was invented that could extract the natural fats from the chocolate mass no one has cocoa butter then in 1847 it was discovered that adding an additional cocoa butter back into the chocolate mass made it possible to mould solid bars of chocolate but perhaps the most important discovery was made in Switzerland 1879 when Rudolf a Lindt was rumored to have accidentally left a mixer running overnight with some of his chocolate in it when he tested the batch in the morning he discovered it improved the taste and texture of the chocolate this process became known as Conchi conching transformed the chocolate bar from a gritty rough texture to the smooth aromatic chocolates we've now come to expect it ultimately helped turn chocolate into a largely popular commodity it is today although I fermented and roasted my beans there's still a few important steps that must be done before I can begin to conch my chocolate first I'd have to manually remove the outer shells of all my cacao beans after eight hours of repetitive motion I finally had four pounds of my beans ready next I took some of the beans and used an oil press to extract the cocoa butter I need for my chocolate this was kind of a pain and I think the oil ended up coming out of the wrong spot but I did succeed extracting enough cocoa butter one important thing I discovered was that adding any water or moisture to my chocolate will ruin it by causing a disease so I had to dry out my sugar cane syrup and milk before I could add it to my chocolate after drying overnight in the dehydrator the milk turned into a thin crusting material so I broke apart and groaned up in my blender then I tossed my dried sugar cane syrup into blender in a matter of minutes I had my sugar with all my ingredients finally prepped I had a cool chocolate but I met with Peter and they are good so you make chocolate right I make chocolate he's a little bit about your company yeah we started a little over a year ago and opened in August the genesis was really the endurance bar which has got 8 grams of protein from pumpkin seeds and algae protein which is a new ingredient cool chocolate just every step make their chocolate stirring straight from the bean including roasting it grinding it conching it tempering and molding it so thanks for showing me the two herbs really interesting to see it on industrial scale and I've done most little steps myself and now I'd love to do it within conching so what's the importance of the conscient wise it's in a very important step okay mostly you're doing particle size reduction in order for it to have a nice mouthfeel you want to be at 20 microns or below and the size of the particles another part of it is is that all flavors tend to evaporate like the acetic acid that's from the fermentation lactic acid those will evaporate to some degree in my world dark chocolate starts at 70% of the weight of the chocolate comes from the cocoa bean in other words it's either the nibs or it's an additional amount of cocoa butter the reason we add the cocoa butter is that it gives you a more pleasant mouthfeel so we're going to do a 70% dark and a 5% dark and then a 70% dark milk we have 1830 grams of beans we're going to split it three ways we're going to put them in the Cui's and just buzz them up and roughly great them so that they're small enough for the machines this is a little cold and that's why it's clumping up okay see so now it's starting to go and now we just got a letter trip after grinding for a while but once solid beans started to look like chocolate so it's time to add the cocoa butter sugar and dried milk the contras would have to run for at least eight hours so I'll have to come back later to finish the process following morning I returned to cool we ran the contras just a little bit longer to help raise the temperature of the chocolate before testing its final consistency 37 we really wanted to get up to 42 43 before we try to temper it I think what we're going to do is I'm going to get the heat gun and we're going to heat it we're going to heat them up so that we can get them up to the 42 that's him already at 42 doesn't take a lot using a micrometer we measured exactly how finely the chocolate had been drowned with a chocolate finally at the right consistency is time to temper it so we're going to take about half of this and just put it on the board so then you move it around this is to try to form all the same size crystals beta five crystals that make the chocolate have a nice snap and keep it from blooming blooming as to where it turns white after it melts and hardens up again it's starting to get a little bit thicker yes you know it's kind of thick yeah and it's and it's all smooth there's a test that people do with it you teach the piece of paper and you just dip it a little bit in like that it should have a sheen on it it shouldn't be dull it should be shiny and then it should also snap that means it's been tempered then it's been tempered correctly getting used to the motions to properly temper the chocolate was tricky at first it's awkward if you're ready you want to spread it out a little bit thinner next time but that'll work that'll work it's probably there now so let's put it into that ball time is of the essence at the moment it's good this is called the flood and scrape method you know this is any bubbles yeah I had a little bubble there as I moved on from the 70% dark chocolate to the milk chocolate I started the hang of it and I'll put it back in after quickly cooling in the fridge Peter and I got to sample my freshly made chocolate all right here's the milk chocolate we didn't do such a great job holding these there you go silly and it should be shiny yeah he's got a snap it has tempered chocolate it's good it's a very dark I can taste the fire roasting in the smoke - its I think good though I would call it rustic rustic yeah and not in a bad way but rustic it's got a and very earthy and you can you can taste the small yeah now if you wanted to make it like milk milk chocolate mm-hmm you put a lot more sugar in yeah same amount of milk just more sugar okay all right so thanks you're helping I'll have the three different chocolates so just got termina bars now so thanks thank you subscribe now to keep up to date with new episodes of how to make everything as they're released", "DRCzZI1O62o": "what's going on minecraft fans my name is Luke inaudible and in this video I'm gonna be showing you how to kill the Ender Dragon the first time I ever killed the ender dragon was a couple months ago during my 200 days of hardcore minecraft and honestly there's a lot of conflicting information out there about just what to bring to kill the Ender Dragon so I wanted to make my own guide this guide will have several different sections all detailing different aspects of the ender dragon fight that you have to prepare for and if you want to find a specific section feel free to go down to the description I put all of the timestamps down there but now I think it's time to get going let's jump into the end portal and get started first things first I'm gonna show you how to unlock the ender dragon fight the first thing you're gonna need if you want to fight the ender dragon is an ender pearl you can get them from Enderman as a drop but I prefer to buy them from clerics if you can level up a cleric to expert he'll sell you ender pearls about 50% of the time for not too many emeralds and this is the way I prefer to do it then make your way to the nether to kill blazes for their blaze rods put the blaze rod in your crafting inventory to make blaze powder then combine it with the ender pearl to make an eye of ender when you use an eye of ender I'll point you in the general direction of where you'll find at the end portal and that's where you find the ender dragon follow the eye of ender long enough and eventually you'll make it to the end portal then all you got to do is put a couple aiyah vendors around the end portal frame and the end portal will spawn now you're ready to fight the ender dragon well not yet now we're gonna go over the gear you need to bring for the ender dragon fight what you're looking at on screen now is everything that I brought to the ender dragon fight the first time I fought it and you can tell that I was pretty prepared but this is also equipment from like 13 different guides out there and a lot of it was unnecessary so I'm gonna be gearing up in greed of MO just to show you the perfect loadout for fighting the ender dragon I also recommend practicing for the ender dragon fight in creative mode which I'll show you later first you'll need a diamond sword and the only enchantment that'll help with the Ender Dragon is sharpness so try to get as high as sharpness enchantment as you can you're gonna want to have some type of pickaxe and shovel I recommend diamond and if you want to use an ender chest which is sort of like an extended inventory you also want to have silk touch on your pickaxe though I do want to make it clear with proper preparation you don't really need the ender chest if it's just for a little insurance when I first fought the ender dragon I brought the ender chest but never had to use it he'll definitely need a bow and you want them to have high power and enchantments and if you can also try to get infinity I didn't have infinity the first time I killed the ender dragon I just brought four stacks of arrows and that was more than enough another important aspect about the fight is gonna be the armor that you wear and of course you want to go with the best stuff possible you I'm testing out a full set of diamond armor enchanted with protection and that's the best gear you could possibly have regular diamond armor will work sure but if you have any other sort of protection enchantment like blast protection or fire protection you'll take a lot more damage from the ender dragons fireballs yes even though the Dragon shoots fireballs the fire protection enchantment will do nothing you'll take a ton of damage even with the diamond armor here's a side-by-side comparison of the regular protection enchantment versus fire protection and as you can see regular protection is way better if you can find it it's also in your best interest to put feather falling on your boots it'll help because sometimes you might get shot up in the air in the end of dragon fight another thing you'll definitely want to try to bring is a totem of undying it can really help you can get them from Woodland mansions but another easy way to get them is by doing a level one rate it's not that hard during the later waves of the raiding of ogre will spawn that's this thing if you kill him he'll drop a totem every single time be careful he'll also spawn vex and those things are just straight-up annoying one level one raid can get you three totems if you kill all of the Evoque errs and if you do higher level raids you can get even more the totem of undying will save you from death once but again only once don't worry that wasn't my real hardcore world just that C file I used for the tour as far as food goes I just recommend steak or any other good food and you also want to make sure to bring golden apples for emergencies I brought ten on my fight and didn't even use five of them one other incredibly important aspect about your preparation is a potion of slow falling and I'm gonna show you how to make one here everything you need can be found in my inventory here first thing you need to do is take some blaze powder and put it in your brewing stand then take three glass bottles and fill them up with water and then also put those in the brewing stand like this once those water bottles are done you're gonna put nether wart in the top box here and that'll turn your regular old water into an awkward potion then at a phantom membrane and that'll turn the awkward potion into a potion of slow falling one more step put some redstone into the potion and it'll change the duration from 1 minute and 30 seconds to four whole minutes I recommend bringing at least six that will give you 24 minutes of potion of slow falling effect you're also gonna want to bring 3 strength potions and those are made by putting blaze powder into an awkward potion like you see here I also recommend buffing it up with glowstone to make it a strength potion too it's also very important to bring a carved pumpkin just take a normal pumpkin and right click on it with some shears there you go there's a ton of Enderman in the ender dragon fight and wearing this pumpkin on your head yes obstruct your view but keep you safe from the Enderman honestly you get used to it then make sure you bring some blocks of something easy to break like dirt you're gonna have to make some scaffolding in the Enderdragon fight and it's nice to have something that's easy to break and there you have it all the gear you need to kill the Ender Dragon now let's talk about the fight now we're going to talk about the actual ender dragon fight and my biggest first tip that I have to get out there is that you should practice this fight it's pretty easy in creative mode while a lot of people definitely have problems building end portals inside of creative mode I know a pretty easy trick to build one obviously doing it like this didn't work if you want to easily build an end portal that works every time dig out a little 3x3 square like this and then stand in the middle then place the end portal blocks on the floor around you while standing in the middle these blocks have to be in the perfect orientation to make sure that an end portal will spawn when you put I of Enders in them however if you set it up like I just showed you you should have no problem getting the end portal to spawn and creative from here I recommend using creative mode to pick out your exact loadout and gear that you'll be taking to fight the ender dragon so you can practice with it and then once you're totally geared up you can switch over to survival mode and start the fight assuming you aren't being attacked by a bunch of slimes the first thing you want to do and this is very important is put on your pumpkin head there's a ton of ender men in the ender dragon fight and if you didn't have this pumpkin head they would all start attacking you if you ended up looking at him I've read online that some people like to bring iron golems into this fight for the purpose of fending off the Enderman but I'm just gonna tell you right now it's not that useful and kind of a waste of iron and don't panic the ender dragon fight is not that hard if you just know what to do the biggest thing is always make sure to drink your potion of slow falling and make sure to keep a potion of slow falling in your hotbar for easy access during the entirety of the fight the ender dragon can fling you into the air kind of like this and if you get flung up high enough and don't have a slow falling potion on you could die each potion or last four minutes and the easiest way to keep track is by looking at the icon in the top right if it starts to flash like this that means it's almost out and you've got to drink another one the potion of slow falling will essentially make you immune from the ender dragons launch attack but there's also as fireball attack that you got to worry about too just like the launch attack the ender dragon will do the fireball attack for the duration of the fight so you always have to look out for it it's very easy to dodge all you have to do is wear some good headphones and listen for that fireball sound when you hear it get out of the way as you can see here without even looking at the end of Dragon I was able to dodge his fireball attack just by hearing but again this comes from practice which is why you're here in the first place I also just want to play the fireball sound effect so you know what you're gonna be listening for again this sound effect is gonna be the precursor to every single fireball the Enderdragon shoots I will say you gotta listen carefully it can be a sound that's confused with the wing flap sound of the Enderdragon too but anytime you hear anything that sounds like a fireball just get out of the way the Enderdragon will also sit in the middle like this sometimes and shoot fire and he'll he's not that dangerous in this state as long as you stay away from his mouth obviously you can see that's where all the fire is but when he's done with this state he will come out and use his launched attack on you so make sure you got that potion to slow falling but now we're gonna get on to the business of killing him this is the first space the ender dragons will primarily fly around while you take out the end crystals on top of these obsidian pylons and you always want to start with the two with iron cages on top I found the best way to do this is just build straight up to the top with something easy to break like dirt but be careful it's pretty dangerous again that's what the potion is slow falling is four so all you got to do is place dirt under your feet until you bonk your head kind of like this you can see I can't go up any further once you're here all you got to do is turn around and bonk the thing with your pickaxe it's pretty easy and of course cuz you got your potion a slow falling you can just jump right off now if you're on the way up in the ender dragon shoots a fireball at you just keep building the ender dragon fires on a horizontal plane so if you go up vertical about two more blocks you won't get hurt the most dangerous part of this is when you're right at the top because you can't go up any further so of course once you're up here just turn around and boot that in crystal as quickly as possible again you want to make sure to do the two with iron cages first because it is the hardest maneuver the other ones you can do sort of in the open field and they're a little easier to dodge the fireballs which is gonna be your hardest thing here the end crystals on top of the other pylons without iron cages can be broken very easily with a bow don't use snowballs you look like an idiot it's not that difficult but one thing you definitely don't want to do is break one of these things while you're standing on top of the pylon you will die you can't be level with them of course as you can see this one i broke without any incident and i really don't recommend this because it's super dangerous but if you do build out far enough you can't take the easy shot on one of these end crystals which for some of the taller pylons might be worth it so once you destroy all of the end crystals on top of the obsidian pylons now we're in Phase two there's only two phases so you're almost done good job in Phase two the ender dragon will mostly just fly around and sometimes he'll land in the like he did before but in Phase two of the landing in the middle part is a little more regular again your biggest concern when he's landing in the middle is to stay away from his head not only does he have fire but he can also hit you and shoot you up in the air phase two is very simple and it's where you gonna be killing the ender dragon all you have to do is go behind him jump up and slice the tail sometimes it can be a little difficult to find the sweet spot but the ender dragon will sit there for a while so you'll have some time and then when the ender dragon takes flight again you can just shoot him down with your arrows you won't do too much damage but every little bit helps like I said earlier phase two really isn't that difficult if you can get past phase one you should have no problem killing the ender dragon as you can see I get it here now enjoy the shower of experience points it only happens once oh and definitely don't forget the ender dragon egg it spawns on top of the bedrock thing all you have to do is whack the thing a couple of times until it spawns under some n2 stone then dig under it like you see here put a torch under the block it's sitting on and then delete the block the egg will fall onto the torch and you can pick it up and that's it you killed the ender dragon and took its egg now you can go back to mining or you could watch hundred days for the 17th time in a row anyway that's the end of the video I hope this helps you to kill the Ender Dragon someday it's quite exhilarating and I've got more minecraft planned for you so stay tuned and make sure to subscribe",

me too i love it in particular cadbury i'm here to talk about is the personalization on cadbury gifts direct worth the money we're going to have a look at a real personalized bar and what you can personalize on it and if it's actually worth the money that is asked for it let's get into it my name is jen author of triedandlove.com a blog full of reviews how to's and top lists of products and services that are tried and loved for you for them and for your business we're going to look at all the different size bars that you can personalize perhaps some other alternative versions of the classic dairy milk bar like is there a vegan version is there a low sugar version we're going to get into that and what other products are customizable on cadbury gifts direct that aren't personalizable but are still really cool gifts that you can get before we crack into the main part of the video don't forget to subscribe and like this video if you find some value in it if you subscribe you'll be the first to find out when new videos are posted to help you so what size bars can you customize and personalize on cadbury gifts direct you can personalize all of these sizes so they go here from the 45 grams to the 850 gram bar now these are not personalized ones but you can get a bit of an idea of the size in comparison to my face that 850 is the biggest one that they offer in general and for personalization as well so what can you personalize on a dairy meal bar well you can actually personalize three different places so i'm going to show you here on a 45 gram bar so you can personalize the front as you can see i've put tried and loved review so you can have up to 27 characters on the front now as your bar gets bigger so does the font size on the front so it's the same amount of characters no matter if you get the smallest bar or the biggest bar and then on the back you can personalize two different places you can personalize the photograph which again gets bigger with the size of the bar and also up to 150 characters of a message on the back again gets gross in size with the size of the bar so i managed to fit in let's take a look at how the personalization looks on the smallest personalized gift from cadbury i can fit up to 150 characters in the space here that's a nice long message so you can say happy birthday in the name you can say i love you such and such or a funny message on the front and then really get into the sentimental stuff on the back so every bar has the same personalization now you may have noticed already that the personalization isn't actually on the bar inside is a standard dairy milk bar it's a sleeve that you get now when i first read that it was a sleeve i wasn't too sure i was thinking well it's just a bit of card isn't it and i'm the chocolate's no different but then actually if you think about it the recipient can gobble this up really enjoy it but then keep this i've got a couple of these in my keepsake box in my shed from different uh activities and things that i've done and people said thanks or nice messages and i've kept them like you would keep a greetings card that meant something to you so this is a nice touch actually and i think it looks a little bit more higher class rather than just the flimsy material on the bar you get a nice solid piece of card that can be kept now cadbury gifts direct do offer a reward system so every pound that you spend you get a penny back in a chocolate chunk as they call it you can get extra chunks on special promotions and when you sign up you get 100 chunks so that's a pound off so it's worth signing up too doesn't cost you anything to do in terms of other dietary requirements and other products that cadbury gifts direct offer as part of the personalization range it is only this bar now the personalization only applies to dairy milk but you can get the lower sugar 30 lower sugar bar in some of the other customizable gifts which we'll get into and also you can buy um the bars individually off the gifts website but you can't get it personalized it's just part of custom package packages or the bars on their own in terms of a vegan option i understand that born the bournville fingers actually are classed as a vegan um chocolate but they they're not offered at all in any of the ranges of personalized or customized products as yet so let's talk about prices currently at the time i'm recording this video a bar like this is two pounds 69 to personalize so don't forget in the shops it's about 60 pence so if you personalize it you're paying another 2 pound and nine p i think that's pretty worth it the only thing that put me off slightly about purchasing the smaller bar was the delivery cost because the delivery cost is the same regardless the size of bar it works on how much you spend so i think if it's up to ten pounds it costs three pound ninety-five if your order is over ten pounds which is the larger bars it's going to take you up to five pound fifty for delivery and if you want next day deliver it goes from six pound enough so if you're just buying one of these for one address you've got to ask yourself how much do you need that personalization i guess um but i think the best value for money in terms of delivery and whole bar is the 850 grand bar the big one that's because the 850 grand bar is 13 pounds to personalize that is only about another three pound f uh three pound fifty more than without personalization and okay you can pay five pound fifty for delivery but it's a huge gift and it's something you can't always get on a standard shop shelf because the 850 bar is something that's a little bit more special so i'd pay that little bit extra to get that special bar and it's not too far off the personalization price to the original price so i don't think any of it is outrageous considering the quality of what you get and the uh different places that you can personalize it's three different places but i think if you go for the 850 pound bar you're gonna get as much as you can for your money so what other gifts do cadbury gifts direct offer they offer three different types of customizable gifts as well as the personalized bars so one of those is the customizable hamper the cadbury hamper now literally you can spend as little or as much as you want in the hamper you can add as many things as you like and it's not just bars it's drinks it's biscuits it's sweets it's boxes it's everything every product even up to a box of 48 uh creme eggs and that'll be my dream please somebody buy me a hamper with boxes of boxes of cream eggs anyway i'm getting off on a tangent so you can put as many things as you like into the hamper now the extra cost is how you want to present the hamper so they do a bag or a cardboard box or around three pounds or a really nice wicker basket but it is 15 pounds so depends what your budget is to what you choose you can also choose not to have it displayed in one of their hampers you can just choose all of the items and then you can display it yourself but do remember if you go on amazon you buy a wicker basket it's gonna cost you seven to twenty pounds anyway then you're gonna have to buy the sort of insert straw or whatever you wanna use um you want to package it yourself then post it it might be worth for the hassle just taking on one of their hampers another customizable gift at cadbury gifts direct is the postal selection box and it's exactly what it says it's a selection box of bars i think it's about 30 different bars you can choose from and you can have 10 bars in your selection box it comes in a purple colored cardboard box presented nicely it's no thrills mind you doesn't look luxurious but it is presented nice in a cadbury box and it's 11 pounds and delivery at the moment is free so you can put whatever chocolate your gifty loves in there and i do remember though if you're gonna go for something like a freddo or a chomp which only costs like 25 p do you want to get a selection box because you're probably going to be overpaying for that chocolate or would you rather do that one yourself but if you're looking for a range of different chocolates and just want to make it look like a nice gift i think 11 pound is is a great price for a gift that you can do order from home you don't have to go out they will present it nice and send it for you so that's the postal selection box 10 bars for 11 pounds the final customizable gift option on cadbury gifts direct at the moment is the daring meal letterbox gift you have up to four bars and the bars are the 110 to 120 grand bars i think there's about seven choices on there at the moment and it costs 10 pounds delivery is free again it is sent the same way as a postal selection box so it's in a purple colored uh cadbury cardboard box it's presented nicely now again it's not luxurious please bear that in mind but it is well presented so again for a tenner it's a great easy cool gift to send so what's my conclusion to the personalized and customizable gifts at cadry gifts direct i'd say they're all good value for money but in some combinations just be aware for example the small bar be aware that even though the personalization price is fair you're going to pay a slightly higher delivery charge than the actual bars worth so you need to consider if you want to do that the larger bars are definitely more value for money if you want to buy a customizable gift they're all fantastic i think all three the hamper the postal selection box and the dairy milk letterbox there's so much customization that you can do with it for the money so the hamper you can present it beautifully in a nice wicker basket so budget is no option that is probably one for

want to get your pans prepared you'll need a nine inch round pan line it with wax paper and then you'll need a eight or nine inch square pan also with wax paper so I have those prepared and ready to go and grab a medium saucepan we're going to go over to the stove so over medium heat in our large saucepan we're going to combine two cups of sugar 3 cups of peanut butter 2 cups of corn syrup and we're going to heat this until the sugar dissolves into the peanut butter in the corn syrup so now the sugar and the peanut butter is all melted together you'll need 12 cups of Special K cereal I can put it in a large bowl because you don't have to stir this all in I'm going to use half of the cereal mixture first just so it's not so hard but you just pour this Oh for that I'm surrett so once you have the peanut butter sugar mixture in cereal you'll put it into your prepared pans and I like pick up piece of wax paper and really pop it in there I really press it firm because this is the base of your cake so here I have a 13-inch base plate and we're going to going to pull that 9-inch round one out or you could flip it on there so you want to set the base aside and now with this square pan we're going to put it on a cutting board and remove the wax paper and you what I did was parchment paper I cut out a six inch circle and a three inch circle so with a knife I'm going to use that as a pattern and you might want to make sure it fits just going to flatten this out so I can get both my circles on there because these are going to be the next two layers over cake so with a knife I'm using this raid s super pair it's my favorite knife it has this nice big handle as it's almost like a little flame it has a nice angled blade a sharp point and we're just gonna cut around that 6-inch circle and if you have to you could um push that together to the leftovers to cut out your 3-inch just make sure you really mold it together so it doesn't fall apart and then cut out your three inch circle so we're going to set those circles aside and we're going to make our edible glue and that's going to be two cups of milk chocolate chips and two cups of butterscotch chips and we're going to melt these in the microwave until it's smooth so it took about a minute and a half to melt these chips it's nice and smooth what we're going to do is use this to frost that first layer the layer that you have on your base this is the rate of super pair right this is another thing I love it's just long enough to reach into a peanut butter or mayonnaise jar has just a little bit of serrations so if you want to slice your toast after you butter it okay so once you have that spread we're going to place our Center this six inch one again we'll cross that and then we'll put our Center our three inch one oh hey you might want to let that cool just so you have a stable base before because the next thing we're going to do is put on our KitKat bars alright so starting at the top you're going to put our chocolate on the side and then you're going to immediately set you need 42 of these snack sized KitKat bars and we're just going to set those on there you might have to hold them to steady them and when that chocolate cools that the chips are going to glue those in place and then you do the same thing on the second layer and if the chocolate gets messy in there that's fine because we're going to fill those up with M&Ms now that you have your second layer done and if you need to just use a single one to fill in space that works too also another tip it's good to have the letters all going the same way to make it look uniform so then your last layer do the same thing so now we have our layers made and we're going to fill those layers with a 42 ounce bag of M&Ms it doesn't hurt to UM make the cake the night before you fill it because of the chocolate isn't set yet it isn't in a hold or M&Ms very well now we have all our M&Ms and for a little decorative feature what I like to do is take gum ball and a skewer just push that gum ball on the pointed side of the skewer and I like to stick those in the top you could break them off different heights and how cute is that now your whole kit and kaboodle cake is ready to serve you and press your friends and family you could put birthday candles in the middle if you wanted just really a unique layer cake idea you", "A0NPas0h45s": "hello and welcome to InDesign stock code at UK I'm engineer I'm defective genuine state for thank you for joining me on the birthday extravaganza stays put up we've got this little box that holds because he doesn't love chocolate on their birthday and this is project number four so we're halfway through the week it's gone so quick hasn't it yes therefore this was nice cute little box nothing is quite a luxurious box of chocolates of it it just makes a little chocolate bar really sweet and if you wanted to you can actually wrap this with DSP and I was just thinking of that now because it just put it so you could wrap that and you could personalize it as well it makes it even more special but we're not going to do that today because I've done other projects any great so for today's put it I'm going to stick with the black theme and it's not too much scoring so I hope look sharp on camera but yes so we're gonna be using it's a memento black ink and then we're gonna be used to frame as well yes no cold so let me just grab the scoreboard put that to the side okay so again don't worry about writing down any of the measurements because they will be over on my blog if you're watching it on youtube click the show more box and that will open up all the links you can go to my online shop everything comes from there as well and it will it's a direct link to this project so it's not gonna just take you to my website and then throw you in them card it's gonna be a very link to this project and it'll be the measurements will be at the bottom bottom of the page I'm so if you're watching this on my blog then scroll to the bottom of the page will be there it'll be in inches and centimeters as well I just don't mind centimeters so I don't mention them but I do have them in centimeters on my blog because a lot of people did request the centimeters so it'd be as close as I can get to but because I don't work them centimeters it could be a bit a bit off slightly yes so to start with you need a piece of cost of these eight and a quarter by eight and three quarters now we'll say if you're doing this in the States and we've got this slightly wider card isn't it yours is eight and a half leave it in half because you'll get an extra bit of the tab which actually work a bit back because this one it's quite small it's quite a short tab so if you're working with eight and a half just keep it eight-and-a-half just cut it in three quarters and then you'll get a longer tap just cuz I'd stop say and a quarter which is a bit frustrating okay so on the eight and eight and a quarter size you need to screw it up five-eighths of an inch there then it's seven and a quarter and then at seven and seven eighths I'm just gonna turn it round and we're gonna score it at three and a half four of one eight at seven and five eighths and then eight and a quarter okay so I screwed another and this is one of those really quick easy boxes oops too much those quick easy boxes that you can knot together quite quickly so if there's a little birthday you forgot or even if it's just a little treat you wanted to give to somebody okay and I think it's quite sweet galaxy is there lots of ice within Recovery's a lot of parents go anymore and it used to be just love how silky galaxy isn't it just it just has more flavours for it sure there's lots of other chocolates I really study and I don't chuckles but I don't too much unless it's forever which it still reminds me of Kingdom so I'm still a kitty chocolate yeah okay so this will be the box of clothes so all we need to do now is snip up these bits at the end we're going to cut this one away I'm gonna do the same at the top so just going to slightly martyr that in both edges there and this will just create our tags so I hope you've been enjoying the birthday extravaganza Mexico halfway for it now probably it's gone so quick yep which means my birthday is already gone and everything so it's a good way of drawing it out for an extra picture a little bit of time so we're gonna cut this bottom one away all the way across that's it this would be the back of the box down here that we're gonna just slightly lighter that get in here cut straight down this one because that will be flat and then you want to cut away that first school I know because we don't need that and actually we didn't need to cut that much of it in I've cut too much so that's me thinking of chocolate straight down that one straight down that one tiny white wooden that do this bit here so you want to do a small-timer they just want to basically take away dope no bleach because otherwise it's not going to close properly which is probably what I'm going to find but least I can show you what happens if you cut too much okay now for the tabs I want to make them nice and round so I'm going to use the school a detailed trio punch I think yes we're just gonna for then that's great because you can make tags and all sort of a bit but it has a corner on over to a rope and it's a really nice smooth round come on up they just need to push it in as far as it goes and then punch it out so much easy so I don't need to grab my overlay punch board every time order do it for right now which is good okay so we need to do now is please biscuit we're gonna add our DSP first so the DSP measures six and three days but so many of my desk is crazy at the moment okay so it's six and three eighths by three and a quarter and maybe are doing it the other tomber it's so hot today that everything is just drying up including me I'm feeling really hydrated today okay then we're just gonna add that just in the center pop thanks sir okay and then we just want to leave this tap here to this side there and you can use your own tear and tape this if you want because it should be the same size no might be a bit tricky for you see I did plan on filming during the day so it would be much brighter but it's been so hot and where I craft it's right in front of the window I just haven't been able to cross too much during the day and when I have done it it's made me feel really sick because I've been so hot so I'm gonna just push these in I'm gonna just add a little bit of tongue back to those tabs and that would just hold them in place push that one there we're just gonna [Music] have some time over there and then just thank you trying to burn folder or your maybe a reading ice on it just to swish there in place that is our box almost done Lucy nice and cute okay so we're just gonna do our top I have a box that you need to have a little celebrate celebratory message on the front so we're just gonna I just cut a scrap of whisper white and I just made it so that it will fit the marquee sign so we're going to be stamping kind of in the center and hopefully you'll get it in the right place hope it hasn't dried up too much oops actually using a stump arise for this would be good as well saying you could double stamp it which I think actually did for the younger label yeah and also this a new dry huh it's quite juicy just doesn't look it okay so we're using the hooray and it's your birthday I'm just gonna wind up up there like so okay any of these out the way all we need to do then it just add some tombow to the back my plane just be careful with the frame you don't want to add too much glue to be we just enough to kind of yes [Music] and then we're just gonna just the frame around that then we're gonna cut that up like so swish it down photos okay then why don't you use ourselves now it'd be really cool actually if you did it in black or maybe a different color you could use some of the metallic metallic pearls that Lina called when I was actually planning all these projects that were out stop by the time I came back in stock it was too late for me to order them in time to be able to see the products and to record it they are actually in stock now and they are part of the suite so you can find them all on page I think it's 68 oh my catalog I'm just gonna use the slips and snips are great for this because thank you sharp right to the point so just make sure your fingers right the way because you can cut yourself but I've done that before on camera as well because they are that sharpen you don't realize how sharp they are and I people I said it yeah it's which of these are like razor sharp to the tip so you do need to be kind of careful how you're using them okay so that's that Kyle and I do have a little folder so I always make sure I put them there and that keeps the tip pretty sharp as well so we're just gonna chuck some of our mixtures on the back of that the right place I don't just use the envious knowing you need to do them issues pop it on the top of your box I say it's a nice quick and easy project to do and I think it would fit most sized chocolate bars I think most of them around the same kind of size is do a slight bit adjustment but the galaxy chocolate bar is gosh I can't ever the measurements of it I'll take it out and show you anything I'll measure it for you in a sec so actually only have fun bollocks I suppose okay so this one is six and a half by three and a quarter so if you've got chocolate bar that's that size and I think it's about half an inch for it yeah it's roughly about half an inch wide which is why over the extra eight little bit of wiggle room there you go that is our project today so this is a nice quick and easy don't project to do and I guess if you wanted to do them and you didn't want to do some straightaway don't do the N flap just put something tear on tape on it and then you can keep it folded flat until you're ready to use them that's a little tip for you there we go there is our project for today I really like that wood there mmm see the glitter it's really what gift a golden flow it just I love the way that the gold floor looks and I've got really a cold person I just don't really nice I mean like okay that's how projects stay and don't forget to come back tomorrow don't put it number five gosh it's going so quick like saying if you are gonna be placing order and order with me this month remember that everybody that shops during birthday week and doing my birthday extravaganza week I should say gets it extra little little goody so just bear that in mind and if you use the reward code this month which is which be over on my website as well you'll get an extra little something as well so lots of surprises and lots of stuff to give away this won't give away but to earn the earning is available better way to use so let me go I will see you again tomorrow bye bye", "dIEdsmlDA1w": "Welcome to a Dark Chocolate Party!

Thank you for watching! <3", "Fo-Aq5VhGaA": "hey guys it's Brian welcome back to my channel today is another candy eating video I know it's been a really long time since I've done I can to eating video but I finally got some stuff out of the way and I finally was able to get some more candy and you know so let's go ahead and try out what I have here so guys today's candy comes all the way from Great Britain once again and so I've done a couple of Great Britain candy eating videos but this one it's coming from there they're kind of popular treats I guess for a great button and I bought these from a supplier on Amazon so there are probably 10 to perfor is in here so they kept all of these they look really great since there's 10 I'm going to do 5 so it's gonna be a two part video so 5 today and 5 the next time so let's get started and try some of these interesting budget very popular candy bars from Great Britain ok guys so my first candy bar is the Cadbury Dairy Milk now I do want to warn you guys that some of these will be really melted because it is really hot down here in south Louisiana and during transport they melted which is really sad so but they still should taste just as good let's open it and give it a try just to notice that the chocolate will have bloomed a bit since melted chocolate when it hardens back again in April of blue as you can obviously see right here so guys I would plead Eve that they probably were in it looked so funny they were in little triangles most likely but you can still see the word Cadbury on the side right there it says temper so they were in little triangles like this so you go snap off one and they have melted considerably but they still should be good so let's give it a try actually this wasn't too bad it reminds me of Easter chocolate the things that we really get in the u.s. that are not really high quality chocolate products haven't saying that Cadbury is a book I've had Canterbury chocolate before but that really reminds me of things like Easter and of course Cadbury I think in us is mainly East or things that reminds me of a like Cadbury bunny or whatever but that if they just like the chocolate I'm used to for like Easter candy um has a really kind of tacky kind of chocolatey taste and the bloom doesn't really take it away anything actually does it tastes like a chocolate that I'm really used to and during that season Easter so that's your bad by the way guys just let you know all these are can't bear talks but they're really popular ones or so I'm told okay so the next one I have is the Cadbury picnic bar looks like it has just about everything in it that you could possibly imagine raisins and peanuts I guess they're crunchy chewy fruity you don't really have any bars with fruit in it all that much in America so this is kind of interesting raisins yeah we definitely got some poisons and candy bars so let's open it so this wasn't taking part of their play it actually turned out pretty well didn't really melt all that much which is really good but you can see everything packed up inside there peanuts and raisins so it's gonna try overall it's hardly a bad Bart really kind of like a trail mix sort of thing which I like salty and sweet all together which is really great and a different sweetness than chocolate sweet I'm because fruit kinda gives a different sweetness then regular really rich chocolate that's such a really nice not a whole lot of travel is just the outside I think it does have sort of like a caramel thing inside to give it all smash together and I think there are like the rice bubbles in there so crunchy from the peanuts but also crunchy from little rice bobble things but like I said a really nice contrast to sweetness from fruit and then chocolate on the outside so that's really good here is the next temperate part that I have a something called a flake now I don't know if the bar just kind of melted or whatever like this but let's open it and see it says that it is the clumsiest flaky is love chocolate so we're gonna see why they say that okay so here is the bar let me show you guys so there it is this is why it is the crumbly it's like yes because it's basically just a bunch of really thinly rolled pieces of chocolate together which is really really cool I didn't know this was a sort of thing about people maybe so that's really awesome something to try and see if it is in fact crumbly or it might have just all melted together No is really crumbling they fell apart my him I'm not sure why anybody would eat those okay there's chocolate but it's really messy thank our livery not sure why sorry maybe just a fun candy but when you bite into it just kind of falls apart it does taste like the other Cadbury chocolate bar um maybe a bit lighter no it's heavy of course since it's just kind of like crumbles of chocolate there right so maybe something cools if I crush up easily and then put over something like decoration or something like that that would be useful for that but I'm not very bad for it I'll just really messy all right guys the next camp every bar I have is the crunchy bar it's I'm guessing lip stuff but with golden honeycomb Center which I'm had honey come before I believe I had it in my other British candy video but I've also had it in the Australian video that I made with my indian video series so hopefully this one tastes just like those actually I don't mind honeycomb I think I'm actually really good I've actually meant to try to make it myself it's actually pretty easy but I've never gotten around to doing that maybe that's something in the future I should make that but like a it's kind of blooms like the other chocolate because it smells little bit not too bad looking though it's kind of like really weird kind of twirly whirly pattern which is really cool wish you guys could see it a little bit right there see that's what I'm playing around and so it's not too bad it's actually really nice little bit a really pretty bar it hadn't bloomed but let's give it a try there's a honeycomb right there um did sort of melt a bit like I said it's really hot so during transportation it melted but some was a lot of its holes which is really cool that's really sweet but really really good I like the texture fighting it's a honeycomb just like biting into like a really kind of hard pillowy Rock but it's really cool we don't have much candy like this actually I know I can't even think of a comparison in America I see this kind of candy but it's really good I like that so ever since I had it in my Australian video I've been wanting to make it like I said and it's really cool like the color of it like a yellow some of them aren't actually yellow though they're just kind of right because it's just bicarbonate soda and sugar and stuff like that so yeah this is not too bad it's really nice kind of has that fluffy pillow any kind of texture you know kind of hard as well I really don't know what to say besides it's like a hard cotton candy covered in chocolate without that cotton candy flavor so really good okay guys in the last candy for today and this video is the can't bury a double-decker now I'm not even sure what this is so let's read it they've tried them in soft chewy nougat and a crunchy cereal bottom so double-decker sounds delicious looks really big but we're gonna give it a shot anyway I like the colors though by the way purple and this orange color very nice so let's open it and see I'll argue I could definitely tell why they closed double section most likely the nougat supposed to be inside the bar and not outside the bar but you guys gotta get the drift of that it's not supposed to be outside I'm supposed to be on the inside I think but like I said it's melting so it is a really big bar so let's just so nougats on top and crunchy cereals on the bottom it has a really interesting flavor and almost gets like coffee for some reason I don't know if that's the nougat or maybe the bottom portion does it really taste all that good I mean you know I kind of think that sweetness but the nougat tastes like coffee and I don't know which is really all because I like the coffee flavor but I'm just not really sure about why it tastes the way it does the cereal is really hard I'm not sure is it a certain type of cereal it's not like the rice bubbles that are kind of like nice and you know easy to eat these are a little bit harder they're like kind of like a grain that's really crunchy so I don't know what kind of cereals in the bottom now they custom to that kind of crunchy cereal it's like a granola sort of yeah like I said the nougat is kind of I don't know whether it's the chocolate within the cereal or the nougat that's kind of like coffee flavored sort of it's kind of weird I can't differentiate whether or not it's that one or the other but overall really good bar it's really big we have a different style of this kind of thing it's you know our candy bars are sort of similar to this but double-decker definitely can see why it's called that and it's pretty big you know like the buses the double-decker buses so yeah soft taco crispy bottom right not too bad okay guys that's it for today in my very chocolatey are eating video and since it is also a British but it's also a Cadbury eating video well I do have five more bars that I will be eating later on and they look really interesting so we'll be trying those a little bit later but guys that's it for this video hopefully if you saw any of the bars that you like to eat or ever had any of these please let me know in the comments below remember to give this video a like thumbs up I definitely share this video in other videos with your friends really

get straight to it tv bar has two quite different parts a crisp and crunchy center and a chocolate coating on the outside the basic ingredients for the center of the bar are rice krispies roasted coconut and cocoa powder the drums move to a continuous mixer and the mix is poured into a hopper the ingredients filter into the machine as they are needed and are blended with a cocoa based binder to form a gooey chocolate based mix of ingredients the mix travels up a conveyor belt and is deposited into an extruder machine the sheet of extruded material is soft and pliable and is quite thick and uneven as it moves along the conveyor it passes through a second rolling process where it is put under pressure and compressed to the thickness of the inside of a tv bar the sheet passes through a cooling process in the first of a series of cooling tunnels at each stage of production the product needs to be at a specific state of hardness the cooler will cause the binder to solidify as it cools so that it will reach the hardness that is required for machining chocolate will become solid at around 32 degrees centigrade the sheet passes through a slitting separating and guillotine station where the bars are slit by a series of knives and cut by a guillotine to the correct length a special conveyor belt separates each bar as it moves towards the enrobing station is made by kneading and working a mixture of cocoa and milk powder with powdered milk and cocoa butter at about 75 degrees celsius in a conch machine the constant movement at high temperatures causes the mixture to become liquid chocolate in the enrobing machine each bar passes through a curtain of molten chocolate receiving a thin covering in the first of two enrobing processes as long as the temperature is kept above 32 degrees centigrade the chocolate will be kept in liquid form below 32 degrees the chocolate will begin to solidify a vibration machine removes excess chocolate the bars are cooled to harden the chocolate coating and pass through a second in roving machine where they receive a final coating to bring the outside chocolate layer to the correct thickness [Music] the complete bars pass through a final cooling process in which they'll spend about 12 minutes traveling through a long cooling tunnel at 12 degrees celsius as they emerge from the cooling tunnel the chocolate has solidified and the finished bars move to the wrapping stations pre-printed rolls of wrapping material are loaded into the machine each bar is sealed in a wrapper cut to size and separated this machine can wrap thousands of bars per hour [Music] tv bar also comes in a white chocolate coating white chocolate is white in color because there's no cocoa in the mix the outer layer is made from cocoa butter milk powder and sugar which is mixed together to produce the white coating well you've seen it all i'm going to sample some of these so i'll see you next time [Music] you", "9h7DVXyjSVQ": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "SiK1tFQn6GY": "Greetings my beautiful lovelies! It's Emmy. Welcome back. Today I'm going to be making a bar of chocolate, but I'm going to be making this bar of chocolate from the cacao pod -- the original cocoa beans that come in the pod. Now if you've missed my Fruity Fruits episode where I open the cocoa pod, and show you the contents and where the beans are located, be sure to check out that video -- I'll put a link up above and down below. So I knew from the very beginning it was going to be a laborious process and, my gosh, I'm not even done yet, and it has been, but I've learned a ton. So let me show you what I've done so far to get me to my current state of chocolate-ness. So after opening my cocoa pod up, I took the beans which are covered in this kind of little mucilaginous sack and I put them in a glass jar. So the next step is an important one for developing flavor, and for helping to remove some of that slime. We're gonna take the beans and put them in a container, cover them up and allow them to ferment for about four or five days. Now after the second day, I noticed that not much was happening, and then I read more about it and I learned that the fermentation process needs to occur around one hundred degrees. So what I did was, then I put it into my proofer, set the temperature and let it sit for another two days. So, total fermentation time was about five days. And after the five days, I noticed the beans had taken on this kind of pinkish, reddish hue -- most of the white slime was gone, and now we are ready to dry the beans. So typically, the drying process is done out in the sun, and the beans are raked until they're nice and crispy and dry. Sooo... since I live in New England, and it's winter right now, there's not a lot of sun, and so I placed the beans in my food dehydrator. then every so often, I would give them a turn, and they were in there for a total of, probably, two days. So, at this point I only had beans from one cocoa pod, and I didn't know if it would be enough to create a chocolate bar, so I ordered some cacao beans that were raw -- that had not been roasted -- and then I roasted them at the same time as the beans that I had dried myself. Just to make sure that I'd have enough material to create a chocolate bar. So then I spread the beans out onto a cookie sheet, in a nice even layer, and I put them in a two hundred and sixty-six degree Fahrenheit oven, and I roasted them for thirty minutes. Then I increased the temperature to two hundred and eighty-four degrees Fahrenheit and I baked them for another five minutes. So after the baking time, I took the cookie sheets out. So once the beans were completely cooled, we had to winnow the beans, and that means 'to remove the shell or husk on the outside of the beans'. And at this point, the husk or the outside of the beans should shatter, and kind of come off easily -- if you just rub the bean and give it a squeeze, It should be nice and crisp, and just kind of flake off the cocoa bean, which is the part that we want -- inside. Now this part ended up being a really fun project to do with my boys, I have two sons: ages four and six, and we had the best time removing the shells off the beans. Emmy: \"We don't want the shell, that's tough.\" \"We just want the precious bean inside, and grind that up, and that's gonna make our chocolate.\" \"That's right! It is the colour of chocolate. These ones come from Peru, same place Paddington comes from.\" \"He went to England, remember, he went to London?\" \"His uncle did, right? The aunt made it.\" \"I think so.\" Next, we have to process cacao nibs -- namely we have to grind them into a cocoa paste, or chocolate paste, and that will be the chocolate liqueur that will give all that lovely flavor to our chocolate bar. Down below in the description, I will put all the videos and the links to the references I used to create my chocolate bar. One of them, of course, being Ann Reardon's 'How To Cook That' channel (@howtocookthat). Where, in her video, she takes raw cocoa beans and makes them into a chocolate bar, as well. But I found another video specifically for making a small batch of chocolate (@horjerj). He recommended using a small coffee grinder. So, what we did was, we took our cacao nibs, and we, first we mashed them -- used a little mortar and pestle -- and we crushed them so the nibs would be smaller -- and a little bit easier for the coffee grinder to manage. I like dark chocolate, and I like my dark chocolate a little bit more on the sweet side, so I decided to do a sixty-five percent dark chocolate bar. So the calculation I did for that was: one hundred grams of the cacao nibs, to sixty grams of sugar, and then nine grams of cocoa butter. So, as you can imagine, the hopper inside the coffee grinder is quite small, so we had to do this in installments of about four batches, just so we didn't overtax the motor. So the first thing you're gonna do is take your sugar, pour it in, and you're gonna pulverize that until you get powdered sugar. So add some of your cacao nibs, add some of your sugar, and grind that until you can grind it no more. First you'll get this kind of powdery substance, and then as more cocoa butter is released, it'll become a paste. It's also important to stop between grinds and scrape the sides of the bowl, and off the top, Because you want to get everything really well incorporated. Once we've ground this as far as we can go, we're gonna add our cocoa butter, and I'm adding 9 grams, Again, we're doing this in batches. And at this point, it should really look luscious and 'chocolate-like'. Next, we're gonna do a conching process. Typically, this is done in machines that have stones that just grind the chocolate for hours, To get that really velvety, smooth chocolate mouthfeel. And, also it's supposed to release, like, volatile gases and just improve the flavor of the chocolate bar. Now, of course, these contour machines are not inexpensive, and I decide to take the DIY route, And use a stone mortar and pestle - and you just grind this for as long as you can - the longer, the better. Even my sons at this point were just like, \"No mama, we're tapping out. We're good, thanks mama.\" So I was here, grinding the chocolate. So this is the next step, and this is where I am at, now. We need to temper the chocolate. Now, what does tempering mean? If you've worked with chocolate at all, or want to work with chocolate at all, you've definitely heard about tempering. But it's kind of this mysterious thing. So, tempering, means if we're going to get the chocolate in the state in which we want the cocoa butter crystals to be in their beta state. And cocoa butter has six different forms of crystals, and the state we want is the beta state. Now that's what gives us a shiny glossy chocolate bar, that has a really great snap to it, And it doesn't have any white spots, 'beta crystals', that's what we want. So how do we isolate those crystals and get them to form inside our chocolate bar? We temper. So the first thing we need to do, is melt the chocolate. Get it into this state where there are no crystals, blah blah blah, Everyone's just melted. Then we cool the melted chocolate down, Sometimes this is done on marble slabs, with little scrapers. But the point is, we want to cool the temperature down to 82 to 81 degrees Fahrenheit. This is when the crystals start to reform. Now, we increase the temperature up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. At this point, this little bit of heat is melting some of those other crystals we don't want. Again, isolating it down to just our happy beta crystals. Now, at 90 degrees, our chocolate is at temper. It's gonna be beautiful, glossy and shiny, We just have to hold it at that temperature. We can mold it and shape it, yadda yadda. And then, once we cool it down to around 50 degrees, we're gonna have some beautiful, snappy, glossy chocolate. That's the idea at least, right? So there are many different ways of tempering chocolate, You can use the seeding technique, you can use the marble slab technique. But I've never used 'this' technique, and this, is the sous-vide technique. Basically, a sous-vide is a water circulator with a thermostat, It keeps the water at the temperature in which you set it. Your food never gets overcooked, because it can never go above the temperature at which you set it. It's brilliant. And I was inspired to use this sous-vide technique for tempering chocolate by Alex the French guy (@frenchguycooking). If you don't know him, he's a lovely fellow, and he has a channel here on YouTube that's very popular. I'll put the link down below in case you don't know him. So after I conched my chocolate, I placed the chocolate into a plastic bag And then I put it inside another plastic bag, because it's very important that we do not get any water in our chocolate. It will cause the chocolate to seize, and get all funky and hard and it will just ruin everything. So that is the Achilles heel of this technique, we mustn't let any water get inside the chocolate. While this is getting up to temperature, it's important to give it an occasional knead to make sure that Everything is consistently the right temperature. Okay, so we're about 122 degrees, now we're going to decrease this temperature down to 81 degrees, And to speed this along, I'm going to add a bunch of ice. Tempering is a finicky procedure. You have to constantly stick a thermometer in there, And you're just getting chocolate everywhere. This, everything is contained, it's just in a plastic baggie. You're not wasting any chocolate, on your bowls, on your spatula, and the precision is also wonderful, too. This has a thermostat, so this would be at the temperature I want it to be. It won't get any hotter because it can't get any hotter. I love that. Let that sit there for a little bit. Now, we're gonna increase this temperature to 90 degrees, and then we'll be ready to pour it into our mold, Which is exciting, because that means we're almost at the end of this arduous *burp* process. Let's go ahead and pour our chocolate. So I got myself a little polycarbonate chocolate bar mold. This needs to be very, very dry and clean. Now I'm gonna dry this bag off thoroughly. And this is dry as well. Yes! Another thing that got me really excited about this technique is, look, I can just push all the chocolate down, Into a corner, cut the corner, and then fill my mold. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Oh man, so this is looking delicious. Now the texture looks a bit thicker. *furiously tapping* Sorry about the noise! *more furious tapping* So, I'm gonna actually get a little bit more, let's just fill this up. Oh my goodness, more than one bar -- ha ha! Now for a little noise. *tap tap tap TAP TAP TAP* So now we're supposed to let this cool at room temperature, I believe Alex said it was fifty degrees Fahrenheit, which is even more ideal. You don't want to put it in the refrigerator, because what can happen is, If the chocolate starts getting really cold, you can get condensation. And water and chocolate, *no no*, So I think you can cool it initially a little bit in the fridge but then make sure to take it out before any condensation forms. Okay, so I'll be right back, then we'll taste this thing! *TAPS* Now, the moment we've been waiting for. Let's unmold the chocolate bar. Nice and firm to the touch. Ok, I'm just gonna... work it out. Oh, yes, did you see it release? Look, I just work it and you can see it kind of releasing from the polycarbonate because you can see through it. Oh, yes. Come on, chocolate bar. Just, release. Twist. Oh, yeah. Yeah! Ready? Dun dun dun duuun! It's a chocolate bar. And it's gorgeously tempered, beautifully shiny. Oh. My. Goodness. I'm so happy, look at that. You know I get pretty excited about these little projects, but this one I'm really excited about. Look how beautiful this chocolate bar's turned out. I'm so happy, I think what I'm most happy with is this reflective sheen. It's the hallmark characteristic of a good temper, so temper is basically, Just controlling the crystallization of the cocoa butter, that's all it is. A couple air bubbles that didn't pop so I probably could have tapped this a little bit more. I don't see any signs of blooming, which is great. So, all indications of a good temper. Now, the final test is to see how well it snaps, and if you've tempered it properly, it should snap nicely. All right. Here we go *dull snaps* Not as crisp as it could be - it didn't snap as loudly as I would have liked - but, the final test, the taste. Let's give it a go. Here we go, itadakimasu! Hmm... Now, It definitely doesn't have the snap of a dark-chocolate that I like - that signature crisp loud snap - And, in terms of mouthfeel, it's not nearly as smooth as it needs to be. I think it's something like 20 - 30 microns, if you get below that in terms of the size of the grains, Is when the tongue is not able to perceive any kind of grainy texture. So that is very, very fine and conching usually takes hours. So, I definitely detect a kind of graininess to it, but not unpleasant. The flavor though, is absolutely delicious. Mm-hmm, that clear distinct rich flavor of chocolate, which I wasn't sure if I'd be able to get. I did ferment my beans myself, although I did mix in some beans that I'd purchased, that were raw. Which had been fermented, as well. Really great chocolate flavor, and I made this as a 65% dark chocolate bar, So there is 60 grams of sugar in here. So, a pretty sweet dark chocolate bar, but that's kind of how I like my dark chocolate. I like a good, bitter seventy percent chocolate bar, but my little sweet spot's more like sixty-five.. I like it a little bit on the sweeter side. I think the thing that's really lacking is mouthfeel. I think I also detect the sugar granules as well. The density of the chocolate bar is a little bit different. While it snaps, in your mouth, it doesn't have that great, 'snappy-then-melt-away' mouthfeel. Mmm. In terms of texture, it's a little bit similar to fudge. That kind of sugary, crystalline texture to it -- slightly there. Mm-hmm. That's what's here. The flavor is excellent, though. Mm-hmm. But what I realise from doing this project, is how much of the chocolate experience for me is about mouthfeel and texture: that deliciously, silky-smooth melt-away experience that happens along with the delicious flavors of sugar, cocoa butter, and cocoa mass. All that together, combined with that textural experience is really what makes chocolate sublime. It's not just the flavor. Kind of amazing, right? I'm still gonna call that a win. I took a cocoa bean -- fresh -- fermented it, dried it, roasted it, winnowed it, ground it, conched it, added sugar and cocoa butter to it, tempered it, and then poured it into a mold; cooled it, and then had my chocolate bar. So, lots and lots of steps in making a chocolate bar. So the next time you see a chocolate bar, and say \"Gah, I don't want to pay that,\" maybe you do, because maybe it's worth it to you to have a really beautifully made chocolate bar. So, big things to Anne and Alex and all the other YouTube channels that I used for reference to get me to this point. I wouldn't been able to do this without you guys. Thank you guys so much for watching. I hope you guys enjoyed that one. I hope you guys learned something.

Bye!!!!", "AceuLQth4IE": "hey ask me and her and Ashley are gonna be trying some candy bars for you does that tank leak anymore so we're gonna try the Eminem's chocolate bar and see just regular M&Ms and this was like a dollar shell statue somewhere we got it somewhere for like a buck this is the Toblerone bar a switzerland it's crunchy salted almond it's Swiss melted chocolate salted caramelized almonds and honey and almond nougat so it sounds delicious it was 219 at Target so I only try that's plain Jane M&M chocolate more like this one is the entire bar is 220 calories and lured just says chocolate bars are better than M&M so it's gonna literally be mmm I came to borrow them and ends at all ten today once you watch this oh how you open it looks like somebody's built something you guessed it it's a candy bar with image in there the aftertaste like aluminum top the whole thing needs already it has that crunchy shell the names in there the jacks are really good if your name a name fan but you're craving a candy bar slam dunk in your ball field oh yeah really yeah excellent personally I'd rather just buy the little mini see how many you can fit in your mouth all right but she's what do you have hey so how you open this there is a pervert job you pull it up and then the triangular section at the end comes off like it's fish it comes out looks like a little mountain top I mean calories all bad sink one third of the watch okay out of there as well that's something the Nets run all the way through it hey there's something sticky in there if it's the honey or the caramelized almonds I need to taste the caramel I got a little bit of that salt taste in them needs more salt she'sa saw the whole salt dome and if I don't taste salt and everybody that's popping cases all value a little container that seats all it looks like those little pebbles take this bar put it on a cookie sheet tablespoon of butter melted use the brush brush it over there put the salt on us in the fridge I think it's good thanks really any place Tomlinson hey I like it I think it's really good if you like almonds if you like nuts and your candy bar I think you'd really like this if you have interests don't get it they don't have some sticky it's birthday it's got some white card personal that that gets picky when you do just stroking your teeth it's good no you did is it my favorite no but anymore it really didn't speak to me so I hope you enjoy thanks for watching", "ZqsIT_mGapI": "hi everybody my name is Sonny and you are in sunny days kitchen sorry for the shaky camera but I just had my silly cat max jump on my shoulder Oh Manny way we are going to show you how I make my canna chocolates I make it with my half a cup of can of oil and it's coconut oil infused with cannabis I make it myself and a cup of chocolate milk chocolate for flavouring this time around I'm going to use raspberry laron oils they're fabulous I use them all the time I make heart candies as well and I use these flavorings in them too so sorry I'm gonna stutter a little bit I'm a little nervous this is my first video I'm gonna put up on YouTube but anyway so and this is my little spoon that I use with I used two of these this is half a teaspoon of measuring with the oil and then in these is what I used as my moles so I'm gonna pause it so I can put my half a cup of kind of oil in to the chocolate and then I melt it that way melt it down slowly in the microwave some people use like a double boiler or whatever but I don't do that I do it slowly in the microwave it doesn't take too long especially if I'm pouring my kind of oil over top of that and it helps the mixture actually it's probably good to go but I just put it in there I'm gonna have to put it in the microwave just to melt it a little further but dying out and then I melt it down mix it together and we'll be right back okay so we're back I melted down the chocolate and it's just a little bit shy of one cup but I'm not too worried about that because um that amount right there will probably make 45 chocolates so I've set out my molds I have my small these are half a teaspoon each these are a full teaspoon so this is a full dose one of these is a full dose you'll have to take two of these depending on your tolerance level some take two three four depending on my pain level my tolerance level is quite high so I switched from smoking to edibles and back and forth so anyway this is what I do I take a full teaspoon of the raspberry flavoring I put it in there stir it around and because it's just me doing this I'm gonna have to pause it again sorry okay so we're back so I've got a tablespoon of the raspberry oil in there flavoring mine if you're wondering within my little box it's all my Laurent oils she's fabulous I loved her oils I use them all the time there's the raspberry but I've got because I make hard candies too I've got different flavoring in there I have a green apple caramel butterscotch root beer creme de menthe and orange I believe so anyway here we go this is pretty well good to go just scrape off the knife it's kind of hard to do when you're looking at it through the camera all right the whatever so then I take my little half a teaspoon and I just measure it out obviously you just take whatever because it's going in the mom like I said it takes two of these because they're half of teaspoons I just find that the smaller spoon goes better into the molds without making too much of a mess so here we go we're gonna go in one of the malls takes two it is to get it falling up as you can see it's pretty level oh don't have it so we just keep going and going and going and going you have no time lapse so I'm gonna pause it and I'm gonna get these done and then they go into the fridge and they sit in the fridge I don't know about 10-15 minutes you can check them after ten minutes because but because my molds are fairly thick molds I keep them in there probably about 15-20 minutes just to be sure that they're all solidified and they're not going to again max jumping on my shoulder on you jerk ball just to make sure that they're solid enough that I can pop them out of the molds and bag them and put them in the freezer so I am going to pause it and fill the molds and put them in the freezer so we'll just end it here but this is what we do and I will pull them out of the molds next okay so there are linear molds and I'm a little medicated because I went licking the spoon after I filled all the molds up it's very good taste yummy that's why they call them edibles because they're so good anyway I'm gonna put them in the fridge now and the next time you see them they'll be ready to be popped out of the malls so instead of waiting for the other ones to solidify cuz it'll take 15 minutes anyway so I'm just gonna cheat here anyway so these are ones that I already made that I put in the freezer and I find that these chocolates I've had them in the freezer not these particular ones but some of my edible chocolates in the freezer for just over a month and they still taste great so I've never pushed it any longer than like maybe five six weeks because sometimes they might get that freezer burn taste so just keep it to your personal preference anyway they might not even last that long but me I don't always eat edibles so I just make them and put them in the freezer so that they're there when I do want them anyway so this is all I do is just you just push on the back of these silicone molds and they just pop right out and then I put them in my bag ease I put about a dozen in each bag and then because they're little freezer baggies they don't hold a lot anyway and then I just seal them off right okay so I got everyone's in there these are crime to match and the ones are in the freezer they're our raspberry so that's it so I hope you enjoyed the video if you have any questions please put them down below and I'll try and answer them as as soon as I can I'll try and keep an eye on it I don't anticipate too many people watching it because I know there's a lot of videos about edibles on the internet but I just thought I'd try my hand on it and on my channel so again this is flower child and I hope you enjoyed the video if you have any questions please post them below and I'll try my hardest answer them okay smile have a great day be true be honest be respectful stay true and stay unique bye", "UouaEB7-jeg": "you are now watching a Lucky Penny shop product feature hey its Lucky Penny shop and it's time for an American candy

nutritional information then there's the date here it says since 1894 look at those almonds so are you a fan of almonds now there was a little see it says right there lift and pull here I will go slower little bit deep pocket what happened there must have been a chocolate bubble there is the Hershey almond bar look at that just shimmering saying eat me now I'm going to snap it for you you've never had one of these it's got big chunks of almonds in there you can just feel them look so I need this piece because it's got a big almond and it's going to crunch if you don't like people chewing turn your volume down because I'm right by this microphone I was in the same speaker that your speaker my microphone mmm so tasty so there you go dad is a hearse that's a hearse almond bar thank for

want to say candy bar because well that's what I call it here in the USA other country do not call them candy bars so it says milk chocolate with golden honeycombed Center I've been fooled in the past looking at a package and thinking it was one thing and it ended up being something else but right now I know I'm gonna have milk chocolate and a honeycombed Center and here it says get that Friday feeling with crunchy so someone explain that to me and let's see what kind of information do we have here it covered up my nutritional facts but maybe you could read some of that there and then this sections covered up so there's not much there and then there's a little tidbit here we are passionate about our great quality Cadbury products this is a UK product because that's what the website goes to just looks good doesn't it crunchy mmm they're crunchy bands crunchy band crunchy bar fans out there let's see a dissection is order because I have two i dice a dissection is in order I'm slurring my words because I'm ready to just dive in to my bar I had it in the refrigerator purposely so maybe that's why it's extra crispy I don't know but it gets so hot in here with all the lights I need to have it ready so that broke really nice we're going to add that honeycomb Center I'm gonna bite it right away the first bite I thought Butterfinger same consistency close flavor different I'm not sure what I'm getting there when it comes up into your nostrils you get Butterfinger flavor but then after you chew it you'll get that flavor that's cool look at that now looks to be area in here and less air pockets on the outside so who else refrigerate stir there are bars especially when I know I have to make a video of something coming into the summer months it gets really hot and there's at least one two three four five whites they're low heat but they still put out some heat in the video booth and that kind of really warms things up but back to the crunchy bar what do you think have you had it before give me some insight and thanks for watching and thanks to all the UK fans that have chimed in and just been really cool in the comments spreading their crunchy bar facts hope they're on their way if you want to see more UK snacks looking at description for a playlist or search our channel later if you want to find this item click the link in the description area below the video you

Snickers bars for you these are all new to us I don't know how long they've been out but they're new to us Astor it's funny we had already bought these and Esther one of my YouTube viewers said you need to try the Snickers bar so I have it it is the Snickers extreme it's all nuts and caramel covered in milk chocolate and I didn't see a regular package I don't know if they're all this big this has two bars in it I don't have a clue and then we're gonna try these Snickers almond and it is milk chocolate almonds caramel and Nimitz and then lastly we're going to try the rockin nut Road Snickers it is dark chocolate almonds caramel marshmallow flavored nougat and that's how that one looks so which one do you want to try first we'll give the calories as we get to numbers okay Kevin wants to try the Snickers rockin that row first this one the serving size is one bar and it's 230 calories for the entire bar I'm expecting that these will look the same as oh yeah as a typical Snickers too dark it's a dark chocolate so Kevin it's gonna cut it and you can see the inside let me so there's the inside and you can see the caramel and the net it's not bad it's not bad you didn't have a lot of flavor yeah no it's kind of like I was expecting a lot more flavor that's kind of yeah I would rather have a regular Snickers bar laughs yeah I do too because the marshmallow really doesn't have much flavor and marshmallow it doesn't any flavor and also the caramel and the peep at the next time add a lot of flavor so the chocolate kind of is there that's about it it's kind of disappointing yeah that's not one that I would get again it's and you feel the you know you have the texture of the net in there it just doesn't have a lot of flavor to it so that yeah definitely I wouldn't get that again regular Snickers bar with the milk chocolates much much much better which one do you want to try that got picked up okay we'll do the almonds now there are two bars in here this is the big one there are two servings and each serving is 210 calories so that bar right each verse tear of candy calories so when you open it up I could already feel but it's yeah it comes like this and I'll let Kevin cut that one and so each bar this is 210 calories for if you wake this entire thing and I'll show you the inside and honestly it looks a lot like what we just tried except its milk chocolate instead of bar top don't you think do you think that looks a lot this is the one we just tried the dark chocolate and then this is the wall we're trying now yeah this one has almonds you know much more why we go you can really taste that almond immediately Baba calm taste good mmm that is so maybe it's the marshmallow and the other one that kind of takes away from that one is delicious almonds meds William mm-hmm good and creamy caramel chewy have to work out to eat it a little bit I always like the Hershey's with almonds that was my favorite grab the Hershey's I'm not a huge I would just eat almonds by themselves though yeah that that is really really good I I would definitely buy that again I would probably try to see if they have a rail or Suns before instead of like a two pack size or something um ooh snacks ah I don't think I've ever seen this I don't know but that's really good okay so the last lesson I'm interested to see is a Snickers extreme all that's a caramel and there's two bars I can fill them just like a little tea almonds it's milk chocolate peanuts and caramel that's it and each piece is 250 Gallery these are that that I don't know why maybe okay this is the way I just tried the almonds almost hard to cook and that one it's a little taller I think anyway oh wow yeah yes full I mean that's like chop for nerds that looks good that's a brain just in case you don't know I got a subpoena the meal if you have dentures or bigotech little chewy or Brice's okay real simple saying your mouth it softens up I don't like that but i could wear girls knickers better mm-hmm although it's really good this would be second regular Snickers and this would be the second one I don't want this after that and then the almonds third and that dog that rocky whatever we can I wouldn't even get that this this one has a lot of caramel and I thought it was very chewy the peanut flavors really even more is really really strong good it's good it's delicious so but just not not going by a regular Snickers bar because we didn't we don't have a regular Snickers bar here right out of the three I would pick the almonds you would pick Kevin would pick the extreme yeah so and then we wouldn't we wouldn't even buy the rocky road or whatever it's called rocky rocky road broken nut was rocking that row we wouldn't even buy that one again so um hope you had fun watching this I know we had fun eating as always okay so thanks for watching", "iSHksQOPWmg": "I am when I welcome you to the series of chocolate so when I was a child my mother used to actually make chocolate at home because cooking chocolate slabs were not available at all then and whatever small roles that she had she was held in that and we would just Kulp it down they were so tasty so that recipe I'm going to share with you today and you can actually make a nice good slab of chocolate awk and you can take all the credit so how do you make this slab of chocolate we want to make milk chocolate and to make milk chocolate what I have here is I have set up a double boiler so there is your span in which there is water and the water is not touching the bowl the bowl has just been placed over the fan where there is water and the bowl and there is a gap in between and that's how it is what I have here is cocoa butter so the cocoa butter is in the bowl and we have to melt your cocoa butter so here is the butter factor of the entire slab and in terms of milk solids you're going to be adding in some milk powder and you're going to be adding in powdered sugar to get the sweetness but if you get cocoa butter nothing like it so you go the butter is almost melted what we like to this is milk powder add milk powder and stir so after adding milk powder let's add powdered sugar after adding powdered sugar you need to stir it once again and you can actually now switch off the heat the water in the pan below is quite hot it's in fact boiling so that is take care of the heat that is needed to get this mixture done and we add in cocoa powder again this cocoa powder is unsweetened if you have sweet and cocoa powder at home then in that case the quantity of powdered sugar should be less okay this is done and you just have to mix it up like this alternately you can use a whisk after the entire mixture looks smooth like this like I told you to mix it up well you not have a single lump in there in the mold now have managed to get mold which looks exactly like a nice good slab of chocolate so I'm just going to take this what I have is enough for those three chocolate flaps and a little bit that is remaining if I put it in this we have a very fine or a very thin slab of chocolate I'll still show it to you all you have to do is pick it up and put in the switch this will take at least half an hour to set you will have the chocolate loosened from the base once it sets completely just remove it the regular pieces and enjoy homemade milk chocolate so the

couch lookin real bum II had to tell you oh you think this funny like the doc from the 600 pound show on TLC you know who we be full-nelson might be the king of this food and I did this first one take you know I don't think they're good great chocolatey flavor not too sweet it tastes like the milk chocolate that you would expect from M&Ms I like the little crispness that you get from the mini M&Ms in there and the peanuts are a nice addition you could taste them throughout the bar but if I was gonna tell you about the bad I have to start with the peanuts again and say there just wasn't enough peanuts in this M&Ms really should have put more peanuts in here I wasn't expecting it to be like a mr. Goodbar or anything but I did want more peanuts in this thing that'd probably be my biggest complaint with it and other than that that's it it's overwhelmingly more positive than it is negative I

and basically crunchy biscuit bars with a unique gold coating and so the stock validators them in a pack see the description and so yeah very nicely then yeah this is a first-rate chairs topped in the notice what is white chocolate for what it's a very strange m30 says yes caramel flavored coating so yeah they're like Cara Mac think it's a forty what's really here and that's I would have described it normally and yeah so pretty risky bars of a caramel flavor coaster but it thinks it did have to be gold this is quite magical it is the like that gold bar and fine ice they're impacting gold additive ultimate goal shiny fish course you're not third real gold witness to the chain hello again who are they dove their own like limited edition and as a actual gold bar from inside I'll be quite nice and when you plug up the tab all the way to this there goes the gate doesn't say it's the price my light so you can see they're really quite tiny when you get into them and also flourishes but little Athena squash together it does look like a call bar shape to see them of it is gold and put that side because design me across something superb are and so see on the slide and the most 2007 gram bar calorie 218 system while cow's fat 520 grams and 4.7 which is such as almost all such great fun never seen that before they're all very wait a minute and so yeah so they're quite tall that will not very wide with a quick polish we are almost all such meters cancer what the healthiest is looking at how gorgeous it I don't know the main this their this I don't mean quite tell on the camera for me looking at it doesn't look yellow it is very yellow and really as either you can quite tell maybe can looks it doesn't look as yellow as it does here when this on the cameras I'm looking at it and those almost oriented you know it's Patti I like a bright orange me I consider myseif golden at ether it's quite nice and just start on the bottom bit of them you know there's not a nice thick Curtis camel took on Silas he's wearing through a bed book on Simon ethanol now so the bottom the width to be nine centimeters at the top lot less 2.3 I think to point to and then the length of the bottom 79 and the top six point seven yeah so basically air to say that's the caramel places it's got this key to make sure with what I remember and crunchy biscuit lousy oak Alameda County so these methods you see it's basically filling so I am you have like a digestive biscuit something honor quite a thin layer of them caramel chocolate lesser the majority but I was actually just this biscuit so it's probably filled with lots of butter that's why it's got its lot high saturated fat maybe I don't know assume the weather such as that comes from running I imagine butters Polly crying it's could be wrong man equipment and yes it looks quite so quite a sweet clearly a biscuit bar and with this with caramel flavor coating so sir let's give it a taste hmm saying wise you listen it to your mouth you get them will do after the camera off my sister saw em quite a subtle and chocolate is not least quite thin they top as you can see so the camera can flavor cozy around my chocolate look there it's a nice bisque I'm inside they're very crunchy I think you must help us play about right to think anymore majesty bit too much and because it's not enough tasty do I look big a strong taste of the caramel flavor topper and it's nice so you continents the crunchy biscuit quality yes I like it it's nice also the countertop is pie I must shut up reverb for a comeback to it but the camera can see is a dedicated Carol topper yeah but it's nice there hmm this is flat when you because there's all sort of is the kanji bisque you there but it's kind of quantities we've been crunches in it them which is quite how six bike I think is perhaps own bait something else I though you can see there it's like a sort of darker Lane of Biscay on the outside and the thing up it's a lot crunching a bit in the middle so you get ice or double crunch texture inside which is really nice them so you're eating it some of this continuously be crunchy make a sharper crunch and something that's probably on the outside West baked to the site you can see that now so they've enough to do similar to sort of a then the Beast type bars like breakaways and things the nettle baits in the same way but it's quite obvious when you're eating this one I show here pull off the case then so it's - I like it it's quite tidy biscuit oiling and see that it's quite it's quite clearly select angular biscuits mundo Quinn has been requests it's a love although with the toppers his on a slanted unintellible too well you know when I mastered I'm so serious you know don't dipped in you really hmm us obviously is that the meanest will dry it out a bit quicker so became a bit lopsided doesn't remember them no not bad at all right I think that they you need taste in them and I think they've just got the combinations just right on me amounts of caramel and topping I think in sense normal something and can't remember them in caramel flavor because yeah I've ended other right amount of that without the caramel flavor coatings really it's just about the right amount anymore it would have been too much just be too strong has been a bit too sickly in a bit powdery but it's just about right and the biscuits very nice as well what's a double crunch really is nice and them mmm I do like this off video I do like this kitchen and with big chocolate as well anyway another it's not chocolate but I do like that texture and so this is a snack bar sort of chocolate chocolate bar ball hmm very nice I think a four out of five to me I think this one do you like it a lot I think it's probably a bit term I think it's missing a sort of an X Factor there really for to a better phrase and doesn't grab something that just pushes it you have to be you know like doesn't help something else to it really kind of a we could have I feel like it's just not something there's missing him that could pass push it up to be you know more than four out of five butter very tasty yeah I do like it I thought if I pick it over above like penguins or whatever fin if I just got bit more to than than this but it's definitely welcome change and definitely different than most other things so perhaps nice time just having Alan again instead of the usual stuff that's all okay guys have you do that review and please like the video spying on Twitter subscribe and I'll see you in time first can everyone take care bye for now see you", "JGecxFZ2Abg": "today I'm going to try the skinny cow limited edition heavenly crisp this is chocolate raspberry these were 348 at Walmart so they're not cheap but you do get six bars so I guess it's a six desserts for you or six nights 348 isn't a bad price they are 110 calories each and the bucks just says delicate wafers layered with delicious chocolate raspberry cream and this is how big the packages and I tried all the other of their other bars and they're good they're very good and they make a good snack really I'm gonna make it a weird observation that smells like Plato I don't know what but yeah it for some reason that smells like Plato okay that's how it looks and that's the inside and I'll just cut off a piece here you are droppings that's good the crisp will remind you of like the liar and an eddy bar that crispy but it's not that strong it's not like peanut butter flavor but it's like crispy layer but the raspberry is a really good flavor and it doesn't come till the end if you've already been into it you're chewing it up and then it comes but it's strong once it does come and it has a really really strong raspberry flavor um yeah I'm surprised if it's that strong but I like it a lot and you could probably get a lot of you know if you're trying to divide this out you can get a lot of bites out of them one two three four five six and I already got two so you get eight good bites out of that and make it last longer for a hundred ten calories I think that's well worth it I would get these again these are good you", "bG4IdOwaOV4": "I was looking they didn't have these Snickers eyes I just won't be satisfied with anything else it ties you from one meal to the next without being filling their nice afternoon snack you know I'm gonna kids come

bar this is a Cadbury bar and I'm excited I was just excited to try something new and kind of check it out and dissect it sorry saw something there and well let's see let's look at the back anyway so that's that we paid here in the USA and it was in a specialty shop in a shopping mall so we didn't get this one at world market like we normally get our bars and there's a Cadbury UK limited a little saying there and the nutrition information for everybody out there there really isn't too much of the packaging it's just you know the read writing in the blue but that stands out pretty good doesn't it whisp ah let's do it let's see what it's all about I just put the bar down now woke up today and went to make this candy bar video and I could not find my cutter yeah my favorite cutter it's disappeared so I'm just gonna have to break this candy bar I like to cut them because it gives you a nice clean cut alright so when I was thinking aerated I was thinking it'd be like an aero bar so it looks like it's a little less aerated how's that but let's give it a shot the milk chocolate is very clean very soft very good so it's a little tougher not tougher not as soft as a narrow bar but not as hard as a regular full chocolate bar how's that it's like in the middle of the - I have to have another bite it's really tasty we just can't get these bars here you're only going to find them in like this was a specialty shop and they had a UK section but going through the regular stores I don't think I've ever seen one on the shelves so there you go that's pretty good we've done a bunch of UK candy and snacks and treats and you can find them by going to our channel by clicking on a name or a lot attendant descriptions we put a playlist to the you know rest of the candy in that series so that is the whispbar from Cadbury and thanks for watching later if you want to find this item click the link in the description area below the video you can also watch more videos in this series by

excited to try them all and see when they rank so check this out we'll start with the most basic one hershey's creamy milk chocolate bar very simple milk chocolate bar nothing much to see as you can see oh it smells absolutely divine [Music] very simple creamy smooth kind of smoky in flavor milk chocolate bar absolutely delicious if i wasn't clear enough i'm going to give this one and three quarters of a thumbs up that's two for now i'm gonna put the head cheese creamy milk chocolate bar at the very beginning of the line in first place pepsi's whole almonds creamy milk chocolate bar it looks just like the plain simple creamy milk chocolate bar except on the back you can see the whole almonds has that same amazing milk chocolate scent amazing smoky flavored creamy smooth milk chocolate and crunchy almonds in there what's so bad about that i'll give it one and three quarters of a thumbs up for now i'm going to give the hedges whole almonds creamy milk chocolate bar shared first place with hershey's creamy milk chocolate bar and she's cookies and cream bar the hershey's cookies and cream bar used to be one of my favorite hershey's bars many years ago and something happened i either didn't find it for a few years or i just didn't try for a few years and then i got it again this past few months once i tried it and all of a sudden it tasted horrible it tasted very chemical and nasty so this is the second time i'm trying it in a few months i'm really curious to see if it still tastes like bad but something has changed about the recipe or it's like what it used to be amazing well here's the hood here's the hershey's cookies and cream bar looking exactly as i remembered it to be you can see all the cookie bits and pieces on top and especially at the bottom it smells amazing this time let's hope it tastes amazing too okay so it certainly tastes better than the last recent time that i tried it and that's a good thing yeah i would say that definitely the flavor of this bar is more like the original ones i had years ago i'm happy with it it's creamy sweet the cookie bits and pieces in there do taste chocolaty and good overall i think this is one and three quarters of the thumbs up for now i'm going to leave the head sheets cookies and cream bar in second place hershey's gold bar i've had the gold bar from other brands i've never had the hershey's one very excited to try it because i like the ones from the other brands wow look at the color on this one it does actually kind of look like gold looks very pretty and interesting let's take a look at back side of it oh yeah you can see all the bits and pieces i believe there's pretzels and peanuts in there probably both salted i can smell the pretzels in this thing i like this one creamy sweet has a nice flavor of the pretzels and roasted salted peanuts in there but the salt level is actually very decent surprisingly i'm gonna do some switching around here and give the hershey's gold bar second place such a pretty packaging i honestly don't even want to open this up it's the hair cheese milk chocolate with score bar this one has milk chocolate almonds and score toffee pieces in it i'm honestly a little bit disappointed in the design of this bar i thought since maybe it was a brand new bar at least to canada and the packaging was so pretty maybe they were going to do something cool and awesome with the design of the bar as well but they haven't it looks just like the regular milk chocolate bar from here cheese and there's the back nothing special to it it smells amazing i can smell the almonds in it i think it has almonds yeah and it's melting to my hands already wow so it's almost identical to the creamy milk chocolate and the hershey's whole almonds creamy with chocolate but those score pieces in there holy cow they just moved this bar into a whole other level in terms of the flavor awesome creamy texture amazing flavor love the flavor of the squirt bits and pieces in there so overall this water is going to be one and three quarters of thumbs up i'm gonna put hershey's score chocolate bar in first place another bar brand new from hershey's with absolutely beautiful packaging it's the hershey's with reese's pieces bar this is the hershey's milk chocolate bar with peanuts and the reese's pieces candy okay so they didn't do anything different with their appearance on this part either but at least because of the reese's pieces candy pieces he says pieces candy pieces it kind of looks different than cooler you can see them popping out on the front and a little bit from the back you can see delicious pieces candy and the peanuts in there oh it smells amazing i can smell the sweet peanut butter from the reese's pieces candy and the milk chocolate to get around okay so just imagine research peanut butter cup with sweet peanut butter inside instead of the salty peanut butter and of course mix chocolate all over it this is exactly that creaming with chocolate an amazing tasting sweet and peanut butter on the inside with of course crunchy bits and pieces because of the peanut and the shells of the reese's pieces wow i'm telling you with my mouth full wow i cannot give any more of a one and three quarters of quarter while i cannot give a bigger one and three quarters of a thumbs up to any of these candy bars than i am to this one i'm putting the hedgies with reese's pieces milk chocolate bar at first place and last but not least back to the christmas season it's the hershey's candy cane bar i love the hershey's candy cane but i recently last tried it for my christmas candy and snacks video loved it i'm not sure what i ranked in that video but so excited to try it now third place is shared between hershey's candy cane barn snickers tree hershey's santa bar and president's choice peppermint hot chocolate ice cream oh this one looks a little bit molten and funny i hope it hasn't gone too bad you can see the candy cane bits and pieces in there oh there's a lot of them oh man that smells absolutely heavenly of mint and candy cane [Music] this is amazing this is by far amazing and i think i already know where i'm gonna rank it

actually have them in our fridge so the first one is this so i'm guessing a lot of you know what a penguin is if you don't it's like a kind of chocolate biscuit thing but it's in a bar so somebody basically made a penguin but they just called it a toucan it's the exact same thing it has chocolate on the outside and the chocolate biscuit on the inside it's the exact same but they just called it a toucan so um yeah that's a bit weird um but now i have like the funniest one ever so i'm guessing pretty much everybody that's my cat playing with a wrapper pretty much everybody probably knows what a kitkat is and this is basically a kitkat but it's a milk chocolate break it's not a kitkat it's a milk chocolate break so in here it's barely different like they just don't have the words on they have lines instead but it's literally a kitkat like it's the exact same as a kickback guys and now my cat wants it but yeah i really hope you guys enjoyed these um off-brand chocolate bars and um yeah

cannabis infuse coconut oil to see exactly how I made this check out one of my recent videos I'll post a link in the description but the cool part about today is Russell at cannabis candy molds shoutout him sent me these chocolate bars along with my favorite part these cool ass molds and look professional they look like molds or chocolates you would get at a dispensary also came with some foils some bags to wrap them up in who wouldn't love that as a present and a cool stamp so you could put that on anything to keep it out of reach and keep things safe what you need here is a double boiler or you can do what I'm doing iced have a pot here I'm gonna use a pyrex dish I was gonna buy a Dutch oven but I'm like I don't have one so I want to show you you can make it work with what you got I'm going to turn this on to a low medium low heat set that baby in there and let's start out with the semi-sweet chocolate I'll pop the camera in so you can see a little better you don't want it too hot you want to make sure you do this at a slow low temp as you can see it's starting to melt it's probably about two tablespoons there that's a lot that's probably over a half cup that supplies half cup three quarters so I just added half of the other chocolate bar to give it a little more texture because it's looking a little liquidy give it a little stir now we're gonna go ahead and just dump it in the mold so there we have it we have the foam molds about 1/2 cup of the coconut oil with a bar and a half of the chocolate we're gonna let it set in a refrigerator for about 30 minutes to an hour all right so it's about an hour later and they are hardened let's go ahead a little put beautiful beautiful might have been able to wait an extra few minutes but hey I wanted to try one no

come on come on mo betta it's the perfect chocolate bar thank you for watching it's been great making this video I don't care whether you don't like it or not I'm sure you will I'm sure you want to put your putting your own top ten that's fine with me um yeah the pleasure making this video and goodbye", "pJc5QUN9b2s": "hello this is potato diary today i'm going to make hershey sprinkles hot chocolate first take half a cup of water then a half a cup of milk and then a half a cup of cream add in one bar of sprinkles and cream chocolate if you don't have this you can just use white chocolate get some sprinkles and mix that all in just microwave this two minutes add some whipped cream and of course more sprinkles", "n-wwwxwFnbc": "[Music] we each category out of ten points and then we're going to give it an overall score of 50 so the two chocolate balls we are going to be trying today is the Hershey's milk chocolate bar and the Hershey's special dark chocolate so let's first talk about the classic Hershey's milk chocolate bar which is the flagship chocolate bar of the Hershey's Company it is also called the great American chocolate bar when this first sold in 1900 it was a mere 5 cents today arranges anywhere between 80 cents to $1 now let's read the chocolate bar for packaging as we can see the color is a very dark brown and silver on the edges the colors really dull I know this is a chocolate bar that if I was at the grocery store looking for a candy bar it wouldn't be a bar that I would gravitate towards one thing I do like about their packaging is they do have the calorie count right on the top of the chocolate bar as you can see this chocolate bar is 200 calories a lot of chocolate bars have the calorie count on the back so you would actually have to pick up the chocolate bar if you're color counting it calories to see how many calories there are in the chocolate bar so overall I am going to give this a 5 out of 10 per packaging next let's Rick chokolate barfle look what I like about the Hershey's bars are they are all divided into small bite-sized pieces and they had the Hershey's Loco finally imprinted on each chocolate bar I'm going to give it a 7 out of 10 per look okay it smells a little bit like curd I have to actually give it a 1 out of 10 as it doesn't have that sweet chocolates melted now let's taste the chocolate bar for texture and taste I do like the fact that it is smooth and creamy it does have a slight sour taste I remember when I first came from big one I didn't like the chocolate bar but it has kind of grown on me I'll give it a 5 out of 10 for taste so let's look at the overall top scorer for the Hershey's milk chocolate we gave it 5 out of 10 for packaging and 7 out of 10 for look a 1 out of 10 for smell a 5 out of 10 for texture and a 5 out of 10 for taste that gives it an overall top score of 23 out of 50 so now we are going to taste the Hershey's a special dog milk chocolate bar we are going to read it full package first and as you can see this is similar to the Hershey's milk chocolate bar the only difference is the two edges are in red color instead of a silver color this also has the calorie count on the front which shows 200 calories per pack whereas the milk chocolate was 220 calories I'm going to read this out of 5 out of 10 so now let's rate the look of the chocolate bar as you can see this is exactly the same as the Hershey's milk chocolate bar and so we're going to read it the same and give it a 7 out of 10 so growing up I was never a fan of chocolate chocolate so now 10:4 smell now let's move on to the texture this is actually very smooth and creamy I think it's a little creamier than the milk chocolate bar in terms of tasty it has a bit of a sweet taste I shouldn't really like the taste of this so I think the texture I'm going to give it a 6 out of 10 and for taste I'm gonna give it a 7 out of 10 so let's really go over the numbers that we gave for the dashi stock chocolate which included 5 out of 10 for packaging 7 out of 10 for look 6 out of 10 for smell 6 out of 10 for texture and 7 out of 10 for taste for an overall score of 31 out of 50 so let's look at the overall score between the two chocolate balls we have the Hershey's milk chocolate that came in at 23 out of 50 and the Hershey's special dark that came in at 31 out of 50 so right now the Hershey's special dark is in the lead you", "vVSUQtrIisw": "what's a mars bar huh got a nice picture the light is so good out here right now in the afternoon sun chillin on the lake you know just see this little spot real quick back in the cove off the lake here nice campsite cool so yeah i'm just posting up chillin snacking what's up anyway actually found this in Spain and I'm sure I had a mars bar at some point in my life I just can't really remember it that much it's certainly not one of my favorites maybe it should be but I just had noticed someone I was over in Spain that these were everywhere like in every convenience store in the fridge right next to beers and everything else this was there's very prevalent these Mars bars so you see everything is in Spanish pretty interesting so yeah and actually these are made in Portugal sure there's a Mars factory over there somewhere but anyway I just thought it was really interesting I'm sure I've had one but I can't remember can't even tell you what they taste like so this is pretty much a new experience for me might as well be course Mars same thing that makes Snickers so maybe it got a little smushed on my plane ride it kind of looks like a turd right now but anyway let's just see what it tastes like mm only got three musketeers with a layer caramel on top which isn't necessarily a bad thing now as good as a Snickers bar we're pretty good I went throw the rest of it out to the little features over here it's only a first Mars bar I've had in my adult life yeah keep it like a six or seven it's pretty good whatever buy it again probably not not over a Snickers or a I better like dark chocolate bar like as far as a candy bar even at Oberlin I think RIT even go for the Hershey's symphony or just the straight-up stickers still solid product obviously it's thumbs up button please quickly shot and poorly produced yet in epic location videos", "t7q5RLE3dgo": "Hi Bold Bakers. Today is a very special day\nbecause I have a baking buddy with me here at Bigger Bolder Baking and that is Brandi\nMalloy. Oh my gosh, thank you so much for having me.\nI am so excited to be here. It\u2019s great to have you here. I watch a lot\nof your shows. A lot of you know Brandi, actually, from POPSUGAR Food. She has a lot of shows\non there. They\u2019re very exciting. Myself and Brandi are going to make homemade\nchocolate bars with flavors inspired by the holiday season. Are you ready to get\u2026 I love that we\u2019re finally collaborating! I know, it\u2019s great! Long time in the making. Are you ready to\nmake some chocolate bars? Yes. Okay, let\u2019s get started. Homemade chocolate bars are incredibly easy\nto make. You just pick your chocolate, you pick whatever flavors you want to go in it,\nwhether it be nuts, fruit, like orange zest, whatever, and then you set it in a mold. The\nmolds that I\u2019m going to use today are these lovely chocolate molds that I got online and\nI\u2019m going to put a link in the description box below of where I got these. Or, another\ngreat idea is\u2026 Cookies cutters. And actually I love those\nmolds because they really do make them look store bought, but another trick is to use\ncookies cutters. So you just put your cookie cutter onto a baking sheet lined with parchment\nand then just pour your melted chocolate into the cookie cutter and let it set that way.\nAnd I love this because it makes it even more festive. Isn\u2019t it a good idea? And you know what else? If you were a really nice person, you would\nactually give them the cookie cutter as well. I love that. That\u2019s a great edible gift.\nOkay, I\u2019m stealing that idea. Yeah, there you go. So now that we have our molds, we are going\nto start making our first flavor. Now, it is nutty, it\u2019s kind of squishy and gooey\u2026 Stop. Are we doing Rocky Road? Because Rocky Road is one of my favorite flavors. Is it really? Well because you get that luscious chocolate\nand then the gooiness from the marshmallow, and then the bite from the almond\u2026 I mean, Rocky Road is one of my favorite...\nI know you chose this because I\u2019m here. Absolutely. Like I\u2019m all about texture and\nit sounds a little like bit you are too. So that\u2019s why I love this flavor. So yes it\nis Rocky Road. Yay! The most important ingredient you need for\nyour homemade chocolate bars is good quality chocolate. Yes. Good quality chocolate with a good percentage\nof cocoa solids. It makes your bar so much more smoother, richer. So we\u2019re going to\npop this guy in the microwave and melt it very gently or you could put it over a double\nboiler and melt it that way. So now that we have our chocolate, we are going to add in\nour mix-ins for our Rocky Road. Yay, awesome. So we have our toasted almonds and Brandi,\nI\u2019m going to get you to bash these up. Okay. And how big do we want to break these\nup? Just small enough for the candy bar or\u2026 Yeah, you know what? With me, I always like a bit of texture so\nlike some big bits and some small bits. Okay. Okay, Brandi, those are looking great. Awesome. Some big chunks and small chunks. We have\nour marshmallows here. Mini marshmallows. I\u2019ll take one of those. And we are going to add them into our chocolate.\nAnd then Brandi, you can toss in the almonds. Awesome. Rocky Road is just one of those flavors\nthat reminds you of your childhood. I feel like Rocky Road ice cream, Rocky Road bars,\nor when you make sundaes adding the chocolate and the marshmallow\u2026 I feel like this is definitely one of those\nbars that everyone is going to love. Once you have it all mixed up, just pour it\ninto your mold. That looks so good Gemma. Doesn\u2019t it? Okay, so I\u2019ll just use the spatula to kind\nof\u2026 Yeah. For sure, spread it out. \u2026Spread it out. Okay\u2026. And you know what I like to do is, especially\nto make sure that there\u2019s no air bubbles or anything like that in your chocolate bar,\ngive it a bash\u2026 on the countertop and it just naturally evens itself out. And it makes\nsure that it\u2019s all nice and compact in there. People always ask me do you have to spray\nthe mold or anything? But you don\u2019t have to; these are going to\npop right out. No. I don\u2019t like those sprays either. And\nthen also, we are going to chill them in the fridge, so once they\u2019re like nice and cold,\nthey pop right out, like you said. Okay, there you go. Lovely. Now, these actually set pretty\nquickly. So we are going to pop them in the fridge, let them set and we\u2019re going to\nget started on our next chocolate bar. Our next homemade chocolate bar is definitely\nmore on the festive side. It is white chocolate and peppermint. Ah, I love peppermint, and especially when\nI see these little candy canes. Yeah. It totally get me in that holiday spirit. Aren\u2019t they the sweetest? And also it works really well with white chocolate.\nAnd for a little bit of texture and some crunch, I\u2019m actually going to add in some, crushed\ncookies. They still stay actually quite crunchy in the chocolate bar. Ooh. Yeah, and these are graham crackers because\nI love graham crackers but you can use Oreos, you can use any type of cookie that you like. Oh, I like that idea. Okie dokie, Brandi, I\u2019m going to get you\nto bash up some of these guys. Alright, these are looking good\u2026 Perfect. \u2026so can I add them in? Yes, add them right in there. Lovely. Look\nat that color. That\u2019s going to be really nice color. Brandi, I\u2019m going to throw in\na few cookies in there. Okay. Give those a bash. Lovely. That\u2019s great. Alright. And I\u2019ll throw those in there. Okay, Brandi, can you give that a stir? Sure. These chocolate bars make really great edible\ngifts for the holidays. You can wrap them, put little like personalized labels on them.\nThey look really really good and there\u2019s something kind of special because like they\nare from the heart. Yeah, people love homemade gifts. They do! They love them. Who doesn\u2019t like edible\ngifts. So also, myself and Brandi, over on Pop Sugar Food, we made\u2026 Birthday cake truffles. And we used Birthday\nCake Oreos. They also make awesome edible gifts so if you need gift ideas\u2026 Oh, those were so good. You could do the chocolate bars, the truffles\u2026 Alright, I think this is ready for the mold. Lovely. Great, so I\u2019ll go ahead and add half of\nthis to my mold. Sure, I\u2019ll hold your mold for you. Thank you. Looks good. If you are looking for the recipes\nfor these chocolate bars, they can be found on my website BiggerBolderBaking.com. Alright, let me get these air bubbles out. These are looking great. Alright, let\u2019s pop them in the fridge. Yeah. So our next homemade chocolate bar is a flavor\nthat I absolutely love: that is chocolate and salted caramel. Oh my gosh, yes, you are speaking my language. So for this chocolate bar, I\u2019m actually\nusing more of a bittersweet chocolate. I think it just works nicer with the salted caramel.\nIt\u2019s kind of a deeper flavor. Okay, so Brandi we are just going to scoop it into our mold. Okay. All you have to do is bring your chocolate\nshell all the way to the edges. Yeah, that\u2019s great. Because what you want to do is have\nit come all the way up the side so\u2026 So that when we pour the caramel in, got it. Yeah. It\u2019s going to be like that pocket of caramel. Yeah. And we\u2019re going to top that with another\nlayer of melted chocolate, let that set, so you have, like, a whole big chocolate bar.\nOkie dokie, we are going to pop these in the fridge. Let them set like maybe five, ten\nminutes and then we can go in with our salted caramel. Awesome. It\u2019s been a few minutes and our chocolate\nshells have set. Looking pretty good. Brandi, I\u2019m going to go in with my signature salted\ncaramel sauce. Look at that. That looks awesome. This stuff is dangerous. So sick. It\u2019s fantastic. So I\u2019m going to drizzle\nthis into the shell. I\u2019m going to do a thin layer of it all around. Get it right there\ninto the corners. What a nice to get this in the middle of your candy bar. Especially\nin a homemade candy bar. Who would think that you were going to put this in the middle? So you are going to go in with the same chocolate\nthat we were using and just pour it right on top. Okay. Buh-bye, no one knows you\u2019re in there. What we\u2019re going to do is like, a little\nbit like we did before. You can flatten it out with a spoon or you can even just shake\nit around\u2026 Tap it out\u2026 Sometimes its easier just to shake it. Alright. And then you taught me about little\nair bubbles. Yeah, give it a little bit of a tap. Alright. Perfect. And we just need this to set all the way through. Pop this back in the fridge, set for maybe\nlike another ten minutes or so, and then we are ready to try them. Best part. So this is my favorite part on Bigger Bolder\nBaking. After a little bit of time, our chocolate has set. And now we get to see what it looks\nlike and to taste it. So I\u2019m going to flip this one over. This is Rocky Road. Give your\nmold a little bit of a push. But that\u2019s so cool. It really is just kind\nof popping out. Give it a little bit of a shimmy. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Look at that. No, seriously Gemma\u2026 Isn\u2019t that gorgeous? \u2026this looks like gourmet chocolate bar. Cheers. Cheers. Gemma, these are so good, but honestly I had\nso much fun today. I know. Thanks for having me. Thank you very much for coming. It was great\nto have you here. I hope you\u2019re going to come back. I would love to.

look scrumptious to you you see some of the aeration there I think I could just break this one there you go easy to break and it looks like the aeration is actually in the chocolate so there's only one way to find out and that's to eat it look at that yep so it's not a different texture in there like you think an aerated cookie or other type of Center your chocolates very rich and smooth and

chocolate bar time and I'm going to show you how to make the perfect chocolate bar with some of my favorite ingredients and the first thing you need is your chocolate it's tempered and if you follow this link here I'll show you how to temper it to perfection so once you get your temper chocolate pop it aside and you need some equipment you need a chocolate mold this is a fantasy chocolate mold this is a professional chocolate mold not expensive available online and this has got 550 gram bars in it but you can buy loads of different varieties of these and the first thing you need to do is make sure it's very very clean and the best thing to use to clean it once you've washed it in hot soapy water is cotton wool just a cotton wool pad and you polish each indent really well if you haven't got a mold at all just use a small baking tray let's line it with cling film and you can pour your chocolate in to create a big slab of chocolate so once this is clean place it on your work top and you need a scraper it's going to be really useful to get a flat surface other ingredients I've got these are some of my favorites but you can put anything in your chocolate bar we've got some pecans some cocoa nibs which are really available now in lots and lots of health food stores and then a cocoa bean that has been dried and roasted and cracked open and they're really crunchy and really chocolatey and I've got some sea salt lay the mold flat take our bowl of chocolate and we're going to pour we're going to fill each cavity to the top so all the way to the top move to the next one move to the next one you're going to need to have tempered about 400 grams of chocolate for this you won't use at all just let that set and use it again later but you need about 400 grams so shake the mold this will level out the chocolate and then we need to tap it so the noise a bit but it's going to get all the air bubbles out of the mold told you it was noisy and all these little air bubbles will appear there the air bubbles from the bottom of the mold rising to the surface and it means you'll get a nice finish on your chocolate bar now holding it really sturdy and flat to take your scraper and very slowly just scrape across the top we can use a palette knife for this as well if you don't have a scraper turn it round scrape the excess off this is making sure that every bar is exactly the same weight and looks beautiful give it another little tap and then we can put our ingredients in so you have to do this quite quickly because if you do it slowly by the time you get to your fifth bar the chocolate will have set so we're going to be a little bit artistic a bit uniform bit random and as soon as you've put them on give it another tap so they sink into the chocolate a little bit tap it some cocoa nibs I like a lot of texture so I'm doing three things salt nibs and pecans sprinkle that on and then some sea salt sea salt and chocolate is huge this is one of the biggest trends in chocolate the past 10 years a little bit not too much we've got chocolate well intensify the chocolate flavor tap again and then that goes into the fridge for 15 to 20 minutes only and no longer if it stays in the fridge longer they'll get too cold and you'll get something called a sugar bloom on the top where the chocolate gets wet and then the sugar dissolves and it gets all sticky so in the fridge 15 to 20 minutes and my fridge just sing the theme tune to live and let die listen no no no no no so that goes in 15 minutes and they should be set and on the bottom you'd probably be able to saved as you can see in the camera there that there's some dark areas and some lighter areas the lighter areas where the chocolate shrunk away we're going to give it a little twist to release them and then you need a clean tea towel I'm going to tip the mold upside down so the boss drop out always put something soft down for them to land on otherwise they will smash so take the mold flip it upside down I might need a little tap let's type up again and out to come your bars of chocolate they've come out beautifully they're nice and shiny and set you just need to keep them somewhere cool and dark or wrap them in greaseproof paper wrap them in cellophane if you're giving them as presents but you do need to try them best bit of my job and your job once you've made them clean snap means the chocolate is tempered it means it's shrunk away is smooth and we can have a little taste it's a bit salty but not too salty it's nutty crunchy and the chocolate is really smooth so enjoy making my bars but get creative use any ingredients you like don't forget to subscribe to my channel and I'll show you loads more recipes just like this", "jvPxeTdWksc": "hi garden sweetu

soon bye for now", "kRVazsl49ro": "today's review is going to be the Idaho spud it's candy bars chocolate bar from Idaho but it's not a kind of potato flavored candy bar and snack chocolate-covered french fries or chocolate covered potato chips it's just a very interesting novelty candy bar is all it is that's me in Idaho so there's a they decided to call it the Idaho spud to play off of the fact that they broke potatoes over there as soon as you can see it's a want the chocolate coated in coconut it's falling all over the place it's it's not you lightly dusted in coconut either it's it's really covered here so if you don't like coconut stay the hell away from this and I believe that there's a type of filling on the inside let's take a look so very spongy filling I believe it's marshmallow smells great so try some of the chocolate the coconut to get it the chocolates on the doctors side in the coconut coconut definitely stands out a lot there's something damn much in it so let's try the whole thing together that's really nice the sweetness the marshmallow on the inside is the sweetest thing in this so it contrasts nicely with the dark chocolate in the coconut and it gives you a really nice little nice flavor to it very good it's very it's very creamy marshmallow in the middle there like I said it stands out as a sweetest part of this whole thing and I think it's designed that way so it counterbalances the tartness of the dark chocolate which is a great idea by them very very smart move Idaho spud you one-up me for the better once again screwed by a potato that's a story of my life always being outsmarted by potatoes well if you ever find these in the store and I didn't buy this in the grocery store I'd the go to a specialty chocolate shop in a mall to find this like the probably one of them on order them online from them from the website there I don't know spud see what's going on there highly recommend very good really good chocolate first time I ever had it like I said they it's a it's an Idaho brings it's a regional thing over there so that's something that you're going to find all over the place but for me as far as I'm concerned these potato farming know how to make a good candy as well definitely I guarantee it I recommend this I should say I guarantee that it's good and I make a coconut all over the place you know so if you look Logan out does it definitely take feel what marshmallow go for it she'll have potatoes you're going to be disappointed doesn't a bladed stable so thanks for watching guys as always", "mrnOqyB8nCQ": "hi guys been a while since i posted a video up and i am quite aware that i really do need to get on with the Panigale video and video series rather it's kind of stalled at the moment I'm not the world's fastest model builder and I do need to get on with it and because i want i want to see some progress on it as well and i want to see it completed and I have had a few people asking me about it so hopefully i'll be getting back to that this quarter so and this video today however is a comparison video that's how i'm doing and what i'm doing here is primarily for from a British viewers with me being British of course I've always had an interest in American chocolates and candies candy mountain charlie we're going to Candy Man yeah um yeah you see them on movies all the time they talk about baby Ruths and butter fingers and and you know this kind of thing apart from things like Snickers which we know here but then you see our Snickers used to be called marathon so you know but when I was a kid when they said Snickers on an American TV show or a movie i am no idea what they were talking about I didn't know they were the same as our marathons which they are but that's by the by so yeah I mean there has been a few more American candies what's the way over to these shores things like your Hershey's and Reese's peanut butter cups that kind of thing but they're still not that commonly seeing over here and what I've got is a selection here and I'm going to show you a little bit of comparison and can give you an idea of what they are similar to compared to a British sweets or chocolates so over to the sweet so what I have down here is Biden is not an exhaustive selection by any means this came out of a big multi bag of these American sweets and these three here are three kind of immediate and obvious comparison ones which I'll get to in a moment so I'm just going to give you a bit of a close-up of what we've got we've got butterfinger peanut butter cups now these are not the Reese's but 12 intents and purposes they'll do the job we've got three musketeers bar one of my favorites we've got a milky way midnight we've got a regular milky way we've got a Snickers bar notice the labeling the name everything else looks looks pretty much like you used to but it's in a gold wrapper and we've got a Baby Ruth okay so what I'm going to do is I've got these up here which are just just so you can look at the packaging I've got a British Snickers these are from the miniature sorts of celebrations boxes and similar kind of thing to these but slightly different shape as you can see if I this one on the floor but pick it up again and put it's all right if I show you them side by side you'll see the shape differences but they're essentially the same thing they're sort of miniature versions and we've got a british mars bar and very well known chocolate over here and we've got a British Milky Way the sweet you can eat between meals without ruining your appetite so we were always told by the adverts when I was a kid and so what I'm gonna do is these down here are going to be unwrapped and I'm going to chop them in half and give you a look at the innards of them I won't sure the cutting because this is a PG channel and we don't want any grew some activity on here so I'll be back shortly so we're back after having cruelly hacked away at some unsuspecting chocolate bars and first of all the known to take a look at is the butterfinger that you see there and then when you draw comparisons to UK chocolate bars where possible so the innards of this one look like that now it's a little hard to tell here but the first thought that crossed my mind when I bitten when I sort of saw the inside of one of these rather was that it reminds me a little bit of a crunchy now if you imagine the texture of a crunchy the honeycomb it's kind of like that however rather than it being cinder toffee honeycomb it's a crunchy peanut butter kind of thing it now if you like peanut butter that's amazing imagine a peanut butter cup but instead of it having that sort of smooth creamy middle it's got a crunchy like a crunchy bar texture crunchy peanut butter middle with milk chocolate coating and very nice but there's nothing that I'm aware of in the UK chocolate that sort of matches that so the next one will look at is the peanut butter cup now the her shoes ones are much of a muchness in how they look but slightly different packaging and but what you've got is a chocolate cup try and get that focus they'll go a chocolate cup with a smooth peanut butter in a and a chocolate cap and it tastes like peanut butter inside chocolate cup and its really there's no other way to describe that one again we don't have anything that's a UK equivalent to that but we do have Reese's peanut butter cups which can find in the shops the next up and and this is one of my favorites is the three musketeers see the three there three musketeers now off the back from there it looks looks like this that's the top of it and that's the inside now I can draw a direct parallel to this because this is incredibly similar I find in flavor and texture to our milky way bar although you can see there is a color difference the milky way is probably a little bit more creamy and bull they're very very similar I find and it's certainly the closest comparison i can draw with a UK chocolate bar so three musketeers think Milky Way and you're not too far off the next one long we have the American Milky Way night or midnight sorry which looks like this now fans of British chocolate bars should sort of recognize this look because not so much this one specifically but more the standard milky way bar i'm going to show you here the standard milky way bar is very very similar to this is this is the standard milky way bar as you can see as the top there's the init and fans of british chocolate bars will have most definitely tried one of these which is of course a mars bar hershey bars are also kinda similar but I think these are definitely more similar than a Hershey bar is slightly different shading color of Nuggets inside and but close enough so these are the little celebrations one sliced lengthways so you can get look at the inside and and I have I have forced myself to eat the other halves of these and to spare them suffering going back to the milky way midnight some people may remember they did a milky way dark version some years ago which was just like this one it had a very pale which was just like this one it had a very pale nugget the caramel and then a dark chocolate text area so it was literally just like the milky way midnight version so that's the milky way midnight in there and the regular milky way they've seen their the next one long is the Snickers same name same font gold colored rapper instead of a brown wrapper and this is the inside of the Snickers and it may surprise you to learn that this looks and tastes just like a Snickers bar and I don't know if it's because I've got this lengthwise that the peanut pieces look a little smaller or maybe just because this is a smaller version this is a celebration size thing perhaps is that I don't really know but in essence these could be pretty much interchangeable there the chocolate itself is a slightly different shade the American one is a slightly darker shade than the than the British one but they do taste pretty much the same and this leaves us with one final one which is the baby ruth bar and this looks like on the outside of it when you when you unwrap one it looks very much like a think it was the biscuit boost that had kind of a smooth top I may be mistaken and that's all quote me on that bow going to feel and it was but I could be wrong now inside what you've got is a strange smooth sort of nuggety middle with peanuts on the top and it tastes a bit sort of peanut buttery and but it's quite a chewy nugget hmm and it's quite nice and it does remind me a little of a boost bar but not quite because the boost bars obviously had and peanuts and then caramel and then it kind of negative it's in the middle but very similar kind of taste and have to finish that off can't leave that poor thing suffering like that so I'm just going to kind of zoom out a little OOP go the right way not an exhaustive list by any means but there you have an example of a butterfinger peanut butter cup three musketeers milky way midnight milky way regular Snickers and a baby ruth bar which are all common well-known American candy bars or chocolate bars as we would know them in this country the obvious comparisons are the American milky ways are like our Mars bars in the UK the American Three Musketeers are like our Milky Way in the UK and the American Snickers bars are 12 intents and purposes exactly the same as our Snickers bars here and and that's really all there is to say about that and I say the the peanut butter ones taste like peanut butter and chocolate there's no sort of easy way to explain that one the the peanut butter cups are smooth peanut butter and chocolate the butterfinger like a crunchy peanut butter which I find really really nice i do like those are going to say and and then i said the rest are pretty much as i've said there and what we're going to have to do now is go ahead and eat these because currently these half chocolate bars so in a completely selfless act of possible suffering i'm now going to have to force these down and even for you and and there you have it so I've hope I hope you found this vaguely useful or slightly entertaining and hopefully I will be back with the Panigale modeling video and with a bit of progress on that and with any luck it'll be it'll not be too long before we're getting somewhere close to completion with it so thank you for watching you", "Cxalpq4a0PY": "what's up guys liam back again this is tier list free and today we're doing chocolate bars as you can see a lot of chocolate bars on the screen i've probably had most of them to be fair for c big chocolate bar fan as most of you probably know so let's go ahead i like all the errors before to be fair they're quite solid bars i actually think the orange one might be the best i love that lauren's chocolate bar that is one thing we're going to find out here i love watering chocolate bar so i'm going to rate the orange higher actually chocolate once con pouring mint yeah i'll do it like that to be fair just look cool that way as well after a good christmas little snack ah they're okay they're not amazing animals they're a sea and they they're okay good when you're out hadn't been packed lunch isn't that they're okay little snack that bar is pretty dead the blue i remember it's called it's like crispy wafer bar is that a caramel one iron at that i've had the normal one which is that one boost bar it's okay but it's just a bit chewy and then a bit powdery apparently i actually really like about me not as much as error orange type kingdom bueno absolutely banging bar caramel i haven't had in a long time but never been that much of a big fan they're okay caramel they're okay again used to be more of a fan as a kid chomp they're okay but not great too chewy for my liking cream egg i am a cream egg fan they've gotten b crunchy not big fan just a bit nah a bit crunchy literally um curly whirly a bit too chewy for me boring not not for me dame dame i like dame's a weird one i like it but i don't like it that much it's okay dairy milk you back in the day just used to be the one i think it's got to be an a note still it is a good bar too fancy a chunk of it now then double decker a bit too chewy it's good nice it's different it's better than the d-list i'll put it c eclairs no i don't like them they're just a bit plain the chocolate bits nice sure but it takes ages to get to there so not worth it for me it's very rough shades they're nice they're on the b list and the b list to me isn't like sure yum it's like yeah do you they're good that's the way i'm doing that one fries chocolate cream it's kind of like a dark chocolate cream in the corner after it it's a bit stronger first you see don't believe i've had them too i think i might have had that as a kid so i'll put that's the same fudge now a bit too chewy and dead for me no flavor not much flavor at all galaxy that's solid camera smooth caramel one see if it's salted maybe a bit higher i'll put it b actually i do love galaxy galaxies to top for me normal gaps i don't know what jesus is there i'll never write him so hit go there and go kingdom egg good as kid good toy he's actually banned in america because of the toys they're riding on kids to choke on them i believe so almost a big i love the chocolate king of chocolates definitely an a definitely up there i actually do love kitkat kitkat chunky slightly more than normal kitkat more teasers there would be i'll do bottom now and then these m m bottles are bloody nice to be fair if you've not had one yet definitely try one crispy one really good definitely worth trying i'm actually going to put may if i really like a queen or something i'll get morphed in but some shops down for 250 something 2 pounds 150 something um maybe a bit high maybe a b we'll go b on them normal m m's they're okay are they they're a c mars it's a c it's okay milker milk is nice you can go b milky bar occasionally i will fancy one and it is the best white chocolate really out there unless you do find like a cadburys white oreo bar which is decent milky bar milky way i used to like more as a kid but it's a bit dead now see for me minstrels i actually saw them one hole once and it kind of felt weird probably eating them too quick i love galaxy the fill is nice the outside crispiness of it i've not liked as much in the lately dairy milk i love oreo love dairy milk b for me i'm not sure i've tried a picnic maybe as a kid i don't actually remember because i think it had nice nuts and chocolate which i wasn't a big fan of until recently been having the snickers and really enjoying the snickers actually it's a filling nice bar it's kind of like i've been really enjoying the snickers lately is that yorkie bar normal alright looks like it might be the raisin one i'm gonna assume that's raising biscuit it's a c normal yorkie it's a b it's nice chocolate melts nicely quality street a bit dead to be fair i'm gonna see because they're okay they're not a d ripple ripples the sea they're just okay they're not feeling melt quite nice rolos they're a sea occasionally you'll fancy them but not always roses i think roses tastes quite cheap never been that much of a fan performance i can go d smarties i like smarties on it they can go see if the m m's don't remember having a star bar i think i did actually it was a bit it's okay i can't i can't remember too much about it terry chocolate orange love chocolate orange occasionally love this bar i've always bought this bar in the past love it even though it's one bars you can get it's a bar but it's an egg timeout great kid snack actually really nice wafer on it i'll grab b tobrine they're brand really nice actually it's a bit different but it's a city taking it off wheel fans here toffee chris is the same topic i haven't had so long turkish light i've never liked remember having it as young because i've never been a fan to ask d 12 orange they've not got normal twirl so normal 12 for me would be in would be an a i like 12 12's are banging my so i'm going to put them as an egg because i love the orange on them as well twix white is beautiful it's a beano twix caramel not so much it's a d normal twix boring it's a d cadbury white cadbury white yeah that's right cadbury white oreo it's a b and whisper gold don't like it i like normal whisper whisper gold i don't think the caramel works that great the bubbliness it's okay whisper whispers go in a b remember they brought it back and it was nice see how we've done this now as you can see i've tried most of them you know if you've got any different folds galaxy and kingdom always gonna be up there for me love chocolate orange you could even move these two up i'm not going to because i do prefer these ones more often than not of course you've got loads here you could even move the m m up you could move the cream egg up sometimes a fancy one of them it's not hard to buy those bounties do you love a bounty as well i want to keep it as that for now let me know your faults in the comments and if you don't like my list if you're gone is that my saying i think that's my saying", "cF4_hEsva8Y": "welcome to Braille AB today we're asking what does it take to burn off the calories from a chocolate bar pretty sure they used to be bigger than this but there you go full of fat and sugar but we just can't resist them the question is how much exercise you have to do to burn off this naughty little treat when our chocolate bar is a whopping 260 calories and when you know that it's actually relatively easy to find out you can consult something called the compendium of physical activities which is an enormous list of activities and they're calorie burning properties so according to the list there are a couple of things that I could do to burn off that tittie little chocolate bar go for a 45-minute walk or 12 minutes of Olympic kayaking but I don't have time for the walk and I don't have a car caught me so instead I'm going for a 20 minute jog I'm off the compendium calculates these figures using a measure called an m-80 it stands for metabolic equivalent of tasks but in layman's terms it's a way of measuring an activities energy cost the higher the met Scot the more calories it burns per minute so according to the list that's the chocolate bar busted but what if jogging is not your bag well you could also try the following dancing for 25 minutes playing a casual game of football for 30 minutes sweeping for 70 minutes or you could do press ups for 45 minutes but once the impressively named compendium might be a useful guide it is just that a guide it doesn't take into account differences in body mass fat content age sex how we move all sorts of things there is a way of factoring all this in to get personalized figures but it involves maps like this if you're a man and like this if you're a woman so I'd suggest sticking to the compendium guide but there is another problem of this approach it might be the wrong way to think about how we balance our food intake and activity really we should watch what we eat as much as what we burn studies show we're terrible at keeping track of how many calories we eat which means we can't accurately guess how much we need to burn off the key is to balance an active lifestyle with moderation of the food that might not be the best for us so in the right context there's nothing wrong with the occasional chocolate bar for more hints and tips please subscribe to Britt lab and give us your feedback in the comment section below", "qPC0rkQ1SEQ": "hi I'm mrs. McDonald and today I get to read a story to you that has to do with my favorite subject math and one of my favorite things in math is fractions now that wasn't true when I was a kid but it is now and some of these things like this book help people understand them better so maybe you'll enjoy fractions a little younger than I did this book is delicious you know fractions can be delicious the Hershey's milk chocolate fractions book by Jerry pelota and Rob Vossler sounds like a good delicious idea to me I even had an excuse to get this a whole pack Hershey bars just for this story so that makes me happy and this is one whole before we even get into the book one whole pack and it has six parts so each candy bar is one sixth of a whole pack so before I even get to the book I can start thinking fractions and that's pretty exciting to me so here we go I'm gonna open it up and I think the story starts with one whole Hershey bar so I'm gonna put that there one whole Hershey bar okay so here we go milk chocolate ooh delicious here is a Hershey's milk chocolate bar but kind Milton Hershey made famous before we eat it we are going to learn about fractions one out of one is one so you can either say one out of one one Hershey bar out of one Hershey bar or you can just say one Oh looks like we get to unwrap the goodness let's start by taking the wrapper off remember not to litter here we have one whole milk chocolate candy bar and what is a fraction a fraction is a part or portion of a whole thing we are using a Hershey's milk chocolate bar as our whole thing 12:12 if you break this candy bar apart you will see 12 equal sections 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and 12 you can stack the 12 equal sections on top of each other hey it looks different but anyway you rearranged them they still equal one whole candy bar maybe this is and the easiest way to understand fractions what would you rather eat 1/12 of a candy bar or would you rather eat 11 12 of a candy bar if you love milk chocolate the answer is simple as you can see doing fractions can be fun so here's a whole candy bar and here's a whole candy bar but this one's broken up into 12 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 and if you're like me you'd rather eat 11 12 then 1 12 1/2 here is 1/2 of a Hershey's milk chocolate bar and here is the other half 6 12 is equal to 1/2 when two fractions equal each other they are called equivalent fractions so here we have 1/2 in here we have 1/2 1/2 is the same as 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 twelfths 1/3 here is 1/3 of a whole Hershey's milk chocolate bar how did we get to the fraction of 1/3 think of it like this our candy bar can be divided into 3 equal groups each of the three groups has four sections what is left over is 2/3 1/3 plus 2/3 equals 3/3 when the top number and the bottom number are the same the fraction is equal to 1 see they're 1/3 plus 2/3 so here's one whole candy bar or one two three equal parts or each is 1/3 1/3 plus 1/3 plus 1/3 is 3/3 1/3 plus 2/3 is 3/3 and to 1/3 plus 2/3 is one whole or 12 for 12 equals 1/3 here's another way of saying 1/3 for 12 is equal to 1/3 so if we take 1/3 it has four pieces 1 2 3 4 and those are each 1/12 of the whole so 4 12 is the same as 1/3 what is left over 8 twelfths 8 twelfths is equal to 2/3 for 12 plus 8 12 equals 12 12 which equals one whole candy bar so here we have the 4 12 here we have 8 12 and if we put them all together we have one 1/4 here is 1/4 of a Hershey's milk chocolate bar if you want to call this fraction 1/4 that is okay too here is what is left over 3/4 or you could call it 3/4 1/4 plus 3/4 equals 4 quarters or 1 and here they are here's three pieces we took one candy bar I divide it in four pieces each are the same each have 3 little tiny pieces so 1/4 1/4 1/4 1/4 1/4 plus 3/4 equals 4/4 or 1 312 312 s is another way of saying 1/4 did you know that the top number of any fraction is called the numerator and the bottom number is called the denominator now you know so if we take one of these we'd have three of the little one twelfths right so three twelfths is the same as 1/4 let's explain it another way 3/4 is equal to 912 so here we have 3/4 is the same as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 12 so 1/4 or 3 12 plus 1/4 plus 1/4 plus 1/4 or 3 12 + 3 12 + 3 12 or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 12 equals one whole candy bar I guess we'll slide it together one whole candy bar so 3 12 plus 9 12 equals 12 12 equals 1 now 1/5 it's time for something different we can still do fractions without the candy bar there are five cows on this page four cows have black spots and one cow has red spots 1/5 of the cows on this page has red spots did you ever wonder why Hershey's chocolate factory was built in the middle of farm country there is an easy answer milk one of the three main ingredients used in making milk chocolate is milk if six cows mood and you mood also your Moo would be one seventh of all the moves on this page don't forget to ignore the duck quack so here's Moo Oh some of these in the outhouse that must be me moo moo moo-moo-moo-moo six cows in one person so that's seven feet seven things are mooing 6/7 are cows and 1/7 is I guess meat okay one six back to the candy bar we need to learn how to put a fraction into its lowest terms if you divide the numerator and the denominator by the same factor you can simplify this fraction to its lowest terms one-sixth is the lowest term of 2/12 the see they're taking 212 they're dividing it by the same number on the numerator as the denominator and they're getting 1/6 so this is 1/6 of the candy bar and this is 5/6 of the candy bar 5/6 is what's left over from a whole candy bar after removing 1/6 eating 106 so here is 1/6 of the candy bar and here are 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 of the candy bar so this is also too if you had out of the 12 so 2 12 is the same thing as 1 out of 1 2 3 4 5 6 1/6 so the way they did it though is divided to 12s by the same number on the top and the bottom to 12 here is an equation that's easy to understand 1/6 is equal to 212 which we already showed you that here's 1/6 and it's the same of 212 mmm-hmm here's another way to say 5/6 1012 it is starting to look more delicious after every fraction we show it's time for another break chocolate comes from cocoa pods the cacao tree grows in very warm and moist climates here are eight pods if one pod fell off and bumped you on the head you would have been bonked on the head by one-eighth of the cocoa pods on this page one ninth cocoa milk and sugar are the three main ingredients used in making milk chocolate sugar usually comes from sugar cane if you cut down one stock you will have cut down one ninth of the sugar canes on left on this field so here we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 so if you cut down one you cut down 1/9 of all of them 5 twelfths here is an interesting fraction it is already in the lowest terms the fraction 5 twelfths cannot be broken down and reduced any further the amount left over from 512 is 7 12 7 12 is another fraction that is in its lowest terms there is a way to get a fraction of 1/10 there are 10 candy bars on this page 1 out of 10 candy bars is unwrapped here is a fraction where the top number is larger than the bottom number it is called an improper fraction 13 12 is really 1 and 1 12 whoever made this fraction used more than one candy bar maybe they ate 11 12 so far in this book we learned that the main ingredients in milk chocolate are sugar milk and cocoa we also learned the fractions 1 12 to 12 3 12 for 12 5-12 six twelfths 7 12 8 twelfths 9 12 10 12 11 12 12 12 and even 13 12 we also did fractions of 1 1/3 1/4 1/5 one six one seven one eight one ninth and one tenth if you want to know what fraction of the ingredients are used in making a Hershey's milk chocolate bar sorry these fractions are top secret so I hope you enjoy that book I sure did and I'm going to going to enjoy cleaning up after it - I hope you understand fractions a little bit better and I hope that you're not scared of them because they can be a lot of fun in fact they can be delicious bye", "IZVHnxgOKqE": "hey guys in this tutorial we're going to make a super easy chocolate Overlord cake grab yourself a kick drum and add some ganache to the center to stick your cake onto I've got two seven-inch chocolate cakes each cut in half to make four layers add your filling of choice I've just whipped up some chocolate buttercream then continue to stack your cakes on the fill-in then roughly crumb coat the outside you just want to cover all the sponge to seal it in let this firm up a little now you see me using this on ganache before a link in the iCard above but it also works for buttercream it will give us straight sides on top a make it level don't worry if you don't have one a scrapper will work just as well I'll leave a link below to a genuine pro froster there are lots of facts out there that are super flimsy now add a second layer of buttercream doesn't have to be neat as it will be scraped clean run your pro frost around the sides and it will take the excess with it fill in any gaps with buttercream and repeat you can also clean up the top with a quick sweep of buttercream but all this will be covered with ganache anyway so don't worry too much next you'll want some goodies to decorate with I've got a box of Maltesers although heavy notice they're getting less round all these were from home bargains by the way love that shop we've got much makers for a bit of height these are knobbly chocolate sticks that you can get in various flavors these are chocolate where four rolls I think you pronounce it Ravel all these other bits of extra Heights and interest with the swirl pattern don't forget to head to the biscuit aisle to you can pick up some interest in bits not going to attempt this name but these are chewy biscuits with nobles on for texture these would look good painted too in metallics a bag of magic stars because who doesn't like those again a bit of interest with them being star-shaped on this honeycomb bar was literally 89 p/y Mayock chocklit slabs to make shards when you can buy one of these already flavored and chop it up with a knife in two seconds um voila done now you want some ganache for your drips this is two part dark chocolate to one part cream and it's been added to a sauce bottle again I'll link everything below you just want to have you can - warm enough that it's runny and you can hear it move inside the bottle when you shake it very much like ketchup hold the nozzle on the edge and give it a squeeze a long squeeze will create long drips under short squeeze will create short drips [Music] once you've gone all the way around dumps them on the top and carefully spread it out with a knife to meet the edges then add your chocolate first let's start with the shards they can be a bit wobbly to insert but that's because the ganache is still running you can always support them with some much Macker then add some more chocolate sticks around them I've started with the larger pieces and work my way down through the biscuits and then Maltesers and stars just add them wherever you like [Music] now we want to cover that board no one likes bare boards empty out the rest of you can ash and spread it up to the Keck on the edge of the drum with a knife add some more pieces to the board and finally if you want some extra texture you can add some smaller chocolate crisp pearls all over the cake on board and that's it a super easy quick chocolate cake for any chocoholic it's quicker to decorate it than it is to bake it and wait for it to cool hope you enjoyed this tutorial please leave me a comment below or consider sharing it don't forget to subscribe to see what comes up next week thanks guys bye", "Okg_sRKbsL0": "hey guys welcome to Rosie's desert spa this week I'd like to teach you how to make raspberry and white chocolate truffles to begin we're going to make our white chocolate ganache I'm adding 1/3 of this ratio in weight of cream to my chocolate this is a 30 second mark that here I have my raspberries sugar and what I just over a low flame medium to low so I'm going to now my raspberries to simmer for a bit because I want that Wordsworth afraid that way we left with a nice thick raspberry paste I'm going to stir it occasionally and just watch it should take probably about ten minutes you can see it's come to a nice thick consistency I'm going to turn off my heat now and you'll coat the back of your spoon as well it's another way to tell it's ready add the raspberry into the ganache a little bit at a time because it is really hot so I'm going to gradually add that in usually when you add something that's too hot into chocolate it tends to seize that if the temperatures are too different and add in the rest so in a where we've tempered it kind of like what you do with eggs and custard now just set that in the fridge until we're ready to use it how much I put multi ran much like last time I'm going to dip my brush into the sawdust and just paint the inside I'm using the different combination of colors here next I'm going to fill all my cavities with dark chocolate dis-ease compound chocolates there's no need to temper it but temperature is still important if your chocolate is to one it's going to run out of these cavities way too quickly and you're going to be left with a very fragile shell so that 32 degrees or so would be perfect let's go get really messy I had my bench scraper and I'm just going to maneuver the chocolate around my cases making sure each one is being filled right up to the top so I'm going to run it along and take off all of the excess and that's why I have baking paper at the bottom of this then what you want to do start tapping it on your counter just to get rid of any and all grab your mold and to put upside down empty up most of your chocolate if you need some help just grab your bench scraper and tap it there it goes run it along the bottom and those are your shells just run it one more time clean it up and set that in the fridge for about five minutes all that chocolates are sitting in the fridge I'm just taking my bench scraper and then screwdrive all that chocolate now football that back into my ball and we'll mount that again next start filling it with your ganache about two-thirds of the way and give it a tap to smuggle it off I also have some salted caramel here that I made yesterday for some macaroon fillings you guys would like the recipe to this do leave a comment below and I can make a video for you guys and just as we did before we're going to layer that chocolate on all over again kleavon use a spatula this time to run it over you can take your bench scraper and scrape off all the excess chocolate now that set in your fridge for another 10 minutes to release your chocolates from the case to not side down and tap it very firmly on your counter until they're all release here you see how vibrant those colors are the petals of the dust luster dust that's our caramel and that's our raspberry white chocolate ganache and that's how it's done if you have any suggestions on what to make an X leave me a comment below now I'll do my best to make it happen thank you for watching and I will see you next week", "RQqpmAvWS0I": "hey guys how's it going it is mr. crayfish and welcome back today I'm going to be showing you guys how you can turn any item into a block so it's going to allow you to turn items such as the apple bread puffer fish what the flip bucket of milk and also an egg as a bunch more as well that I'm going to be showing you guys but it allows you to turn it into a block form which is not normally possible in Minecraft but with this new command block creation that I've made you can finally do that so this is all within vanilla minecraft as well this uses no mods but let's not wait any longer let's go ahead let's get straight into this so we're gonna head around to the back of my mansion here where we have a brand new machine installed and I like to call it I like to call it the block of fire because it turns the items into their block form and looks like young Greg's already at the back here how you doing young Greg you're doing good but here is the block of fire so I've pretty much put items inside of this glass block here we press this button down below and that's actually going to convert it now I've got a chest over here with a bunch of different items we can actually turn into blocks here and they kind of strange ones as

to the stuff nonsense podcast where we don't talk about anything we talk about anything uh i'm gunsmoke and i'm joined by my colleague as usual uh wrist watch just the first watch it's just the first word that i came up with in my head um those might be our real names on our birth certificates you don't know that you don't i am gun snack you don't know that um what are we doing today uh yeah of course we are talking about uh chocolate bars chocolate is such a a broad subject that we've sort of specifically narrowed it down to chocolate bars some of which you might argue were not chocolate bars and just chocolate within a little bit you'll you'll you'll you'll figure out eventually what we're around about oh there we go um i'm gonna make i just thought if it ain't bars it ain't ours yes um having said that though we might go on to do like different types of chocolate in different episodes so yeah this is a chocolate bar episode we might do a other bits of chocolate episode where we include chocolate buttons chocolate magic stars maybe other shite like that but this is just bars only as you can see i'm getting his background there all the fully fully formed chocolate there is in bar that's where i am right now bar form he's in chocolateville is that chocolateville oh bourneville bowenville that's why yeah we do there is really part of birmingham that is just you're just in birmingham right now yeah this is where i'd be if there weren't restrictions so i've kind of brought the vibe along talking about sorry i just wanted to say about cadbury world remember when we went to cadbury world oh yeah that was fun that was actually quite decent we can do it again because i i can eat that i do eat dairy again now so we can go back at some point oh yeah speaking about that have you eaten many chocolate bars or gone back to eating much chocolate since sensitive um not a lot i've had some and like i have dark i like dark chocolate anyway so i have a lot of dark which doesn't have a lot of dairy in it and some of it doesn't have any dairy in it at all but i think the ones that i do have a bit but um at christmas i like was straight into the quality street after eight terry's chocolate orange which have no place in today's episode because they're not bars even though you can't actually buy although what i have seen the chocolate orange bar though is that even a bar though because that's just segments stuck together it's not really it's just it's lazy it's not a traditional bar it's just one of those things where they'll do anything to uh make it into something you can literally like smarties bar that's not a chocolate bar it's not well known in any way that is true yeah i don't know yeah i don't know i think we're going to be covering all we're going to be covering some of the classics we veto sent me a list which i've not i've not added anything to because i think we sometimes we do like i don't want to do too many things for the tier list that's what i'm getting at basically we are going to do a tier list come the end of the episode um which could of course could go up dab which could cause some controversy so you know who knows very well what was the segmenteo that you wanted to start with talking of terry's chocolate oranges speaking of techniques yeah we're all having uh i can't talk muddled brains no no i don't know what's going on today i don't know why we're doing this i think it might be the morning wine i had oh dear i told you to stay away from the morning wine because well it'll become they'll become an issue and you'll start having a bad liver and having too much alcohol in your life and then you it's a bad thing nothing goes well if you have too much alcohol i think you're right yeah from now on i will stop um yeah the segment is 22 discontinued chocolate bars that we really want to bring back uh we'll see if we really want to i bet some of these we won't are these from the uk or are they uh i think they're from the uk yeah lovely lovely as if they are uk so we'll be able to relate better um number one is the cadburys taz bar which we talked about before we actually start about starting the episode yeah uh he it doesn't stay here but you mentioned it was like a pretty much a caramel freddo yeah well i saw a thing it said it was like a fredo but with caramel in it and instead of being in the shape of the frog it was in the shape of taz the tasmanian devil the famed cartoon character i don't know i can't imagine it would have been like incredible but it probably would have been nice i'm a big fan of a chocolate caramel combination and now now it's basically just always salted caramel now though rather than just normal caramel but i like both some might argue that having that around the tas bar is is justified as having a caramel version of the dairy milk because how many people really eat the caramel dairy milk i don't really i'd have it but no oh yeah i like it i don't know if i'd ever choose it i don't know i do like i do like some caramel though if anything i probably i don't like salted caramel when it's got too much salt in it though because then it's just weird like when it's got a big like rock like crystals of salt it's a bit too much sometimes but you know you don't need that rock sole nah get it get away with it with your rock salt and stuff uh next on the list is cadbury cadbury's mint crisp uh it just looks like a crispy bits of mint in the chocolate bar but i'm also a very good fan of the combination of chocolate and mint to be honest it's a very good combination yeah what uh oh yeah after eight not a bar but great combination i can't think of a bar i can think of a bar that's uh have you had the fries peppermint cream before uh i haven't i think they're doing orange cream as well or strawberry cream maybe all three they just have like also cadburys it's kind of like the um quality street like the strawberry and orange creme like quality streets but in a bar pretty much is it literally just felt cream-filled yeah it's like that texture that you get in the quality streets but i'm a big they're my two favorite quality streets by the way and no one else likes them not really me and my mum like him and no one else does so we always get everyone else's uh rubbish quality streets because we love them so you know that's a baroness yeah yeah there's also arrow as well um arrow yeah that's minty isn't it yeah it is they have i think they have um i swear i keep seeing new versions of it but yeah that i used to like that one the mint um arrow definitely incredible remarkable remarkably it's really nice um next on the list is cadbury snowflake uh it's just like a a white flake basically white trouble oh yeah i think i did i think i saw that on some list that i looked at i yeah it's probably fine yeah we were saying as well what did does a flake classify as a chocolate bar or not because it kind of is but then also it's just something you put in the top of a ice cream it's like but you they're annoying though with flakes though because they they like flake off and they go everywhere but because it's such thin chocolate it just melts like instantly so like if you've got it on like your clothes it just melts like straight away because it's really thin so you can't like take it all the way out of the wrapper so you kind of have to like eat it in the wrap otherwise it'll melt in your hands yep tactics you need to tactically eat your chocos guys absolutely i'll keep it in ice cream tactical chocoing that's what i call it uh next on the list i don't call it there it's a good thing to call it anyway oh yeah uh next on the list is mars delight uh i'm not very good at explaining things uh apart from the literal explanation of what it is uh what the hell is it i don't even know where it is it kind of just looks like again maybe like a white version a white chocolate version of her master which you really need white chocolate versions of everything i don't think so it's like yeah it's they just do variations of everything now i think it's come to the point with so many things where they just the industry doesn't know what to do so they just come out with new like slightly changed versions of things already exist it's like with films as well i like they're film producers and directors of like run out of film ideas so they just either remake films or do sequels or basically do like a remake i already said remake but there probably are some original film ideas people come up can come up with but like in terms of like big films they're all like based on other films or remakes of other films it's the same in chocolate it's just like disney doing like a the live the live action version of every animated film god yeah it's the same with like kids tv when they brought up brought about like the cgi postman pat and he had like a helicopter and i wanted to be sick that's like the worst thing i've ever seen in my life and they have like firemen sam as well uh cgi it's just awful everyone's childhood's ruined the people of our generation and older it's well at least we actually had good kids tv i think we were we're going to be the last generation to have proper children's tv because like our kids will probably just have like an ipad put in front of them when they're like three years old and then yeah it's all online now they're just a bit they're they'll be like creating tech creating tick tocks talking of getting your kids to do things i was having a conversation yesterday about is it okay to like bring up your children to try and get them to earn you money so like try and push them into a career path where they will have a lot of money and then they can give you some because me and gabby's brother were talking about um well he said that if he has a son but obviously or a daughter but mainly his son he would try and like get them to become a footballer so that they earn loads of money and then he has loads of money and i've always thought that running to train train your son to be a footballer and then you get loads of money yeah i'm wrong is that morally incorrect i don't know i don't know but i don't know how a kid would know that they want to do child acting or something like that for example without the parents oh god what about like child beauty pageants and stuff just a bit weird it is weird like what was the girl who got murdered who was like a child beauty pageant person and then there's a conspiracy that she's actually katy perry is it jonbenet ramsey john bernay ramsay yeah well i like the fact her first name's john bernay but wasn't her dad just called like john bennett or something i don't know if i've made that up i'm gonna just google that i think i think the dad but like john bernay is just like a cooler way of saying john bennett pretty much who actually hang on where you do that i'll read out the next thing john bennett ramsey john bennett ramsey was the dad john bennett ramsay and then she was john john bernay ramsay just like it's like highest in the bucket in highs of the bouquet basically the same thing sorry choco choco i'll speed up i'll speed through these uh next is nestle's vice versa which kind of looks like um minstrels um basically one of them is sorry milk chocolate in a white chocolate shell and white chocolate in the milk chocolate shell they're swapped so that's actually quite exciting how did you bring that back i'm quite excited by that well maybe we can find these sorry you know we did the crisp episode maybe there's like these chocolates on ebay we'll have to have a look maybe i'll keep listening i mean i don't know if they'd be all right to eat them now but they can i don't know we can have a look for the content yeah we'll eat them for the content definitely for the content we need to start doing stuff like that like for the content like trying like doing stuff now that people can see us we actually should do it we can make like a well we'll talk about later but we can make like a maybe a stuff accent shorts yes yeah we should genuinely do just like this it's a good shot uh number six on the list is cadbury's tiffin uh i don't know if you've heard of that it's uh it's basically raisins and nuts uh in a bar which kind of is just like fruit and now which i don't know if anybody actually eats that i definitely wouldn't is it like tiffin like the thing that you can get there's like a sort of cake but not you know it's like got i feel like it's got like digestive biscuits in it it's like a square with chocolate on top i think um that's why that's called tiffin there's also a chip shop in in stratford called take away i don't know why it's called tiffin but who knows this uh it doesn't lose any biscuit in this it's literally just raisins and like hazelnuts it sounds all right it's fruit and nuts all right it's absolutely fine i never had it i don't think i'd want to i'd just eat fruit by itself if i want fruit i am because i am usually one of those people where i think like fruit is fruit and then if you want to have a cake you don't want to have something healthy in it you just want it to be a cake that's like got in it because you don't eat it to have fruit i know you mean but fruit and nut is actually all right and there's not much else that's like that though like it's like when you have like a rock cake or like a biscuit or something and you think it's chocolate chips but it's raisins and it's like the worst thing ever yes that's absolutely horrifying i think that's a common thing that people despise i don't know next on the list is cadbury touchdown um which i'm not sure what that is i'm just looking it up to see what that is it sounds very american touchdown just seems like a word that doesn't exist in the uk it's only in america it's exclusive to things all new american word touchdown exclusive to us markets i don't think we're allowed to use the word touchdown in the uk i guess it's just literally it has an american footballer on the front of it so i'm guessing it's just some american so i guess no one really cares about it i don't yeah we don't care about america at all sorry to it's the widely american listener base that we have but we don't we don't like no i'm not saying we don't like you i'm joking america's good well i've not been but from what i think it's good it's fine still listen and watch please do don't don't hear [Music] just one of us uh next on the list is uh cadbury fuse that rings a bow crisp and nutty goodness uh i think it was um it it went in 2005. maybe i've very like maybe i was gonna say maybe i lightly remember it um i might remember that a bit from my childhood possibly fuse possibly would have been a corner shop regular around the corner from me they said it had crisp and nutty goodness i'm gonna have a look at the uh wrapper absolutely you can use yeah that kind of looks slightly familiar for some reason hang on though there's a new version of it it looks like this on ebay potentially cadbury's fused chocolate bar with peanuts 48 grams yeah you can finally buy them oh maybe it's come back since the cycle came out i don't know how this article is these are coming in from india though you can buy them but they're like from india so i don't know maybe they still make them in certain parts of the country but you just have to get them shipped in from uh other places maybe we'll try a few cadbury's fuse at some point we'll see you can get your grandparents to send time that's very true i yeah there's going to be some ancestors in india who i can um get a hold of they still live in india no but there are some there are a fair few people there who's who are in india though i don't actually know them but um i can maybe get in touch i'll be able to find that contact details or stuff announcing his trip to india that would be good i do want to go to india at some point i really have to india is a good place sounds decent as well to be honest i'd give three years ago i'll definitely have a have a look later to see if any of these are still about or have come back um next on the list is cadbury's marble which uh as you can expect it's just sort of mobilized chocolate with a hazelnut center i think i saw that on the back it's probably more it's probably style over substance i doubt it tastes incredible but actually chocolate hazelnut is a great combination but that already exists such as the vigo bar and also other things as well as another one that's chocolate and hazelnut i can't think what it is um i don't know some reason what i can think of is bounty but that's definitely not hazelnut that was coconut i'm just being is it the purple one the purple and uh in a celebrate not celebrations it's uh oh maybe there might yeah i feel like it's not a bar it's like in a box like a little this is a chocolate rather than a chocolate bar like it's a it's a miniature one a little boy what little boy okay so yeah that uh i'm just gonna because he even wrote a song called little boy i'm just gonna do a few more just so we can uh i used to like that i never knew i don't ever remember that thing is i remember it and i remember having it i think it was just very basic white chocolate like it was it wasn't anything special but i don't i remember it but i don't remember it fondly enough to remember when it was discontinued like i don't remember it going essentially and then like five years ago i was like oh god cadbury's dream that's not there anymore yeah because white chocolate as opposed to actual chocolate is literally just sugar and milk a thing on tank top apparently white chocolate gets better if it's like caramelized it tastes nicer so you can like get white chocolate melt it down and then put it in the fridge and then it's better it's like yellow but it's like slightly caramelized and the reference sounds better than actual white chocolate so you can make better white chocolate out of white chocolate pretty much so i've just seen and it looks like cadburys since then have uh released a new white chocolate bar it's just called cadbury white great brilliant well done with the name there cadburys i wouldn't hate to do that it's actually called cadbury white yeah should we invent a chocolate bar that's called stuff a nonsense brown and it's just it's just milk chocolate oh yeah cadbury white yeah they've got a cadbury white oreo uh easter egg as well out this year yeah cadbury white is literally a thing we have to invent stuff a nonsense brown bar so like i reckon we need to invent a chocolate bar i swear that was a thing that i had to do at school like at primary school or secondary school i had to like invent a chocolate bar and like name it i feel like that might have been in like in like ft at school i swear it was or something like that or you have to invent like an item it was really weird because it's not something you'd normally do in in at school but like i swear we had to do something and then the teachers would steal it and make it for themselves probably well actually it was that specific teacher um mrs gardner who uh accused me of like plagiarism she said i copied like all of my homework from a website but i actually hadn't and she just like accused me of plagiarism for no apparent reason i don't know whether that's a compliment because she's saying it's written well so i can't have written it or whether she was just i don't know i don't know what a reasoning was behind her saying it was plagiarized have you ever been accused of crimes against words before um not that i can remember uh i've been accused of many things i normally show off to people saying that i've been accused of plagiarism it's just like quite a good line to like show off like it makes me look quite hard being like uh yeah i've got accused of copying from a website once you should get that tattooed onto your forehead well i was actually i was accused of commenting on my website i might do that that's my next tattoo yeah just to address in the in the last episode about the ocean i said i didn't have a seahorse tattoo but i actually do i just didn't roll my sleeve up like high enough to see it and i couldn't remember that it was there isn't it massive yeah it's like there i don't know how i didn't see it i rolled my sleeve up to like there where you can only see the tail and i just didn't realize that it was there but i remembered then having a conversation with my mum about it and she was like why don't you get a chameleon because it's more interesting and i was like no i might still get a chameleon though who knows what the future holds but my next one is just a tattoo across my forehead saying i copied from i was accused of copying from a website i didn't actually know what one i think you should get next i don't know what go the be the beef sorry to be the beef why is that is that the raccoon it's a it's a beaver and a raccoon oh yeah that's quite cool yeah it's a beaver with a raccoon tail that's pretty good i might get like uh yes yeah i might get like a zorce tattoo like a zebra and a horse i like dog crust like animals that are like like a liger maybe i might get a tattoo well i think probably source tattoo is my next one oh could you get the zorse written and then that should be our next episode hybrid animals that's actually very actually a very good show we could actually do that yeah hybrid animals is gonna be the next one hopefully so if you're listening in the future let us know where the hybrid animal well i think we'll know but you will be able to know whether it was or not have we got another one before the tire list i thought i'd say tyrants left here because see one that probably more people i think would remember um cadbury's time out yeah i don't know if i knew that that had stopped i think i did know that that stopped i've not seen it for a long time but i don't yeah weirdly i i wonder when the last time was that i actually bought like one single chocolate bar and actually ate it because i genuinely don't i haven't done it for such a long time i don't know it's probably when i had one of the vegan like vigo bars when i was when i didn't have dairy but i don't know i steal like dark chocolate out of the cupboard and that's about it what was a timeout i can't remember i think it was like a chocolate slash wafer bar oh yeah i know i think it's like something else but like is it like a blue ribbon but not i think so hang on timeout also why is it blue ribbond rather than ribbon it's like is it it's like ribbond it's like r-i-b-a-n-d which isn't even a word is it pronounced ribbon there i don't know people just call it i don't even know what people say when they say it whether they say blue ribbon or blue ribbond with a d but it's like stupid blue ribboned ribbond yeah timeout it's kind of looks similar to a tight yeah a timeout looks sort of similar um do you think it's tier list time i think it is tearless time but as well as being something that we categorize items in a tier list is also the list of things that i have shed tears over yeah we cry over this i cry and when i cry i write down a list of all of the reasons that i cry and yeah i'm miserable but this tier list is a much more positive jolly one unless you have a severe lactose intolerance and you can't have any of these items or you're vegan yeah or you're actually healthy um so for those of you who are unaware of our tears because we don't have any ordinary tears we don't do no normal stuff on here we do our own stuff and also our own nonsense as well yeah and also we're we're renaming the podcast things and crap can you explain why uh uh was it english to punjabi uh on google translate i typed in or was it you or me i think one of us i think it's a bad memory i think it was you i've done stefan nonsense and then come back his stuff and crap then i did it again and then it came back as you basically have to just switch it around all the time and it eventually came back as things and crap so so yeah this might be called i might mock up like a logo that's the same as our logo but it says things and crap instead oh maybe oh no i've got an idea basically um i'll tell you afterwards the tears that we have we have nonsense at the bottom bad second from bottom bad stuff i've just written bad because i'm lazy average good stuff and elite um sneaky wiki wickers is the first also known as the snickers but i thought i'd make it sound more cool because i'm like quite trendy but yeah snickers what do you think uh i quite like a snickers bar because is good it's decent uh what were they called before they cut them out marathon bar i think you can still get them from like morrisons yeah i think you can i used to be able to get them in like some of the sweet shops in town remember the sweet shop in stratford in bard's walk and bradley hunt used to work there you know the one from exo oh yeah yeah yeah yeah i remember seeing him in there yeah bradley hunt used to work in uh oh this could be the this could be the title bradley hunt used to work in a sweet shop um that's actually quite good but yeah he used to work in a sweet shop when they used to sell like retro like chocolate and stuff in there candy canes that didn't taste anything like what they were supposed to yeah they needed them actually they had like three musketeers and stuff like that there was one chocolate bar that i used to get from there all the time that was actually amazing but it was basically like a mars bar but longer and just like better but i can't remember what it was called but i'm not a massive snickers person but we can average ourselves out where would you put it personally uh i would maybe put it in good i wouldn't put it in elite i don't think yeah i'm happy with good we can go for good snickers um we have a mars bar next i'm a big advocate of the mars bar i'm a big proponent of the mars bar um i'm also why are there loads of space related names for chocolate what's the connotation between chocolate and space because there's mars there's mars milky way um magic stars there's galaxy and they're all space related i swear there's probably another one i don't know maybe it's for like kids specifically because you know like kids really like astronauts i was just going to say maybe they were invented like chocolate invented for like astronauts potentially actually do you reckon they wouldn't be like this thing dragon like in space all the chocolate bars are named after like stuff from earth no that makes no sense uh where would you put mars bar i i would say it's probably i'd say good or elite from her from mars but i don't know what i'm talking about today i'm in a weird mood today for some reason i don't know why um mars i think mars i'm a big fan but you do it you because i i don't really have that many mars bars but it's i like it i just don't have it asking uh i might i might have to go late because we don't have loads of of chocolate bars and i reckon mars but i'm just going to go an elite the next one i'm veering in the same direction just because of legacy and also because it's nice but dairy milk like it's not it's not the most interesting by any stretch of the imagination but it's dairy milk it's got a horrible name though dairy milk right it's not actually a nice name when you think about it when you like abbreviate it uh it's cadbury's dairy milk it's cdm which is of the uh central defensive med so it's like angola kante basically who else is a central defensive midfielder douglas louise maybe marvelous nakamba if you play matic nemanja matic yeah basically nemanja matic is a uh cadbury's dairy milk uh do you reckon it's got going elite i think and also the versatility of it because they have various versions of it but i guess we're just touching this off the original one i suppose i think off the original one we'd have to put an elite the sad thing about it is though like however time it's just gotten smaller and smaller and now it just they because they've taken so much of the sugar out of it it's not what it was we need to start a business where we import american confectionary and sell it that's what we need to do you know how he was talking about opening a shop in town or just opening like renting a building we need to import like american confectionary and start sweet shop with actual proper i don't know how legal it is but we can see uh galaxy is next another spatial is that a word spatial uh yeah like a food chocolate astro astronomical chocolate yeah yeah it's very space race related no it's not shut up galaxy i don't know i like galaxy i very much like galaxy uh i think it tastes very unique you know you know know you sorry yeah i'm just trying to get the words out you know what it'll taste like without seeing it but you know what it is basically quite creamy yeah it's a creamy bar tea so what sorry i was just quitting fried in at dinner i don't know if you've seen season six through six i don't know if i have yeah if i'm not i have to i can't think if i have or not also line of duty i need to watch the new series of that as well and i think maybe the series before because i think i missed it but are we putting galaxy in elite or good it's going to be in one of them shortly personally i put it in elite because i think i think it is late chocolate is just good chocolate is just good i don't even have a sweet tooth particularly i always say that but i think i'm changing to have more of a sweet tooth now but like chocolate is just nice toffee crisp is the next one though i think this was always my mum's go-to when i was a kid because like my mum and dad would occasionally get like something if we went to like the corner shop or something i swear i think we'd always get my mum the toffee crisp i don't know i must have had one at some point i must have done i think i know exactly what they are but i'll be going yeah sort of average i would say maybe average yeah though they're all right there's not a lot of chocolate that's bad like there's not much that's bad but like yeah i really can let me think of like one or two that's like gonna go nonsense well are they on the list that you sent me they might not be i don't think actually at the end we can always think of one or two more that we have strong opinions on and then add those as well yeah um toffee crisp lion bar we have next leon there's a lion bird just sort of like a toffee crisp no it isn't i can't even remember well it's kind of let me quickly be inside let me google lion i think it's quite rugged is it a rugged chocolate bar i think so it's quite rugged what do you think you would be if you're a chocolate bar um it doesn't even have to be a specific one that exists you can just describe like what the qualities would be of you as a chocolate bar this is not making that's a good question wafer cat wafer and caramel i think lion bar is with chocolate on it sounds all right it sounds okay but probably not that amazing you know how sometimes with a chocolate bar there's just too much going on and you just want it to be more simple like that's what i think about snickers for some reason i think if i was gonna be a chocolate bar i think i'd be a snickers because i'm i'm in that case that's actually quite good i think i'd be uh fruit and nut because i'm a nut case and an absolute fruit cake i'm really mad i'm mentor i'm absolutely mental i think i'm a dairy milk fruit nut potentially what should we do with lime bar wafering caramel with a chocolate coating that's the official symbol of coating i would have it in good but okay will slap it into good dublay decker dublade decay also known as a double decker if you're english it's also a type of bus it is when there's not just one level there's two and you can go upstairs that's quite frightening going down i hate going down the stairs on a bus um when it's moving still yeah i much prefer the the second level though i'd like yeah like yeah it's mostly the odd people that's at the bottom and uh true i'm trying to think because the only time i'm actually because they can't get upstairs yeah the only time i ever really get a bus now is if i come to see you which hasn't been for a long time but i swear i always say upstairs on the way there but i sit downstairs on the way back like virtually every single time so i don't know why that is yeah not sure why i think it's always quiet on the way back it's always quiet on the way back so i feel like i just have the downstairs to myself and i can't be bothered to go upstairs so yeah um what are we doing with a double decker i don't even know what double that why do i not know what double decker is it's kind of chocolate at the bottom and then like a like a soft something in the top like a it looks like the inside of a veggie dipper from mcdonald's in the picture that i've seen i don't i don't think it is but that's what it looks like to me it looks alright actually sorry what did you know you can get a double deck of trains you can get a train now you can get trains with an upstairs uh i didn't i wanted it i don't know if you look double decker express um that's on the indian web on on the indian railway they have double decker trains one now and this one's chennai central chennai is where my grandparents were born that's really cool it kind of makes sense it's in india though because trains are like the busiest there i think so also hungary as well apparently uk double decker what uk double decker train oh apparently there might be double decker trains in the uk in the next 10 years that's actually quite exciting double decker trains imagine a double deck of cars and you could just like you were like getting driven to school by your pa by like your dad and you could just sit upstairs in the car don't have to have all that annoying small talk because everyone hates their parents when they're teenagers or kids so you know you can just sit upstairs imagine sitting upstairs in your car like yeah i'm bored i'm just going to go upstairs whilst you're in the car quite cool yeah um where should we put the double d double decker i would ah it's really difficult because it's good but it's is it great no it's not no that's good good oh okay bourneville i like bourneville because i'm a big dark chocolate fan but i don't think oh yeah you hate it i hate bonk well i don't like dark chocolate at all oh but you're in bourneville though right now you're live from bournemouth birmingham oh yeah that's true bourneville's just full of chocolate it's just like willy wonka's chocolate factory um what have i just got a draft when all of my windows are closed and the wind has just come into my room from nowhere my windows are all yeah that happens with me as well i think is this like a hole no a gap in between my windowsill so it's kind of a bit i don't know maybe i create my own breeze or something i don't know um stop breathing where would you put bourneville if this was just down to you don't like you have to take me into consideration and then we can average it out so if it was just me i'd put it smackdown at the bottom but um so if you put it in nonsense and i'd put it in elite should we just put it in average i guess i guess because then it's slapped by the middle although i don't like it i can respect that it's probably a top tier good quality chocolate bar so uh we can put it in good if you like okay oh vibes um i'm sure if i did like dark chocolate i would like it but i don't i reckon they should name chocolate bars after other parts of the midlands as well it's just like the cadburys solihull or like and the cadburys wolverhampton i definitely try like i'd definitely try like a caprice dudley i don't know what that would taste of only taste if uh tgf i know i knew you were gonna say or lenny henry maybe um milky bar is next i have have a thing where i have a mental block and i always confuse milky bar in milky way even though they're not similar just because they have milky in the name but a milky bar is just white chocolate isn't it yeah yeah um milky bar again we've discussed the fact that white chocolate isn't actually chocolate but it's still nice i would go for probably i'll probably go for good or average it's fine would you go get averages i'd probably say average because it's something you shouldn't have that often because it will just oh no telephone um boost uh i can't say i've ever had a boost boost looks like it should be an energy drink but it's a chocolate bar i don't get it the brand also is an energy drink i swear it is the branding's just not right for like a chocolate bar it doesn't make any sense but also i don't know what it is should we just put it in bad because we have nothing in bad and i don't really know what it is yeah i'm bad yeah goodbye well not properly because if it was in nonsense it would be goodbye 12 uh 12's basically a flake but with a coating on it which kind of makes it less of a mess in a way it does it's less messy than a flake but not not messy it still is if we're looking at a scale of if we're on messy and messiness of chocolate bars and the bottom is messy and at the top is leonel and then i don't know where would flake be where would 12 where would 12 be and where would float be like i think on a scale of leo to messi i think uh yeah it doesn't make any sense [Laughter] it doesn't mean anything  out let's i think tactically flake is better than 12 but no tactically twirl is more cleaner yeah it's it's a big flake it's better flake might be better to be honest i'm where should we put 12 i think 12 is probably good still it's nice because it's like light and if you yeah i don't know why that's apparently my symbolism for light that's like sign language for light potentially i don't know 12 we can put it down good yeah i like how i wrote that with that before i even asked but i could have crossed out what about crunchy crunchy sorry i'd probably put crunchy close to elite or maybe not i don't know i do like crunchy but i don't like crunchy all the time it would be like every now and again yeah it's a scarce it's a current but it's an enjoyable one all the same will rot your teeth if you eat it regularly yeah that is a proper like dentist's nightmare very brazilian teeth as well it could do that it could well do that should we put in good yeah or should we put it in elite i don't know this is pretty good we there's a lot um yeah there's quite a lot of good but the chocolate is good it is good it's mostly good if there's only so far you can go wrong what about a whisper oh sorry we have to whisper we have to whisper for this whole whole bit okay i'm not quite sure what a whisper is is it a slate just as well i don't know okay i'm gonna go google images it just looks like a more compact dwell um it kind of looks like a twirl but also like an arrow at the same time where should we put whisper i think we should bring him good yeah i think we should yeah i think we should put it good as well um whisper so if you enjoy asmr then let us know if you want us to start an asmr channel yeah it's basically just us doing this but it whispering it's just yeah we can just record like whispered versions of every episode and put them on there um we have a dime bar next we're down to our final four dime or dame if you're stupid i don't know i think people everyone calls it dime i think it's time it is time but uh some argue uh i've had a dime bar i genuinely don't know i'm not sure i have to be honest it's quite a crumbly caramel it's quite like sounds nice shatters in your mouth i quite like shattering it is great i don't know how to end that sentence at all but oh oh right hang on i don't know if i expected it to look like that but it looks nice is it what's the texture of it what does it like feel like when you bite into it it's like you're biting into a brick but like a thin brick that's what i was going to say it looks like it's like quite brittle but also it's thin so it's not going to be like horrible necessarily is it nice um where are you going to put it i will just leave it to you if you want because i don't know enough about it i'll put it in average because some might not some people might not like it and also i think we need more on average i don't know we don't have anything in nonsense yet um but maybe at the end we can put something forward we'll just come up with the we'll just discuss the crap ones at the end um we have a flake is a if a 12's in good it's a flake in average because it's a 12 that's more leo messy i would argue i would argue that it's better than as well all right to be honest i think yeah i think a flake because of the 99 mr whippy it's also very versatile in an ice cream it but not versatile in an ice cream but it's versatile in the fact that you can use it as a chocolate bar or to put in an ice cream so yeah that's absolutely fine to put a flak a in there what about a yorkie which was my go-to when i was a child but it's also sexist so because women it says on it like men only like women can't have this or something i wonder they definitely used to no they shouldn't do that yeah would get some nuts yeah well you can't yeah i do remember that let me try i want to try and investigate to see if yorkie still says yeah it says oh hang on it says it's not for girls but a lot of pictures don't say that they just say original so they might have got rid of it it's not for girl's part because i don't think they should segregate i think um we have to take points off for misogyny and oh yeah i think misogyny always makes things worse so i don't know i put it in good to start with but does the misogyny knock it down to average or even bad what's so good about uh a yorkie anywhere it kind of looks like a really plain chocolate it literally is i don't know why i used to like it well it's not there's nothing bad about it but it's just fine it's just like chocolate that's it let's put it in bad yeah uh yorkie and then i think there's one more before we talk about ones that we despise girl yes rubbish chocolate uh yeah twix is the last one i find twix nice but a bit too sickly like it makes me feel ill because it's too sweet it's like very sweet of twix i find yeah it reminds me of a school lunch box additive yeah it is very school lunch boxy for some reason i don't know twix is another one i swear like own brand twixes are nicer than actual twixers like i swear i used to have like tesco twixes sometimes i don't know what they were called and they're like they're actually nicer you know how like own brand stuff can sometimes be better than the actual original thing but yeah i can't think of any others but off the top of my head where would you put twix i would probably put it in average but i don't know it's not increased just i think it's too sweet though like i can full twix in one go i would i would agree i don't think i'd implode i was going to say funk i i thunk i had implode um i think he would as well twixie wix okay what do you hate talk to me about the chocolate that you want to kill there's one that uh i've never had but i know i wouldn't like it and that's a turkish delight which apparently is oh no yeah turkish delight is horrible yeah i think it's fries the same company that do the our peppermint cream and the orange cream which is also cadburys yeah i think they i think they're they think it's fry's turkish delight and i had turkish delight there was one you know the turkish barbers in like there's a couple of turkish barbers one the one where you got like your face like slashed open and so did i like they just have to like injure you every time they get your hair based on turn your ears and burn your ears yeah they like um off sometimes offer you a turkish delight and i had one once and it's like awful it's just like apparently a bunch of flowers apparently the only people that eat are historians and psychopaths that's probably accurate yeah turkish delight make yeah awful so the the country of turkey up your game you got nothing on cadburys or capris is elite to be honest cadburys is great in general we need to also at some point do a tier list of companies that do chocolate like cadbury's nestle hershey's willy wonka but it's just called wonka i think and yeah others can't think of any others now but yeah um is there any other awful ones let me have a look at worst chocolate picnic i don't know what that is but i know of it but i don't know what it is it looks just like the tiffin one but what's on the front of it it looks like it's like peanuts and raisins anything with raisins in is going straight to the bottom for me oh god well maybe we'll just do that as well then so picnics in there as well yeah if you look up worse chocolate bars like then none of them are actually bad like they are the worst but that doesn't mean that they're bad because they're still chocolate yeah they've got curly wurly in here that i've seen and curly whaley is are they the ones i like are they like really hard they're quite chewy and long and uh toffee sort of one yeah orange orange twirl sounds nice chocolate orange chocolate mint chocolate hazelnut chocolate and coffee all those combinations are incredible to be honest can we put bounty all the way down in nonsense we can if you like i don't know if i've said before i don't mind bounty i will have it i'll never go for it first but i don't mind it but for the sake of wanting to remain acceptable as a human being i'll put it in nonsense because i'm alone in that do we have any thing to say before the end of the episode just something's not right in my brain today i don't know what's happened um i don't know yes yeah yeah let's just say things like uh despite what you people say uh chocolate is not bad for you unless you have too much so just make sure you don't eat all of them and one go maybe like one every two or three days or something yeah i keep getting like there's always chocolate everywhere you can't avoid it like there's still quality street around the house like leftover from christmas and like lint that i got my mum for like lindor i got my mum for mother's day and then like she just can't eat them all so i have to end up having some and then it's there's always chocolate you can't avoid it it's everywhere all the time it is everywhere but everything in moderation folks everything in moderation folks everything moderation in moderation for the nation everything i need to stop saying folks because i have to start everything in moderation again but yeah yeah blue man blue van money kind of just um all you've got to do is everything in moderation yeah um so yeah so thank you for watching and listening the episode today um and should we say goodbye and maybe wave yes goodbye and wave furnace", "ZIGILsq-arQ": "what is up gamers today we're going to be ranking the top five thing bars number five is maltesers teams of bars honestly pretty needy uncle um it has seven types of diabetes um you", "dtdgPjCcxQY": "[Music] what is going on everybody and welcome to another minecraft video today I want to be showing you guys how to get shaders on the Xbox one version of bedrock edition for servers and stuff you know I'm on the hive I'm going to show you guys how to get shaders and custom texture packs on your global resource so yeah you guys definitely don't wanna miss this you can see that I'm on the hive and I have no shaders no custom textures or anything and I'm on the Xbox so I'm gonna go ahead and go to save and quit this be kind of a longer tutorial so hopefully you guys will understand I'll try and go over thing everything exactly how it is but at first I'm gonna show you that no I don't have no textures or shaders right now I'm gonna go ahead and go back to the main menu and I'm going to equip those shaders on to my global resource and just show you that it works and then we'll get into the tutorial so let me just go over here and you guys can see that it says minecraft texture update beta I'm gonna go ahead and click that and I'm gonna click yes go ahead and press B it's gonna load up this is a shaders now this shader is not made by me although I did alter some of it to work a little bit better for Xbox but it is called on the little screen here you can see that this is now the shaders it is a ESB II shader it does work on Xbox so I think you guys could download that in the description I'll try and have that one as well as my shader if you guys want to get that for servers so I'm just gonna go ahead and click back on the hive so that way you guys saw that it didn't have shaders and now that it's going to have shaders whenever we actually load in this is gonna be so awesome because now if you guys have some custom resource or custom texture packs and you want to use those on servers or like friends realms or anything like that or even other servers you know realms and stuff how I showed you guys on Xbox how we could do that you know with the app and everything if you guys are looking to do that and you guys want to do that with other cool servers it works perfect it's really nice I really enjoy this a little deal by the way I did not find this method the person that found this method will be in the description below if you want to follow him on Twitter welcome to so there we go we load it in and let me just go to first-person and look at the sky we have custom shaders now guys there's the shape there's the Sun I'm just gonna run over here because the trees should be blowing around there's the leaves you could see I'm waving it's so cool the water look at the water guys look at the water it's so beautiful the water so awesome I'm gonna go down here so you guys could see all of this look at this this is this such a nice shader look at the water this is on Xbox by the way so if I go like this you guys could see that it is Xbox it is on my account so yeah let's go ahead and get in - all right now that we're the main menu I'm gonna show you guys how to do this only on your Xbox one so you don't have to use the computer or anything this is a really easy method so the first thing you're going to do is whenever you load up minecraft you're gonna need to navigate to the marketplace so we're going to be getting a manifest from a texture beta so let's go ahead and go to the search menu press Y it'll load up go ahead and click in the little box here and just wait for it to pop up you know it'll do its thing and we're gonna type in beta that's all you guys got to do it'll be a texture pack bar just type in beta and press Enter once that's done you know and slowed it up pending on your internet mine's kind of slow right now but when that loads up you can see that it says minecraft texture updates so this is the very first one right here so it says I already own it so you're gonna click on it and you're gonna need to install this it will be completely free so it does not cost anything go ahead and download that onto your Xbox okay and once you've done that we're gonna go ahead and move on what we needed after you have downloaded the texture pack beta from the minecraft Marketplace store go ahead and go to Microsoft edge once you load that up go ahead and go to my youtube channel this specific video in the description I will have a link to a manifest that you're going to need to download so make sure you guys download that once you find the YouTube channel and you download it from my channel or you click it and it'll take you to this mediafire link go ahead and just hover over the green button like always like you're gonna download something new and then just click copy link once you do that let's go ahead and navigate to the more apps and we're gonna need to get the UFO transfer of course file downloader and we're gonna need to get ourself file explorer so that way if you don't have those make sure you so let's go ahead and go to apps and let's go to file downloader let's go ahead and load this up once we have this loaded up we can actually download this manifest I already have it in my files but I'm gonna do it again so that way you guys can see exactly how we do everything so it'll take just a second to get this loaded up once you do that if you haven't used this before it's really easy just go ahead and go to file down or click the little buttons up here sometimes you might not be able to see that so before I get into this lets go to the settings go to settings click it and then we're gonna go to video so go to display and sound go to video output go to video filter and overscan and make sure apps can have borders is unchecked you need to make sure that that's unchecked so that way you can actually see some of the stuff inside a file downloader in UFO transfer now that we do that so let's go ahead and click the three lines and go to download from URL we're gonna need to go to local storage down here so click local storage and you can see that we already have some stuff like crazy crafts so cool let's now come over here click that and click the move your deal back up your controller and press the three lines on your xbox controller and click paste once you do that move your little cursor over here and click the down button once you do that you click start and it will start to download the manifest it's already downloaded great so now we can go and click this to make sure that we have it downloaded go to storage go to local storage right here and you guys can see that we now have manifest.json perfect now that we have that let's go ahead and go to more games and apps now if you guys haven't downloaded all of them you're gonna need download UFO transfer so let's go back to apps you're going to need file explorer as well so UFO transfer will look just like this click it once you have that loaded up and everything goes you'll barely be able to see that in the very top right corner will be a little Settings button click it you'll barely be able to see it once you uncheck borders I don't know why when I record it does this funny thing where it blurs out like that but it just does trying to follow along though click open in file explorer click that once the File Explorer opens up you'll be able to see that we can go to packages and all the other stuff at the very top so let's go to the packages in the very very top and what you're going to want to do is you're going to want to go over probably one most the time it's one for this one that says mega scopes universal file let's click that once you do that go to local state once you have local state you can actually access everything that you just downloaded from file downloader so let's find the manifest Jason so let's go ahead and scroll down here and you can see that we have a manifest so go ahead and click the three lines and click copy and once you've done this then now all you have to do is download any kind of resource pack or texture pack or anything that you guys want to download so let's just go ahead and copy that I'm gonna go ahead and put it in one that I currently already have you guys would like me to show you how to download one it's the same method I have plenty of videos and there's plenty of other things to show you how to download custom ones but I guess I could show you just in case this video but for now let's go ahead and go to packages I'll show you how to download a separate one in a minute let's go to go scroll down until you see where it says minecraft we passed it minecraft you WP console go and click that file and go to local state games oops go to games go to Mojang Mojang and go to resource packs now any of these resource packs this is the one that I've currently using with the manifest inside of it so you can only use one at a time so if you don't want to use this one you're gonna have to delete it so I recommend using anything else that you want since I don't have a texture pack I guess I'll have to show you but if we go ahead and go into like this file which is my my actual texture pack you can see that has a manifest that's all we're gonna do is replace this so the one that we have we would just press start and we would just click paste and then it would replace the one that's currently in there so we need to go and click the original manifest and delete it and click the copied one to make it a full one so let me go ahead and delete this one like so yes delete press ok now come back here click this and click rename since I didn't delete it before which I probably should have let's go ahead and delete the copy out of it so that way it's just manifest dot jason that's all we got to do click enter make sure there's no spaces press start now it renamed manifest up Jason so this is my texture pack or my resource my shader kind of thing my volume one I'm actually gonna go ahead and delete the original resource pack that had this one in it so this is the shader that we currently were using inside of the video at the very beginning on the hive so I'm just gonna go ahead and delete this one completely out of it so just delete press ok now that we have that deleted let's go ahead and load back minecraft once we load minecraft we'll be able to actually use this and install everything that we need to do so let's go to games and let's go ahead and go to minecraft that'll load up it'll do all its loading resources and everything else that needs to do by the way you have to delete the texture beta one so make sure you delete that before you apply this one but what its gonna do is basically counteract to each other it's a kind of a shady way of getting these on to global resource but hey it works can't do it all of them can't do a whole bunch at once but you know you can have this one and since you have the manifest after you downloaded it you're always gonna be able to put it on whatever texture pack you want and since it's just really for servers or friends realms or something most of the time you're gonna be playing with the same one that you like so once minecraft loads up I would give it a second all you're gonna do is go to the settings and you're going to go to global resource which I'll show you in just a second if you're anything like me it takes forever for Minecraft actually syncs the data sometimes you have to wait for about 20 minutes but most the time it does go pretty quickly so if you guys are actually experiencing anything like this on Xbox just select your Xbox run its course and let it do its thing just walk away and then come back and when it's fully done loading all of the resources so once we're at the main menu go ahead and go back to settings and just go down to global resource see it hasn't even loaded up yet so now I have to actually just wait it's gonna end up load doing a loading resource pack so just wait a second and it should start to install everything there it goes loading resource packs once it fully loads all the resource packs you'll actually be able to go back to the settings menu so there we go let's go back to settings go back to global resource and now you can see all the ones that we've purchased or bought or got from the marketplace so the one that we have is textures minecraft texture update beta go ahead and click this and click the green arrow that you want to put on now that you've done that let's go back to global resource go ahead and click it and delete it there will be a trash button so click the green arrow and delete it you're gonna delete this one because it's the one you downloaded from the marketplace store and that's the one you want to delete do not do not redownload it or nothing delete it after you've already put the manifest on the one that you're wanting like a shader or a texture pack go ahead and delete this I'm not gonna delete it because I've already done it and you never want to delete it unless you have one already in there so I've already installed mine perfect all you have to do is press B and it'll work so since you deleted yours go ahead and press B and then you're gonna go back into global resource and you're gonna reinstall it so let's go back to play or not play let's go back to settings since you just deleted yours go back to global resource and now go back down and click it and click the green arrow whichever one that you are on so that way it will be back in here and then just click B it'll load back up and everything should be working fine if not go ahead and close out of minecraft reload it re add it to your global resource so let's go ahead and test this out you guys saw that the last one I was on on the hive was a different one with water now this one's not gonna be like that so I'm gonna go back to the hive and I'm just gonna play so this one's gonna be my resource pack which the water should be a little bit different the sky will have a different set of clouds the water will not be wavy but the plants will be wavy still but the texture will be a whole lot different the shader anyway so you guys will definitely be able to see that does work for anything any kind of shader as long as it's Xbox compatible shader but any resource or texture pack that you guys are wanting to get this is how you would do it it's the same method it's really easy go to any website any youtube channel whatever that you're gonna want to do to get these custom textures hopefully this video was very helpful hopefully understood hit I did my best to explain how to do this if you guys still cannot understand it or can't get it all the way let me know and I'll try and do one where you download I'll delete everything and then I'll do one where you download you know all the way straight up where you get one from the internet download them a texture pack or something like that but you guys can see that I knew how have a new kind of shader this is my shader this is volume one shader of mine it's a lot different so we got a different Sun different clouds the water is not going to be the the the leaves are definitely a lot a lot different from before so you guys could see they're still they're still wavy and the water is a lot darker for flow it's nighttime but it's not that dark but it has a nicer transparency but this is the one that I was using this is my texture or shader Ciego it lights up when you're inside yes we're still on Xbox and everything so that is perfect so yeah if you guys found this helpful or anything like that please leave a like comment down below if you need any help or anything like that I'll see you in the next one I'm daikon black rose and I'm [Music] [Music]", "NgkadHrFzQM": "[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

stuff we got okay so today as you saw in the um title we are going here i'll put these like right here we're gonna be trying different chalkboards that we've never tried before because there's a dollar store we have a couple here so we're going to be trying them okay so we have um island bar three musketeers a mars bar and a big truck we never tried these so yeah i'm excited we also got waters to wash down the stuff and cause hydrate okay so which one do you want to try first um okay we'll just get right into the video oh make sure you like and subscribe because thank you for eight subscribers um okay don't try this one sure okay we're gonna try island bar i'm not a big fan yeah i think there is i'm not gonna yeah i'm not a big fan of coconut so i'm just gonna see how this goes okay it's actually like kind of it's not sunny yet today but it's like bright mm-hmm it's weird okay look it's like how small they are it comes with three okay ready um i think it's really good be quiet brothers okay well it's not terrible well it's not my favorite i read that like a five hmm i think it's pretty close to like an eight nice okay next this is gonna go by really fast we'll probably be like big dark yeah sorry we're just like kind of whipping past this because there's like not much to do we got other stuff but chocolate bars and open packaging guys oh wow that looks cool much different than i thought it would look like split wait what the heck it's like purple what the heck it's like jelly inside look at that oh my god it's freaking what the heck that's good mm-hmm it's like it's gummies what kind of this is this um it tastes like chocolate licorice toddlers mm-hmm like there's a little milk that's really good that's actually really good i'm not expecting that yeah does it say no um what do you want to try water every time i want to try three musketeers i think that name is so cute if you're wondering she got flavored rings from herself my husband's yellow i'm not drinking pee don't worry okay okay musketeers three musketeers i can't even grab the end of it [Music] that's how you open them i split mine okay whoa and i like the designs like all of these designs okay that looks so it has like fudge okay um wait this is like mars bar but mine is for caramel yeah we've tried this before but you can find any other ones in the store that we haven't mm-hmm so we're just kidding it was good but um i'm not like a big like of course i like chocolate but i'm not like a lot of chocolate so um it's basically a mars bar if you've ever tried a mars bar without the caramel inside yeah just fudge oh we forgot to rate them we rated one okay big trick honestly like yeah i'm saying a seven and three musketeers i'd probably land in a seven for me i'm gonna say five maybe because i'm not a fan of like a lot of chocolate yeah again we've already tried marshmallows but yeah we're just gonna eat it and rate it because why not she looks exactly like a mars bar pretty much i love these water bottles they like yeah you can like squirt them and they split them up yes there you go oh my god i'm so sorry where is the fairness here evenly take that take it away oh my god oh no see it's just uh i'll show you for comparison it's just the bottom of the mars bar three musketeers it's just the bottom of the mars bar literally like look it's blue the same thing [Music] [Music] um because it like with the caramel and i feel like extra chili yeah i like i bring it like an eight maybe water hydrate me probably a nine so iona so i did nine eight seven and six which is my ratings this was a short video six minutes um yeah but i hope you guys enjoyed this video yeah i hope you enjoyed the video um let me see you i'm coming closer make sure you subscribe i'm like anna oh i'm just gonna say comment down below but the comments are turned off but in your mind tell us yeah because we'll get it from the air if you've tried any of these or what's your favorite yeah okay um have a great day night or morning i don't know bye", "5cFhx_myB0Q": "hello hi everybody gave here from the Hawaii Institute of self-reliance his survival welcome back Mahalo for watching in this video I'm going to show you how to make chocolate from the tree to a chocolate bar on the homestead there's three different varieties that I have right here is a cacao tree this is one variety this is the Aztec ancient Mayan Aztec variety you can tell it's very bumpy and not very domesticated right and this is the Hershey's variety this is what your Hershey's is made out of your standard Hershey's chocolate and this is old-school but this is even older right and how you tell that the pot is ready you can shake it right and there's a rattle you can hear the beans inside and then if it was on the tree and I'm not sure I can scrape the skin right just scrape the skin and there's no green right that's a good indication that it's ready to pick also the development of the ridges and each variety is different you just have to know you're ready so don't go away and learn how to make chocolate here's some pods on the tree leaf the bark to you some smaller ones is a better example sleep smaller developing cacao pods here's another variety here we have vanilla and cacao this vanilla vine is growing on the cacao tree here's some vanilla beans yes we grow long vanilla and cacao busted that one up good okay so what we're doing here is I'm breaking them open and he's putting the beans in the cooler to ferment and ferment these for about five days keep it about a hundred and twenty degrees and what you're looking for is just the bean and you don't want any of and grit or any sand or anything or any of that part of it or any of the Rhine so you don't want any of this you don't want any of that and you don't want the seeds to be sprouted I don't think we have any sprouted ones here so I won't be able to show you what a sprouted seed looks like but it's fairly obvious what a sprouted see looks like and you just don't want any of them in the container so this is what the sprouted beans look like I actually did find some right there they're sprouted you don't want them in the fermentation container and you don't want any the rhein you don't want any of this all of that goes back on the tree so we're getting everything that you don't want in here out of here and this will ferment for about five days have to help it get hot in this cooler and we're gonna put some of this into that and get the thing ferment and this is still cold and an active right so I can drain this one more time this afternoon before I put this in there and this will be busy man going off pretty good by that time and there's a vinegar with the mother in there you know live vinegar bacteria and probiotic stuff and some yeast and then you'll add that in after we get the juice that we want to drink right now yeah so this is basically yeast to start different vegetation and I'm going to show you that we're gonna collect some of the juice this is very rare extremely that you would actually get to see cow juice from the beam that's good that's good there you go cacao juice let's test her out oh my goodness it's like drinking a jolly rancher so good oh yeah at the bottom of the cooler where we're gonna put the seeds you want something like this so you can collect the juice from the beans the white part that comes off the beans here are some beans that have been fermenting for about three days now I want to mention this is a dry fermentation they have a nice sweet vinegar smell it's not a dirty sock kind of funky smell it's actually pleasant for a vinegar smell and I want to mention like I said it is a dry fermentation now when you collect the juice the first day or two is good but then you want to add on the second day you want to add some yeast and a little bit of vinegar to start the fermentation process but that's after you drain the juice because the juice is good without being fermented of course you can ferment it and you can make like a cow juice wine which is really good so now what you want to do is you want to ferment these beans for five days total if you go over five days they could get kind of funky of course you don't want any bugs and like I said it's a dry fermentation you drained it every day you mix it twice a day and you want to keep it above a hundred and four degrees and there's a little trick by adding hot water bottles inside here there's a hot water bottle buried in here and that will keep it warm and then these coolers will keep it warm so I'm gonna shut this lid to keep the heat up to keep the fermentation going this has been laying out for about two days it's going to start to dry and the pulp is rotted off you can see that it's kind of rotting hot it's come off of it now these beans took about six days to ferment and then when the temperature started to drop that's when you lay them out to dry and flavor or the smell of the flavor is a good vinegar kind of snow not so sour socks subtle smell these have been drying and they're not quite done but they're close and they smell pretty good a nice sweet vinegar smell not too bad don't worry about if they stink because roasting then will take out some of the flavor of your beans don't smell so good [Music] [Music] in this step we are separating the inside of the beam from the outer shell the outer parchment or chafe let's find one yeah this is easier to crack you see the inside just the nibs this is before roasting and then you roast them after you separate this part from the innard and I'll show you the setup with the Champion Juicer and a fan beans go in the Champion Juicer right in here no screen and come out the bottom the fan is blowing here comes out the bottom right here the fan blows separates parchment there you go simple easy effective cheap way to do it not that labor-intensive you could set up other rigs and it just takes time to build it and maintain it and you know if you're just a homestead and you're not doing a whole lot of production this works just fine there you go see just a little bit of smoke starting to rise off of here about time you turn it that's typically down you see it's starting to get it dark dark color to it and you can smell it and the convection oven would work a lot better this is this your typical kitchen oven and you could use a BB a coffee roaster right and then some people will roast the beans whole or roast them as nibs which we're doing right now I believe row seat as nibs better more surface area and I believe you get more of an even roast if you roast the nibs and not roast the beans you make nibs and then you roast the nibs because the nibs are little pieces of being you use a Champion Juicer to make nibs and also you can make the liqueur with the Champion Juicer as you can see them right here I've got the liqueur and then this is the waste that I could add back in and this is the nibs I'm putting in there I started out with five and a half pounds of nibs and one vanilla bean four ounces of cacao butter and about four grams of soy with icing and I kind of heat it up to activate the vanilla bean and to melt the cacao butter so I'm going to show you how I do this it's going to get loud because a juicer is loud [Music] so this is the chocolate liqueur putting it in the Melander wet stone grinder this is brand what it looks like this is the point where you add the sugar after I add the liqueur and that infuses the sugar with the liqueur and then you could pour about 12 hours after this has been ready here's the Melander add some sugar you slowly add sugar to use the sugar with the local for five-and-a-half pounds of a core you put in two and a half pounds of sugar which will make a 70% cacao chocolate bar and then you let this run for 12 hours or if you want really smooth chocolate let it run for a little bit more or you could take your sugar and we're using cane sugar and then grind it in a coffee grinder and it will infuse with the liqueur better and then at that point you want to pour oh I didn't show adding the sugar oh no I did I did okay what's the temperature four point eight ninety four point eight so 95 95 okay so it's ready to add the seed and this is one method of tempering chocolate because this has been running and the sugar has been infused and we got some cacao butter he's placing in there and this will start the process of aligning the crystals so we can temper the chocolate you just got to make sure that you stir it up really well you're gonna stir it through the seeds in there completely and that the temperature is 95 you don't want to go any lower and you don't necessarily want to go any higher because if you it drops down below 95 you might have to bring it back up to 105 to break the crystals starting to temper so he's gonna mix this up take out the stone and we're about to pour okay okay I'm not exactly right okay because we do want to go well I'm just saying before you put the seed in before you put the seed in now we've wanted to go along now you're going to drop it but you're gonna mix it and then the crystals are gonna start to align this is my buddy Gary he's the chocolatier yeah we're on right no no no cuz I this is informational and you know I'm just like an apprentice so if you go down to about 93 and that's the time we're gonna start forward 92 okay making sure you get zero water in there you want to stir it up real good with the seed in there you know all that stuff you know the stuff together because this is like the most important part you have to start all over if you mess up the tempering and it is not the easiest it's definitely alchemy there's no true science really necessarily behind this it's kind of interesting okay I've trimmed some of the bars they're out of the mold trim them with the knife there's just a little excess on the side not a big deal now we're going to do this kind of the old-school way with a piece of tinfoil Willy Wonka [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] there you go bar chocolate we groans we made homestead chocolate that's how we make chocolate now I'm just an apprentice my buddy Gary he's been doing it a lot longer than I and I'm learning from him and there's seven steps to making chocolate roughly and I think that most important or the most difficult would have to be you know the fermenting and the the tempering right because the fermenting you you want to draw out all that that purple and and or as much as possible and the tempering is kind of tricky you want it to be solid right and not flexible but you want to have a break good break here's a here that that's snap that's what you want this is a good tempered chocolate and sometimes it can be hard because it will bloom but bloomie doesn't really necessarily affect the taste too much it's just the look of it and how how well it held the temper so I'm gonna try it oh yeah that's some good stuff there you go chocolate homestead made in Hawaii I'm gonna wrap this video up right here I wanna I'm gonna put a link in the description box where if you want to you could donate and get some chocolate and I'll put a link in the description box for that and I here to answer any of your questions thank you for the like thank you for the subscription make sure your the bell symbol to give notification for when I upload a video and until next time Allu really good stuff oh yes just keep me awake keep you going for a long time this is definitely one of the ultimate survival foods but old chocolate", "sSiQ4pgi9Q0": "everyone and welcome back to the breakdown today i'm going to teach you how to download and install shaders in minecraft 1.16.5 i'm actually going to be showing you how to install two shaders packs in this video but this will work with any shaders pack as long as it's 1.16 compatible if it's compatible with any version of 1.16 it should work in minecraft 1.16.5 shaders so yeah we're going to be going over all that in this video we're going to be showing you how to install two specific packs how to find a few more and if you do have any other shaders packs that aren't mentioned on our list here or in this video in any way they'll still be installed the exact same way first and foremost though we do have a smart sponsor which is apex minecraft hosting go to the first link down below the breakdown.xyz slash apex this is your very own 24-hour ddos protected minecraft server we actually love just apex so much we have to our own server played our breakdown craft.com on them so if you want to start your very own minecraft server check apex at the first link down below the breakdown.xyz slash apex to get it up and running nevertheless let's go ahead and get shaders installed so the first thing you want to do is download some shaders packs luckily the second link down below will take you here this is our in-depth list of five shaders packs for minecraft that are all confirmed 1.16.5 working so as you can see we can scroll down here we've got all these cool shaders packs in this video we're going to install two we're going to be installing cylinders vibrant shaders here so i'm going to go ahead and click on that download link and then we also want to install chocolate pick shaders let's go ahead and click on that as well now when you click on these it's actually going to take you to a dedicated installation tutorial on our website for installing the shaders packs let's go ahead though and scroll down to disclaim the yellow download button for choco pick shaders and then we're on the official download page what you want to do is come over here to the right hand side and scroll down until we see minecraft 1.16 then we have this release version of choco pick 13 v9 go ahead and click on the orange download button to the right of that the download with them again after a few seconds oddly enough on google chrome you probably won't even have to save this file it'll probably just download without any issues you may have to save it on mozilla firefox though it's 100 safe to do so it's been downloaded by over a million people now we are done downloading just yet we still need to download cylinders vibrant shaders right so we're going to go ahead and download silver shaders and again we click this from our download page took us to a dedicated tutorial we want to scroll down and click on this download selder shader button isn't going to take us to the official download page for silver shaders where we want to make sure that we download the correct version for our computer the better your computer the better version you want to get for me i'm doing a video so i'm going to go with this medium here however you may be able to go extreme if you have a really good graphics card or if you don't have that good of a computer you might want to go with the lite version luckily they all install the same way now when you go and click download here it's going to take us off to add focus we're stop don't click anything on this page do not click a single thing on this page whatsoever except the red skip button that appears in the top right the only thing that you want to click on this page is the red skip button in the top right once it appears after about 10 seconds again nothing else in this page but the red skip button when you click on that it's going to go ahead and take us off to mediafire where you want to click on this blue download button right here when you do that your download will go ahead and start in the bottom left you may need to save it on mozilla firefox but you really shouldn't need to on google chrome now there's one more thing we need to download and that is optifine in order to get shaders installed you need optifine installed to make that happen basically optifine allows shaders to run so let's go ahead and get optifine set up to do that you want to again go to the i think third link in the description down below that's going to take you here this is our in-depth optifine tutorial we're gonna be going through every the basics in this video but if you do have any in-depth issues or want more in-depth help this tutorial can help you out it also goes through at a slower pace than what i might in the video nevertheless go ahead and click on this green download optifine button here to be taken to optifine's official download page as we can see it says minecraft 1.16.5 here that means that's the version we want if uh that isn't there you want to click on show all versions and find minecraft 1.16.5 but again for us right now it's right up here at the top so let's go ahead and come over to this version and actually click on the mirror button not the download button click on this mirror button here and you click on that it's going to take us off to optifine's download page once you're here you want to go ahead and click on the purple download button here and after a few seconds optifine will immediately download in the bottom left your the page may refresh or something to like an ad or something when that happens if it does that's okay but optifine will still download in the bottom left on google chrome as long as it says optifine on the title like ours does here you can go ahead and click keep and same thing on mozilla firefox and it says i'll define the title in the center of your screen go ahead and save the file now finally we can go ahead and minimize our browser and here on our desktop we have a few things we have chocopic shaders we have silver's vibrant shaders and we have optifine right so we have all three of these files on our desktop if these on your desktop no worries they're probably in your downloads folder to find them go ahead and click on that little windows icon in the top left of my screen probably in the bottom left of your screen go ahead and click on the windows icon in the top or bottom left of your screen go ahead and type in downloads and this downloads a file folder here when you click on that you will find your shaders packs and optifine in your downloads folder drag them to your desktop for ease of use now we're not completely done yet because we need to unzip this file now how do i know we need to unzip this chocolate pick shaders file well if you're watching right very closely when you download it if we come back over to chocopix download page right here we can see that this says unzip file next to it right if you missed that little bitty text right there you would install the shaders pack and it would not work every shaders pack doesn't need to be unzipped though so as you can see here chocolate pick we go ahead and double click on it it's going to have all of these different versions inside of it however if we open up silver's vibrant shaders it just says shaders if you open up a shaders pack and it says shaders it doesn't need to be unzipped if you open up a shader's pack and it doesn't say shaders then you're going to have a problem so let's go ahead and unzip chocolate pick so right click on chocolate pick and then go ahead and extract all and then click extract when we do that we can actually go ahead and delete the file we downloaded right like so and we can come over here to the new extracted folder that appeared when we extracted it now when we open this up we have all the different versions again extreme is going to be for amazing high-end pcs and low is going to be for lower end pcs medium is right there in the center and that's what i'm going to go with i'm going to drag that to our desktop and now we can even delete this chocobit download or this chocolate like folder that was created after extraction now on our desktop all we have is chocopic medium and silver's shaders medium as well and optify so to get started we need to go ahead and install optifine to do that you want to go ahead and right click on optifine click on open with click on java and click ok but what if you don't have java here or what if your java file doesn't look like my java file looks like something completely different well in that case you need to go ahead and do two things the first thing being this download and install java this is java for minecraft mods obviously shaders are monster minecraft so we need this version of java in order to get that installed it's a quick and easy three-step process and downloads everything from java's official website we just kind of show you how to do that nevertheless once you've got that you should be able to open up optifine with java but just in case you can't you may need to run the jar fix what this is going to do is like all the drop files on your computer and link them back to java making them all work happy together again and that's how you can actually get your java logo fixed to look like mine now let's go ahead and right click on optifine click on open with this time we're going to click on java and click ok that's going to open up our optifine installer right like so where all we wanna do is go ahead and click on this install button in the bottom left optified will now install it's super quick super easy from this point it's installing there you go now if you have any issues and for whatever reason it doesn't say optifine successfully installed here that's most likely because you've never played minecraft 1.16.5 before you need to go play it with no mods no forge no anything just vanilla minecraft 1.16.5 then come back and this will work let's go ahead and click ok here and then it'll close out of the installer now we can delete optifine we don't need it anymore well we do need it just not that file nevertheless now let's go ahead and get our shaders packs installed to do that we want to go ahead and open up the minecraft launcher right like so and then once we've opened up the minecraft launcher we want to make sure we're selecting optifine now we come down here and we click on this i actually have this optifine 1.16.5 profile i got to that by clicking this little arrow here opens up this drop-down box we have this optifine profile now if you have optifine it says 1.16.5 dash optifine under it go ahead and click on that you're going to go you can click play all that stuff but just in case you don't or if it doesn't say 1.16.5 optifine under it here's what you can do to do that we want to go to the installations tab and then once we're on the installations tab we want to make sure all four of these boxes right here are checked we want to make sure modded historical snapshots and releases are all checked and as you can see when we check modded optifine suddenly appears for many of you that's going to fix this issue you can go ahead and click play however for some of you it still won't fix the issue because either it just won't show up or it won't say 1.16.5 shop to find under it if that's the case you want to go ahead and click on this plus new button here and then you want to go ahead and name this whatever you want i'm going to name it play.breakdowncraft.com why am i aiming at that because that is our own incredible minecraft server we have 1.16.5 native grief protected survival it's the best survival server out there with 30 custom quest player-based economy truly amazing that's our medieval survival service got aquatic survival if you want traditional slash shot based survival in minecraft that is what aquatic survival is for and then on top of all that we have the best

playdoughbreakdowncraft.com is the ip i can't wait to see you online nevertheless once you've got your name in there let's go ahead and click on this version drop-down box then we want to find release 1.16.5 dash optifine let's go ahead and click on that there and then i'm going to change my resolution you don't have to do that but i'm just doing that so we can see better once we get in game most important part though is changing the version to 1.16.5 dash optifine mine was at the top though you may have to scroll down to find yours i do want to mention that but mine is right up here at the top nonetheless let's go ahead and now click the green create button in the bottom right and we have this new play.breakdowncraft.com profile but most importantly it says 1.16.5 dash optifine under it go ahead and hover over that and click on the green play button you'll then get this warning saying that you're about to modify minecraft of course you are you're modifying minecraft because you're installing shaders that is modifying minecraft so you understand the risk you know what you're doing it's okay we're going to walk you through everything in this tutorial go ahead and click on that green play button and now my obvious launcher is going to close and it's going to go ahead and open up with optifine installed where we can install shaders super quick and super easily literally it is very simple to install shaders from this point so i'm going to go ahead and do a quick jump cut and i'll meet you on the minecraft main menu here we are on the minecraft main menu to get shock-a-pick and cylinders fabric shaders or any shaders pack you want installed let's go ahead and click on the options button here when we click on that we don't want to go into video settings now as you can see here we are we are in video settings and we have this shaders button now for me it's going to automatically open but i do want to show you something that you can have on that could mess with shaders i just have to figure out exactly which one that is so give me one quick second i'm going to figure out what that setting is and then we'll be uh good to show you how to turn it off and then we'll be finished to install shaders or ready to install shaders so now if i go and click on shaders it's gonna say we need to turn off anti-aliasing and that's in quality so we can go into quality and then turn off anti-aliasing i think there may be one more in here like one more setting that can miss a mess of shaders but i can't find it so anyway it is pretty self-forward it tells you where to click on the first one being quality so that's going to be the section and then what it is inside that section but nevertheless we can go ahead and click on shaders and get them installed to do this you want to go ahead and click on the shaders folder button in the bottom left so again that is going to be from your main menu click on options video settings shaders and then the shaders folder in the bottom left that's going to open up our shaders packs folder where to install shaders literally all i have to do is take them from your desktop and drag and drop them into the shaders packs folder now if we go ahead and close out of our shaders packs folder here they are back in minecraft sometimes you may have to click done and then click on shaders to get them to appear but here they are to select the shaders pack just click on it it's that simple so you can see we click on shocker pick it's gonna reload minecraft and just like that this shaders pack is installed now you have more additional settings on the right hand side over here of different things you can turn on and off and different quality settings you can set for your shaders but most importantly and something that a lot of people miss is in the bottom right this shaders options folder there's a lot more settings in here that you can change for lighting and you know atmospherics and different things like that for example i had an issue with the shaders pack one time that had issues with clouds i was able to come in here into the advanced settings and get that fixed to where they no longer show up weird and basically they just weren't there it was like there was a hole in the sky and that was that would be fixed via the shaders options so now that we have our shaders pack selected as you can see it's got this box around it showing it selected then go ahead and click on done done done and we'll jump into the best minecraft server and the multiverse playdoughbreakdowncraft.com to check this out i don't know where i'm going to spawn though so um yeah we're going to see okay so we are on the aquatic survival server here it is night time and these shaders do look pretty good at nighttime but i think they're really going to shine if we do pee time day so p time day and that's going to allow us to see yeah there we go look at that look at that water wow so there's no denying that shaders are installed actually you can see the clouds look a little weird to me and i was able to fix that in other packs by going into a video settings and then going into the shaders options here i'm not going to go through all that because who knows you're just going to play around with it and you can always just uh turn clouds off with optifine like you could always come in here and go into uh i believe it is details and then clouds off and there you go now there are no clouds and it still looks good because this shaders pack adds in its own clouds high in the sky but nevertheless the shader spec looks pretty good this is chocopic shaders i believe but we do have another shaders pack installed let's go ahead and hit escape options and yes you can change shaders packs in game so if we go into video settings from our options menu click on shaders we can actually select silver's vibrant shaders in game and it's going to reload minecraft we can click on done done and here we are in game with now cylinder shaders you can see the water is a bit different things are a bit different and look at that lighting that's one of the my favorite things about shoulder shaders is this lighting that comes from the sun and i mean it's just amazing and how it like goes around stuff and just goes around buildings and trees and even like these goes through those fence posts it's amazing what the lighting in this pack can do let's go ahead and look at this one at night as well just because why not and here's this pack at night it's a little brighter at night in my opinion which is something i do like but it's still very very yellow due to torches but that's not here nor there nevertheless thank you all so so much for watching if you enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up subscribe to the
