skills pre-roll they're gonna see a little creaminess trade skills 1.5 grams nature boys all that stuff I think this major points to get always pretty role I was just going to smoke it before you know what might do something a bit different much good it just to see what's inside it you know in the spirit of like you what some of pre-roll West case we reviews on a Instagram see that minding some pretty roles and stuff seen exactly what's inside in that and I see these native boys peels and put quite a bit hard round at the moment a lot of people smoking on them like you know the business and that sort of for you know what let's cut one op see exactly what's inside it yeah it's only gonna be a short video like there wasn't quite as I can see what's inside to make sure they like stem use and often show that which I really don't think that will be you know nature would do the absolute business so I highly doubt it's gonna be anything sort [ __ ] in here but yeah let's get this a pre roll out and see exactly the same sue there is the pre-roll to start of it's a case then I'll show you as well we do have like a little glass I've wanted to be a little bit of weed in mind just unfortunate looking this being a bad stuff well yeah come to my class which obviously I'm gonna keep and reusing stuff damn certainly looks nice certainly smells nice as well really nice or skittle smoke coming up there so sweet through II sort of smell Klim yeah just a as well be is raining outside so I do apologize about that didn't hear that stuff but yeah anyway nature boys skittles pyrrole as you see you there let's get this opened up see what's inside it oh just got that cut open as you can see look all our weed there let's go certainly on Thursdays fictions it's looking at the business Google drive's anything that shouldn't be that's all the pulp order stove our classrooms everything you'll save a little bit in the middle well yeah natureboy skits you know you got break your dad didn't roll really nice damn yeah well I expected just really nice ground-up flour doesn't realize anything in there that shouldn't be in there absolutely don't think I can see anything anyway find it all stem is that just a sugar leaf you know it actually is sugar leaf they're so round itself [Music] yeah maybe it's honey's best I don't feel like a stem nut feels proper song might be Tony's bit stoner part from that looking pretty [ __ ] silent it's a nice ground flour it's not amazing that I put it out suppose for some great skills yeah certainly some diggin dogs as well which is just maybe it's been hand ground other than I probably Grandal to be fair a grinder this certain is it's a nice and well ground and I saw some really nice flower I don't know what I was expecting but I thought we were gonna see obviously I'm a DS need to boys pre-order many boom really nicely and stuff I just for whatever to one see exactly what's in there you know I've seen in the spirit of lots of a pre-roll and West case we review them and an Instagram afford apron assault so we could have another loss certainly seems like nothing untoward at the ordinary there's nice ground or flower Labadie the specs so yeah Nature Boy skills pyrrole well I have to do is we roll this now actually gets focus making it but yeah I must see the flash run quickly as well just so you can see that what and where I'm seeing just saw some really nice brown flour yeah it's we the flash on not really helping us see anything who have already seen things this you see for some nice grams of flour really really nice I rise today from that flush is doing anything frizz really is it yeah natureboy stick it was pretty rolled 1.5 grams maybe those are tiny that was stemming now I'm still not even sure if that was the spending it was proper soft and that look it might have been a tiny little step in there but apart from that it's all obviously for fire very nice ground-up flower so yeah and I we see comes with you little lacerations well fun you know sort of forget about Rosie a nice little feature on the pre-roll yellow flash boots like that grieve that that will certainly get some use out of so time to roll this [ __ ] back up like I said that's your meter boy skills 1.5 grab pre-roll go in just to check everything's what it should be in there yeah sound is always bigger major boys as well ways bringing as that fire and yeah what we do this so maybe different if you wanna see me got some more pretty girls let me know its best pure whatever Gordon actually a lot what's inside but yeah there we go Nature Boy skill was lucky a real soon with some washing your people I just wanted to hop on really quickly so bringing into this video obviously I just got that skittles pre-roll I have actually smoked it now as well well I've actually a build-up to spliffs out of what was left of it to sort of nice press smoke one absolutely fire banging taste to it some of the nicest skills I've tasted and the skills are reviewed the skills of my channel was definitely a ladder flavor the UK grade one and boy I would have said wow this the skittles wasn't necessarily as quite loud a flavor of some skills of smoke before the actual taste was bang on like initially tasted like some skittles like the sweet sort of thing no absolutely [ __ ] banging so yeah obviously I just wanted to hop on and say you know end of this pre-roll video have you seen what's inside there even sorted all right that was a little stem I personally not even sure that was still estab if it was it was certain very small stem but it was also not mud softened but certainly didn't affect you know or wouldn't have affected I'd imagine the way the pre-roll would have smoked yeah because it was been him you made bright white ash as you'd expect from eh boys so yeah I just wanted to hop on and just sort of bring that to an end bring it to a close sort of thing you know like anyway actually fought to the flower when I smoked it what's absolutely banging and if you want to see me got more pre-rolls you know see what's inside him and stuff let me know because I can do that yeah I also just want to say we're

now don't get me wrong these are the pre rolls that I have don't get me wrong I have something pretty well before but I personally have never owned one like I've never hey let me go get a pre-roll let me go cough a pre-roll you got rules no I'm not doing that I've always had trust issues with pre rules but I don't know what's really inside of it and I don't know who ruled it yeah so I got my two free pre-rolls last night at I aim weed pop-up shop if anybody doesn't know or if anybody lives in New York hit me up cuz homegirl got connections they're always underground we'd pop-up events that happen and it's basically a party where you could just go shop for [ __ ] weed you know you get all the exotic things that you've never heard for and never like really get around your neighborhood things of that nature you get to get that you get to get edibles food good music like accessories things of that nature like I got this rolling train oh it's all dirty I had this rolling train from one of the events that I did go to so yeah so I have to here I got this from the entry as you can see it's a little loose they were kind of being whatever and then I got this with the purchase of the bud that I've got from a table so I've already smoked the bud that it's already enrolled in this one and this is a mystery weed so hopefully all those will lighten refocus let's party let's party let's party my god I'm so yellow okay there we go a spark joy oh this is cute they even did a little a perfect em can we get that and focus I can't I can't get it in focus there's a perfect um there's a little piece of weed at the bottom but I like who did this voltar [Music] okay this is smoking good this is tasting good so far is good but um last night I'm at a good time going to the event kind of sad that I should go by myself actually a couple my friends my friends like mean I don't want to go me I'm me I'm like [ __ ] I'm going so I went I got me a couple Apes as I told you or we got me two free pre rolls and I got edibles so I'm going to edible first these are there you like these are the thickest edibles I've seen like and I got three for 25 I ate half of one last night yeah quick story so when I went to go buy the edibles last night at the table the couple that was there was nice enough to let me try their THC infused food so they had rice and like a car you chicken I'm not going to pass up free food so I thank you very much so that [ __ ] was my hit spot I'm gonna just say that it is by tasting wise it didn't taste that great but it sure enough got me smacked I give him that so moving on to the fuzz they don't die I got three different bugs as you can see I got two from the same table present both wicked green and then one from a different table boom so I got sugar cookie purple pie and apple fritters I'm gonna insert a video clip of it Oh sugar cookie was definitely a fan favorite of the ladies last night so that's why the vendor recommended it to me and that's what's in the second panel oh yeah it's really sweet smelling like it smells legit like sugar like candy and then we have purple piper if I definitely cooked my I personally pissed I like her I don't know why it's just so pretty so you got the purple part yeah then we got the apple fritter the apple fritter smells the best the best so sugar cookie was definitely a fan favorite profile looks the best and Apple Twitter smells all of them so also the positive thing that happened to me last night at this event was when I went to get the sugar cookie and purple I was only gonna get one I was only gonna get the purple pie but then the guy told me about shooting you something since you mentioned before I deal at your table was like two for something why they bother he's like I can't do two 460 I'm like okay cool so I got an eighth for $10 less just to get another one with a free I feel like a good deal because rather than spend 80 for two days I got anymore and a free pre-roll whoa sounds have you with that kind of made up for the fact that I went by myself but I did the most novice mood ever I didn't have any problem when I waited I don't know what happened like I swear to fall I had papers in my bag or whatever but I had nothing I didn't have papers I had fun so I didn't have a rep I didn't have nothing so as soon as your girl got there you already know I went scavenger mole I would like so where is the photo they pointed me to a table phantom blow me some paan so I kept it push it I found somebody I was rolling up I'm like I gotta look for somebody smoking not finishing like just starting to smoke or like rolling up at this moment so I was just looking around scavenger room and I found somebody I was like [Music] - oh so I got some papers I like I bet got my phone so got my papers I started to check my pocket no lighter mind you I went to this event right after work so I was so eager to smoke you didn't even know how to smoke I was I was like I've got this I'm on it I'm about to smoke about to have some good weed in my system I ain't never had before oh boo boo nah nothing so I'm so glad I'm part of the stoner community as we're stoners are very nice I asked the couple even though I've kind of felt bad that I was kind of like raining on their blue loving parades this is it we're definitely going back on and I had to ask them for you know a lighter they sure know tells me and homegirl huh huh and then we'll make up [Music] yes I did all in all I could have a good time and I wasn't upset about going by myself after the fact that I walked in the door I was mad walking there I was like oh yeah I'd make a stun pull my friends suck I went on with friends yeah it's like um I always want to blow me off of whatever [ __ ] them well no not [ __ ] them but bump them forget about them they want to have fun let them have fun and let me have my fun too but yeah yeah hope you guys didn't write this whole video about me going to the Vida vent last night and seeing some brand new bud that I got going on and I definitely enjoy this pre-roll because I [Music] have no idea what kind of but it is it was cute it was cute if you like this video thumbs it up if you really liked it comment down below other than that peace and love say hi you guys [Music]", "mdqV728E-ug": "[Music] what's up pop peeps in sugar I'll pop mine for 20 and we are back for another product review video before we get started popping so let's do our little thing that we call SML we need you to subscribe and while you're there I need you to hit that notification bell and also just like me because I'm pop mom and you guys already love me anyway so make sure you're going in that love but Ananya to guys today I know have been one like a total hiatus but maybe about a week or two now just because of the holiday break so I appreciate you guys hanging in there making sure you go to my videos as soon as they drop on leave Wednesdays I appreciate it I came back with something bigger this week guys I have Peck woods not to be confused with back woods this is tactless this is packwood's dot la is out of Los Angeles and I am so excited so be the proud owner of three of them I have all three pack words from LA they're now at planted 13 so you can get packwood's in nevada now at planted 13 so shout out to shot planted 13 that always hook me up with the latest that comes out I got all of these and Nevada from them they have an exclusive one called alien og so I'm excited I have all three so what I want to do today is just do a simple product review with you guys I will include all the links to Packwood's la comm so you guys can go in a site find out with new strands that they're coming up with but I'm just excited about the company so what they have done is infused rolling papers that look like blood papers and they're not they're a handmade hemp wrap paper that they put a vein into it to make it look like it was like an actual plant wrapper this guy's is special because they did three different infuse menteur this they have a concentrate in it they have a premium flower and then on outside they dust it with Keith so I don't even know how strong this is gonna be I don't I don't know how many puffs I'm gonna be able to get all I know is I'm gonna be a little out so I don't want you to judge me but we're gonna get into this I have three brands here this one is the alien OG hopefully you can see that this one is exclusive to Planet 13 once again shout out to them they are sold out maybe out of this one you guys have to call them and see this one is called GABA and this is a hybrid so is the alien og so both of these are hyper some remember hybrids want to keep you nice in the middle that way you can feel the head body high but not too high now this one the purple one is called purple punch and this one is an indica so today I'm not going to smoke Invicta I'm also not gonna smoke this particular hybrid Agathe I'm gonna go for the alien og because I am an alien and I want to get a shot off the plane 213 because this one was exclusive you might not see this one on the market I'm not sure so I wanted to kind of give my review to them as well what I thought of the one they made just for planting 13 customers so we're gonna get into this I'm gonna remove these two to the side so first of all I'm going to just talk about the packaging because you my peeps know when I do a product review I go there I go all the way there first of all I love that this can't break I do know they're going for $60 at the shop so they have $60 here in Nevada we can look up and see what they're going for Vegas but this is $60 so for $60 to Graham would concentrate premium flower and they keep one outside that does an amazing deal and I love that you can't break anything so you don't have to silver fragile because I mean your product is fragile but I love the date took the time to kind of like really design it where it's eye-catching as well and even if you see it inside of this place like it's playing 13 they have done the displays so beautifully so shout out to the pack was marketing team in LA y'all did that it also kind of reminds me in a weird way of a Kylie lipstick if y'all agree with me pop peeps just tell me that in the comment it really does it has that whole trippin thing on the side so this is really a good packaging I I'm impressed with packaging didn't even think that so you just roll it off it's a roll and I hope my camera can get to this so let me come up I want you guys to really see that when you first pull it out and you can really smell it the scent on this is I just love the smell okay so if you can see them holding my hand up you can see the key fits nicely dusted on it outside this part of it is a glass tip so it's gonna allow you to like kind of burn it evenly so you get a nice draw every time you pull that's what the glass tip is supposed to doing this is a nice sized glass citize I would say that's a couple of inches I don't know if you can see that real close up but that's like a two inch glass that's really nice to me it feels like if you had a mini cigar in a way so I kind of I love the feel of it it's nothing to it but to do it we're gonna get into it anything I like that's a blunt or the palm rolls or anything like that I like to light mines with the hemp I know this is a little piece of this is hemp rope I like to light it with that that way it gives me some type of control instead of letting my lighter control everything so that's how I'm gonna do it so choose the you pot peeps shot the Packwood's LA and let's get this alien og from shot planted 13 let's I like to inhale just to make sure I'm pulling everything I must say lighting getting I thought the pool would be happy they go be a lot heavier and it's not it's really smooth and I guess it has something to do with the glass tip now I can tell if you can tell I lit it wrong in here but it should have a nice even lip and because that keep us on the outside it shouldn't burn through fast that's what it shouldn't do if you find yourself in you lit it the wrong way just let it take its time and let they kind of like let it breathe and it'll evenly start to burn around so what I like is that you don't have to put the whole piece in your mouth it burns real light you can just put your mouth right on a tip just like my shirt be on the lookout for shop pop mom for 20 years oh I got that weed weird I like this a little dude not sure what premium flower I do know that the concentrate is nice and to keep this not even coming off on my hand I love that so let's talk a little more in depth about this back once I got my smoking hat on you know I've seen Rick Ross smoked this I've seen you waka flocka the baby little baby what's that other baby skittles baby I don't know one of them other babies they've all had this and now I'm hot moms at it I gotta do this I need a friend shout out to any of my papi friends that want to come share cuz I don't know if I'm gonna finish this this is this is a lot I might have this for the next couple days it's two grounds one person should have to finish this off seriously what did you say when you hi you just don't know what to say I guess you say that [ __ ] was good huh no I hate that y'all see me like this cuz I'm gonna be rolling I don't even know me get anything else doing this is too much this is probably not the best product reveiw to have done I'm super afraid of my life right now but this is nice you know what this would be great for like people that are having bachelor parties or bachelorette parties New Year's Christmas you can get them the people if you live in a legal state oh I can't move to this come to the East Coast Jesus [Music] Oh also Packwood's shout-out to y'all have made a collaboration with cocoanuts which some of the celebrities have teamed up to make these into like chocolate edibles kind of thing so check out backwoods la calm because they got a lot of interesting collaborations like they did a collaboration with planted 13 they're doing it with celebrities so shout out to them definitely gonna go to pack once when I go to LA cuz this is pretty cool in the light so stoned and how many puffs that I take I don't even know if somebody keep it count I wish somebody was here to play this is what they do to me pop beats they just leave me in a room with filming and just tell me to go for my own okay I'm really high seriously you don't think it too high he's just like alright I'm over it I'm like hi okay I think I hit this at least maybe 10 times which is extreme okay this is my review of a Little J first of all I'm high I'm really high and I just don't even know this hormone right now seriously I don't even I don't even know what to say I mean for once I am truly I think it's strong I for what a high grade us I feel like my body is just like somebody else came and took off really nice somebody named Adele a no Gina so somebody can come take over your body if you did a little G because I don't feel I don't know oh I probably wish I had a friend this year went that way I can have somebody to give me feedback and I know Papeete y'all wish to do that but you're not here right right here matter of fact you try it exactly it's like a calming effect but you just feel like hmm maybe I should take it slow like I feel like I can do things but I should probably take it slow I feel like if you were sharing with this this was someone you don't have to worry about them soggy enough to tip its glass so it's really like one stay sturdy you're not sometimes you you roll a blunt and then they get all saggy at the tip of it and you gotta pull it back together they've already solved that issue so this is a great cheerful I would suggest you buy it this holiday season share it with your friends you can put it out as you see I'm probably one hit just another day so this is definitely a two day if you buy yourself this is a two day situation it's no way this is no way it's just no way like I'm cool put old day I feel great about this situation would I buy it hell yeah yeah I like the alien og I do I really do and this key thing is fascinating it really is because it's not like coming off on my hands or anything Frank it don't come on that's just like amazing oh my burn my nose oh [ __ ] I feel cool this out oh I'd say that like I got a young Stoli if I put it alright guys here's my Beulah spec would if I had to give five stars I would definitely get them five pot leaves on

J I Sparkle up doing oh yeah you gonna be home [ __ ] cheaply crashing yeah [ __ ] so with that being said I'm giving a sour apple killer a 9 out of 10 [Applause] make sure you like subscribe more flavours coming soon and so they turn up", "8xi6JrT6pH0": "okay cool today in the name of what's in my pre-roll we have this eight gram grenade xxl infused pre-roll from napalm with originals flower so uh this is definitely by far the biggest joint i've ever gutted i'm not sure how i'm going to deal with that i have some ideas hopefully this all pans out but yeah let's go ahead and just jump into it if you're watching this on my patreon page thanks a lot i appreciate you being a patron it means a lot because this thing was [ __ ] expensive sorry to use some foul language there but uh yeah it was 150 on the menu pre-tax uh so thank you to tropicana for making this happen giving me that 15 discount got me out the door under two bills but still very expensive nonetheless uh but yeah let's take a look at this tag cause i'm interested in what we're gonna find here um so we've got eight g's it says seven g's of originals indoor flower and 1g of live resin and it says lift tickets infused rolling paper so i guess there is a g of live resin mixed in with the flower we'll find out together um and then also lift tickets are infused so that's like more live resin in those papers so in any case that's what's going on here with this label let's see if there's what's on the back okay this is the actual testing panel here just came right off that pin and this is what we got in here so 28 to total thc and it does say 7g a flower 1g of extract southwest caregivers here and when was it made back on 8 26 so not too long ago were just coming up towards the end of september now it's about the 20th um so yeah not too old just under a month about so interesting let's see originals og rolling paper by lift tickets so that i don't know we're going to find out together but that makes me wonder is the live resin just what's in the paper because lift tickets is you know it says rolling paper and then flower by but doesn't say concentrates by so oh but wait oh oh ingredients never mind hold on cannabis flour cannabis extract live resin diamonds cannabis extract live resin infused rolling paper alright so that answers my question of course there's the government uh warning they're always watching um so yeah we should find some diamonds in here as well as the flower and then of course the rolling paper is infused so maybe i'll be able to save some of that maybe not looks like quite a bit of cb oh never mind i was reading that wrong i thought it was 11 cbd i was like wow that's a lot but uh point one four five percent cbd so not too much compared to the thc in any case let's get into it and see what's good i'll take this tag i'll put it over here i'll move my sticker because i imagine there's going to be a lot of flour coming out and so this is it let me zoom out you don't need to be that close this is the pin here is the seal so you see you have the official napalm seal um and yeah i mean i think that's it i don't think i actually pull the pin that would be pretty cool but but i think i just twist this off so let's go ahead and watch the seal break together or if it yep there it goes and you can see that it's got that kind of amp anti-tamper seal stuff there stuck on the jar and here we go it's ready to come out let me zoom back out drum roll in your heads boom there it is damn this thing is huge uh definitely again the biggest pre-roll that i've ever gutted the surface looks a little strange just before i pull it apart i thought i'd zoom in on that and i do want to get a dry pool and not neglect that because there's no going back on this one and how the heck oh maybe you do have to pull the pin no i don't know maybe not do i just we're finding this out together i should have did it say pull pin on the instructions to use no no okay uh i don't want to break it but it doesn't it's like stuck in there what the [ __ ] hold on hold on here you get to see me mess with this thing and be a total idiot let me try to pull the pin no okay it doesn't work all right well it's in there it's stuck in there and it's like if you spend this much money on a j and you can't get it out of the cap like what the [ __ ] maybe i gotta unscrew it all right okay i'm just there we go okay i don't know what i did there i think that was my fault so pardon my retardation um pardon that my use of that because i can't erase it and we're live in this video so i'm sorry for saying that but yeah that was my fault i think i i feel like is this screwed in or what what what's going on here this looks like porcelain i should have probably read to see what this is made of but looks like a nice tip it smells great i gotta give that to the originals the uh i can smell the ogenus from back here so let me go ahead and get a dry pull on this real quick and it pulls just fine like i feel like if i lit this up it would smoke perfectly it's got that like really nice it's almost lemony it's like yeah definitely a lemony um maybe minorly gassy but i get more of a freshness off of it so it's like yeah but there's definitely a fuel in the taste too on it so i'm gonna enjoy smoking this flour for sure it's got a great taste classic og so maybe the originals you know i don't know it's it's it's definitely uh on point with a lot of very popular ogs i'm not gonna comment more than that but it tastes very good um all right so let's go ahead and get the right angle on this thing because there's no going back here we go with this here looks like this is where it was actually sealed together so here we go snip snip snip now this is a barrel and i really am curious about how they put these together because it's just like this big tube and i'm like is this you know i mean are these all made by hand hand packed most likely at least like do they cone these out at first how do they do it so let me see i'm going to try to actually cut down the middle here i'm going to try to preserve the paper as much as possible maybe i'll be able to roll it back into a j let me see oh there we go here we go i'm just going to open that up there it is there we go all right awesome well there it is it's coming out in a big old barrel because that's what it is in here all stuffed in oh man i don't want to lose any of this material so i'm going to be really careful as i pat it out of here come on now come on now come on now here it comes all right here we go is that no no i'll be honest i am on the lookout for seeds only because that is what i saw in another video where somebody had opened this up oh special k i just i'm glad the paper caught all that only one tiny tiny little piece managed to make its way off all right cool so the paper is pretty much intact i don't know if we'll see if we find any of those diamonds in here i don't know what they're supposed to look like this stuff smells so good though it's really awesome i definitely love the the smell i'm getting so let me go ahead and get more of a centered view here as i go through this it's a lot of material as i was saying i don't even want to breathe too hard because it'll just go everywhere um so let's see what we got in here already just a little passenger there so far now this is going to take a bit it's going to take a bit but i i don't uh don't see how where the diamonds are exactly and uh you know eventually um if napalm sees this video let me know what i'm looking for exactly because i'm not seeing it i'm seeing a lot of this though which i'm just suspect now because i've seen that other video special k i believe is the user that put that out and there are a lot of these little tiny looking pieces that like are not seeds because i keep smashing them and they go away they're just very suspect you know so but uh the material itself i mean i kind of like the grind it's not grounded down to nothing um so that's good it's got a good consistency it probably would have smoked pretty well but it does have the occasional passenger man it is just so hard to go through this much material though to be honest i probably should have put it in a rolling tray i think i think maybe these chunks i keep coming across might be something to do with the live resin i mean it doesn't feel sticky it doesn't feel like a concentrate by any means uh when i'm breaking them up but i'm just you know finding these little clusters in here and uh and yeah so i just want to be thorough this is probably gonna feel one of the longest joint videos also i hope my phone holds up uh heat wise because it tends to overheat but yeah i just keep seeing a lot of these little bits of things so i i think those might be the diamonds i don't know i can't say because it just feels like herb when i'm when i'm busting them down but they have a c like shape so it's very uh suspect in that way but not yeah not a lot of passengers really you know i mean i've come across a couple here so far there's just so much freaking material in here and so let's break it down you know we're talking about what 150 bucks pre-tax um so that's a quarter so and i mean you've got a g of live resin so i'm not sure what that goes for concentrate wise um but yeah breaking it down by its components what is what are a couple weights maybe like uh 80 bucks you know let's say 48 yet each right and then you get a g of live risen whatever that runs so this really isn't too bad considering that they constructed it also and i mean i am kind of going by more store prices pre-tax etc but uh but yeah i i wouldn't say it's necessarily super overpriced because there is something to do with this construction but as you can see it's not free of defect you know i mean there are a couple and i mean it's just so much too i'm used to just going through one gram so this is seven times the amount of material that i'm used to going through and it's like i can see as i'm doing it there isn't too many but there are just little tiny pieces that are suspect it's got a good consistency though i've really got to give it to that because yeah i'm sure this would have smoked awesomely um just the way that it's got a mix of like really finely ground stuff and uh and really big chunks in here and it just smells so good yeah it really does have that classic og scent sweetness to it um like the lemony citrusy sweetness with that fuel in there yeah i can't wait to smoke this stuff but uh and i just brushed those stems back in there so i mean i'm not seeing anything crazy i'm not seeing any seeds you know i mean that was the question after seeing the video that was released not too long ago would we find any seeds there's nothing sticking out at me you know and i'm checking as you can see i'm checking all these little bits as i'm coming across them but i really don't think we're going to find anything but i just want to be sure because yeah you can only make this video once and i mean you know yeah i have to say this looks pretty decent i came across a couple stems but you know stuff like this here there's gonna be there we go there's another one over here so i can pick these out you know and there's probably going to be a bunch more of them you know not not a supreme amount because i you know otherwise i would just be doing it right now but as i go through it i'm sure i could find more of that we found that bigger stem so there are some stems in here just a little bit nothing crazy again especially when you consider the price point you know and the and the work that goes into making something like this now i don't know what kind of material they started with maybe they get a good deal on lowers or whatever you know but uh yeah can't really see anything to complain about in here um but i'm not finding those uh we're gonna weigh this out right now so it comes out to eight g's they must be in here i guess like but i'm not seeing what i would suspect are the live resin diamonds or whatever so anyway i'm getting a notice that my phone is getting hot so i better move along and get this weight off uh because this is again a really long video um so let's go ahead and get the scale going i'll move you guys over there here we go all righty and there it is and you can see that pretty good from right there so let me tear this out yeah i'm gonna try to corral all of this material in here it is again more than i've weighed out before so i'm hoping this all stays in here be cooperative here we go oh all right so there's some left on the paper coming up to 7.7 and i did there's a couple crumbs out here but not a whole lot so that is what the weight is coming up to you now if it's supposed to be not including the paper then so be it uh it's going to be kind of a pain to pull this paper off i think oh let me try it hold on i want to give it away just to see if it comes up to at least here we go here we go all right i'm throwing the paper into two so you", "_PyqdvruQwU": "ready you're ready for this ready are you ready we are ready to smoke

for that okay so there's .38 of dope in this pre-roll that's on point perfect ah do another dance you're getting dances today now let's see what's actually in here so it's not too bad look at this this is a stem here okay that's something you don't want to really pre-roll right here that's leaf okay so there's a bunch of leaf getting in there this is definitely bottoms okay this is bottoms this is the bins after it's handled weed you're going to grab all this bits and you're going to put it in your parel that's what's happening here but there is flour in there too it's not all sticks and stems it's not all leaf matter you can see the leaf matter there's chances you know when i roll my joints i report all the stem all these little bits that affects my smoking goodness these are i'm pretty slick i mean i am slick but i'm also pretty happy this is a little slick pack um i'm looking forward to getting all snapped up here it's [ __ ] 420 right on the dot too hmm not bad not bad not a whole lot of flavor there's really not a lot that stands out on that taste i know i'm smoking weed but there's nothing to complain about either right i'll just start there so good good good good in the past i've had two other radicands actually have them right here i have the waffle and the god bud done both these they were both 29.99 which is a great price and they were both quality dopes they passed the test they're rebuyable they're suggestible check them out check out redican this is gonna be perfect for me throughout my day a quick little snap snap i'll take my i'll take bowl hoots throughout the day just to get my medicine so i can keep going that's what this is very convenient actually and for 250 per joint all i need is one and then i continue on my day this one's almost going out though i need more than that so you got a second one going right away before this one goes out and you just gotta keep her going it's smokeable but it's not flavorful that's what i like to say there i smoked my second one i'm getting down there i'm getting pretty snapped up i am feeling good i'm starting to forget words here you go friends take one of those put it in your mouth later later as easy as that smoke three at once if you want whoo [Music] you can like two up and give one to a friend if you want that's how easy that is to they're quick lights that is nice it's not like uh they light like a cigarette you smoke you know one two three four five there's five more somewhere one two i lost three okay so no i have four i have four in my hand and i got five six seven eight

one all right so it is smokable weed there's no way i do that if there's no way i could do that if this wasn't smoke but we this is decent weed okay there's there's not a lot of taste there it really just falls in the sativa category that's what's going on there so there's no point for really enjoying your bud the weed needs to be better but the convenience and the actual product is fantastic

just have these with you have these in your car have these in your glove compartment i just smashed through 10 retican readies the overall smoke was a little harsh a little dry there's not much flavor

[ __ ] like that [ __ ] i'm your neighborhood weed man roll that [ __ ] like that [ __ ] smoking i'm your neighborhood", "Ge0ORhYJmoc": "what's up guys welcome back to Kush Coast and today we're gonna talk about using your 120 sight cones machine and how the order forum a lot of people get confused on what cones to order and basically they come in different styles you can get cones Raw's these are the raw versions they're brown they're opposed to be organically made or whatever these are the basic white cones this is a company that you can buy it's called J wear and they make cones as well they're pretty cheap but when you buy from J we're compared to buying from the cones company the cones companies gonna ask you what sides you want them in small that it added a large when you're buying half grams you're gonna want the point six otherwise known as the smalls and these ones will do the half grams and then if you're ordering for the one grams you're gonna want the one point three I don't know if you can see that there gives you a size one point three that's for your actual gram if you use the gram ones it's really hard to get a gram in them so they call them one point threes or they're a hundred and nine millimeters the hundred and nine millimeter is the way you need to know if you're ordering from other companies like this J wear because they don't come in sizes point six point that it it comes in reefer King size and party size but the hundred and nine millimeter is the actual size that gets you that one gram but if not the ninety eight millimeter will do half grams pretty good but you get a lot of extra paper just so you know so basically some of the things you guys are gonna need beside your cones in the machine you're gonna need a grinder to grind the product I prefer these coffee grinders like this these suckers right here get the cannabis to the exact consistency you want for it to be able to burn smoothly you can over grind with these real easy and just make piles of Keith but if you just tag it a couple of times which we'll show you in a minute it keeps the product real consist and it helps surface stims which you can pull out later of course cones when you buy the machine it comes with one of these scrubbers and before you reload this every time you need to make sure you clean it otherwise you get Jam ups so this is a real important tool to make sure you don't lose you're gonna want a pair of tweezers in case some of them get stuck down in there and you can tweezer them out if you have problems this is a good emergency tool to go to you're gonna want a couple of different size rods or pins or whatever to be able to poke down inside of the cones and help pack them in case they got air spots in them these work really good we just got a piece of bamboo nap in we've been using them for a long time if you guys want and you guys don't have that much product you guys could cut off little pieces of card like I did here and this card will actually fit on this combs machine let's see it goes like right here well maybe over here there it is so it goes like that and then we got another one with an angle and we put it like that and you can block off holes this way and only fill in so many without losing product through the rest of the holes a couple crappy old business cards work really good for that but they also work good for stirring and making sure that you can fill all the cones so these work really good we got an old film container here and the reason why we have this film container is because you're gonna need a skel if you're doing it for shops to get them the exact weight so this helps hold the cone up and not spill all the stuff out of it as you're weighing them so you could go through and weigh them real fast like that but these are a couple of the essentials that you guys are gonna need besides some product for us we've got some gorilla glue these are some buds that work quite pretty enough to go into the sacks for people there's a bunch of smalls in here but so we're gonna make these into joints so go to waste we also got some green queen and we have a bag of pitbull and even though it's really good smoke it just it got real lar fee it didn't get real dense like we wanted it to so this all get rolled into joints it didn't make it into the bag so a couple of things you guys want to know to start you want to really clean the table really good otherwise it'll go from a one-man job to a two-man job on the bottom of this cones machine right here it have suction pads these suction pads are crucial for you to get through this once you stick this sucker down and the spot you want it at and make sure it sucked down real good to where it's not gonna come off leave it there don't keep picking it up if you keep picking it up you're gonna cover the table and keep and when you cover the table and keep it won't stick no more and if it doesn't stick you'll never be able to pick this spring up on the inside and be able to turn it like this it'll keep picking up with it and then you can't two-hand it and pick it up this spring is real strong in here so you want to make sure that it's tucked down real good so you can actually turn it okay so now I'm gonna go ahead and get out some cones and then I'll show you guys how we load it all right so to load your cones machine I'm going with these point sixes the this order calls for a lot of handout pre-rolls so most of the handout pre-rolls you get in the shop are gonna be 0.6 s or half grams those are the ones they usually hand out the gram size joints we'll do in a minute but basically you grab this stack of cones like this and then you can real easily just walk along and drop them down inside of these holes like this and it makes it really fast to go through it and dump them you're gonna pull out the little paper stints that they give you and you're just gonna go through and load this whole machine down like this until you get done so I'm gonna go through and load this and then I'll show you guys how we do deal with the grind all right real quick just you guys know we filled this in the down position if you can see here it's touching that's the down position and then when you go to lift it up that's the up position it sinks them all down to where they're down inside of there lower than the grade of the actual top so that way when you put the Cannabis on there or your material it'll go down inside there so now I'm gonna show you guys what it we do to grind it and the consistency you're looking for a couple of things that forgot to mention you're gonna want a couple of Tupperware containers we're gonna want one for grinding your product into then you're gonna want one to put the finished cones in and this one we'll use later but for now we're gonna roll with this one so basically we're gonna get our coffee grinder out and start grinding product let me get that set up so I could show you what it looks like so for me I like to go through it and try to remove as much stem as possible and get rid of all your chunks of stem those will end up plaguing you later when you go to try to tighten joint down and twist the tops those little pieces of stem will start poking through it so I'm gonna just keep breaking this up like this getting it inside of this grinder trying to pull all the big chunks that I can find anything hard real pokey you want it gone but make sure you got gloves on so you're not you know making everybody's smoke all dirty dead skinned and you don't get your hands super sticky or black this products real sticky and it'll ruin your hands real fast it'll make it tore you can't touch the papers without ruining them so you want to make sure that you get your hands covered with some kind of gloves for this process it's just better all the way around and sanitary for the product as well you don't need to fill this very full of course you don't want to be sitting here all day long doing tiny bits at a time but I mean you want to make sure that it's got a good chunk in it just not super packed to where gonna make it hard and you have to fight the lid on it so once I get it about like that I'm gonna throw my cap on and this only takes like a couple of seconds you'll listen and I'll let you hear it there's one and then I'll do one with a shake then I'm gonna open it up and you can already see that it's pretty ground down pretty fine so a consistency like this is really nice but you have to still be sure that there ain't no bigger chunks like this these little chunks like this will get stuck in there and mess you up real bad so you're just gonna go through it and break them up make sure and I move the product from one side of this box to the other just to make sure there ain't no big chunks that did get broke up like that one or any big stem that you see you're gonna want to make sure it's broke up as well any big stems but that's basically the grind right there then I take this and I slide it down and then I go on to the next one you can see all the kief in it there's a lot of Keef in that if you go too long all you will make is piles of Keef there won't you won't have any mass to it so when you go to smoke the joy what happens is this one and either gets so compacted that it doesn't want a bird or two it'll start running oil all the way down your face when you smoke on it it gets so tight that the oil just starts pouring out the end of the cone and you don't want that so I'm gonna go through this bag right here and knock out as much as I can and I'll show you guys what it looks like when I get it all browned up okay here you can see our consistency it's fine grain powder like tobacco we removed all the stems like we talked about you need about 65 to 70 grams to do 120 1/2 grammars you always want to go about 5-6 grams over so they're not light but plus you're gonna lose some even with your scale on the point system which we'll show you later so I got my consistency ground up set that off to the side say this is the area I'm working in I already threw my pile of stems away you're gonna want to take a moist paper towel and wipe this down real good and make sure it's clean you're also going to want to touch the bottom of your suction cups and make sure they're clean and moist and there's nothing stuck to them then you're gonna set it down and you're gonna make sure it's planted on the table solid so that way when you go to pick it up later and turn it it doesn't come up off of the table but now that we know it's on there and it's already in the up position not the down position where the white papers showing but up position am i picking it up and locking it into place it keeps the papers from getting destroyed now taking the old card I like to use these business cards and I like to sprinkle it on here and try to go pretty evenly and you're not gonna fill them all right the second you're just gonna spread some out across the tops and make sure some little pieces fall down in there so that way when we do the first beating you can make sure that you get it all the way down to the cones filter at the bottom the little crutch so I'm just gonna get some down inside of these like this and once I'm confident that I spilt a little bit in each one and that each one's got a little tiny bit in it I'm gonna go ahead and go through like this and if you do it light-handed don't go Bam Bam Bam just like it actually gives you a better pack than if you're slamming on it real hard then I'm gonna go through and I'm gonna add some more and this time I'm gonna get a little fuller and a little fuller until they're all filled up you're just gonna keep repeating this process and if you do it if you take the time to do it right the first time you won't have to bunch you have to fix nobody likes having to go through and fix a whole bunch of these combs it sucks so to keep the process fast it just do it right the first time and you won't have no problem so I had it a little bit and add some more product and I'm gonna do this until I know that all the paper are covered that each one of them have some to the top of that white paper in there I don't know if you can see that with the camera but you got to make sure that it gets all the way up to there it looks like I need to grind some more let me have a second and I'll be right back guys so I got more ground we're gonna get them all filled up a little fast make sure we get all of our holes filled and you can look down in them and see which ones didn't get it which ones did and of course I didn't weigh this product which I probably should have then I would have known I had enough but I don't got time I got orders to fill so I'm just flying through it as fast as I can we still have thwack sirs to do which I'll make a video on that that's where we take whacks and then keep rolling which I'm sure everybody's already knows how to do but we get so many questions why not make a video about it right and of course we don't get paid for by combs or anybody else for any of these videos we post you guys know nowadays YouTube confiscates all the money and it doesn't allow anybody to do any type of merchant handling or any type of third party marketing or anything like that for anything with cannabis on it they uh ixnay your videos monetization so we don't get paid for this we just do this out of you know share and share alike and this culture was based on that so all these secret keepers nowadays you can keep your secrets and Joe money alright that's looking pretty good we got just about all of them full some of them are a little short but they'll make up for it later as we're pulling weight out of them cuz they're always gonna be over so you're gonna be taking quite a bit out as you go [Music] alright now when you go to the turn it it's stuck to the table really good and they're gonna all stand up for you just like that right there now you're gonna go and pick through them and you're gonna throw them on a scale to see what they weigh and that's why we have this little cup here and we set that on the scale before we turn our scale on to tear it I also like to keep another cup on the graphic pass this one over here because as I pull them these way approximately for the half gram joints about 0.2 so at point two you need to make sure that this says point 7 or 0.8 and in California and Oregon to be able to say that you're selling it to a shop and it's medicine you need to make them weigh exactly so that way they're not getting a messed up dosage scale so point 7 is what they really want them to be at so you're just gonna take over here and make yourself a little pile because as you can see when we shook this thing it kicked out all kinds of product around it so as soon as we're done we're gonna clean it all to the front of us get it back into our bag or our Tupperware and clean the table again and start over again but this one still says point eight so I got to get it down now it jumped two points there it is right there that's close enough okay so you're gonna take your poker you got two different pokers you're gonna take your poker and just to get you a nice flat top to be able to grab it with three fingers and you're gonna do a shake like this and that shake is gonna tighten it up you can hold it up to the light and look through it and you can see that the product made it all the way down to the bottom and there's no big air gap here and if there is an air gap you just keep shaking it until it comes out when you crease it with your three fingers it's gonna make a little try thing like that kind of like a triangle right once you got it like that you're gonna give it a gentle twist like this and then you're gonna shake it again to help tighten that twist into place and when you're done it should look just like that right there to keep your scale from being on for long periods of time though the trick is to go through pull them out one at a time weigh them make sure that they get their weight right and set them right here in this jar fill up a jar like this first and then go through and tighten them all up after you're done it'll make it a lot faster for you in the long run and you could have multiple jars and go through the whole thing real fast but unless you have somebody else here helping you and you're doing this by yourself this is the best way to do it right here all right guys I'm gonna go on to finish it in this out I'll show you guys how many we get and what they look like when we're all done all right made it through all 120 it took me about 28 minutes 29 minutes or so and just from going from here skelling I'm dumping the excess inside of the cup dropping them in here boom boom boom until I had my cup full shut my scale off take them twist all the tops throw them inside of my Tupperware that's what a hundred and twenty look like it would normally go straight from here twist them put them in a two sticker label um and then put them in off to the side but this company doesn't need them to so there is going in Tupperware and they're gonna be delivered like that and the tough work so they stay dry and they don't dry out any further before you guys even get to this process though you guys should practically roll one see how it smokes and make sure that it burns properly before you get to this stage where you're making hundreds of them if you get some cannabis that people grow or if you didn't grow it yourself and you're purchasing it they didn't flush it properly the joints won't burn right and you don't want to make hundreds of them and hand them out and get a lot of complaints about the way they burn I mean the number one reason for them not burning right is because of the way people dry and cure it but if they don't flush properly that's another reason why to moist a weed won't grind white right or it won't burn right so you want to make sure that it's at the right dried consistency to be able to grind up nicely not so dry that it's you know turn straight to dust but about four to six percent is the average moisture level that you're going to be looking for my next stage will be after this is to clean this to repeat the process and I'll show you guys how I do that alright so real quick for you guys to clean this the simple way is to make sure everything's down in the holes first using a card to scrape all any big chunks that's leftover then you take your brush and you go through and you brush off the top make sure everything goes down on the inside like this here make sure it's good and clean then you're gonna make sure that it's in the upright position not in the bottom closed position that way this can go all the way through and clean really good I like to choose a section this is in section so find a section start at a section and roll with it and just fly through it like this right here and this is pushing everything down to the bottom and this will make sure that when you put the next set of cones and they don't stick to the walls that could be a real big problem if you get them all caked in there you can't get them out you end up breaking a bunch of papers this is the best way to do it just like this right here all right so we got it all cleaned out I don't know if you could pan the camera down here and see inside here all that that's in there so we got our tough water dish over here I'm gonna just dump my extras in there I'm gonna take this bad boy lean it over on its side like this so I could see down it I don't know if you guys can see in there and then I'll take my brush and I'm gonna go through and I'm gonna scrub this bottom plate off with the brush and get it really good and clean and try to get all that stuff out of there and onto the table it's weird holding it like this for your guys's angle but uh you got to make sure you get the thing super clean you don't want this thing getting gummed up it'll gum up real fast on you if you have to you have to clean it with alcohol or something that's fine clean it with alcohol but then make sure you let it dry out for a long time before you use it again because the key itself will stick to everything like glue if it sits there the longer it sits there it'll stick so hard it'll be real hard to get off so the trick is is to go through this as fast as you can and try to get you know all of the product back off of the off of this 120 sight combs machine so it's not stuck to it like glue then you could give it a couple of days it's clean set it off to the side out of the way try not to get the two or the three little suction cups dirty you got your tongue over here and you look at this right here see how it automatically keeps up and starts to clump up that's because it's got a lot of oils in it get your card out scrape it all right back into your tough wire and you're gonna repeat the process again and again and again so you're done with your tada but you want to make sure that you clean this table off really good I got me a paper towel right here and I'm gonna get it wet and I'll use that to read moisten the table again and make sure that it's tucked down real good because any of these little particles right here they're gonna mess up your guys's suction with the suction cup so grab a paper towel and then go through and just give it a good wipe picking up all those little green particles flip this bad boy over make sure my suction cups are clean stick it to the table make sure it's stuck now you can turn it BAM back in business time to reload and go again and basically that's all there is to how you do this 120 sight cones machine it's real simple it's made out of real hard plastic and if you can afford it I know they're expensive but if you guys can afford it this is the way to go for mass producing joints the cones works good they got crutches in them so you don't get cannabis or tobacco or whatever you're using in your mouth and these are the subway we prefer to do it if we're gonna be doing them by the you know buttload but

bed still go a bit [ __ ] so I was chilling on my bed I went to the kitchen I went to go get some [ __ ] like somebody drink or something eat I was checking on something so anyways I had got up off my bed to go to the kitchen so I went to the kitchen came back had my lady in the couch on my bed and I went to take my slipper off so I have put like raised up my right foot and then I tried to kick my slipper off and as I kicked down bra it was all bad as I kicked down my foot caught my email cord bra oh and as you can imagine the worst happen the [ __ ] email came tumbling down the [ __ ] drop down came off the [ __ ] red was on the ground water spilled the after bath of that [ __ ] Oh bad that bucket after bath of that [ __ ] oh the custom girl rig into pieces guys it's in pieces it's in [ __ ] pieces and you know what didn't [ __ ] break this wasn't the downstem that wasn't biscuit that was the drop down that was on it this was the drop down that was on it and it didn't [ __ ] break so this [ __ ] [ __ ] was damn near set up like this in like this right oh [ __ ] me oh it cut me [Music] look that [ __ ] really cut me anyways so this [ __ ] was dammed out here like this like this and [ __ ] he came crashing down off the table boom boom bap this [ __ ] broke this didn't break I wish it did this was only ten dollars this rig came in a daily high club box that was like $35 so in any rate I [ __ ] broke a rig again check this out this this right here is my first ever piece of glass I bought it was if you could see [ __ ] if you can see that [ __ ] just diamond glass this was the first rig I bought I bought this [ __ ] off 420 in San Francisco on Haight Street just because by huh be cool ja needed add a brick to take a dab out of so I was like [ __ ] I mean let me cops up so we can take some dabs she was taking dabs on 420 with my homie cool John that was reason why I bought this piece but then it ended up breaking I didn't break this piece but it ended up breaking and it's just what happens when you have glass man [ __ ] breaks so yeah I'm a little salty that this shit's broken because it was like my best setup that I have for an email and my mom gave me just peace so it was like you know didn't cost me nothing but [ __ ] it lost me everything do you feel me because this it was tight so that's his god broke-ass it sucks this is still going it's burning just fine it's burning like pretty slow for being just one person token on it it's hella nice is burning evenly now that I finally got it going it's [ __ ] blue brah that's just my favorite I wish this was blue but my older brother got it for me his favorite color is red so that's the only reason why we're cuz my brother got it for me for Christmas so shoutouts to my brother you guys think about this area should get along whoo so yeah guys that's what I've been up to just working on the [ __ ] grind making sure my finger don't bleed out just been working you feel me putting these videos out let me know if you guys like this style here or if you like it over there where I sit on a couch I'm on the other side of the couch and this is like where I sleep so [ __ ] if you leave a comment down below if you like it this style view like looking like this to the side having to cuz I get a better lighting from here when I'm over here on this side I use a [ __ ] lamp light and this burnt out so yeah if

you like it on my bed couch with the window open leave a comment down below what you guys like to see better yeah it's going pretty nice so yeah man all right Pete to the custom grow 420 really that was like to clean this piece to use on my email this because it had the least air restriction it was like a juggler you dumb you just like you can you can just take a toke on that as hard as you wanted to in you filming you was getting your whole dab unlike this piece right here because of all the [ __ ] little [ __ ] and [ __ ] in here all these little [ __ ] you kind of have to hit it harder to get more airflow this one you just and it would just come at you didn't even have to that had no restriction at all [Music] sidecar [ __ ] super slid the fuses I [ __ ] was bomb but r.i.p we got anymore come on you mentally smoke too much flour on this channel but we'll try and come out with some more content with flour I do like some open oil it's my shake that's pretty nice the ash is pretty white guys my review on this since I've been smoking it this [ __ ] got me [ __ ] loaded so it's a pass you feel me it's easy on the throat it's easy on the lungs you get fat clouds out of it and this one in particular is actually rolled way better cuz I actually if you will go watch my [ __ ] what video maybe it's not even in a video yet [ __ ] well I [ __ ] had two of these right so I had this one and I had this one which was the red one and the red would damn near was trash you feel me I didn't really like the red one now I'm not hating on it because it was [ __ ] red but like when you [ __ ] took a toke on it like for some reason it would just like it would hit like you could get a cloud off it and I smoked it to the face and I don't feel like I got loaded off it it tasted cool was black cherry but I don't really like that one but this blue one is [ __ ] bomb cuz like my eyes are already low as [ __ ] is this I'm just higher can't even it's hard to explain it it's way better and I was damn you're gonna smoke another one with you guys for the [ __ ] of it yes this one the sour tangi because i got two of these too and I still have both of them that I need to throw up and it's from the same company so they got these where's that [Music] damn cuz I was gonna put a fella forgot because I was gonna put this [ __ ] out and light one of these [ __ ] right here because one of these is tangi sour tangi sour tangi and this one is [ __ ] juice this is a good old uh and this is a indica and this one is a hybrid you feel me I forgot I was only gonna smoke half of this and then smoke one of these down but [ __ ] damn this [ __ ] just went out so this one just went out I'm actually gonna [ __ ] spark one of these [ __ ] it I'm Lexie I'm gonna just our tangi I think so lucky sour tangi this one here okay so this one just to recap really quick high voltage it was a pre-roll raw cone had top-shelf blood in it I don't even think I said this Kylie's finest og mix for life president it doesn't even say [ __ ] on here covered with OG key and it has live resin inside and I'm assuming it has you know top gel blood in it because that [ __ ] was pretty fired this one here is a premium cannabis rolled with the foot Premium Canada strolled in nature and natural leaf nature I'm cuttin hi this right here nature's combs premium cannabis rolled in natural leaf nature's calm calm distributed by Kings coast tan GOG hybrid tested 1.2 grams tested by SC labs 31.3 40 Hz so yeah there's that I'll show you guys this get it glare off it comes with this [ __ ] on the top I'm assuming that's just so just so just so just so yeah so the none of that [ __ ] did falls out I'm actually gonna keep that on there yeah yeah yeah I got that [ __ ] back on their breath okay so I'm gonna leave it on here just because I don't want this [ __ ] falling out so this was genius and idea number one [ __ ] smartest [ __ ] so this [ __ ] don't fall out it has a [ __ ] filter in there that's pretty [ __ ] dick it's got this cool little band on it to hold everything in it's a palm leaf is what they told me if I'm not mistaken you take a [ __ ] swag ha yeah so this is a palm leaf I'm not mistaken so let's [ __ ] party be spark it mother sparker yay Cheers [Music] [Music] the flavor on this is kind of hard to describe I don't know you've got a [ __ ] try this you I'll know it makes

you guys can see I don't bring it back and it's about to get night time for you guys cuz I know a lot of you I wanted to see the night time so stay tuned see if it gets night gang [Music] keep down please smoke everywhere we go [Music] let's go baby fam we got the joint lit as you can see it is ripping you guys you guys see the cherry on that thing I think it's back what you guys think about it yes I really like the tip that it has on it it's like I never seen a tip like that before but I'm really liking it because it keeps all the Scooby Snacks we're coming in your mouth and we also noticed that you don't have to get a hella hard like I thought that you had to be like you know how like when you roll hella fat you've got to hit it hard know that one you can hit it regular like a regular joint and it's hitting really good yeah I'm hitting it way too hard it is pretty heavy you guys there's hella [ __ ] weed in there I mean what the weed included but the tip is pretty heavy left away the tip itself see how much it that's some Gaston I didn't even know there was constant rain there either I just see like the celebrity spike scenes and I was like in aware how much to smoke on what should be cat he was saying that bringing a joint like this is like bringing like a bottle oh yeah like okay it's like usually when you go see like a family friend or just somebody like that's important to you bring him like a like a cake or a bottle you know something for like this nice gift big Oh join make sure if you have it comes to your size I mean if you ever go see your friends you pull up with one of these and yeah and if you live in a set you better keep its rental in your pocket in case you're looking up saw yeah it's kind of running a little bit late yeah that's the only thing that I'm trying to figure out how would you stop that or just [ __ ] probably start lighting the other side once I feel like you need to have like [ __ ] yeah look we did it work to catch it up old fashioned hello saliva you know stop the look going out right hopefully that works let me know what you guys do to stop your plants from running put it on but so far what do you guys what do you think I'm highest luck gets high in here it's boxy to be honest with you I'm gonna give mine to pee I'm not gonna if I go it's its exhibits joint the [ __ ] flavor is could be more flavor II like I've been smoking some SF cultivators wedding pie $61 out the door testing at 31% that [ __ ] is way better way better than this but I mean I don't know maybe maybe I maybe it's the concentrates too though I'm just doing a little bit of flavor yeah I mean honestly I'm gonna keep it really guys I feel like it's not hitting like a hundred percent it could be I think if you roll do be better but yeah you know I don't like the fact that it's running so bad I think that's like my main problem with it and yeah I feel like I'm wasting away I'm so high that I'm just like [ __ ] you know but it's like if I were to rolled it I'd be more pissed because it's like damn you exhibit homies these are hand rolled them I see them making them I'm pretty sure I have no idea what is each test bet just a big flex guys we're smoking a [ __ ] $184 joint what let me know if there's things that you guys feel like it's just for the foot I feel like designer is just for the Flex you know I know bass quality to this testing at 27 percent by the way pretty high 27 percent concentrate don't see any wax running or anything like that either so I'm not really sure where the concentrate is in the joint I mean it is like white ash though all the way yeah it definitely does the job oh yeah let's play baseball you know what I was thinking is that like it's a big guys joint you want it to last you how long Lee I don't know I didn't set a timer but it's feel like I'm going kind of fast yeah yeah you right sure it's eight I mean there's still no cuz it's hella fat but it's like you think you'll be just custom ah don't underestimate you guys and then I just want to remind you guys to go cup some lady where a wave emerged a very explosive second exclusive that we got the sweats on Ted I got them on today real one make sure you guys go cop it going real quick thank you guys for supporting us shout out the whole way and we appreciate you guys for getting us here we got bigger things coming you guys oh

it was not that smoky and now it's like the only thing I don't like okay so we're getting to the end what are you guys thinking is this what is $285 honestly it's not $1 i'ma tell you why you guys polite you could just get so much weed with that money you could just roll so many blunts that just getting so much higher I don't know that's my s what I so I think creating for me was worth it

before handling any material to avoid contamination place your vibration table stabilization mat on the surface you will be working off place the vibration table on the stabilization map plug the extension cord into the wall outlet plug the vibration table into the extension cord place the cone filling machine on top of the vibration table set the cone riser aside for now load your cone filling machine with empty cones [Music] grab the material that you will be filling your cones with today we are using menthol meadow an herbal smoking blend from herbal spirits use the switch on the extension cable to turn the vibration table on once your vibration table has turned on begin filling the machine with your material the vibration action of the machine will shake your material into the cones use the included cone packing tool to pack the cones while the vibration table is off continue filling the Machine and packing until the cones are full once the cones are full turn the vibration table off using the switch on the extension cord place the cone filling machine with the cone riser underneath it on a flat surface rotate the cone filling machines while lightly applying

only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or you have a medical marijuana card like I actually do myself I don't wanna show you my personal information hi yo what's up guys Ronnie really back at juice I would know this frame review for you guys in this video it's been a minute since I did a any strain review video or anything like this so um if you guys want to see more of these videos let me know down below in the comments and I'll definitely get him out because you know I like doing these videos but um I wasn't even planning on doing this review or then I was just thinking like I haven't done a review of eating I know why I said [ __ ] it why not these are pretty cool so let me do every one them so I got um two packs of these um dutchy pretty rolls but they actually called them um and it is cigarettes so um I don't know I just thought these are pretty cool because ever since I was like young and I first started smoking weed I always like at least for me was like always a dream like the day that I'd be able to like walk until I can Circle K or you know I don't know if you have support cases where you guys live a gas station you wanna me and I like buy a packet like cigarettes but like weed cigarettes and then I mean so we finally got some cannabis cigarettes so that's pretty lit in my opinion um but yeah I got this mo dispensary go ahead and get them from a [ __ ] gas station or nothin but still [ __ ] lit what hopefully one day they'll be gas stations but this video will be reviewing the Northern Lights one if you guys want to see a review on the purplish green let me know down below in the comments and I'll get back to ya and that's my stupid fire concentrate it's right now so if you guys want to see a wax review let me know down below in the comments and I'll get that out too but yeah let's just hop into this so duchies Northern Lights cannabis cigarettes basically just pre-rolls but they're [ __ ] on fire but yeah let's go over the pathogen real quick so this is the front of it pretty basic pretty simple but it's [ __ ] I don't know it gets the point across and it's the open enemy and so it says duchies right there Northern Lights obviously it's the indica made with 100% but source from premium genetics and then it comes with six potent 0.5 mm cannabis cigarettes and Isis keep it keep out of reach of children yeah 6.5 pre-rolls in the back of it just says Northern Lights as a pure indica and is arguably the most famous strain in the world yeah that's definitely one of the most famous strains so that's the back of it pretty plain and simple and in the side of the box has had the Arizona Department of California this side just has some other warning on it nothing else crazy yeah these road forty-four dollars plus tax but they actually that's a little bit expensive in my opinion for like six point five three rolls that's like three grams three grams for 45 bucks that's a little bit expense that's not expensive but on the pricey side you know what I mean um I've got these when everybody won't get one free so I paid 45 bucks for two of them I'm still like $22 each so can't complain I paid about 20 bucks for this I don't know if I would pay that full price 45 bucks for them that's a little bit pricey maybe if I needed something convene I was going on with the trip was something I'm one of them maybe I would but like just done like the everyday occasion I don't think I really see myself kicking these up too often but they are really sick so I already smoked five of these they only have one left for you guys so you open it up it comes in these little bags or this little bag and it's to keep it fresh I'm pretty sure oh I didn't notice that this is just now but I guess it comes with a sticker I don't know how I missed that but yeah that's pretty cool I'm so a little sticker mm-hmm yes that's kind of cool so you can like kinda it says Northern Lights all the time in because you can like try out all the flavors and like make a little collection wall I don't know do something cool don't mean that I mean but they normally it comes in a purple bag I'm assuming for this indica I guess it's the tables would probably come in like a yellow bag or something I don't know the only meaning so we got one to one and they're normally they'll be like if you if it's a fresh pack so I haven't opened this one yet so I'm gonna open this in the next review so you see what it's like when I open a fresh new sealed box you see I'm saying completely schools so there'll be 6/6 ones in that one but this one only has one left let's multiply already but you take it out a little small but it's hey let's [ __ ] pack completely tight in there so my first time taking these out I was like kind of thinking like them like these are kind of small you and I mean I don't know if they're gonna be like they're gonna do me like that they're gonna really give me the lid off for just like one y'all know saying but they not they actually do you just this oh oh yeah they probably like one of the most potent pre-rolls i've ever had they're also um really packed like they packed perfect when you select even though this is only make point 5 and it's like pretty small it's gonna burn for about oh it's gonna burn for about 10 minutes or so so it's [ __ ] fire yeah so this is the pre-roll give you guys one more look at it and then the crutch even has their little logo in it so that's kind of cool yeah that's the joint nothing else really to it um I forget all the top of my head what this was tested at but I want to say it was about 24% 25% but I lost the sticker sorry yeah let's just get into smoking this now if you guys are smoking along I forgot a lighter I think I got one so yeah a soft bunch of this now though hope you guys are smoking long hope you guys are smoking something dank and if you guys are cheers let's get it so dogs in the background I don't know if you hear that let's get it shoes all right so yeah this is [ __ ] fire you can see already and just burn them pretty perfect not running nothing at all so the taste on this is like so far you can tell us that you can definitely tell us made from straight yo my buds they're not using the trim and no [ __ ] like a lot of pre-roll is doing on I mean definitely some fire and this a pre-roll that thing has a pungent like Northern Light stage like um definitely like that classic indica pungent like skunky taste um definitely fire now like and like I said before like these things like these joints even though they're so small they burn for a minute and they burn perfect like you see that [ __ ] like it's I never really look at the ash till just now the ash is not the best color you want to see one smoking a joint but I have seen a lot worse so that's not I don't know let me know what you guys think about ash down below in the comments but you can see how it's smoking it's not running at all smoking pretty much perfect you know I mean like perfect the taste them like it just has like a pungent funky taste like nothing like too crazy like the taste isn't like too good I mean it tastes fire it tastes like some fire bud like that I thought if I roll up a joint myself it would taste better than this but I don't know if it really all depends I don't know it's just personal preference and it all depends I don't know I haven't really smoked flour too much I smoked many concentrates no but he's good but not like what I remember you know I mean but it's definitely definitely has that classic identity that Classica indica like you mean like you see me stuttering over my words a little bit definitely getting kind of tired relaxing yeah just classic indicate indica high so let me go over the raisins but I'll read this real quick usually in these reviews I do like five riddance log over the package in that age the smoke the high the price point not like give like an overall review so um the packaging I thought this packaging was pretty cool it's just I got a little like a cigarette box but like a [ __ ] for a week I mean so it's pretty [ __ ] dope I thought it was lit I like the concept but like I like the idea behind it so um I give it a four point five out of five I just feel like they could have added like a little bit more information about the strange like that on the box because it doesn't really say too much about the strain or any information at all you know - but it says Northern Lights and that's it but besides for that I thought the pack pretty dope so let me know what you guys thought of it down below in the comments and if you disagree with me or you're with me on any of these just let me know down below in the comments but the taste on this um they gave like a four out of five I think that's pretty accurate because like I said it's not the for a pre-roll it's [ __ ] fire a secret age for super tasty um like on for a pre-roll it's like top notch but I feel like if I just bought some top-notch flower like a Potter 8th for 45 and rolled my own joint it probably tastes better than this and if you're fatter than this you know what I mean but it's fire for sure the smoke they looked the way it smokes you guys seen like this thing rips like you know some of those pre-rolls dispensaries are giving you they don't even brown right don't hit right yeah but this burns like perfect all the way down to the grudge this smokes like it his [ __ ] yeah you guys been seeing so this the way it smokes I give it a 5 out of 5 because it's like it's ripping you out I mean you should smack him the high the high is up there but I got kind of stuck between a four and a 4.5 out of 5 so I gave it like a four point two out of five because it's [ __ ] fired but like I said I definitely had some more to fire like for 45 bucks I feel like I could get like a way far like a way better eighth the only mean I roll my own [ __ ] so I feel like they're paying more for like the package and just like that the looks initiated this static of it you know I mean but it's definitely fired the next thing was um yes I'll give it like a four point two out of five for the high the price point I gave like a four out of five it's a little bit pricey for something like I hit like three grams applied for 45 bucks it's a little bit pricey but like if you're going off like if you need something convenient like it going on a trip or something like that that's [ __ ] a good option for you because I mean they're [ __ ] they're really good they they're coat when they burn [ __ ] perfect this you guys see I mean everything about them is good but they're just a little bit pricey so come if you don't mind paying a little bit sure I guess I go for it but me I couldn't see myself on them unless I was like going on a trip and I or I needed something convenient everybody sneaky use some [ __ ] I mean because I feel like I think I got that I already said I can definitely get away far for $45 and roll my own [ __ ] but if you don't know how to roll I guess over these or something but the price point I need like a four out of five so that makes the overall rating about like a four out of five but um these are definitely fired so if you ever see them in your area duchies that she's pretty rose that can we pick him up and try them out um if they're having the buy one get one free deal definitely pick him up and try him out place uh 20 bucks for three grams can't go wrong as fired like this video and want to see more reviews I'm gonna down below in the comments and if you want to see a review on these on [ __ ] dream big rolls there's something I'm going to comments to I'll get that out and add some like fireworks I could do every review on so let me know down below in the comments if you like doing some more review videos again but so much for that thumbs up comment like subscribe do all that good [ __ ] you're gonna count with you Mitch Enron you're a so", "9PZxkPIstXU": "all right so let's talk about these little smokes so these low smoke CBDs are around $35 it comes with seven pre-rolls so that's around $5 per pre-roll I've been using them for a couple months now these are all the old containers I have what I like about these CD joints is a you had to keep that body hive that you get from smoking THC products but you also keep a mental clarity so you can really think and you're not as foggy I guess is the best way I could put it my favorite thing about this product is the packaging the packaging is just so premium it can be reusable that's why I kept all my cases because you can fit your pre rolls or joints in there that you made yourself and just use s container it has a magnetic flap so it won't open random little matchbox addition to it is a very handy just in case you forget a lighter but overall other than the price it's a very good product and I would definitely recommend anyone that would like to try any CBD drones and also get a cool package", "XbUr98Z7MII": "[ __ ] video on hello rso sosa and today i've made it up the granddaddy dances and i've done a [ __ ] video i've

review on this CBD pre-roll joint vegan on my name's Robin change get you changed big buddy range no we're not the same I found my local smoke shop so some people ask me can I get it CBD without ordering it online like how can I just go pick it up smoke it today you know spark in them you can pretty much pick and pick it up anywhere I've seen it at gas stations I've seen I've seen it at smoke shops like dispensaries you name it CBD is pretty much everywhere they even have CBD stores in different places when I first seen it I thought it was just one pre-roll like I couldn't see what it says but guess what it is - because secret nature is what the packaging looks like I think it is so freakin cute it's called frosted cush and it is to see your city rose to free Rose that our CBD and it says in the comment you suck you how they think how they say later on there and at the bottom it says organic cannabis flower so we got to see what secret nature's all about I've never tried them before or anything they actually are from Rogue Valley Oregon hmm so if I ever go to Oregon if I like I might have to go and check this out but this is what it looks like and then it just has a little tube this is so cute like you can keep your ashes in here if you want you can keep your yeah joints whatever you smoke but it is to pre-rolls in I swear this stuff smells so freakin good this is what they look like what the tips look like I know you guys did it I hope you guys can see I'm glad you like the beauty gurus but yeah this is what the tips look like you can see like get some cbdu at the tip I don't see any like sticks or anything actually there is a little stick right here it may not be a stick but yeah they're rolling pretty tight and roll pretty good but I know you guys are waiting like I'm out to spark one up I think this little tube is so cute like it keeps it so it fresh that's another thing that's a big plus okay [Music] and I've seen this packaging widget I'm not gonna I ordered some sheet but from other companies I haven't water from this company because I want to try it out first but is she good does she hate like I love Jon Odie's like I like instantly star like slow no I didn't smoke weed earlier but almost all over though like I should be more up a little look like a little glass who does she hate rude [Music] okay secret nature path look sweetie would eat this is a 80 milligrams this is 80 milligrams y'all can see there but it says hopefully hopefully y'all can see that but it says pesticide and something else like Andy to see but everything they passed off on us good remember I said make sure it is lab tested and there's its lattice be laughed at it even got the test ID I got it done and Bill Costa labs I don't know what the where that is but they basically tested it and they even have a test ID on the bottom of the package so this is how you know you can some legit smoke okay y'all don't want to be smoking their trash yes you can get trash as cb2 flouring the way this whole he it's so hard I taste I can't really get a good taste off of it and that could be because I burned my [ __ ] taste but it's off this morning when I was drinking coffee so hope they can be proud [Music] enhancing burning over there I'm really going in sales but I decided to burn alone today but I was so anxious or yeah like my shirt I've got this shirt for like $1.99 yah and I was like [ __ ] I'm getting this you pay a shirt a video shirt I need a shirt and it's not like a little crop top and a guy like a little permanent blue not in the front I was going out but the way I'm set up right now like awful Aang get up you know at this point I'm gonna have to take them out and see thing our incident because I did do a video but if I find it you guys already know it will be in the description box below but yeah folks we did so I'm gonna have to check him out though for real because my my small shop they were like 17 dollars I noticed it's the one that I go to you I don't know baby taxes on time so I got a I'll be finding all the deals on the actual websites so yeah but I was just trying to look for different things that I could help other people with that don't trust virus [ __ ] on my or just don't want to wait because I thought when I first arrived CBD I didn't know want to wait for some [ __ ] to be shipped to me I wanted to find the pre room and I went looking everywhere I'll just type in CBD near me and then everything just popped up that's really high that's really how you got to do it anyway like in order to find what you really want and check out new people in trying to shake you just gotta try shape but make sure it is the lab tested okay even if there's not and you just want to try it give it a try because I still do the [ __ ] but I try to make sure that I do see lab tested somewhere on their website just because you just don't want to be smoking trying it's like who's what want to be smoking my catnip or some [ __ ] potpourri so Scooby [ __ ] but it was a book you don't know what the [ __ ] people be putting in pre-rolls a shade so just always make sure you know what the [ __ ] you get I don't care if they [ __ ] cheap [ __ ] that [Music] and to get research but this good though like this it's kind of instantly calling just kind of instantly telling me because I was like a little anxious before I started this video but like now I'm cool how are you guys liking these smokin easy guys like these or what because I do I like familymoon I like filming them yeah yeah so someone had basically asked me like what my race is and to be honest I've been told so much [ __ ] that I really don't know so I decided I'm going to purchase a kit and that'll be I'm gonna do a video I might do I don't really know but if you guys are interested in you guys would like to see that let me know good and you know we gonna be smoking so talk about Dorne because I've seen some other people do it but I was told that I'm all like I was told that I'm mainly black and I have like 10% Hispanic in me which is weird because my mom is dark-skinned and as you can see I'm not dark-skinned I [Music] don't matter please [Music] when you find look at the box leg I think it is this CPP or THC but it says CBD everywhere on the box a handmade oh let me read this yup it says our joints are made with premium hand trimmed buds ok beat we never use shape trim or anything that is not top shelf material 100% flour with no artificial beads no artificial ingredients or additives this is Road in organic hemp papers yep got a smoke clean this brings the highest flavor and terpenes and turbine and allows for a smooth experience ok Rogue Valley organ I see you [Music] this product when I gave you her for adults 80 and over smoking candy hot legal hip product oh [Music] it does have a little bit of THC it has a 0.3 I'm sure I got at the bottom say I don't think I'm lying see it's a very viable 0.3 first thing that the THC at the very bottom and then this is exactly what I just read to you guys let's get it under I feel good I know I anyway so I like how he hits me hard real hard actually I don't really like their tips I will be honest above it I thought I did but they're not really it's like a lot of I can't really show it I don't know there it is so as you can see like it's really wide and open and there's I see me becoming through a little bit I already spring my job you know this point I can take alright guys so if you guys like this video and you want to see more videos like this when we do a CVD related reviews or any type of review really let me know and I will be sure to do it for you and yeah and if you just like the video overall you like the smoke with me make sure you give the video

I'll see you guys in my next video latest car demand [ __ ] she led me here", "D_HMBMYYCo8": "okay cool so today we've got some Topanga Canyon from the jungle boys I was down there LA farmers at the beginning of the month I spotted that they had this on their low shelf and lots of people say that Topanga Canyon is awesome so I figured with all of that going on I didn't have a choice but to grab this Topanga Canyon so here it is it does look like that was cultivated at the beginning of August and we're just coming up to the end of February now so it is kind of old kind of older but not super old not the oldest weed I've ever smoked that's for dang sure and not even the oldest weed that I've smoked in the last couple months but yeah let's go ahead and see if it's any worse for wear other than the date here let's check out that information looks like it tested out to twenty five point three three percent total THC or well total yeah th see the total cannabinoids coming up to twenty nine point nine six percent so almost thirty percent total cannabinoids there it is to the little window there's the can verify sticker and the little holographic thing letting me know that it's real but since I bought it from LA farmers I know it's real but yeah let's go ahead and pop this August weed open and let's take a look have a little flap on it I'm not used to little bags without that flap but I'm just gonna wrestle this open alright there we go smelling it already there it is in the bag let's go ahead and get you guys a view in there a little preview and then I'll go ahead and dump a couple out see if there's a champion ugh they look to all be about this size or so so there's a handful for you guys to check out go ahead and get a zoom in there perfect alright so looking pretty good I like it you know not looking like anything to write home about necessarily but it's got a great smell to it actually definitely has a sweet almost like mac-like scent not really getting a lot of OG it's more of a sweeter OG I guess if anything a little bit of citrus little like sugar sweetness and maybe just a bit of fuel in the background but that's predominantly what I'm getting is like a sweetness off of this yeah it's almost like sugar candy this yeah very interesting does smell great so that's awesome so let's go ahead and zoom in just a little bit more you guys can get a look at these nugs cuz yeah they're all about this size nothing sticking out at me as a champion ugh in there so okay cool so that's basically my first impression of the herb now what I did was I checked this out on can verify and it didn't work so this is gonna be my first impressions of this can verify system I scan this little code with my phone and it took me to the cam verify website but it said it was invalid so what I'm gonna do now is I'll show you guys what happens oh yeah this is my receipt to just to prove diali up there I was beginning of February bought it for 25 bucks cuz it's on the low shelf so let's go ahead and check out cam verify here and let's see what happens when I put this info in so the serial number so I scratched off the bottom part let me get a little focus here sorry I'm shaky I'll put this down there so I scratched off the bottom part thinking maybe that was the serial number that's why I didn't scan out but I believe it's just the part below the code so let's go ahead and put that in together here and so I'm trying to film this as I do it one two two three four four six oh it's not even taken Wow alright well that was captured live my idiocy not checking to see if my cursor was in the proper field but alright this is real this is me being a person over here at 6 now see this is another part that's confusing the end it could be an eye it could be a lowercase L I'm gonna guess it's an eye and then it's an X and I'm gonna go ahead and hit verify and it can't says it's an invalid serial so I'm thinking all right maybe I messed up let me go ahead and just copy it off the top here maybe I messed up maybe even though I scanned this with my phone maybe I'm doing something wrong let me go ahead and I'll just change that let's paste it back in there instead of it being an eye I'll try it a lowercase L I don't know I mean as you guys can see if you can let me zoom back in just you can see it in the light here that's the code alright that's the serial number supposedly so it looks like IX L X all right so I've tried IX this is LX now I'm gonna go ahead and hit verify and it doesn't work it just says invalid serial number so then I figured okay maybe looking at this thing again maybe it's 2 9 7 B I don't know I mean maybe that's why I had to scratch it off so I tried to 9 7 D and this time I'm gonna put my cursor in there 2 9 7 B hopefully nope an invalid serial number so I don't know I know it's real because I bought it from Los Angeles farmer's there's my receipt I know it there it is 2 pagan Canyon but it's a little disappointed to try to verify it through a system that's supposedly you know the top notch whatever vulva blah you know the best verification system I guess that's available right now and it just doesn't work so I don't know where the mess-up is I don't know if somebody didn't put something in the computer that they should have or what happened but yeah I don't know if this doesn't work so the flower itself awesome-looking the verification system not so much I don't know what to say about that but uh maybe you can't verify jungle boys chime in on this one I don't know why it didn't work tell me what I'm doing wrong if you guys know let me know but I mean as far as I can tell I put that exact number in there I scan it from my phone no results everything just keeps popping this up invalid serial so that is what it is first impressions", "hh7DaaJmarg": "countdown three we have the rocket pre-roll infused with shattered and Keith this is for everybody who wanted to see a pre-roll review so open it up here never bought it before I rarely buy approvals I bought for my life if that one and a half grams here infused with shatter and Keef like I said smell good I'm just kidding we're gonna cut it open come on I'm gonna bring the camera closer let's see what's really in here and that top-shelf pre-roll let's slice it open here see what we got inside looking like a nice light green color like some good-looking bud so so far so good so the sight test it's looking decent smell test I'm not smelling a whole lot right now a little bit here so sites looking pretty good smell let's double check that decent I mean it might be sitting for a while let me see if I can change the angle here actually giving you a little something better to look at this might not be the best angle so I'm gonna get my phone here and see if we can make it look a little better cell phone looking a lot better we can see that nice green color and see some of that shatter and there little dots I wonder how much exactly was in there looks good smells decent so past those two tests now let's do the most important the taste test tastes pretty good it doesn't taste some of the best flour I've had like that fresh flavor this might have been sitting for a little while doesn't taste that amazing I figured with the infusion it would taste a little better so the taste let me down a little bit

"hey kids we're back again today we're gonna be taking a look at some pre-rolled joints from Chung's choice many of you probably know Tommy child from his movies like up and smoke but what you probably don't know is that Tommy Chong was a cancer survivor so the flour I'm told is provided by Huntington Farms Humboldt County's first conditional use permit cannabis farm 25 years of cultivation experience they do sustainable organic growing so you know all of their cloud is top-notch I have two types of joints from challenge choice here first one is a hybrid it's a flower to eat combination it comes in this beautiful glass tooth and the childproof cap on it you can see here this one comes in at 14 percent THC very nice the second one I have is a sativa it's a flower keep combination 1.25 grams this one comes in at seventeen point six percent THC exciting is crack one of these things open see what it smells like to try to - remember this is a childproof cap so you have to push down on the cap and twist and for a little bit let's take a closer look at this wow you can really see the ketha flower in this joint this wood smells like oh yeah well you know what I'm gonna do next guys you remember kids if you'd like to get Chung's choice or other fine legal cannabis products you can get it through rehab delivery rehab delivery has been providing medical cannabis patients in California for over 10 years now sourcing the finest tested products throughout the entire state [Music]", "IX5dj0SfQDQ": "well it's time to do another video here and um unfortunately the mailman hasn't arrived yet it's with my stuff so um wait a minute what the hell is that it's the plate of pot and it's got eight items on here and it looks like one two three four pre-rolls and four three point fives um well let's go through them i guess we've got edison ice cream cake we've got weed me mandarin cookies uh ignite crescendo that's a pre-roll no idea what that is scotia lemon dory then we've got canna farms super critical uh silver haze or something like that then we've got captain's choice it's some sort of mysterious sativa blend of pre-roll then we've got another new lp here dixtra green houses i think that's what they call it dixtra something like that um lemon pepper spice and finally we've got ignite gg number four pre-roll oh my goodness this is very exciting eight new items on this plate of pot right in time when i ran out just giving a shuffle here so it's all nice and random super random and here we go i'll take anything except a pre-roll please no no it's the captain's choice oh maybe these will be good i don't know we'll see it's the captain's choice here it is it's the captain's choice sativa blend uh 19 or 195.5 milligrams per gram uh and this is two pre-rolls in here for a total of one g and let's see here united greenery so that's who makes this that's who the captain works for and we've got the date is november the 3rd of 2020 so not too bad not too bad so if you're wondering why i got these four pre-rolls on this plate of pot here um when i made my last order i had like 20 bucks left over so i thought you know what i'm going to get a couple 1g things but there's not many of those around anymore so i thought i'll just get 20 worth of pre-rolls and i tried to get stuff that uh we don't normally see as flower right so this one here right you don't even have the lp doesn't have anything so i mean or the brand that's why i thought it'd be cool this one here for two dubs that are each supposed to be half a gram this went for four dollars and 38 cents which is not bad um for two half grams supposedly half ram joints we'll find out soon first we're going to check out the scale here because uh that's what we're gonna do so like on my last video we're gonna do it a little differently here we're gonna put this on zero it out because somebody suggested this and you know in my mind this would be technically slightly slightly even more uh accurate so here we put that on 50.00 perfect perfect see look at that [Laughter] i guess that's cool anyways let's open this up and see what these things look like and way holy shit oh my god that's not even a i thought that was a flip top i've been trying to flip it like this that would pop open but nope that's the hinge they hid the opening over here somewhere oh boy that is a little bit difficult to open but there we go we got it and hey you know what these are actually out of all the pre-rolls i've seen these are some of the nicest looking the filter isn't insanely huge it's big i would go half that size but that's it's not half the size of the joint like those quest ones let's see what they each weigh with filter because normally we don't check it with the filter oh my god 0.8 that's good what about this one 0.8 also wow that means that these might weigh the proper amount let's find out let's empty these in here and see if it makes uh oh and look at that nice little spiral we'll see if it makes it a gram look at that i just pulled the filter out all nice oh very nice and now i should be able to just just sort of go like this and empty it all here look at that 0.49 i did get a couple tiny little bits out so you know that's that's fucking close oh my god i've never seen one that was so accurate i'm impressed i'm impressed let's try this one i have no idea what strain is in here though that's a mystery [Music] there's a little bit in the tip come on get out of there come on get all of you come on oh my god look at this they actually did it the captain did it all right so i went and got this nice box and i'm gonna check out the uh we'll check out this stuff here with the microscope and see what kind of stuff they're putting inside here see a little stem right there hopefully that's the only one right well let's take a look at it we got this nice box it's black so we won't get a lot of reflection should be all right so one thing i didn't think of when i was getting this box was how tall the box was it's pretty tall i can barely actually know what i'm going to turn the box around and i'm gonna put this thing up on here and check there we go i figured they were so here we are looking at the captain's choice this is what the captain smokes when the captain's looking for a sativa apparently um so you can see some chunky trichomes in there you can see it it does look a little bit like uh it reminds me somewhat not as nicely of but somewhat like shred i i don't know if uh can see some bits of stem here and there you can see some trichomes they're kind of cloudy and chunky looking let's see if we can zoom in closer that's about as close as i can get without it getting all horribly blurry oh there we go a little bit nicer there yeah so that's kind of what it looks like there and you know i don't see a ton of stems i see some little bits of of stem and leaf like you can see right there the big reflection you see all the reflections shining so much off that pretty sure that's a leaf right there and so it looks okay it doesn't look as bad as that one time i got the pedros from color that pretty ready to roll garbage that stuff was horrible but this looks okay it doesn't look as good as shred but it looks okay so hopefully it is okay and i'm gonna go try it and then i'll be right back so i just got in from trying the captain's choice sativa blend oh sativa blend i didn't notice that before interesting at 19 so i first out there when i was trying i thought it was kind of weak but um after a while uh it's sort of sort of a creeper on there and it sort of kicks up to like maybe just below a medium for the high so the high on here is uh it's all right but at first it kind of was like it felt weak but there's a bit of a creeper there and it sort of creeps up to maybe a medium maybe just somewhere around a medium maybe just below a medium to a medium that's kind of nice and it's kind of like uh it's got like a i guess it makes it kind of alert sort of um sort of really awake it's kind of woke me up this thing it made me really um make me feel really awake and stuff i don't feel like energetic or anything but i feel really kind of like i could go and do some sort of physical activities or some shit um yeah so that's kind of all right i guess not that i want to go do anything like that but you know i guess it's okay it's okay it's a nice it's like kind of like um like a clear-headed kind of a buzz maybe not clear-headed but it's kind of it's not a couch lock at all we'll say that and yeah but this stuff is quite dry so i don't know if how it would burn in a joint or whatever there was absolutely no flavor no flavor at all and there was no smell too so that you know that sucks for both of those things unless i guess some people they they like it so it doesn't smell so i guess for you that will be okay but the high on here is okay um the weight i'm surprised actually had the proper weight on here for um pretty much for both of them they came up to well combined it came up to one and uh yeah and it was actually packed really nicely in here it's a probably one of the nicest pre-rolls i've seen so far it was a little bit large filter but it wasn't insane like some of them and as it came out it was all nicely packed it had it felt like there was no hard spots or anything like maybe there would be really good air flow through there there was no no hard spots or anything that was all sort of nicely nicely packed so yeah you know for five bucks and it's okay there's better for five bucks but you know whatever it's uh it's the captain's choice so [Laughter] if you like captains and maybe i don't know who knows i wouldn't i don't think i would ever buy it again but you know i had five bucks to spend and i spent it on this and i don't regret it because there was nothing else available so i would have had to have spent well i would have had to have less stuff so i don't regret it because it just gave me more stuff to try there how old was that i wouldn't buy it again though anyways though that's the captain's choice um this uh seven more things on the um what is that called there so we got seven more things on the plate of pot uh come check it out hit the subscribe button uh in the notification bell it'll tell you when the next um one of those videos goes up and that yeah that's uh that's all there is for this well we'll see you later have a good one i just remembered something that i wanted to add in here real quick because i just remembered it i was just stopped recording but anyways when i was saying there was no flavor in this there was no flavor but there's a little bit of an aftertaste which is not the best aftertaste and it's a taste i know very well and you guys probably know very well it's the taste of when there's a seed in your joint you're smoking it there's a seed in there and it burns that taste it's very unique taste that was the there was a slight aftertaste of that so i don't know if maybe a seed or two got ground up in this also maybe who knows but i did have slight aftertaste of of a seed you know that's unmistakable aftertaste it took me a few minutes to figure out what it was and then when i realized that i was like oh yeah that's that yeah anyways just thought i'd mention that because uh yeah anyways see you later have a good one", "4d9TgN341Gw": "hey guys it's Florida MJ 4:20 here and today I'm going to show you how to roll your own cone joints at home so what you will need is some paper pair of scissors some cardboard tip material 1.25 papers you could use other size papers I guess but I use 1.25 s you need a pen and some masking tape so the first thing you're gonna need to do is make the mold for the that you're gonna need to make your cones so take the tip of the pen and get this so that it starts curling like that and then take your finger and roll it this part can be kind of difficult to get going stick with it so what you want to do is keep this end right here small and keep the whole thing in general not getting too fat unless you want really really fat cones of course you know however whatever shape this is in at the end is how your cone is gonna be shaped so really I guess you could make it all kinds of shapes if you want to that would be kind of cool to make a really big fat cone huh so and I'm sure everybody's done this in kindergarten rolling up some paper like this and I probably should have done this beforehand but you take your masking tape a little piece off yay I can do this all righty that's pretty cool now if I can find the end of this thing there it is right there just tape this right here and there you have the mold for your cone joints pretty cool huh all right imagine if we had paper is that big huh now we can set the tape aside and for the next part you got to get out your paper this part is pretty darn simple just kind of want to line this up at the bottom here so it lines up at the bottom of this form and just roll that sucker up and make sure you wet it before you let go so you get the paper to stick there you have the paper part of your cone take off one of your little deals here and get the pen part out of the middle right the ink part and you take this you can use other stuff too like a small screwdriver you just want to get this part started so it doesn't crease you know if you use the cardboard out of these they're a lot more likely to crease so using a tool like this really helps get this whole thing bent like that and now you want to take a look at your paper it's only about that big so you're not gonna need the whole thing down there what is it we all right now you take the filter cardboard and notice how this isn't even that's good that's okay because this isn't even either this is on a perfect cylinder you slide that down there stuff it down with the pin and you're almost good to go now this part this part right here there's a little bit easier if you have something like that has a screwdriver like and so you basically you just want to tighten that up down there and all you have to do is stick this down there and turn it like a screwdriver against the edges and it's this one's actually counterclockwise but you'll get the point so and you just want to turn it sideways like a screw until it's tight up against the edges so now we have our cone paper voila very cool huh and so you can change the size of your cone by where you roll it on here too you don't have to roll a completely different sized one but you can you can roll them fatter than this you know your form you can roll them skinnier you know however you want to really let's get some wheat ground up since I'm not really reviewing a strain today I'll just use my grinder get out some of the 27.4 7% evany and ivory I got in $125 an ounce sale stuff is pretty good it's got a little seeds on it but what are you gonna do right it's a good deal get this all ground up all right you might have gotten enough in there might need a little bit more and I forgot one thing that'll make it easier so I'll be right back all right now I'm back I think we will need more than this for a little bit more in the grinder oh it's all gunked up in there dang it is a sticky string got lots of trichomes on it those have a lot of seeds though a medical this is just powdered now all right I'll show you the seeds I got so here's I'm not done with those ounces yet but these are probably about three-quarters of the seeds I've gotten a lot of them were chopped up while I was cutting up the weed another thing you can use is a funnel you can stick it in the end of the cone paper and it'll make it packing a little easier I usually don't use it but you know there's the option if you want it so they'll get this thing packed up you just want to make sure that when you're packing the cone joint that you pack it as you go don't pack a whole bunch in there and then pack it down that is gonna cause your joint to run like crazy believe me or another thing that that causes is for your joint just to completely go out get that thing fully packed keep tamping it down as you go and actually one thing I'll show you the best way to do this it's a little bit more difficult is to actually put the paper on backwards I'll show you about that well yeah so that's a nice little personal conjoint here not a big ol fatty but if you want to you just roll your paper higher up on here and it's a fatter cone automatically I'll demonstrate it for you after I get this one packed this is going to be a nice postpone for me 27.4 7% and it shows to lots of trichomes covering this bad boy let's see when you get to the end just kind of cup your fingers around it like this and then you can just punch down on it real easy nothing difficult here that's for sure hands are just covered in this stuff all right so here we have it conjoint not sure how much this weighs that is about point nine grams so let's assume that the paper and the cardboard weigh about what point two or something because I only used a very little bit of it so it's like a point seven gram Joey that's pretty good it's packed in there nice and tight draws really well I can feel that now let me just demonstrate for you real quick before I get this choked up let me demonstrate how if you you lit up higher you get a bigger cone out of it so before I match the bottom here this time I'm not gonna do that I'm gonna roll it further up here you just lick it again same as before here we got the cone and you see how much fatter this one is so there you go if you roll it up even higher you're gonna get an even fatter one and I think it would be funny to make a really fat mold where it's just like boom you can pack yourself some really crazy ones and on these if you just if it has a bigger tip right here you'll just cut off a little bit more of one of these filter papers there we go pretty cool way to save yourself some money this will work well if there's any of those shake deals out there in your area or whatever there you go alright now before I light that join up let me show you how to back roll back roll look hold let me show you how to back roll a cone joint so you take the paper and you see oh here's the sticky side you put it on backwards so we're gonna be doing the sticky side is gonna be outwards so you see this I don't know if you can see that here's the sticky side okay so you take it and roll it like normal except that you get it into place like this and then you moisten it before you roll it up and now you just roll it and continue to moisten it as you go okay and so you're rolling rolling rolling rolling now it's rolled on there and it's stuck together right and you have all this extra paper hanging off what do you do what do you do indeed you find my lighter and I'll show you what to do you take it and you light it I went ahead and looked it one more time just to make sure that it's sealed before I do this let's say you take the lighter you just catch it on fire and let it burn hold it up so it doesn't really burn there you go and now you have a back rolled cone here right now what is the advantage of this well it's not a well okay first of all there's a lot less paper on this on a back roll but the other advantage is specifically for cone joints if you look in here you see how there's that paper right here this is a pain in the butt if you're packing a cone joint if you look in the middle sorry these are really delicate until you get that cardboard in and if you look down the middle of these they don't have anything in the middle so they're really easy to pack so that's why you would do a back roll cone joint very cool huh they're a little bit more delicate they're gonna have a way better flavor though because you're just cutting out that much more paper so well I'm about way better but you know they're gonna have a better flavor alright so let's get this lit and toked up no I'm definitely ready for it it's raining cats and dogs out there right now I'm pretty gloomy Saturday so no I could use the medication that's for sure so this is how you light the cone joint I guess I should have said that you just want to roll it around the end until the whole thing is lit you don't want to inhale the cone joint while the flame is on it because it will make it run like crazy this won't prevent it from running but it discourages running by lighting it even leaf alright there we have a nice DIY cone joy at home see if we can toke it without it running all over the place get all this jakey stuff out of the way those always come in handy huh sure plenty of people have used those at a pinch or two yes that ashtray is not all that interesting really it's burning pretty nicely um flavors pretty darn good as far as today this morning I probably had the most flavorful joint I've ever had it was of citrus farmer and that grapefruit flavor just came right through I mean I got all excited because key relief is I'm gonna sail and then I saw that all their flowers in store only that was a bummer vitae kids have it a sale it doesn't include flower hey these guys need to get with the times there's like half of the patients went straight to flower smokeable flower as soon as it was available I should tell you something so you know we're gonna bind and you don't have that's what I normally use like packs of these papers or I'll show you these cones pre-rolled cones like this it's just convenient but you know if you need to you can make them yourself at home save you a little money or if you're just did a pitcher you go have around party bays there you go never be without your cones woods you also roll my hand I'll have to show you a hand roll come join those aren't as good at least mine are a lot better with that mold there before my guess I don't know what you call it coffee stuff all over the place really feeling the effects of this ebony and ivory Sookie fee you can really tell it's a 20/20 7.47 presented man so uh anybody else out there roll your own cone joints been doing it for a while I actually started out not with doing cones but just for the longest time I would just put filters on my joints man that would be interesting actually if I did an evolution video of my evolution of joint rolling because I have a very distinct evolution of what I've been through you know really crappy crappy hand roll joints you know with no filter anything you could barely talk out of that clog up on end to I would put for a long time I put really small filter tips in for a long time after that I would put in bigger filter tips that I started trying to do cones never really did get big in two blunts but there have been times when I did you know rolling once man oh man as you can see is burning really nicely that's another thing you can make sure that you know there's a lot of complaints of pre-roll of cones running really badly we'll get good and then you don't have to have them roll all right I'll be running good you get good they won't run a lot of it also has to do with the grinder you want a nice even grind people say that it's bad to have a fine grind but it's really not is that bad nope you just gotta pack it correctly I like this a lot this is just a metal dab tool you can probably get it for five or ten bucks at any head shop all right but let me tell you what makes a good packing tool for these things so what makes a good packing tool is it for it to have some diameter to it like this you know it'd be a little bit heavy so that you can let the weight of it do the work so when I'm packing I'm not really pushing too much as much as letting it drop maybe having a little bit of pressure add to it with the fact that this is heavy and metal really helps that the other thing I like is for there to be a smaller tip I'm still a flat end you know I want it to be flat on the end still but a little bit smaller on the tip than it is in the main part because this helps it this packs it down and then if there's gaps in the edges you could turn it around the edges like this and it'll pack around the edges you could also just make another one of these if you're out of everything but paper just make another one of this but roll it so tight that there's not really a hole in the end you can just pinch the end I guess and use that to pack it I think I'm gonna make a video next couple days where I show all the different ways I can roll a joint gonna be cool and there's a lot of people out there just come in to cannabis now that it's legal I think that's really cool I think it's an awesome thing you know there's so many people have been missing out for years and welcome right so I think it's really cool who would people discover something like cannabis it really helps improve their life and can really you know help with problems that otherwise might require harsh drugs or you know have really bad side effects from those drugs and that kind of thing as cannabis you know we've been using that for longest time as a medicine we know pretty much the side effects and stuff nothing too crazy with it I know that cannabis has helped me with my PTSD so much and I only wish that it had been legal earlier because that stigma really really hurt for years I mean if you already have PTSD and you wake up with nightmares and many a paranoia it's just made so much worse when you think that your medicine is gonna make you go to prison you know I mean man I did the mixed messages you know it works you don't makes you feel so much better but everyone in the society tells you how evil it is and you're breaking the law and man that's why I'm just so glad that we have a medical system here in Florida no don't have to feel like a criminal for doing something that's totally fine it's solely wholesome there's nothing wrong with cannabis you know it's like saying there's you know milk is terrible no looks not terrible it's just you just got to use it in moderation not not drink milk at every freakin meal and for snacks and you know same kind of deal oh man sorry you're pretty harsh at the end here see I wonder how much THC that is 192 milligrams it looks like THC very interesting so well guys I think I'm done until there we go roll your own pre-roll conjoint at home well just you rolled it it's not pretty rolled using a few simple things you probably got around your house anyway and there you go so hopefully you can save yourself a little bit money make your own pretty rolls own thank you very much for watching y'all have a good", "Q_RKmbYjq2M": "hello everyone good morning good morning good morning this is your homie malty oh we and today we're coming with so i come off with my car my cat is there um that is only me now people today we have the nice and the cbd uh products that and last night we done the from the goods and today we have from the goods as well onion the last night was more um concentrate site uh you know a beautiful and uh grounded purple uh shuttle it's really good um and of course ours and the little um a little vape pen uh what it's delicious as well this is blue dreams that if someone is interesting on that side um check my last video um or go on the straightaway to plays with cbd products people today we're going a little different way we go help our way and as well i wanted to discuss what i think about company how i see in the website and all that you know by the way i'm not sponsored by this company all this product was by them by from my pocket that i'm not related this is pure pure pure pure my review and my opinion with no you know influence from another people uh people say that today we'll be having the disability uh little pineapple express pereirol uh 30 percent of cbd or 14 protein of cbd that people what i do i change our view um i do little close-ups that you can see in the bible how it happens and we open this and later yeah you know i light up and smoke and i tell you my faults what i think it's good or not it's i think have little different approach uh this company for anyway if you change the view up here you go people pineapple experts coming out to but anyway um first i really like um how you know a company really make packages uh it's look amazing i like it it's really in the top top quality uh at least in the packaging and i'm not saying that there is bad boys it's under five star um now with this one it's in the 14 percent of cbd okay that is that is cool and now ingredients why i say this company have literally different approach look at that people organic pro property theory i'm sorry if i butch this world herbal blend what i think it's really don't use hemp it's use this and blendy use this on the use this blendy blendy blendy blendy products you know [Music] what you can use to um to mix with your normal and the wheat what is quite cool i try and it's quite nice um i try this in the holland anyway go back to this little bad boy and what has happened and the art and the cbd isolate what is in the from help and the tapes and minor cannabinoids that can include in the cbg and cbc um that and a lot with previous and products that people yeah quite interesting but let me open this it's safety card we like that let me smell this bubble what's this inside kind of sweet and tiny that really shoot exactly and smell and here we go and that is cool this this is glass it's glass people this is good it's glass tube that that is big shout out um no plastic you know cool nice glass tube uh that people yeah look i was saying they look nice i will if so use and the own papers what we have as well and at some point i'll be delivery of these bad boys uh don't you order it those people yeah this look nice smell quite okay not anyway we got we changed our view and i light up this bad boy but we here you go we go it's time to try this little bad boy uh people uh coffee is check uh lighter check and of course our spiritual check yep that here we go ready to go people i smell very piney and heavy piney what is correct because and the pineapple excess should have little tiny sweet piney healthy flavor however we see how gold is it's quite moist very mellow it smell the pine on you not every day you take kind of sweetness almost nothing almost go tasteless and i think if i'm honest i like these blends for you on the sleeves instead to use tobacco because it's almost tasteless and you have your whole almost whole spectrum and the real deal stuff now i don't say it's bad because it's not however to compare to two flavors what you have from this uh flavors what you have from that uh yeah this little lay down however you know it's nice ben honestly it's good quality and the herbal mix that uh you know it's how it is and i tell you that we go um it's more it exactly taste better than ham flour that i think i like this approach i like this approach to use herbal mix and infuse with with cbd isolates well that is done um i think it's better idea to do it and instead to have perroll hem however i think price of this is about 10 pounds it's 9.99 um it's a little too much i know and they give me and the nice and the glass you know jar and that that it's all cool and that i think it's a little too much uh it's only that my opinion um if i much prefer add you know another tenor and have this bad boy and i have 300 parts and it i i must be picky i'm sorry um overall it's no battery it's very mellow almost you smell it tastes nothing that as the art medicine for you yeah i think in the cook yeah it's not unpleasant what sometimes can have unpleasant than the smell that it's it's okay i mean i think it's still uh it's still um little down compared to these products that people anyway i still be smoking this and now i'll be quickly jumping to show you in the website how look um that you can see um and decide for yourself now people change the quick review and i show your website and we'll be done now people check there you go people website it's let me underscroll it's really uh look nice i like how look look uh cool now you have quality control the premium and the line of cbd infused products and the lab tested that it's so good you know explain you everything nicely a winner so 2020 i'm not surprised um that people yes i think it's this is the herbal mix uh and it's done that i if i'm honest it's better by this uh it's better by honestly by this you you come better and that now you have a vape pants what i really like and enjoy um of course in the shutter uh it's quite good uh as well lovely i never try on the ejuice and i think this be another product what i won't try look people how beautiful design uh i don't know maybe in the summer and the cartilages as well uh why i have yeah and maybe cartridges as well you know uh and here people i think the most with this company really do great and that eats all that [ __ ] it's delicious and a hundred percent uh i want to try tropical citrus and many another that oh so you torture as well that is nice the other and yes we have in the papers as well oh you can have under your and the grinder however be more interesting and up oh here we go ah 30 pound no but look nice people say that you know it's how it is that people it's always i really like this in company uh i really like products how look um i don't know it's this one i think it's no worth it and the money all the rest yeah hundred percent um if you'll be a little cheaper maybe you know some promotion or something maybe seven pounds and that only hey i'm not you know company owner that um this is only my third rest of the products that i say uh uh and the shutter and the vape it's spot on five stars this one i like idea and don't usually help me to use and the herbal mix and the infuse and the stuff i think this is better approach um overall i

virtually hopefully one day we do get to like have like a big ass smoke sesh together and like a lit ass day like that would be so fun you know nice view type of [ __ ] but this is how the packaging looks hi 90s super nice super yellow definitely summer vibes has the palm trees right here they're wax infused cannabis pre-rolls each of them hold 1.2 grams and you all know like most of the time i be smoking like joins priors once in a while backwards but it's like everywhere not rare i would say but it's not i don't smoke it as often you know because pre-rolls um are definitely much healthier since they're nicotine free and let's just take a moment thumbnail these are so cute i can't i cannot oh my gosh so we have right here the um flavors that it has we have strawberry it's sweet and juicy strawberries straight from the fields we have watermelon the refreshing watermelon you crave after the beach peach so juicy and delightful you'll want seconds definitely tropical punch oh i love the the color for this one i love the color for all of them but this is like my favorite color a blend of sweet tropical flute flavors gelato oh my gosh you guys are you guys seeing what i'm seeing the packagings are so cute super [ __ ] cute sugar cookie ice cream better than grandma's pink lemonade like a cold glass of lemonade on a summer day definitely for the summer days pineapple sweet pineapple sprinkled with sugar and double cup a candy lemon lime soda your favorite rapper's drink okay hi nighties i see you guys you guys the packaging oh my gosh i can't even decide which one i want to try out first because they all look so cool and you can tell like the packaging is good quality i like glass containers like this because i can usually like stuff this pre-roll if i didn't finish it in the um back or like if i have another one and i'm like i'm gonna save it in here so it doesn't reek my room like these are just pretty cool containers and like i like that they're colorful that's super cool and it's vibrant and it makes me like happy and it's so summer vibes definitely summer vibes i really like it like i don't know i'm just so excited i can't even choose which one like i think i'm gonna have to like grab them all and do like any minimizing well because they're all too good so guys i actually didn't record a lot and i was actually talking a lot about the product itself and i'm already i already had sparked it up too and i was not recording uh youtuber fails look it it's definitely burning pretty nice we have that white ash i just [ __ ] up the burning that's why it's like but it's burning very like nice and even not even but smooth because i didn't burn it even but yeah as i was saying i was talking about the product i really love um i'm smoking tropical punch and this one has 29.7 thc i just chose this one because it matches my nails to be honest nothing specific in particular but it's hitting pretty good their weed is indoor weed they don't use no um no trim nor shake which is like number one like a big thing most of the pre-rolls range from 30 to 40 so far as i'm hitting it it's super smooth i can taste it that tropical in there these are so like on the gold and cute as [ __ ] like hey you're going to freaking grocery shopping or something you want to smoke right before let me take out aha 90s super cute super fashionable just spark it up ready to go so far i actually like the weed it's hitting pretty good and for it being small like it's hitting pretty good and as i was saying when i was unboxing packaging um they are wax infused heroes and h holds 1.2 grams so these little shits hold 1.2 not bad at all oh i did try fuzzies and it has 0.5 and i just feel like last time in like five minutes or so and this one already has lasted me like okay decent time and although it doesn't have the wax out on the outside it has it in the inside it tastes like pretty enjoyable versus the fuzzy i just felt like i don't know it just tasted like straight up wax like i don't know how to explain in like straight up wax and it also i don't know if it also could have been like the weed too that fuzzies carried because i know that the packaging date was pretty um it had been like since the end of march that they had packaged that [ __ ] so i was like [ __ ] but i already had paid for another great thing about these free rolls each of them comes from a natural blend of terpenes but i really like these spring rolls like i feel like with two i'd be like pretty cool two or three [ __ ] smoke on eight right now [ __ ] it it's all down maybe smoking like how many do you want me to smoke in the session because they do have seven now left i have seven all left so let me know what you guys want to see with the rest of these pre-rolls because yeah i don't want to be reviewing each flavor that's going to be too many or maybe i can i can do a series on this high 90s let me know down what you guys think i should do seven pre-rolls in a sitting um a series of like some flavors or like i don't know don't let me know some creative ideas i sometimes don't i'm not really creative i'm not creative to be honest but i do enjoy making videos for you guys and for the people that do enjoy thank you so much like i said i wouldn't be able to be doing this without you guys and we all go make it here i [ __ ] burned myself with a lighter but definitely i [ __ ] with it i also loved like it is a pre-roll i'm usually you guys always know i'm usually smoking joints free rows once in a while i'll be smoking some backwoods or whatever but it's an occasion it's not all the time because they are nicotine free so they are healthier which is it benefits you you know but i hope you guys enjoyed this video and say hi to the [

Avella: Lowell Herb\nCo. is one of California's largest marijuana companies. Lowell specializes in producing\npacks of pre-rolled joints. Last year, it rolled and\nsold over 4 million joints. In order to do so, Lowell needs a lot of cannabis. This is David Elias,\nCEO of Lowell Herb Co. David Elias: Right now,\nwe're selling about 1,100 pounds a month, soon to be up to almost\n1,300 pounds a month. We're rolling 25,000 joints\na day out of this facility. Joe: The recent legalization\nof cannabis in California for recreational use has allowed companies like Lowell to grow at a rapid rate. David: As of last year, our revenues have\nincreased just over 300%. Joe: Lowell let me take a\npeek inside its facility to see how they make\nso many joints a year. Thank God, because I roll\nmaybe two or three a year, and they're all terrible. Let's check it out. How you doing? David: Right now, we're best known for our one-eighth pack of pre-rolls, which is seven pre-rolls\nin one-eighth of an ounce. We also have a quarter-ounce pack, which has double the number. We have jarred flower, which we sell one-eighth\njarred flower as well. AJ Fay: So, this is where\nwe store all of our flower. When it comes in, it goes\ninto a quarantine container, which is where we do our\ninitial R&D lab testing. When that comes back clear and it passes our\nquality-control standards, it moves over into these\nother two joined containers, which is all usable material. Joe: Each container\nholds about 2,000 pounds of marijuana. My new LinkedIn profile pic. Joe: Strawberry Banana, Mimosa. AJ: Some Gorilla Glue. Joe: Silky Johnson. AJ: The Rude Boy. Joe: The Rude Boy. You got any favorite strains? AJ: Sour Diesel. I love Durban Poison, and I love that Strawberry\nBanana; it's a great indica. Joe: All right, cool.\nAJ: Really relaxing. Joe: You seem like an indica guy. (laughs) The cannabis is put into this shaker to separate the big buds\nfrom the little buds. The big ones will be\nput in jars like these. Employee: This is 77 eighths in total. Joe: Seventy-seven eighths? Employee: Yeah. Joe: So... that's... gonna be 7 pounds? AJ: No, that's, like,\nless than half a pound. Joe: The first step in making\nso many pre-rolled joints requires this machine: a knock box. One-hundred paper cones,\npre-attached to filters, are loaded into the machine. Lowell starts with a blend of flower, which is added to a loading tray. Each tray holds 1 gram of cannabis. The tray is placed on top of the knock box and the machine vibrates and bounces, pulling the flower down\ninto the paper cones. Once the joints are filled, the trays are brought over to a roller. AJ: So, we have about 40\nrollers working each day on one tray per hour, so 100 joints per hour per roller, and that's where we get our about 25,000 joints rolled per day. Joe: Then the joints are\nbrought over to another station where they are placed\nin packages and sealed. David: When you think about pre-rolls, pre-rolls are very convenient. It's easier for the user; they don't have to buy the flower and roll it and then put it into a joint. Joe: Lowell also sells flower in jars if you like to roll your own joints. David: Here in California, we test for pesticides, microbials and potency. So, when a customer gets our product, they can actually see the\nTHC potency right on the pack and know that it's been tested for all the other items that are mandatory here in California. AJ: So, once everything's\nproduced and packaged, it moves into this container, which is our quarantine container. Joe: Gotcha. AJ: So, the lab comes here on site, they send their reps, and they do a random sampling based on the batch size. Joe: So, they just go in,\nthey grab one of these. AJ: So, this was a box of 25, they took two or three out\nof there for lab testing. Joe: Yeah, \"lab testing.\" AJ: And in a few days\nwe'll get the results back, which means if it passes it's able to be labeled and sold to the retailers. Joe: OK. How often do they\ncome through with tests? AJ: We test every single\nMonday, Wednesday, and Friday. Joe: After it passes, the products are labeled, boxed, and shipped out. Got his newest product. They're coming out with 17-pound joints.", "YW6EEZNiwFw": "hello everybody okay today I have a super quick tutorial walkthrough if you will we have a lot of people really interested in CBD joints but have actually expressed that they don't know how to use CBD joints so I'll kind of walk through this you know product this is made with industrial hemp flour it is a full one gram joint it's rolled with raw papers it does have kind of you know like a paper filter in there so when you're in handling the part doesn't go into your mouth and so with that this is the part that goes on your mouth it will say we're all on it and it's more like the slender side at the bottom of the joint and then on this end is actually what you're going to light with fire with flame I'm gonna use matches we also sell hemp wick in our store here we start CBD you're welcome to use lighters pretty much anything that will make fire is how you're going to light the pre-roll but I'm just gonna basically show you how to light the pre-roll on how to put the pre-roll out Oh quick other thing to note because is a full gram I don't recommend smoking the whole thing out once this is a really great product to share amongst your friends this is also a really good product for yourself but just to know that you don't need to take puffs to complete the whole joint you kind of smoke until you feel it so usually for me when I'm smoking enjoy by myself I'll take you know anywhere from three to five hits kind of let it rest see how my body is responding to that and then if you want you know there's no harm in smoking more just know that to get the effect of smoking CBD you don't have to smoke this whole one gram joint that's actually a lot of CBD in my opinion and I'm Allison to go on this piece and this is a side that I'm going to light and we're just gonna do a quick little minor joint if I can light it so the point is to light the paper kind of light that hole first you know circumference of the joint you do take a few puffs really big inhalation is just to kind of like get that cherry on the end of it lighted and then from there you can just kind of inhale and take as many drags as you want like I size you through to four drags but the other thing that I wanted to show you guys is how to properly put a joint out so I recommend using a metal ashtray there's also ceramic ashtrays if you happen to be outside concrete is fine you definitely don't put it out on anything wooden because this is a flame but you're gonna basically take the end and so this is how I'm gonna preserve the joint so I can smoke it later if I choose to I'm just gonna gently kind of tap it out you basically want to suffocate the flame sometimes depending on how much you smoke you can kind of push that lit piece out and again I just kind of dampen it out you know just to make sure that flame isn't still lit but you can put it out and basically when I wanted to refocus I would just light from the end again but that'd be south and basically you're trying to suck the heat from the end all the way through using your lungs that's what's lighting it and pulling and burning that hemp butt of that hemp flower set you can have the effect of smoking CBD so hope you guys like that video if you have other questions for us you're too afraid to ask feel free to you know DM us on Instagram also come visit us in our store at restart CBD we're always happy to talk to you guys in person and yeah we actually sell these pre-rolled joints both in our store here at restart and online at restart CBD calm we carry about six to seven different strains both in loose bud and pre-rolls but yeah girls are a great way to have the convenience of smoke CBD without the pipe without the grinder without all the accessories and a really good fun way to experience this specifically in group settings like taking these to parties so thanks again for watching we appreciate you and check out below for more video", "K_NyT7egqjk":

bright well then you know Cheers props and welcome I hope you enjoy the sesh let's get this [ __ ] started up and we will get to talk and maybe trying to do in front of the camera I think good Cheers gotta say man I'm assuming over the time that I've been you know making all these YouTube videos my skills on rolling I've gone from absolute bottom of the barrel breaking blunts in half trying to roam - honestly I I would have to put myself in a pretty pretty pretty decent position when it comes to rolling me I've honestly never met anyone in person that can't roll better you know better smokeable joints than me you know cuz obviously everybody has their preference on let you know I want a little bit of looser I want a little bit tighter I can do you know whatever you want I'll roll it up I like it but yeah so right now I am still currently chillin in Kalamazoo Michigan because of the corona virus I've not really wanted to go back to my house because there's a lot more cases there and personally I don't know if you guys know this but I've seen an asthma it's pretty seasonal but it also has to do a lot with when the weather changes my allergy sofa clothes are really hot too really cool that it really messes up my allergies and cold too you know vice versa the same thing really message about so honestly like I don't know I've just been trying to stay safe and some other stuff like that I actually have a buddy who got it back from my house he said he really didn't had any symptoms and his whole family got it he's pretty sure that his mother got at the supermarket but you know you just gotta be stayin safe smoking to mean staying chill but honestly I think the main thing to keep in mind is just stay [ __ ] just just stay relaxed a chilled out because you know what one of the things that I realized when all this started was you know it's not just Michigan it's not just America it is the entire world that is dealing with this pandemic right now and you know it's like you can't really feel bad about yourself if you're just kind of hanging out chill and smoking because technically that's what the government is telling us to do so it's like you're following orders so it you know for a lot of people out there a lot of people out there probably feeling really great you know I'm happy that I'm all for all this and that but I'm sure there's a lot of you out there who are just like man I feel like I'm losing my mind stay relaxed everybody's in the same shoes as you we're all going through this [ __ ] together trust me it's rough on me and trust me you guys know this I haven't been going to school or had a normal job in about three years now because I've been doing YouTube and stuff like that and I feel like it would affect me less than other people just because I'm used to hanging out not really doing a lot you know chilling but for me personally I do go out a lot you know at night and you know to go to clubs and bars and stuff like that so that's been really difficult on me but in the comments let me know what your biggest struggle is on the coronavirus arm maybe it's you're not able to see your friends I'm pretty much shown in a house with my boys and stuff like that so in all honesty it's pretty straight with me you know like nothing too crazy nothing nothing nothing where I'm going to insane because I you know don't have any human content but I know there's some of you out there and especially shout out to the people who actually got the coronavirus I just want to send out my deepest condolences to you guys I hope that you're okay I hope that you are recovering well and that you're doing all right and you know make sure to just stay inside and just stay safe and all that jazz smoke a joint you know what I mean such to Adani video do what you gotta do by the way I gotta say this um real quick I gotta give a little shout out to mama smokes shoutout to you MA I love you so much she actually told me I called her up on the phone today cuz I saw that I had a missed touch from her and she said to me that she was missing me so much that she went out and she watched one of my videos just so she could hear my voice and I was like ma you're the sweetest lady of all time seriously that really warmed my heart that made my day and uh yeah might honestly title this video how to get through the coronavirus without losing your mind let me think about other tips and tricks I can give you guys okay here's another one if you guys haven't been go outside and take walks almost every single day it helps you get that fresh air it really helps clear your mind and you can just really be calm and chill and relaxed about it and you know it just really relaxes your body I've definitely been finding that um to be a really solid move for myself personally I don't know about you guys but I've been taking pretty much daily walks I also have my longboard I don't know if you guys skate or longboard anything like that but you know even the government's been saying you know make sure you guys get outside you know do your thing because you need exercise you need energy I would even say you know to everybody out there do a you know a 100 push up a day challenge try to do 100 pushups every single day and you know just get a little bit stronger maybe do some ab crunches just a little home workout remedy I'm sure you guys are all doing this stuff and I'm just reiterating what you guys already know but you know it's important it's important to do it and I gotta say especially for us all out here that are smokers and stuff we're definitely probably more risk of you know possible death when it comes to coronavirus just because of the fact that you know we our lungs are not as good as you know nonsmoker lung so make sure you guys are really being careful make sure you guys are you know obviously you know everybody's got a ton of friends that they hang out with and stuff like that but try to keep your circles pretty tight and even if you know you're hanging out with a friend or you know you're giving some you know you're giving a friend some weed or something they didn't have any your you know you wanted to provide them some weed something like that do a no-contact pickup you know what I'm saying even as much as you want to see your friend it's hard I know but just it's the smart way to go about it that's what we honestly that's what I've been having to do and as someone who goes out pretty much Megan is extremely social I probably hang out with three to four different friend groups every single day when I'm in my house it's been really difficult for me but it's the smart way if we can keep this down everybody's gonna be a lot better off we'll lose a lot less lives you know in the long run it'll just be the you know it's gonna be the the way it has to go by the way lemon you got it let you guys let me know it kinda get a little bit stoned ears let me know what you guys think of the different ambiance here I'm actually up in one of the rooms but instead of in the car because honestly it is latest [ __ ] well actually it's honestly not too late I'm gonna guess that it's maybe like 9:30 10 o'clock at night something like that but it's definitely dark outside to a point where the lighting would not be okay and yeah I just want to make sure you guys got a halfway decent looking down on smokes video again that's crazy I can see myself in the mirror man I just want to say that I really love you guys all out there and seriously this whole corona thing not to keep talking about it too much but it really has given me a respect for life in general because it's like you know man it could go just like that and there's nothing you can really do about it you know what I'm saying so try to cherish these days and just really make sure you talk to your loved ones make sure you give your mom a call make sure you give your dad a call you know if you don't live with them trust me it means a lot it means a lot students actually smoking really nice I've seen just a literally actually a little bottle over here it's actually perfect to be honest I love finding stuff that you can use to a shame to like for months and months and months and they're just some random little crap it's not a fancy ashtray so like if you drop it it doesn't break or anything like that big moves big moves and yeah let me know what you guys like I said before let me know what you guys think of the you know the room is a home I'm not really just like you know I guess just more smoking inside the house or post in my car because I know that a lot of you likes me smoking in my card specifically I don't really know why maybe it's heads of the og days but yeah let me know if you want another video inside the house or if you would just prefer the videos to be out in the car again like I said the main reason I made this video in the house is because of the fact that it's getting darker outside and there was not good enough lighting you guys would be looking at a single pixel of Donnie right here and I don't think you don't want that yeah damn thing saving we're about to the end ma'am I hope you guys enjoyed this video I really from the bottom of my heart I gonna get close on this one bring it on in from the bottom of my heart I just want to say I'm really sorry about lack in the videos it is completely on me I've been playing valor and I've been slacking off I've not been doing my job and I just want to say if any of you out there are looking a place of Valor in

that's the flavor you let me put it all spin move let me we'll be looking at a vibes free roll call without further ado jumps a close-up get into the review I burped up some old bird Moody's flap in the comment section have you take a look at the date pre-roll cone today we're looking at vibes and this is a rice cone oh the rice paper kind of burns up completely the word doesn't really leave a s I'm hoping that it also doesn't have that process of rolling paper taste we're going to do and get these out the pack so you can see what they look like alright burn club these are the vibes rice papers pretty decent papers I'm gonna go ahead and run all our chests on that one census looks kind of funky so we're going to use our lean green machine to hold this in place gonna stuff it up with some of this week and see how the smoke so let's get this thing filled up and see what it do [Music] [Music] hi Bertha got this vibe rice cone rolled up and it's real easy to feel we use the lean green machine that's like one of my favorite cone filling devices you're gonna do your own sapphire on in front of this and see where smoke-like begin I'm hoping that their taste of process paper isn't that strong in this but we'll get some firewood see what it do all right bear claw I think it's a fire oh just buy rice drink just raining so my dear to hear that but I do like to smoke on a rainy day so go ahead get some fire on this why be drink see what the first size to each matter was like [Music] all right well there is the descent of process paper um it's not that strong but it is definitely here we're going to take the first poll to see what the smoke actually tastes like I'm thinking that it might not taste that strong because it's not that strong in this ice cream but again I never want to get ahead of myself let's see what this thing you're doing yo now roads up there is a a fine line of paper taste going off the side street but it doesn't show up that strong in the taste other side of smoke like light I mostly just tasting the bud and it's a very Turkey but and that's really all just coming through right now there's very very light very light one of want to taste of it now I've had other rice papers and they perform basically the same way there's a very light underlying taste of rolling paper or both seniors who taste when you smoke powdery rice papers is weak now that side strength as it comes off of the earth is gone into my nose that smells just like processed paper does yeah there's no way of guess around that scent coming off the side string because all of them have that same thing but again the taste of this paper so far is one of the least strongest process paper tape again it doesn't mean that it's not there because I do still taste it it's just a very minimal we look at the ash on this what you see on there is really just the weed this burning of the paper that burns completely to where we look at it you can't you can't see the ash of it at all first bleep well hurry up there winds out there howling right now through trees a very good smoke coming dry like I'm I feel like my esophagus is very dry whoo Smokies that is my bra cubes I brought you a drop it is smoking with them mama daily say this when you see these do me try they know to think if you try them how did you like me again it taste for me it's minimal compared to a lot of the other rolling papers I've done in a long time but what do you think I will smoke the rest of this in five no is - grandma - Amar'e to Lamar Facebook into amore life you know what the first time I've seen divides I welcome to the head shop close to me it's the one that goes to to get a lot of my stuff and the lady behind the counter was like um the vibes just came out I was when I did the employ oh the Hempleman was pretty good like this race one better the process paper taste is fainter on this that that help one has a vegetative taste bud and the stronger process paper tape still one more hit we got to do do you want to get some but I like this racing never stopped me the do it is out there to the world Wow Merkel so much we got me going to the moon Neil can't see [ __ ]

my [ __ ] so you don't deserve to be on my [ __ ] show so I'm gonna stay in celebrity your ass Canyon celebrity and you know what people actually I think they like like 2 percent because the bickering situations what made you pop in no [ __ ] I need you topping [ __ ] we want to review Jumbo's I've heard a lot about them but I've never tried their stuff I mean maybe I have but I've never actually went to their dispensary to buy it so this one is Sunday driver 80% indica and 20% so to go to OG and green it's plenty of time time purple sponge 30% indica 70% sativa so we went to their store downtown we picked up some of their stuff it's like one of the top need friends like that there are in the entire industry everybody raves about dog boys and their products and they're kind of pricey but I guess like most wheat is in a dispensary if it's like on the top shelf or a Private Reserve so this should aspire and some super pricey so this cost one hundred and ten dollars for two eighths also they gave us this bag because we were first-time customers and in the bag we see MC shark it's like a box it says exotics and it has like stickers a lighter so this is the lighter now we have two lighters well there's a little logo on us though then we have stickers over here we have joystick [Music] all right so you've never tried jumble boys I'm assuming no what are you sure so you can I think we're the best weed and growing them somewhere garbage it's not garbage to me I like if you see this get me up because I wish is official or nothing I [ __ ] with it I don't care if everybody smokes bachelor Delphine I don't know how to roll [ __ ] backward so I so that's why you know Swisher I like Swisher it's leave me the [ __ ] alone some people like Toyotas and some people like Bentley's and some people like [ __ ] Saiyans and Prius is like everyone has their own opinion I jump into them for some people don't care about cars some people are rich and they have princes because they want to they care about the environment yeah right yeah right so people that do care about the environment don't want you smoking anyway I'm also it's not spying that's knowledge yeah and it looks good too like you see all the purple yeah see she gave me where is it it's gonna be tough no I got you just cluster phobia yeah yeah well I don't like people to touch me I don't tell you just touch me I'm touchy-feely you clasp the phone so I'm just gonna roll this up and we're gonna try it but can you can you just scoot over adjust your drop so there's a rule I'm just asking you somehow wait I'm breaking up the weed eunuch blinder yes so we had a conversation about like yo listen just can you just pull back a little bit let me roll it and just just just chill just think about astrology or whatever whatever you think about yeah that's how you guys people you meet them you about you ask I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know talking about that's his game no please just roll that I just wish you black yo you're not telling nothing and you can tell the truth anyway but a snitch all you do is complain just be happy oh he doesn't likes whispers I do I am everybody knows who I am right the only thing is uh why don't I roll no no I don't like it oh you don't like something that's good wouldn't you want something around your weed that's something that I think make a change not a thick blood yeah you better watch your mouth mmm that's a song right because it's not referring to me I know that's that's a violation right do you alright so we just let it go so it's so far it tastes I would say I would compare it to like a gelato type of teeth it's very good alright we'll pass in this this is good look I mean it would be really good without the squishing you spray the Swisher's how I'm grateful are some people watch them grateful I'm just saying there's a lot of people in the world that can't even get jungle boys and can't even try it if they wanted to fifty five bucks if you live in Kentucky I don't think it's 55 bucks and I don't think it's accessible like that so saying basically it's a Superbrand take that [ __ ] it is that [ __ ] will you sit it down right so that's good you don't have to spend so anyway like I was saying I wanted to enjoy the weed dogs good it seems really good really worth the money so you've got your values worth they're like they're downtown LA if you could order on at least you can order them March online and maybe weed if you're into like a compliant state I like their packaging I always kind of did like their logo is kind of cool how did you get up on it well I work in the cannabis industry if you didn't know and I'm pretty much connected to every big major brand that exists right now I'm up on the cannabis trends you know what I mean yeah that's what I was wondering I do all public relations and more Giddings for like some of the top companies in LA and then I own this clothing line so really yeah I want to be the voice for the woman in the industry for the women in this industry who get overlooked and undervalued and treated like [ __ ] so I want to be their voice because you don't [ __ ] up we're not appreciated and we bring a lot to the table because men can only go so far when you have a vagina and titties and a cute smile you can like go to the moon and back but man can't do that and they don't understand the value sometimes and having a pretty girl with a brain on their team and they try to treat you like you should be doing dishes so that's the whole like point behind this entire thing that I'm doing yo you notice this voices anywhere what is that one for clarification like - oh no I'll tell you I got this tattoo because I said that I will never work for anyone ever again because if I have to work for somebody with the boss tattoo on my hand then I'm gonna be humiliated so when I became to a level where I can not have to work for anybody for a little while I decided to stab myself to remind myself every day why we go so as the bosses life like single huh I say you think you're living the boss's life like some dog yeah someone called bosses like yeah like when you say you say needs got a bag of [ __ ] you know he's a boss but you play you know I'm saying what are you so hyped up I didn't even see I don't know I'm saying with the mistake the last

got the home is right here stop guys I'm saying so what you got there backwards this is the fourth one the last one we have remember the video we bought four of these over at home flowers yeah and yeah this is the last one polluting littering same thing pushing pollution I guess lettering is pollution right is it on a session blood what you guys think let us know okay and then to hybrid the news huh here hold it like this no like this no no there's stuff on the other thing yeah like the keys - yeah that's cool that's pretty so if I was interrupting guys can you I just so basically what this is it's two grams of straw Nana in a hemp wrapped with the glass filter with keep around it and wax to help to keep stay on the outside first thing man so it's definitely retail price of these were actually fifty I say 50 or 45 which is uh we got it for a steal we got it for to each guys it was like 25 no Cindy someone it's just probably it just all depends on where your location is obviously guys but yeah yeah this yes any quality of the light oh good yeah I do you got the packwood slider - I'm gonna show them the glass tip too dan you gotta do a thumbnail cigar dog [Music] have you watched his other movie Martin Scorsese movie Cape Fear Robert De Niro's like a psychopath in there some [ __ ] no while I was watching it I was watching no I didn't watch it I was watching a joaquin phoenix joker interview on jimmy kimmel and then he said something about his lap he was like that laughs you do in the movie this is kind of like Robert De Niro and Cape Fear or some [ __ ] did you see that interview where he showed the whole audience the outtakes of walking Phoenix that [ __ ] you liked on Instagram Jimmy Kimmel showed that [ __ ] and then you could see walking Phoenix he was kind of upset that he actually showed that [ __ ] no you like the outtake it was on his before he was like cher Cher oh you said harder it was just me and him yeah I would have been hiding a pension now actually I'm pretty literate okay yeah guys just hopefully the lighting is good I mean [ __ ] it should be good but the glass tip is all right okay you said it like a cigar supposed to be like a luxury a guard yeah like backwards again yeah and it makes it cool because those it'll it'll stop burning once it hits the glass tip so you're not burning off like you're not smoking the filter if it was like paper or something this says it's brought Nana's a constraint that's an interesting name this is like well you know like you can tell yeah it's pot shelf but all-natural wrap glass culture the word natural dough isn't that lady shout out to show grow natural natural late no is that really natural they're saying the rap is natural oh yeah a naturally occurring in the wild what are you what are you what are you getting right now I'm just really it's like saying I don't know very much forget okay this is dodo hold on it was like four of us my those three just gave up I was at home that's you know it's him okay but that doesn't make sense because tobacco is natural - it's a [ __ ] plan so when they say all-natural on that - it's awful marketing when you see natural you're inclined to buy it more I guess you're reading CNN IGN your culture don't i GN don't tell me any bad news about last of us so you can tell me the [ __ ] outrage right when i found out last of us wasn't gonna have multiplayer but then the next day they said they were gonna have it just not with the original [ __ ] disk i don't know what the [ __ ] they're trying to do here some sort of like marketing scheme or some [ __ ] but I loved multiplayer on Last of Us she was dope he would petition for it no it's already on there it's already a player they're not gonna have it on the it might be a deal seat you guys are talking about the other day remember me they've always would have had they've always mean and there's no way they wouldn't have had it it's like it was just like how many people would yeah well and not another thing some people like we're like good hope no multiplayer just like those people suck at the multiplayer it's like dude they could they could have a good single player and I'm good multiplayer they did it on the first one why can't they do in the second one they're like oh let's just put all our marbles into single-player single players dude have you ever played a [ __ ] story again after you play it beat it be honest see exactly there you go yeah like a harder mode or whatever right now that's online thing there's a progression still it's still campaign no it's you play the progression on boardwalk sort of campaign they can play with your friends so it's the same no it's not it's not some the way so I mean then what I'm just trying to say into a campaign like no clear period like you had in the first part exactly what - and I'm saying that's it like this there's just no argument about it like I'm not really people like you know people play different one player yeah from what I heard like I seen you guys play it all the time and it was hyped up too so but I see what you're saying about border lines you do get to replay it but when you replay it you're you you're basically coming back with the stuff you had already it's basically still a progression you're gonna get levels above the level that you ended with you know I'm saying last of us you beat the game it's you just beat it because you you like the story that's it you know there's nothing to do after there's no endgame remember I remember watching my sister playing the first one it was kind of short yeah hello art so I gave up on do Annie oh oh the samurai game was I should do the bosses were winners never quit eventually you used to get tired of quitting only succeed after that so how you liking this it's good would you say it's anything to stick out differently than the other ones with this dream was just same experience I've only dated like two of them oh the one a whole flowers no one here right now and the one a Halle flowers seemed harsher I don't know is I was just two of us really that's two of us this time so feels like it's easier oh it's

shouldn't hit both of thing was at the same time all I knows we're gonna have to relocate to where somewhere", "mCy37KOh25o": "okay cool so here we are in my thousandth post thought I'd do something a little different today and got this packwood's shout out to what's in my pre-roll for their inspiration such a simple concept with something so desperately needed in today's day and age so yeah this is legit Packwood's that I picked up it's prop 64 compliant not exactly sure what that means it does look like it is a normal blunt but I'm sure it's kind of like hemp wrap or something like that it doesn't exactly specify here on the packaging but as you can see it's got its holographic seal there it's got this wax but it's not real wax apparently and it's sealed by actual plastic so yeah let's go ahead and crack this thing open and see what we got looks like the dotted line is right here Packaging always gets the best of me all right cool all right so that came off pretty easily strip this does this just want to come off all right let's get the sticker going really self-conscious of my nails right now I definitely should have cut them but alright let's see oh there we go popping this off I guess this would be pretty problematic if it was actual wax oh that's just a screw top all right makes perfect sense plastic in there and there's what we're seeing from the top first a little preview there let's get this thing out of here no graceful way to really do this let's see there we go cool there it is it even has packwood's right there on the glass tip so yeah I mean looking decently keeped up guess that's the whole point this little guy escaped some like a little well let's just cut it open in reserved judgment here let's see if I can smell anything not really picking up on any Jack necessarily but it's probably just because it's overwhelmed by whatever this rap is made of got my little scissors out so here we go first cut definitely is stout whatever's in there oh damn oh no I was gonna try to patch this back together after this video but we'll see how that goes all right so there we go let's open it up get the focus on that alright well not exactly what you'd expect from their post on their Instagram page so you're getting at that looks like it'd be pretty hard to pull through falling apart pretty easily let's get a smell for this I mean it is looking fairly tricht yeah I'm not really picking up on any Jackson I know it's blackjack but I mean all the blackjack that I've ever smoked has just been predominantly Jack smelling it and I'm not really getting anything off of this let me grind it up a little bit that's what you this is what you're getting look tiny here let me get in here this is what you're getting I'm not shooting on this if you want to spend you know fifty sixty dollars to get this packed into you know keep tup want do it I mean I don't have a problem with that but that is what you're getting get you know it's ground up pretty well it's all smashed in there it's got some stems in it nothing no huge ones nothing like that I mean the note looks alright it's not anything amazing I see some perp in there but I'm sure I mean I'm not getting any smell off of my fingers at all which is kind of weird if anything maybe a little bit of sweetness but nothing jack like so that's what you get right there let's see what it comes out - oh wait you know there's a lot more there I mean not a lot more but there's more in here cut down a little more I'm saving this guy now is that it isn't where I'm at the tip there all right you guys couldn't see this but I'm trying to work it out it is just smashed in here look here so I mean maybe that would have smoked awesome laying here let me focus a little bit there we go so maybe that would it yeah it's like I don't know maybe that would have smoked great I don't think so [Music] I'll try to take a picture away in it cuz it's like honestly it's so caked in here I'd have to scoop it out so but yeah that's it that's what's inside right there you're looking at it pretty much all of it except for what's jammed right in there there's some Keef on the outside I don't know you know where the what is it co2 wax I guess maybe it's with in the nug like kind of blended in or maybe it's on the outside but honestly no Jackson it whatsoever and yeah I don't know that's what you get so if you want if you're cool with that and if you want to spend the kind of money to grab that then go for it but I mean I'd rather just grab something else and roll it myself there it is backwoods blackjack", "mKrqfPOIWSU": "yeah you guys go out there up your pre-roll game if you get it in a cardboard box and it's uh they're dry grab yourself a pack case throw above it in there let it sit for 24 hours your experience will be completely different than smoking a dry pre-roll nobody wants to do that anymore so let's let's change that welcome everybody this is anthony with boveda joined today by cody ziering with pac case how the hell are you buddy i'm good i'm good i'm coming off vacation so i'm still uh still a little bit of vacation mode um which is always a fun little area to be in no doubt uh best part about vacation is on the way their worst part of vacation is coming back to the office and seeing 18 000 emails waiting for you it happens all the time i know yeah so it's just been pitchforking out of that but um things are good yeah there's a lot going on here a lot of things to talk about today absolutely industry's booming boveda is booming pack cases booming let's get to it where do you want to start i mean you want to start with i guess how we kind of ran into each other years ago yeah absolutely this has been a long time coming no doubt um where was that i think mj biz vegas 2017 maybe yeah okay um yeah you guys what launched in 2016. just about yeah we uh we we came up with the idea very very early on like january 2nd 2016 we were still working for a vertically integrated cannabis company right near aspen colorado great experience gave us great insight into the industry and really what the cannabis market kind of demands uh and everything has come from there it was like it was one of my first very first trade shows i think when i walked over and saw you guys um it was a funny story we we bumped into you uh quite literally um saw your shirt and were like oh we know bobito we love that and we just started talking with you brett and i actually got invited brett's my business partner everybody in case uh nobody nobody knew that uh brettgelfan shout out to you buddy um brett and i actually went to that convention for free the cannabis company had purchased tickets for us and we had left before the show happened so we got to go on their dime and you know that's kind of when our world turned around and how did you how did you guys get into the space again um what was your background before pack case funny funny story uh i was working tech i was uh working for apple at the time i was an engineer um doing some annoying stuff on the phones with in between customers and engineering kind of realized that uh corporate life wasn't for me i needed a change and i was helping brett work on some website for some cannabis company uh two weeks later he said hey we need a director of marketing are you interested i jumped on the opportunities like all right we'll pack your stuff and get to colorado next month uh time to start so went out there a little bit of nepotism uh brett's uh brett's dad my dad and the guy that hired us have all been friends for 30 35 years i guess he wanted some smart cheap labor at the time and that's uh kind of how we got our invitation but a few months later unfortunately he got sick and it put brett and i in a position where we were running the show uh in our young 20s which is absurd to put 20 year olds in charge of a 15 million cannabis company but hey you know you got to do what you got to do in business it sure is yeah we have a similar story too um you know i want to hear it how did you get started please yeah no i was i was in tech as well like straight out of college um under the fluorescent lights in a cube sea of cubes and i was like oh yes i'm getting out of school i'm gonna you know work and sell stuff and pay off my loans and you know it's a big fortune 500 company and uh after about a year and a half you know i was going through started out as like uh you know basically a quote guy you know early on learning the sales process and then moved through quickly but i know i wanted to to sell and to really own accounts and quarterback stuff and i talked to my boss and he's like well that's probably eight to ten years away for you and so i'm like oh i can be patient but uh not that patient [Laughter] and uh yeah luckily family friends um one of my family friends lived down the street from my cousin again nepotism here lucky right place right time but um kate holstein who's in charge of our international business she's been uh she actually got me to sidetrack even more she got me my first job um working like as a banquet server at weddings and so i've just i've known her since i was a kid basically and she's like hey i worked this company boveda and um now we make these humidity control packs we're in the cannabis space we're in the tobacco market and we're in the music industry and i heard those three things i said cool i mean yeah i'm in so i interviewed with them long story short um you know as employee number 12 and i think we're over 65 now and that was just four and a half years ago so um really fun fun place to work similar stories here we're basically um very similar in what we do our products and our services are very complementary to the things we're trying to address here to the cannabis industry 100 peanut butter and jelly uh especially for for pre-rolls we make something that's uh great for protecting them and you guys make sure that they stay fresh and tasty for as long as absolutely possible longer than most thought would be possible exactly so anthony i mean we've been talking we've known each other for a long time but really i don't know the the story behind boveda how how did that come about what is it like tell everybody what bovita is yeah so um it's a really simple product and that's that's what uh that's what we like most about it but it's very effective and it works pretty well um it started 25 years ago a couple of guys in the tobacco business they were cigar smokers saw a problem with uh humidification one-way humidification for regulators for cigar humidors um they said there's got to be a better way to do this so they worked um with a couple of engineers from general mills here in minnesota on coming up with a product that's able to basically self-control it's not you you don't have to add anything to it um and it's a two-way controller so in a deficit environment it'll add humidity and then when there's not enough it'll or when there's too much it'll it'll absorb some too so it's it's really getting rid of those peaks and hills and valleys of humidity um and so that that technology started for the like i said for the the cigars and tobacco business and then over time and we i'm sure this has been talked about on many of our other podcasts but um you know we started seeing these tobacco stores uh selling a lot of products in northern california um to the traditional market and um there's like wow there's there's a demand for this on the cannabis space too and that was probably 10 12 years ago now um and so we came up with our our 62 formula and um you know from there the the technology has really stayed the same but we've been finding out more about how this technology can um you know not just protect weight and help you know manage the moisture content or water activity but to also preserve terpenes and trichome integrity so it's been fun to to watch how it's how it's grown and what we've learned um that's that's really fun there's a huge feast of thought culture here feast of learning love of learning um that's that's something that's at our very core um and we have a lab down in um the basement of our hq here where a lot of these tests are being ran we have a lot of partners um different labs across the states and even internationally that help run tests and it's it's really cool uh so yeah that's you know it's a bit of a ramble there but that's uh no it it it sounds super cool i mean we did we've we've been doing r d on our products for four years you know always trying to come up with new stuff but we just have to make a really interesting design and make sure it's structurally integral you guys you have to do some chemical engineering which i can only imagine just ups the level of difficulty by you know to the umpteenth degree so good for you guys it's great that you guys can do everything downstairs and run humidity tests and i know that's a great segue into what we'll we'll talk about next because you can't really run a humidity test without measuring what you're trying to contain the humidity within uh which kind of leads me on to what we do over a pack case and we make these really amazing joint cases this is one of our awesome hemp clients father obsidian but check this out we call this product a jpeg it's our flagship so you'll notice inside this is what's amazing to bovida and everyone who uses it there's a gasket seal that lines the actual case to hold five payrolls um so when you close it you can actually hear the click that's how you know it's sealed and then our favorite part not so boveda is central but we have a extra little place that you can store roaches so you can't finish a joint you don't want to stink up the rest of uh the fresh ones inside the pack that was a really cool idea um so as we were developing this the whole reason we put a gasket in there was to make sure that pre-rolls stayed fresh unfortunately in this industry the pre-roll has been an underutilized product skew for so long such an easy product to produce it's something that from a beginner to an intermediate to a super heady everyone loves smoking joints everyone loves smoking bloods and when we first got in the industry back in 2016 everyone was just taking trim that shitty extra leftover whatever stuffing in a pre-roll and saying okay good enough today now it's totally different story people use only flower premium everything sometimes they're even caviar which means that they may have a core with some hash or are wrapped with some keef and some extra little bits on the outside and can exceed retail values of over 50 bucks in fact last time i was in vegas at the show we went to a dispensary planet 13 and they were selling a can of cigar for a thousand dollars uh so the pre-roll game has totally evolved now think about this anthony what would what would you do if you went out you bought a blood that was a thousand dollars and it was dry i would immediately want to return it right and can you probably not probably not so products like that have to be in something that's airtight and gasket sealed and if you're doing it the right way you have a bill vita pack in there as well yeah no doubt um you you brought up some really interesting stuff cody um do you mind expanding a little bit on how you've seen um you know we're we're more on the you know we certainly work with a lot of companies that manufacture pre-rolls um but also you know people that are just packaging grams or eighths or quarters or ounces or pounds um but it seems you know i mean you guys have a focus on pre-rolls do you want to elaborate on how that's changed throughout like the last four or five years um you know going into this more premium stuff versus just the consumable hey you know the dispensary is running a deal and you get a free pre-roll and it's kind of just like everyone expects oh it's it's probably gonna be dry it's probably not gonna taste very good but i mean how is it where is it changed and where is it changing where is it going yeah absolutely like i had said before when we first got into it no one really cared they just took a pre-roll they were sometimes even making them in the dispensary with leftover whatever after bagging out you know an eighth for a customer there's maybe another gram or two in the jar so the manager said screw it let's grind it up throw it in some pre-rolls and now we can sell it today the pre-roll is a main sku in the industry i think it accounts for maybe 10 15 20 somewhere in there depending on the month of total cannabis sales in the entire country so clearly they're here to stay and it's a product that people love so very quickly back in 2016 and 17 when we were starting pack case we realized that the pre-roll was super underutilized it wasn't really given the appreciation that it should have i mean it's a top level sku it's a real money maker and it doesn't take a lot of money to actually start producing them so we created our product because there wasn't any premium offerings like i said everyone was just throwing [ __ ] in a tube and or a bag and that was it there really wasn't like a uh a big demand for people asking for quality pre-rolls and we didn't understand that because as pre-roll enthusiasts someone who we smoke joints all the time especially when we went skiing or out for hikes or whatever joints are the way to go um no one really had anything that was nice or worth talking about bringing home so instead we just buy flour and roll our own but it left a huge amount of market opportunity for all these cannabis companies who weren't doing something to make a premium sku that addresses a huge market need so there was an incredible amount of demand and no supply whatsoever and that's where pac case came in to fill the gap and give opportunities to companies like this to be able to sell a premium pre-roll so was pac case kind of born on the mountain per se it's funny uh we quickly came up with the idea late at night uh the second night that brett and i had ever met um just because we were talking about going skiing and taking joints before we ever had a prototype uh i had actually uh three or four joints like in my chest pocket um took a little kicker while i was skiing and totally yard sale ate [ __ ] skis went flying worst part though uh i was kind of hurt and the joints were all broken so not only was i like in pain i couldn't smoke so it was it was rough so brett and i very quickly jumped on finding someone to help us out with the design and we quite literally used our prototype our very first one which i have right here super basic shitty design but uh this i used for an entire winter to hold pre-rolls and make sure that they wouldn't break so connor was uh was born out of uh two things a we needed a person we had a personal need we needed to be able to carry joints on the mountain or going for hikes or wherever uh and at the same time we knew that the cannabis market needed it too so it was a little bit of a selfish uh build it was kind of doing it for us and then realized there was a business behind it too that's that's exactly it though i mean that's how great products and ideas are born what's what's uh what's a problem i'm facing in my world today like some broken pre-rolls and then you know there's gonna be thousands of other people that have the same problem so cool stuff i've always loved your guys products um and you guys um you have your your five pack obviously what's what's more of your consumer facing um your duo right do you have you don't have a single though because who's gonna smoke a single joint i mean you're always gonna have one for a buddy so you would think that we uh we do have a we may or may not i cannot confirm or deny that we have a single in the works um but it won't be ready for a while if in fact we're working on something uh really though like one is never enough right like two is always better than one three is better than two and [ __ ] if you can have five will have five um so it's it's what's most amazing and what i find most interesting about our product and why it it works so well on both sides of the aisle um it's a packaging product it was always developed to be a packaging product and whole allow cannabis companies to sell pre-rolls but over the course of a year or two as we were our social media was growing and people were starting to find out about what we were doing people started asking for these just like hey i don't live in a cannabis state how do i get one um so we put them up on amazon and let it ride and uh two years later we've sold you know more than 50 000 units and are absolutely crushing a thousand reviews which blows my mind and we have over four and a half stars which on a product intended for packaging that gets sold as an accessory yeah blows my mind every time 100 and um one thing that i've always loved about your guys product is that um you know you can you can customize it um you know the the business can go put their branding on it and customize it however they want um that's a huge thing especially up in canada and some other markets that um you know they can't necessarily advertise or brand do you have any experience there um helping companies really market their brand with your guys packaging technology i'm glad that you asked that anthony pack case technically is a packaging company right that's the product that we sell but really when you get down to things we consider ourselves a marketing company we give our clients an ability to brand and promote products in ways that they wouldn't be able to before our packaging may be slightly more expensive than everyone else on the market but that's obviously because it's a premium feel what other packaging can go out and say hey i sell for 20 on amazon but instead you can come to my dispensary take five of my best highest quality joints with delicious flour have my brand on it and then now go and walk around with it so we give these companies not just an opportunity to create beautiful packaging that's going to create an amazing customer experience but we also allow their customers to then become a walking advertisement for their company think about it you buy a jpack from somebody that means you have five joints so you take one joint out to smoke with a friend well you're obviously gonna close the pack put it back in your pocket again you still have four left so you're gonna hold on to the packaging for a long time which means anytime you smoke with somebody and you take that out your brand as a company gets exposed to their friend who's now likely to become a customer their self themselves yeah well and let's let's back up to a second so let's talk about um the premium aspect so and what that value can can mean not only to a business but to the consumer so your guys you go i mean let's and we can even back up to that leap down study that we helped you guys do so that by let's explain this to the the people so yeah boba can take uh packaging and put it into a um a dry chamber put above the pack in there and then we can basically estimate the shelf life or stability how long the boba packs can last how long the product is going to stay fresh um versus no active humidity control versus having a boat pack in there and then we can compare that um against the control and give you hey this is going gonna you know add an extra week two weeks a month some cases um let's should we chat about uh how that went and what that kind of means for brands and consumers as far as you know brands are gonna be able to go into more inventory and that's something that we've seen on on the boveda side is um you know a big concern or a big problem facing a lot of these operators was hey we're just trying to get product on the shelf because the supply and demand chart is totally kitty wampus and you know we've had cultivators operators say we're we're trying to like they're torn especially these commercial ones because they want to have a longer cure on their their flower and they wanna couldn't really control that quality um but then they have um people in the supply chain saying hey this dispensary's been out of said strain this amount of flour for x amount of days and like we just we need to get on the shelf it's just flying off the shelf that we have seen as i have seen personally that's kind of slowing down and people are able to go into more inventory and carry more um but our products together can help assure that that shelf life is there and so product isn't sitting for two three months and then it's sold dry that's one of the benefits of being able to use pack case and boveda together um these operators who you know think about it if you have a production team of 10 well you don't necessarily want to have two people doing pre-rolls and two people doing edibles and spread out your labor force a lot of the times it's more efficient and our clients have told us this that you know i want to put my entire production team have them do an entire run start to finish bang it out and then move on to the next project now when you do that with flour with pre-roll with something that's not necessarily super shelf stable like a concentrate or an edible you have to have velocity so not only do you have to package it up quickly you have to get it out the door you have to get it to the dispensary they have to shelve it and then they have to get it out to the consumer now that process can take a lot longer than it would take a cannabis to dehumidify and then dry out lose terpenes lose flavor lose potency and mess with um with effects right like if uh some thc converts into cbd that flower that you smoke once it's converted is gonna make you feel totally different than if it didn't exactly so with boveda and pack case because they're such a tremendous seal these producers have the ability to make an entire run of pre-rolls leave them in their factory if they have to and as long as it's properly sealed and the boveda pack is fresh these pre-rolls are going to last a lot longer which means that their production problems that come along with having to do massive runs and then making it like sit on it as opposed to doing smaller runs and moving them quicker and making a regular process makes life a lot easier for them they can sit down bang out all of their pre-rolls that they need for a month and two days and then not have to worry about the quality at all because of the protection that pacquiao boveda provides yeah and a term that comes to mind that i hear a lot is consistency um and that's that's what a lot these brands want to deliver because they know in a lot of these markets especially on the east coast where i've been working predominantly it's medicine so uh you know it's if you can the cannabis plant in the flower is not a it's not a pill and it's very volatile and so like you said um you start getting that trichome degradation and you're gonna lose medicinal benefits um and it's like you know going to get your prescription and your short your short two pills and there's an extra one magical pill tossed in there you know it's like you you want to make sure that the product is consistent and delivered same same smell same taste same flavor same effect every time and uh yeah i think i think our our two products definitely can help um in that in that regard absolutely cannabis obviously is a product that affects headspace and if you find something that works for you and you find something that you like you want to make sure that if you buy it again it's going to have the same exact effect uh there's only one way to do that in terms of flour and pre-rolls and that's control the humidity making sure that the product stays the same on day one as it is on day 30 and potentially even out to day 60s so it's important i know that a lot of people that consume cannabis for medical reasons um which there are many that's how this whole industry really started right um they need that they need consistency of dose they need consistency of effect and you can only do that by controlling terpene and humidity content right yup yup there's no doubt about that and then um you know let's another thing that i've been seeing um and sorry this is so salesy just because that's the world that i live in every day is just sales but um you know competition between brands um i i like to think of the cannabis industry as a more friendly um competition uh than any than any other industry that i've been in or or seen where it's you know really we're we're all in this together with one common goal and that's to bring uh relief to a lot of people and liberty to a lot of people um to do what they want with their lives consume what they want and um just not step on anyone else's toes but competition on shelf space um is the pack case boveda combo is that something that people can use to set their their brands apart from others is that can you take these these two common value adds and educate the consumer to say hey i'm gonna my pre-rolls are gonna probably be better in here by the time i get them depending on when they were packaged and you know i'm gonna have an extra two three weeks to go through these um with the boveda pack and then you know i have the pack case forever um these are these are things that consumers care about and are gonna want is that messaging from the consumer is that getting driven to these brands that are making these decisions on packaging yet it's a good question some of the brands who really have a premium focus and a premium attention absolutely they understand that their customers keep coming back to them because their products are so good some of the there's a lot of a lot unfortunate but there's a lot of cannabis companies out there that really don't cater to a premium market um and don't really care about the quality of their products um you know like i said a lot of them are still back in the model of 2016. let's take any leftover [ __ ] that we have let's toss it in a pre-roll put it in the doob tube and just send it whatever happens happens i don't know about you but whenever i consume something that affects headspace uh alcohol cannabis whatever else it may be i always want to make sure that i'm getting something that's quality and consistent um price isn't so much uh a concern of mine right i would much rather pay an extra 20 or 30 bucks to know that uh the quality that i'm getting is there versus having to deal with some [ __ ] for a much cheaper cost i believe that if you're gonna intake something it should only be the the best quality you know it's affecting you like you as yourself not a car not a house you and your health so for me as a consumer i always want to make sure i'm getting high quality and i think that there's a lot of companies that value my sentiment and cater towards a client like me when you have a customer that doesn't you end up with shitty product and that creates a negative loop sure you're going to get the sale once or twice because it's a cheap product but i doubt that person's coming back to you there's no consistency there's no flavor it's all dry harsh smoke it's no good no one likes that yeah and that's i think that's changing too i think as more people get introduced to cannabis i mean we talk about all these people taking baby steps i mean i was down in in florida i had a dispensary doing a visit and i i witnessed what i always knew was going on down there but never had witness for myself which was a woman that looked just like my grandma going into a dispensary for the first time and she has all of her paperwork and she looks at the the person at the front desk and she's kind of you know pretty coy and her her husband's behind her um you know they're just kind of looking around and she goes i'm here to um purchase some marijuana it's so cool to see that but there's so many people that need to be become educated on you know multiple different aspects of cannabis um but it's there's so many new people coming into it and uh that's that's a that's a big piece of the education piece and you know knowing what you're consuming how it's gonna make you feel um you know what you like essentially there are a lot of people figuring out what they like and um you know here in minnesota it's tough for me uh because we don't have um you know like we don't have adult use here so i can't just go in and say hey you know i'm wanting this today and that's uh that's something that a lot of new states are having which is is great um and uh sorry i kind of lost my train of thought here it's all good those are those were always my fate when when i was back at the cannabis company those are always my favorite people you know there were times and days where you know as just a higher level employee at the company uh the dispensary was short-handed so i'd have to go in there and maybe put a quick shift in and just talk to cool people about wheat all day it was honestly not a bad way to uh spend a couple hours outside of my normal role my favorite customers were always the older folks who really had never id any idea they'd walk in they'd always be like hey can i like can i buy some weed yeah and it's like you don't have to whisper it's legal welcome to the cannabis store let me show you what what are you what are you interested in what would you like to try are you interested in smoking something would you like to vape something would you like to try an edible it's always great introducing those people to the entire world something that as an enthusiast we've been living for decades right but i don't want to date myself but [ __ ] it's been a long time um yeah it's it's it's remarkable the clearly the direction of the country the world is totally changing our neighbors up to the north were a lot smarter than we were legalized a lot quicker and look what happened now they have five or six companies in cannabis worth over a billion dollars you ever think that there'd be a unicorn in cannabis now there's five it's insane yep ellen what do you think is i mean comparing the canada to the u.s right now um especially these last couple weeks um just these these larger operators and what what is that what does this mean for cannabis in 2021 um as far as these these bigger companies you know that and you know four or five years ago in the grassroots cannabis movement semi grassroots cannabis movement um you know a lot of it was the the buzz around trade shows in the industry was all these you know these big companies are gonna come in and they're gonna start getting swooped up and the commercialization does cannabis in your opinion cody does it kind of model what happened uh recently this last decade with beer craft beer and you know your big domestic beer is there gonna be a commercial side of cannabis and then also room for the craft cultivator um that's really focused on small quality good stuff um that's gonna be competing against you know price and volume from some of these giants that's a great question the beer model is one that is perfect to use as an analogy um i think myself a lot of these major cannabis companies are swooping up a lot of the smaller ones there's a lot of conglomeration that's going on in the industry obviously when you kind of grow as a company or you want to expand you either need additional growth space which requires additional licensing so a lot of the small guys or the guys that were in quickly did some decent growing started as a startup and made it to mid-sized company those are ideal acquisition targets for the big boys so i think what's going to happen at least the next three four years is that all the big boys are going to start to swoop up a lot of the smaller guys that's where you emerge the budweiser the coors light all the the general high volume lower quality lower price type products from that will come the grassroots movement again so i think everything is going to kind of go underground for a little while and all these craft companies in maybe three four years will start to emerge when people really care about quality and it's not so much about bottom dollar anymore yeah we have a huge canadian client that we love working with when we first started with them they had a huge huge initiative and focus on innovation it was 2018 they had an opportunity to really try and control the market with an innovative awesome product uh cost was no object they said [ __ ] it we want the coolest best highest quality product that we can provide and it worked out great for them they quickly jumped into one of the leaders positions in the industry in canada and everything was was great it towards the end of 2019 and then with uh early covid uh early 2020 uh their share price fell dramatically they were you know their balance sheets showed that they were just outlaying cash left and right for the innovation without necessarily realizing that when you spend so much on innovation it takes a long time for it to come back right roi on innovation is a year year and a half process minimum for us for example you know we started designing jpeg trio in 2018 it didn't get launched until you know mid 2019 it took 12 16 months 18 months to get the product out there so with this cannabis company even though they were so amazingly focused on innovation for the first part once legalization happened now they realize that it's all about bottom dollar and how do we reduce cost of goods so now instead of trying to produce flowers that may be tastier but take an extra two weeks now they're producing lower quality genetics that harvest faster that they can just turn around and sell and cheaper packaging and i think that's now the start of where you see the the budweiser and the the coors lights versus like uh you know a small batch brewing company really focused on delivering a delicious tasty product i mean one has consistency one has flavor yup but you know which would you prefer to drink budweiser or the the local craft beer pretty easy decision in my opinion yeah well for me too it's a time and place thing sometimes uh you know being from minnesota and uh going up to the cabin a busch light just kind of brings you back you know i love those you mean can't hate on that i'm a big coors guy i went to school in colorado spent a few years in co i love course especially like any tailgate absolutely but then you know you're trying to drink 16 18 beers potentially and really have yourself an afternoon that's not so much the case when you're drinking something that's a little bit tastier and perhaps next to a steak and maybe you're gonna have one or two very different days though the pairing is everything bingo and the season two i'm a big seasoned guy when it comes to those things absolutely you brought up uh i don't know how much time we have here ramsay um but you brought up uh kovid um how do you think that's been um impacting i guess pros and cons um your guys customers people you've been working with um you know if i can touch briefly i can just say what i've noticed is um i think a lot of these quality things sops standard practices best practices a lot of these procedural things are starting to really get drilled into um on paper and people are starting to like really figure their their [ __ ] out um and that's i think making a little bit extra room for products and services that focus on true value-add and um you know roi that you know we can bovada specifically too can can really tell you hey your flower your inventory your entire inventory weighs this today um and here's the percent moisture content um if you added two percent moisture content to that entire inventory here's the literal change in fair market value of your inventory i think those things now it's not it's not everything's not moving so fast where it's hey package it get it you know it doesn't matter if it cures on the shelf whatever we just we got to get it in stores because we don't have any and people are buying it anyway um i think covid kind of or the lockdown specifically um kind of help people really look at their what they're doing their day-to-day operations and where they can make changes have you guys noticed that too absolutely it gave you know business operators a chance to sit back and not be surrounded by the buzz of a hopping office and they actually had a few moments to think about like hey what can we do better what can we do to improve like our everything our process is top to bottom from growing the production of packaging to sales yeah um what's interesting is that you know this is what makes me happy is that a lot of the country deemed cannabis in a central industry um okay would you ever have been able to imagine that 10 years ago probably not i mean even back in 2014 but government said hey people need cannabis especially in california and all the cannabis companies stayed open so i think having those cannabis restrictions that got imposed on everybody required all these business operators to really sit back and understand how can we do things more efficiently because [ __ ] i used to run my growing operation with 40 people well now i can only have 15 in the building so how are we still going to manage the same output but with less than half of the labor staff forces you to sit back and really think about what you're doing and if you guys are cutting short you know corners trying to take a shortcut when that's not necessarily the best thing to do or neces or even necessary you know small little changes in process like adding a movita pack into your curing box can potentially generate an extra 300 000 a year for a mid-sized cannabis company it's substantial and that tiny little you know how much could that really end up costing you a couple thousand dollars over the course of a year when you can end up you know that can let you back a couple hundred thousand so a lot of these guys with cannabis you just you've been running and like you you ever try and get on a treadmill when it's set at 10 you there's no warm-up time you just have to get down and start sprinting yeah college a couple times yeah i'm not sure if those ended well but that's that's what working in a cannabis company is like the moment that your product goes out the door for the first time it's off to the races you have now an endless uh endless demand for your product and you have to continuously handle that that with good supply um and they don't haven't had a lot of time to think about it as soon as they got on that treadmill it's just off to the races full sprint covent gave them a chance to sit back take a second step off the treadmill and try and figure out what they should actually be doing yeah i completely agree um definitely notice that as well on our end um all right cody uh what's next for paccase great question we have a couple cool new packaging products coming out but that's not really what what tickles me i get very excited about the consumer market i love bringing products to people that will actually use it so we have a really awesome new case that should be launching the next five six months uh think jpac an iphone had a baby that's about all i can touch on it yeah well that's uh that's intriguing um because i think i think i know where that's going um don't wanna don't want to speculate too much but um and where can you pick these up so i know you said amazon um i know you guys have uh point of purchase displays too so i'm assuming that it's this is getting into more mass retail absolutely yeah we uh we sell in a couple different places you can go out and check uh jpac products out on amazon number one uh our shopping website packcase.com i'm sorry packcase.shop you can get there from packcase.com as well um and now they're we're starting to be available in retailers so there's a whole bunch of distributors starting to pick these up so you should start seeing them in retail stores over the next few months and if you're a retailer and interested in picking up our products we have a wonderful wholesale section on paccase.shop so make sure to stop there put in a little vendor request and we'll make sure to get to you so you guys can start selling pack cases yourself cool cool yeah same thing for boveda um we're on amazon we're in the retail stores uh we have a direct site businesses we have a wholesale site too um yeah you guys go out there up your pre-roll game if you get it in a cardboard box and it's uh they're dry grab yourself a pack case throw above it in there let it sit for 24 hours your experience will be completely different than smoking a dry pre-roll nobody wants to do that anymore so let's change that [Music] you", "zYQRh70yPi4": "hey everyone it's tech crazy today's video is going to be review for one of the top streams for 2021 harley quinn um hopefully you can see it it's uh i have a hard time saying their name tantalus tantalus the 420 already and uh it's like uh i think it's half cb it's actually more cbd than uh thc 4.2 thc and cbd 7.9 it's probably a lot more than that um so let's go ahead and open it up together it's still sealed i haven't opened it it's got a lot of tape on this one try to take this off now i heard this is one of the top uh ones for 2021 i've made a video on it as well um i get my i get my stats like that um overall from the internet i don't just look at one side either i look at like hundreds of sites and i come up with popular by demand you know like everyone's saying this one this one this one and you got five of them saying that and three saying the other ones so i'd go with the five one but harley quinn is definitely a top one it smells really good it smells like lemony it smells lemony lemony that many danky uh what does it smell like to you it's got a lemony kind of peppery too lemon peppery which is a kind of a favorite uh smell and taste now in daisy as you can see this is another big joint as you can see these are definitely over half a gram these are probably 0.7.8 let's go ahead and light it up this was a three pack i got it was i think around 15 bucks totally worth it i was actually really happy to get for that price it's kind of smooth you can really taste the lemon on your tongue it already comes in three rolls see interesting yeah and it only comes from three holes these ones but like i said this is a new one one to two thc cbd so for every thc it has two parts cbd so it's double cbd for the thc some some of them are like one two one this is a one two two more cbd than thc but still tc mix of colombian thai and nepali i can really taste the sweet aftertaste when i blow it out it gets even sweeter so taste is really nice it's not like you getting any citrus that's what's supposed to be yeah i'm getting a big-time citrus on the back of my tongue i'm supposed to have a little hint of cherry too know that's probably the sweetness i'm getting the sweetness again on my tongue you taste like a cherry it's almost like a resin cherry taste at the end of it i can tell you right now this could be a very clean head height yeah this is probably a good daytime smoke sativa right yeah actually i don't know if this one says teeth i'm pretty sure it is though even if it's a hybrid it's probably gonna be some tv dominant because all the parents trains on extra times i think it might be like a 60 i have it online the information for this strain already on the details and the information page so if you want to know everything about this strain make sure you check out my marijuana stream details and pictures uh harley quinn because 75 sativa 75 percent heavy they'll be all the information you need even how to grow it on that video um it's not bad now i i think i got about two two and a half grams from the pre-rolls i think they're a little bit bigger at all it was like 15 or 18 dollars nice size joints enough for two people for sure all day long sure i'll probably have a hard time finishing one by myself but smooth smoke though it's not not harsh at all very smooth overall i think flavor 1.2 and pricing maybe i'm gonna give it a five if you're looking for a nice clean seat uh cbd buzz this buzz is really clean um i think i don't feel it in my head at all i feel very even keel yeah yeah i could go in a meeting right now talk with 100 people and i'd be fine everybody's relaxed today for the price i'm gonna give this one i'm gonna give this one harley quinn it's very clean it's very tasty we're not coughing at all it's very smooth i'm going to give it a 4.6 compared to other strains come on i got four or four my friends give me the four four i want to give them four four because i went with 4.6 because it's a new 20 21 straight um it's only in pre-rolls and the price was very low and the quality was exceptional very very good quality for the price um i feel relaxed my body feels relaxed so i imagine it's just one of those ones that's not very maybe not very motivating it might not make you energetic but it just relaxes your body and if you've got stuff to do you should have a hard time doing it you should be able to get it done so yeah overall i'm gonna give the harry quinn by tennelis 4.4 my friend gave it a 4.2 um it's just lacking a little bit of flavor i think um the buzz is super clean though and the smoke was very clean but the flavor needs more flavor needs more terpenes if i had a little more terpenes and a tsu a little bit higher i would go higher with the squirrel i think for the price you can't go wrong i think a lot of these companies are not flushing their plants and if they did they would have a much better flavor it would be a lot more of a lemony citrusy i'm still getting those cherries that that cherry is there but it's very light you can taste it yeah you can still taste it it's still there you can taste the resin but you've had strains before where like you would like it would hit you like more funnily i bet you they didn't flush these plants was missing and that's probably why the price is so low too it was you know what if it was properly properly flushed you would probably be paying like 50 maybe even double the price it resonates would be like seven eight nine dollars it resonated pretty good um it burned really well we didn't have any problems with it it burned very well yeah all right so um i'm going with 4.4 my friend went 4.2 so overall it's a 4.3 if i have another person i'm just gonna start putting in the middle of the of the rating so that way you know we're all ready i'm going 4.3 overall so thanks uh

cone filler this relatively new product was created by raw with the intention of easing and expediting the process of packing raw pre-rolled cones they come in both king-size and 101 quarter to fit every smokers needs let's go ahead and take a look at what this ingenious new packing tool has to offer attach the raw cone filler itself you'll also find a bamboo packing stick as well as an additional packing tool which detaches from the bottom of the cone filler to make it easier to pack the trench an extra mouth tip for the filler and a short instruction manual are also included will take you step-by-step to show you how these nifty tools will come in handy when filling your pre-rolled cones now that you've unpacked all of your cool new tools you're going to want to take your ground up over tobacco and begin filling the top of the filler with it then using the packing tool that comes attached to the bottom of the cone filler pack down the herb into the trough until you can securely closed the filler then you're going to take your pre-rolled cone and slip it onto the mouth tip of the cone filler being careful not to wrinkle the paper now close the top of the filler ensuring it grasps onto the tip of the cone then at a slow and steady pace slide the top part all the way forward then all the way back to its original position being cautious not to detach the cone as you go some users like to partially slide the top back and forth a second time to pack it further while others use the bamboo packing stick to slide the rest of it through the mouth tip and into the cone as always pack your herb further down into the pre-rolled cone using your bamboo packing stick to ensure your cone is packed evenly throughout finally twist off the top of the cone and there you have it a perfectly packed pre-rolled raw cone despite the fact that Rob's a great care when creating this innovative and effective product we have run into a few minor issues with it and have received several complaints from customers regarding them personally the biggest issue we've come to find is that the cone filler will oftentimes leave a partially unpacked space near the filter tip causing the cone to be flimsy our solution to this has been to pre pack the cone slightly before using the cone filler in order to avoid cos the complaint which we have received them most from our customers however is that the pre-rolled cones will at times not fit onto the mouth tip of the cone loader unfortunately this issue has been addressed by Josh himself the founder of raw rolling papers as he has stated that because of the fact that free rolled cones are all hand rolled there will always be instances where they will not fit perfectly onto the comb through it in any case the product itself is still quite effective and convenient as it makes the process of packing pre-rolled cones ten times faster and simpler thanks for watching our video we'll continue to release videos every

we will catch up on the gorilla skittles grow making this episode 3 in the grow series it's been a while since the last video in this series so if you want to see episode 2 i'll link that in the top right corner for you to check out we left off installing scrognet at day 65 from seed these two gorilla skittles were very slow growers compared to my other strains i have going on in other grow tents we switched the plants into the flower cycle which is 12 hours on and 12 hours off for the lights i started feeding the flower nutrient mix on the green planet gp3 feeding chart since the flip to flower the gorilla skittle plants really took off of growth filling out the mars hydro 2x4 growth tent completely you can see how happy and healthy the plants are by the leaves reaching up also known as praying we then install the second layer of trellis netting about eight to ten inches above the first layer which provides the plants with support later in flower when they start to put on weight and will want to lean over we now have channel merch available on the website if you want some quality clothing while showing the channel a little extra support since cannabis channels can't monetize the majority of the content on youtube your support really goes a long way in allowing the channel to improve [Music] [Music] the two gorilla skittle plants are now day 25 of flower and can really use a cleanup you can see how little amount of light penetration to the center and bottoms of the plant there are usually i would have liked to get this completed around day 20 but i've been working on a few projects for the channel in the background which is another reason the grow videos on the channel have been a little bit more spread out than usual if you want a more up-to-date view on what's going on with the channel and me head over to instagram and give me a follow at terpehize i also went over the defoliation process in the last video so i won't go into too much detail about it in this video if you want a full explanation about it and why i do this i'll link that video in the top right corner if you want to check that out [Music] i work my way across the tent pulling off most of the large fan leaves may look a little aggressive but everything grows back over the next week or two also do a light lollipopping at this time to remove everything below the first layer of trellis netting after completing these steps you should notice light penetration through the plant lighting up the ground around the pot a little bit by seeing the light penetration it also shows you that there will be adequate air flow throughout the entire tent and plants airflow is the key to reducing mold and bug issues [Music] if you're new to the channel i upload videos every week covering indoor

to be talking to you today about the five things that you need to know about CBD [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so the first thing that we want to talk about number one what a CBD and is it legal we all know the medicinal benefits of cannabis the main two components in cannabis the main two cannabinoids are THC and CBD CBD is a way to get all the health benefits and the medicinal properties of cannabis without having to sacrifice your your your cognitive state in a way that might you know hamper your work ability CBD actually has most of the same medicinal benefits of THC but just without the high and it's the medicinal stuff that is in a more concentrated form yes like you're not getting as much CBD yeah from traditional okay yes smoke so you got cannabis and you got him so cannabis is actually very strong very concentrated in THC a very low concentration of CBD industrial hemp is actually very high in CBD but very very low if not anything of THC so actually a lot of the CBD comes from industrial hemp it actually doesn't come from cannabis lucky for us and lucky for a lot of people that are that need the medicinal benefits of cannabis while CBD legality can vary from state to state CBD is not only legal in Missouri but it's also legal on a federal level they actually just passed a new farm bill that was an update from the 2014 farm bill completely removed it from the controlled substance act is it legal yes however do be smart about it this stuff especially our flour and our pre-rolled items do look a lot like the quote unquote real deal so I recommend that the customers leave that in the package until they arrive at their home if it does feel a little disjointed yeah studies have shown that CBD reduces pain inflammation anxiety depression migraines seizures IBS psychosis and mental disorders and nausea so thirdly how is CBD take it you have sublingual sublinguals are a quick way to get in your bloodstream usually just drops under the tongue topicals creams balms there's even patches that are great for muscle and joint pain then you have your pills pill form is great capsules really quick and easy way no hassle no frills way to take CBD then you have your edibles edibles are delicious there's all different kinds of edibles vape available form of CBD can be great for somebody who's already using an e-cig or already has a vaporizer that they're using on a daily basis and when it comes to flower we have the jars of loose flour we have the roll-your-own kit that has the filters and papers included and then we have the pre-roll we have regular pre-roll and then we actually have a Keith and honey rolled pre-roll concentrates concentrates include wax shatter crumble any sort of concentrated CBD isolates and CD is also pet safe there are specific products designed just for pets you could also take a sublingual that's meant for human consumption and give that in small doses to your pet either through their water or in their food meow the fourth thing is how much CBD do I take we always recommend in your starting dose you should usually start about 25 to 50 milligrams and then kind of go from there start a little smaller work your way up and just see what works for you it's not uncommon for people to take upwards of a hundred to two hundred you can't really overdose on CBD so take it you know if you want to start at a hundred start at one hundred if you think that's what you're gonna need one good thing to know if you are using any kind of sublinguals or anything like that with the dropper most droppers are one mill per dropper so you can figure out hey I've got a 30ml bottle it's got a thousand milligram of CBD and you just divide that a thousand by 30 mils and that's basically how much each dropper will be so the fifth and final thing that we're going to talk about will I pass my drug test with CBD yes you will however some CBD products do have trace amounts of THC in them the legal limit for CBD products is 0.3 percent or less THC a lot of the products that we carry are 100% CBD pure CBD or isolates isolated zvt if it says full spectrum that's where you get into that gray area where yeah I'd include something like that and the flower and and yes again it's very trace amounts but if you are using CBD on a regular basis at all I would recommend sticking with isolates and pure CBD and stay away from the flowers and the multi spectrums in the full spectrums now quality is a huge factor know where you're getting your stuff from know where your shops getting their stuff from if you're into CBD at all you know the names like green rose and fresh leaf and summit stuff like that that's what we carry so it's all lab tested most products aren't only just lab tested they're double and triple lab tested and keep in mind even if you're at the point three percent you're not gonna get high from it on the other hand if you're not getting drug tested the multi spectrums are fantastic they have what they call an entourage effect because you're getting all those camp cannabinoids to work together all that synergistic stuff going on aside just all they say all the harder right pretty role in the flower stuff it's some of the best stuff for anxiety and insomnia sleep disorder sleep IDI is an excellent way to go for for anxiety alright guys thank you so much for watching I am Steve this is

the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system so click here to watch it and let us know what you think as we continue to evolve this new idea", "9at3Iiw5VPs": "[Music] hello and welcome to the north coast journal preview where we take a look at the stories being followed in the upcoming edition of the north coast journal i'm your host dave frank and i'm joined by north coast journal's news editor thad greenson and arts and features editor jennifer from mikko cahill welcome guys david how are you doing right on doing well a little sunshine out there today and got some good news friends family news about more vaccines in the pipeline so i think people are starting to look towards that fourth of july weekend as a potentially uh you know fulfilling and rewarding date on the calendar where we might actually have some degree of normalcy so hopefully that's permeating your guys lives as well fingers crossed yeah stay optimistic right as best we can do um so that let's dive right in what's going on on the cover this week of the north coast journal well this week is our annual cannabis issue so um it is about all things uh all all things cannabis news um recently um but occupying the actual cover space of the paper is a story um following up on some reporting we did a couple years ago about the roanoke park public safety department to the police department at roener park and um some cannabis interdiction activities they'd been doing that became raised a lot of questions from the article it looks like there's been a federal indictment handed down on one of the local police departments in the 101 corridor can you tell us a little bit about the background on that and kind of what brought us to this point yeah so two two officers have been indicted in the case so far um and their indictments were unsealed friday um and so that's a lot of the documentation was was the actual charging document that we built the story on but the story takes root back in um in december of 2017 when a man by the name of zeke flatton actually a movie producer was looking to dabble in the cannabis industry visited humboldt county bought three pounds of cannabis and was transporting it south to a lab in the bay area for testing when he claimed that he was pulled over by an unmarked suv and by two officers who were wearing kind of tactical gear but no badges no name no name tags no patches kind of affiliating them with a specific agency they identified themselves as being with the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms and um asked if he was carrying cannabis he said he was asked to search the vehicle found the three pounds and basically said we're taking these you can expect to receive a letter from washington dc and we're going to go now um and zeke flatten is is a former cop himself um and um and a really sharp guy i mean just from interviewing him he's one of these people who has a pretty meticulous memory and an eye for detail and he said that it just didn't feel right um something felt really off about the stop he noticed that the officers never ran he gave them his license but they never ran his name um back to dispatch to see if you know there was any warrants or anything out for him didn't seem to run the license plate of his car um and didn't give him a receipt for the seizure of his cannabis um and so he said pretty quickly he came to feel that he was robbed he also noticed that while they said they were from a federal federal agency the car that they were driving had california exempt license plates which didn't line up again he's a pretty sharp guy who picks up on these details and so um he pretty quickly came to feel that he'd been robbed by what he figured were actual law enforcement officers but out acting outside the scope of their duties so he made a complaint to the fbi um and to the mendocino county sheriff's office because the traffic stop happened in mendocino um and that's kind of what got this ball rolling that now um you know two pl two and almost two and a half years later has resulted in these indictments almost three and a half years later so one of the things that he said was that um it wasn't the actual loss of value um that really triggered this it was his thoughts about something bigger must have been going on if this is how he was getting treated that maybe other people were getting treated the same way so you said he reached out to federal um law enforcement but there were he also reached out to local media is that right and kind of what element did local media play in bringing the story you know the momentum that built around this original complaint yeah it played a huge role and certainly zeke zeke flattened feels like it was it was crucial that it was really the tipping point um but i guess to your first point yeah he said that he really felt like um it wasn't the loss of three thousand dollars worth of weed it was the the violation and as somebody who'd been a police officer previously i mean he kind of understood that oath of office and he also just started wondering like if these guys are so brazen that they are going to impersonate federal officers outside of their jurisdiction and stop me in broad daylight and steal my weed like what else are they doing and who else are they doing this type of thing too um so worry you know he said that he made the complaint to the fbi and felt like it was initially kind of taken seriously or whatever but he was worried that it would just kind of die quietly that it would make it from kind of the the the main fbi office to the field office and then just kind of be quietly go away and so he decided um i think about a month after making the complaint to contact kim kemp a reporter based in southern humboldt and um to her credit she she took it very seriously um and um and started you know vetting his story and making calls and one of the last calls that she made before kind of going public with his allegations um was a call to the to atf just saying hey did you have officers in the field this day in this area and were you involved in this traffic stop and um while some of the other agencies had kind of been um i'd say a little bit evasive or a little bit squirrely or not really you know didn't seem terribly interested in her inquiries um atf did and atf i think seems like really kind of its ears perked up but the the idea that somebody might be out there impersonating its officers and so not only did they they give a statement to kim but they also um immediately kind of reached out to zeke and asked if they could contact zlatan and i think he said that they were on the phone with him within an hour of kim contacting them um and then come to find out they then exerted some pressure it sounds like on the fbi and on local agencies to kind of saying hey this is something that needs to be taken um seriously and and zeke really believes that that you know kim's inquiry and her subsequent reporting really got this ball rolling um and after she reported i think one or two stories on um on zeke's allegations um the um the lead roner park officer um who's been indicted uh or former officer uh jc tatum who headed the the roanoke park interdiction team um took a really kind of interesting step of issuing a press release kind of in response to kim's coverage trying to explain away zeke's allegations um and um the fbi the f the indictment certainly says that this was a fraudulent press release in a fraudulent police report designed to kind of cover his tracks um that's the allegation anyway um but there were some things that just didn't match up about the press release and from just a journalist who's seen gobs and gobs of law enforcement press release releases it just was strange it didn't have an exact date it didn't have an exact time it didn't identify the kind of car zeke was driving it didn't name him you know didn't have his name in the press release didn't identify a quantity of marijuana seized it was just it was atypical and i think a lot of people noticed that and then it brought a new attention to this case so the uh the charges are cons for two officers tatum and huffaker are conspiracy to commit extortion under the color of official rights and then officer tatum former officer tatum also faces additional charges of falsifying records in a federal investigation in order to cover up alleged theft right so what and then also a charge of tax evasion as well oh right exactly yeah like uh al capone the tax man will always get you um so you know what kind of transpired in this investigation um that that you know what are some of the elements of the story that kind of sent out to you like that you said he was the head of a of a interdiction task force yeah and so yeah what what are some of the details that kind of stand out in terms of the 101 court or interdiction team so i think there's three things i'd want to hit on there the first it was actually not in in the indictment but was uncovered by kqed in an investigation it did after kim kemp's initial reporting in this um and they requested gobs and gobs of records from from roanoke park and and they found two things that were kind of interesting one is that roanoke park was kind of nationally awarded for its interdiction efforts at the time um for just the amount of the quantities of cannabis it was seizing and the amounts of cash it was seizing this was from a law enforcement perspective an enormously effective interdiction team um headed by tatum and then um they found that um basically when when a law enforcement agency seizes say 50 pounds of cannabis it's kind of impractical to expect them that they're just going to hold all that as evidence until the case goes to trial and so what they do in these large drug seizure cases is they hold on to a sample of it but then they destroy the rest and there's a really meticulous process they have to follow to do this of getting a court um destruction order and then they're supposed to you know um transfer the the drugs to a specific officer who's then um uh kind of ordered to destroy them in a very specific way and then document it with a destruction um with destruction documentation and so what kqed found is that for at least 800 pounds of cannabis over like a two-year period rohnert park was unable to actually show documentation that it was destroyed they had court orders telling um the department to destroy it and they had documentation that it had been handed off to jc tatum the sergeant in control of such things but there was no actual you know proof that it had been destroyed so that raised a lot of questions um then in the um in the indictment itself um federal agents um reviewed lots of body camera footage from the roanoke park police department and they were able to document numerous cases i think they identified five or six of them in the actual indictment itself but where officers seized cannabis or cash from drivers i think tatum was involved in all these traffic stops and did not provide them with any documentation did not provide for them with a seizure receipt and then also um for which the agents were unable to find any other documentation of this traffic stop so within roanoke park police records it was as if the stop had never happened it never existed there's no police report attached to it or anything like that um but they have this footage of them actually taking custody of cannabis from people um so that raised a lot of questions and then the last aspect is just the irs investigation um the irs did what seems like a pretty exhaustive investigation over several years of um officer sergeant tatum's um financial records and what they claim to have found is um hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash deposits um into his bank his and his wife's bank accounts and family members bank accounts um all of them in sums less than ten thousand dollars which and if you over if you deposit over ten thousand dollars in cash the bank is required to report that to the irs and so the they're alleging that this is very much a pattern of somebody trying to conceal illicit profits um and so all of these three things together i think really raised questions about the scope of what was happening in roanoke park um over this time period and um while the indictment is really related to two specific traffic stops in december um and um and then for um you know for sergeant tatum the um you know the tax evasion and the attempt to cover up as well i think the um other information indictment really kind of leads one to believe there might be other shoes to drop and there might be other actions coming gotcha well there's so much more in the article um hopefully people check it out thank you for sharing uh your insights on this with us um i know these officers are facing a lot of time and and it you know we'll see how it plays out and we'll see how you know i'm sure you guys will follow it down its uh path um yeah so what one other thing i wanted to ask you about um there today actually breaking news uh happy st patrick's day there's breaking news in the sacramento bee about the eureka police department a few officers communications can you tell us real briefly a little bit about that breaking story yeah real briefly um a reporter for the sacramento bee um obtained from from an unnamed source um screenshots of group text chats with six epd officers that include um just lots of very vile things uh misogynistic and um really dehumanizing language um directed at uh people that um that these officers were in charge of protecting and serving so it really raises a lot of pretty alarming questions absolutely something that we at the journal are following up on as we speak and we'll continue to do so and hopefully uh bring more of that to light well fantastic thank you yeah that's available online like like north coast journal sacramento b's also online check it out um how about you jennifer what's going on this week on the arts and features beat with you you know so for our cannabis issue um i you know i had wanted to include something about you know people infusing foods with cannabis for a while but i'm not sure if you're familiar with jessica ashley silva if you um she's written for us before she covered the guy fieri barbecue contest at the fair the sweaty meat fest i believe she called it and um i i saw that she had posted a while ago a fail and you know i love a food fail but this was an infusion fail and so i asked her to jump in and write about it and also i want to say that i feel partly responsible for this fail um i asked jessica to write about a cannabis pairing dinner which was a virtual event usually you know cannabis dinners you go and you get a whole infused multi-course meal that i don't know how you get home from but um you know when people do these really fancy-schmancy meals infused with cannabis but this was a virtual one given our times and so she cooked at home along with a chef who was you know using fancy oils and swirling things on dishes and it was you know very very fancy and it it gave her a sense of maybe hubris and so she and some friends dove into some cannabis cooking and everything was going great and then she had this very cheesy burger that was so great on this some sort of infused burger thing and then she was like why don't i just make some infused cheese and she made this attempt and to her credit she made a really beautifully formed three fresh mozzarella balls and um you know they look great if you look at it in black and white if you look at it in color and she wrote about the you know the the hubris the fall the tragic outcome of trying to infuse it because it came out sort of the color of silly putty sort of a brown gray unpleasant and um when she described trying it she was like you don't taste brown please don't taste brown please and it tasted so brown it tasted as she she describes it as tasting like dirt hay and dead plants yeah and then of course you know like a good you know growth raised in the right family she tried not to throw out food and she tried to apply it to a pizza with a lot of garlicky pesto and hope no no nothing nothing could cover the taste of of swamp from that mozzarella but um you know she talks about sort of the basics of of how you infuse food and um it was a learning experience for me to read about um but also i really like her attitude um uh if you're if you're in humble foodies you know her it was one of the admins and um she's very funny and even honestly i always enjoy when she you know blocks someone or kicks them off of the side it's always great fun but she talks about the value of food fails and most of the time on something like humble foodies we're sharing you know our successes look at this amazing rack of lamb i made look at this fantastic fettuccine i made and people don't really share like oh jesus what did i do to this poor piece of meat but here she is and she was saying that she learned something which is that okay mistakes were made and here's what she could do instead next time like maybe a flavorless uh instead of working directly from flour maybe she could use you know a flavorless extract would be better next time or you know maybe mozzarella is meant to just be a mozzarella right it has that cure maybe we infuse other things um but she you know she took it as a learning experience and she also was like well you know what i did figure out how to make some cheese so hopefully she'll be back to do that again but um yeah if you've if you've ever tried failed or tried to smile through someone else's failed infusion meal i strongly recommend it i mean the only thing that i forgot to ask her is if it's i mean i would imagine that the thc quality was still there but despite that i think um despite the effects of cannabis it didn't make her enjoy it anymore which is too bad that's yeah which you know i i get the boost of um the boost of enjoyment that people get from you know having cannabis infused foods i i totally get the draw if it's a tenth of what i experienced when i was pregnant then i don't know why everyone's not eating cannabis infused food all the time but other than having to drive um but yeah it's a fun read and you should definitely check it out and definitely not do what she did that is amazing yeah so it sounds like mozzarella should be left as mozzarella you don't need to infuse it it's kind of i mean isn't there already a high to cheese isn't cheese its own drug so it takes more and more yeah speaking of uh own drug um you did a satirical piece maybe not so satirical uh cannabis strains we need in 2021 and wish were real tell us a little bit about that because that is hysterical i'm gonna say it's only barely satirical because um so i've done this for a few years in a row and i have had a couple of people who were like so i don't understand where can you buy these yes actually there isn't one that makes you feel like a disney princess that's not real i made it up um what i what i like to do is go through and look at real strains and look at their descriptions and how they describe the crosses and whatnot and look at some of the really hilarious names that they have and i must say that one of the challenges is coming up with names that aren't already strains so you know when i was looking up like there's a there's a strain that um a fake string that is for people who are really upset about dr seuss you know if you're like really upset about it which relax relax what happened on mulberries or what was it i can't what i saw on mulberry street i have a copy it's not great it's no cat in the hat but people are so upset about not making more of them you know the ones that are out there are out there but people are so upset about and i thought well i should have a strain that helps people cope with that stress and i looked up and i could not believe there isn't already a strain called who hash [Music] but evidently an opportunity missed um and there are a few other ones that are some of them that are meant to help you through the stress of the pandemic like darth vaxxer which is sort you know sort of my little tribute to thaad who is a very big star wars fan as you can see from his background um and uh legion of zoom which is meant to help you feel more more like you're really in the room with people when you're even on screen um which i personally don't want [Laughter] but some people might you know it can be very draining having all your interactions remotely she says as she's having a skype conversation with someone that she used to sit in a studio with truth but it's fun to do so there's one um q-tips which i think was really funny about q and on and there's some other contemporary uh references but others are just more like um you know broadly uh appealing i suppose like tell us about sofa cushion uh sofa cushion is for when you just need to ride out the rest of the pandemic just keeping it mellow you know a lot of people have tried to be really productive during this and personally i feel that's a mistake it's been you know it's been so emotionally and mentally taxing for us to go through the ups and downs and the sort of national grief and personal grief and all those things and yet we have all these things telling us you need to hustle you need to be working on your side gig you need to be and some of that is survival financially but some of it is just the social pressure of always be productive always be doing something and so this particular strain allows you to just uh what do i have that it's it's um a couple of indica strains inertia and lazy boy to help you sink deeper and deeper into your couch until you become one with it which you know let me help you with that tap into your inner fauchy one kenobi yes somebody feel free if people want to make these strains um you know just send me a small fee and we'll be good yeah you got to trademark that stuff well right on there's a lot more in that article definitely folks check it out that's just about going to do it for us this week it flies by unfortunately uh north coast journal

comment down below anything all right deuces you", "RyZavBlIjEs": "[Music] hello everyone it's me the cannabis reviewer i'm back for another exciting week of grow today happens to be thursday march 18th 2021 welcome to my 2020 2021 winter growing season i'm growing cream caramel and orange sherbet cannabis plants they're in their first day of the fifth week of their flowering stage but we're not here to show you the plants today we're here because i'm excited to tell you that i am adding supplemental lighting to my grow for the first time i'm loving it i'm adding supplemental lighting what's supplemental lighting mean well supplemental lighting basically is additional lighting that is designed specifically to help achieve a certain goal right and what my goal is is big ass buds right so i've been scouring the internet looking at trying to figure out additional lighting um you know i've asked people to comment and um eventually i think i'm going to make my own led lights because i i can do it it's just a matter of uh figuring out what i want to use but uh do i go with cree do i go with uh you know um a samsung lm 301bs do i go with um ozram there's a there's a few others out there that are have actually really good led sources but for now because i really want to do it right and take my time design the schematic get the circuit board designed do all of that right that's going to be a more of a long term project so in the short term how do i quickly add for not a lot of money how do i add supplemental lighting to my grow and as i told you i'm in the fifth week first day fifth week of flowers so it's all about producing buds at this point and stage of the game well luckily for me i found this company called rapid led and they're basically you know right after my own heart when it comes to this to be honest because that's they're all about diy and building your own now i'm taking it to the next level they pre-give you the lights and all that and you assemble it all i'm actually going to design my own light i am going to use a meanwhile driver and you know what i'm saying but the other i can do no problem but so let's get off that so we're going to add supplemental lighting so i've been looking at lights and what's cheap and what can i get because i don't want to spend a lot of money just yet because once again i don't you know at some point i'd rather spend that money on my own light but for now i want to try to increase my bud and i need to increase the par level because right now the par level sits around 500 par 550 maybe six if you're right in the center and also the light distribution of these lights they're good but i'm going to show you exactly what i'm doing and you'll understand why i think adding these extra supplemental lighting will be good so you might be asking yourself well what am i gonna be adding i'm adding this photo red boost puck by rapid led thirty dollars now i got mine from the big box store on the internet you know who you are uh and i didn't get them from here because i i was able to get a package deal but they sell them so it's all good but what makes this unique is six hundred and six hundred nanometer light to increase boost yields okay and so i got already already bought the power the power supply that i got come with it and it uses a 600 nanometer light and what it uses actually is these cree they're called cree there's four of them here there's the cree leds and these cree leds xp g3s they're called um if you actually go to the led itself i know i'm getting kind of nerdy on y'all but if you actually go to the wavelength you can see how tight so if we look here photo red s line photo red standard and we've probably got the standard one but nevertheless look how tight that curve is so you are definitely getting a directed source of light and so i'm definitely excited about that these are 7 watt bulbs or 7 watt leds bulbs i shouldn't even say bulbs they're 7 watt leds and i've been trying to figure out a way ways to mount them to my light and have them work but before we do that let's kind of do an unboxing a little bit show you what they look like for real and this is how i got it i have opened it i have checked it to make sure it works and all that i admit i was excited i got it i got the second one's coming later today but i want to go ahead and get everything ready and set up so when that second one comes i can just mount it real quick and go and besides this might as well get the light in there and get it working for now anyway so we're gonna use this rapid led and in the box you get a couple of things and i as i said i bought this from the great box store in the sky and uh but you can get it at a rapid led if you'd like or wherever there's plenty of places that sell it turns out so the first thing you get which is interesting as hell is this little puck this little puck right here is first thing you get another so you know you're looking at that you're going damn that ain't very big right it may not be very big but it is very bright and that is why we got it because it is very bright and uh i can zoom out focal length proper and all that good um what makes it nice is that it's so small and light that it's going to be super easy for me to mount i'm looking forward to that hard to see that close i know i got short arms so how are we going to do this well let me show you what else we got also in this kit that i got was the power supply and a lens and one thing i will say i was disappointed with about this though is this is a spot lens for the leds the spot lens and one of the things i was disappointed about with it is that it doesn't stay very well so if i were actually going to have to use this i would have to try to mount it somewhere make sure i get stay in here and swatch this it will fall fairly easy it's not in there very well i'm oh and especially if i drop it of course it also is now not going to fall very easily because it's cold but when this turns on and gets warm the heat the metal heats up and this thing falls right out like that boom just falls right out but luckily for me i'm not using that but i will show you how it works and how bright this is it's impressive each watt each each uh now you gotta realize wattage doesn't mean really okay but each led seven watts i believe is how that's going to work she does get a little warm but she don't get real warm which is surprising actually no i think the whole thing's seven watts that's right these are like one and a half watt uh leds i apologize i just screwed that up but get ready guys do not look at the cam at the camera for it is about to get bright and i i tell you what i'm even gonna do i'm gonna shut off my other lights here just to give you a good understanding of how bright this bad boy is takes a couple seconds to fire up and then it goes and boy does it go holy schmoly it's bright as hell i've i've been wearing i've been wearing sunglasses look at that and okay so what does the lens do if you notice from this it's a pretty wide pat pattern or spread of light so the lens if i can get the damn thing on without blinding myself and i probably won't be able to you got to get them in those holes there we go and it probably won't stay but we'll try like i said it gets hot and the lens will just drop right the off but see now you've got a spot light and it felt see what i'm saying see what i'm saying but for me i'm not i'm not really that interested in the spot i want to spread it out wider i'd rather now you will get a hell of a high parlor reading with this spotlight but i'm not growing if i was growing a single plant then i would use this but i don't grow single plants i will save that though but it is a really bright summer gun and just to kind of show you how bright it is let's uh let's use my handy dandy par meter that i bought which i love and we'll set it down okay can you see that almost there we go so we got uh there we go we'll just do it this way we got 3.3 par get ready guys 90. so we can get that up to 80 90 par add additional so basically an additional 100 par right here depending on the height of course and where it's at least another 60 or 70 par you know 80 there's 80 right there you can't tell i guess but there's 80 right there you can't see i'm i'm all over the place problem is i gotta work around a goddamn camera and it's hard to do that and i'm short it's so bright you can't tell about it so i'm gonna get an additional you know and this and i don't even know how accurate to be honest uh the par meter is going to be for this far red here because it is further red than i don't i haven't looked at the um at the response light response i don't even know if i have that information with on this i could look it up maybe but um this par meter may not be able to reach this all the way anyway but you clearly see it's bright and it's definitely going to work just fine it does get a little warm but it isn't anything that i got to worry too much about and uh i've got a plan so that's always a good thing so uh what when we come back we'll talk about the plan and what we're gonna do with this baby and i think you're gonna love it we'll be right back this is the cannabis reviewer go get you something to drink take another head of smoke medicine of course only if you're medicated and you need to medicate or if you're in a recreational state have fun either way we'll be right back this is a cannabis reviewer okay cannabis reviewer back you know i'm sure you can probably hear my fan apologize for that but hey we are growing and they need to be fed fresh air for now for now by the way my next project is diy co2 for my box and we're not gonna go i tried it once before and i screwed it up and i realized why and i went with a yeast and sugar i'm not gonna do that this time i'm gonna go with citric acid and baking soda and tomatoes tomato paste and uh i've got get myself a cylinder and we're going to try to try to do it that way and see how that works i've also got a co2 meter coming that i'm going to hook up to my raspberry pi and be able to read out the co2 level so i know if if that shit's actually working or not so i got some some improvements and advancements coming here to my grow box in the future please keep following along with me be great so let's talk about what we're gonna do we're going to use this right here as my light holder and it doesn't make any sense right now how that's going to work but it will when i show you uh when i draw it all out and i'll show you what we're gonna use i'm gonna use they told me because i i i uh asked them how if they had any particular weight they recommend mounting mounting these lights and they actually said wire ties so i'm going to use wire ties but i am definitely going to monitor the hell out of that and make sure that they don't get too hot and if they do then i'll switch to something else i've got a magnet set up i can try to use they said you can use magnets but i worry that this has a coil in it and more than likely you know i don't want any problems with magnet any of my high strength magnets causing any issues with the power because that is the power supply for this that drives those leds and that's important uh okay so um how are we gonna do this and how's this gonna work well let's get up close and talk a little bit more about it that's what i would say and straighten you up so first of all we're going to talk about the light and then i'll show it to you as well but right now here's my thinking with the light we're going to have the light so this is my sf-1000 one of them and it's got lights that run lengthways like this for the most part and in particular it's got like right through here and maybe right through here are a set of the reds lights and then everywhere else they have whites and blues whites and blues basically that's how the lightest led light is set up from if you're looking at it from the led side so and then right here they have one ir right in the middle or not in the middle but in the middle of this one ellie right so we're going to look at it from that perspective okay so it's a rectangle as opposed to a square and the lights are more centered the red lights are more centered than they are towards the outside so my thinking is why don't we do this and we'll add those extra lights on the sides closer to the center than i actually did but on the sides so now we'll have a wider red pattern that makes it more rectangular or square than rectangular because my grill box is actually really square it's not rectangular it's two foot by two foot it's actually like 20 inches by 20 inches but it's a rectangle and these are pretty small these little things are 2 and 5 8 inches long here so they'll fit extra that those extras those two will fit in the space that i have and fill up just nicely so that's how we're gonna do it and these are so these are red as well these are the photo reds but they're reds so now you ask yourself okay let's come down here how's this gonna work how am i gonna mount this so uh this is the back side or top side and what we have here is we have two modules two boxes this one is the uh power supply led driver and this is the dimmer box and it's black and what i want to do is put these lights here and here right now we're looking at the back side so we're going to have a cord it runs this way and a cord that runs this way and then the lights will be on the other end well how we gonna attach that well that's where this comes into play because this believe it or not there is gap underneath both of these so i can take that metal wire and this is not going to work well probably because i'm just doing it by hand but i think you'll get the concept a little bit further right and then so these are the wires so it's all that so the wires that go across so it's the screen basically and then what we'll do is we'll have it like that and we'll run these we'll run the two power wires this way maybe around probably this way and up actually this way and up and go to over to the outlet and of course now that i'm adding supplemental lighting that's going to be an issue with the fact that i only have two i only have two sockets so i went and bought one of these i'll plug that into the two socket and now i've got enough for six lights so this should cover uh i've got uh two lamps and then two supplemental on one side and two supplement on the other side so this should cover the whole thing for now that's what the plan is we'll use these tools this tool to cut it we'll use the marker to mark it i'm going to use this so to give you an idea if we take this thing and we place it like this right and i take the wire tie and i run it through here except i'd run it the other way but you get the idea run it through here and then around the other side and we mount it the interesting thing about this is that without being a metal screen i don't have to worry about any issues with heat it'll just soak up that heat just fine bigger issue is not knocking over and getting this to stay in but you'll get you get the idea and then we tighten that down and i'm not in the right one one more see that's what makes this nice is you can do this until you get to the right one and then we mount that and also what makes it nice is after this gets mounted and it's turned over i will be able to bend this if i need to because if i want to angle it i can angle it a different way i can straighten it up i can do whatever i want because it's going to be basically just locked down like that and it will go through this will slide this will slide through uh both of those to the power supply and in the dimmer so that's our plan and so i'll get this ready and i'm going to cut it out line it up mount the first one slide it in there get it figured out where i want and then we'll mount when the second one comes in we'll just be able to mount it and go i'll have the first one i'll go ahead and kick the first one on so we have some light in there something's better than nothing and then i'll adjust the other side when i need to the plan that's what i mean it's cheap cheap screen i can cut it make it a little bit longer it's long too long now so just cut it down and then cut it again when i need to it's going to work just fine and i'm not really mounting it to anything it's basically just floating sitting there perfect and i just use this basically to keep this i use this i mean really technically i could tie it down with this but i don't want to have a lot of stress on this joint right here this spot it's not really good surface mount lot so we just add that a little bit just for a little bit of structural support and it should be a fine fine fine and more fine anyway we will be back show you the next step this is the cannabis reviewer i can't wait be right back i'm back so how we gonna do this right well i only have one of these and i gotta wait for the other one so i'm gonna make a mock up for the second one and that is basically i'll use one of these pieces of card uh uh not cardboard but art paper card cardboard paper we'll draw around it and that'll be close enough and then we can cut that out and we can say that they're right here we got two of those and that's basically right there with this right here there so we can take that cut it out real quick now we'll have two i'll use that as the mock-up for the second one till i get it okay so we got that now the other thing i've already done is i need to figure out somewhere i did it let's see if i can find it here it is i need to find out where to mark it at so i only need it as wide as this so if we zoom in here you can see that i've marked it with the marker so we'll cut this out all the way down um and that'll be more than enough for what i need probably don't even need that much but it's all good and then the other only other thing i'll need to do is get the length figured out and cut it and then it'll be ready so that's the next step is getting that length figured out so uh we'll put our put it on there lay it up and see what we got be right back this is the cannabis reviewer cannabis reviewer back we're about to mount this right here gonna mount that on there like that turn it around see where we're at if i can get through that hole okay now should have done it from the other side probably let's do it from the other side ah that ain't any different than where i was all right one more one more damn it damn it there we go now this in the hole turn it around come on now here we go i think we're getting somewhere in the hopefully you all can still see that that'd be it simple like i said that isn't the only thing that's going to hold it but uh that's simple now we can use this to trim that up hopefully i will keep my on that hopefully that doesn't need uh doesn't it doesn't get too hot so now we'll slide that over there and we'll mount the the wire and we'll go from there getting closer guys be right back we're back now we're mounted and of course think about it it's not going to be quite like that it's going to be more like this so i got to get the cord through here and then up to the top and out so i got to figure out where i need to put that basically i need to put a hole and run this out but i also need to tie it down first as well so we're gonna have a tie here and then uh it looks like we'll do some holes here yeah you guys yep you can still see what i'm doing good so we'll do a tie down like right here right here and then we'll go through like right here take those maybe those three out so undo that now this might be the case where these work better than the others i don't know we're going to use them and find out and i may not be wide enough for the cord we may have to go two over instead of one hmm of course we need to go to okay i don't want to go too crazy here so let's do this one first that one that one and one more that should do it now let's open that up right on through love it in there beautiful so now we can take one of these and make sure that we get it nice and tight right around this one spot and actually we probably want to go the other way with this from the top so we'll go from the top now it's going to go like this and we want to tie that down like right here so we'll use this get a good dark down on it now it is true i know you guys might be thinking well beautiful look how beautiful that is you might be thinking to yourselves how you gonna do the other side dummy i get what you're saying i totally get what you're saying uh i'll slide it in and do all this inside that's how that's gonna have to work but for now we've got what we need this will work just fine for now really enjoy it let's uh take a break smoke one more we'll move the camera back over to the light show you what we got be right back we're back we're back we're back we're back let's see what we got so i can get this to slide in that's what's nice about this screen it's pretty damn flexible didn't think that far ahead though did we that ain't gonna work no we didn't that's gonna be a all right all right we're back now we got to figure out how we're going to get that done because it's going to sit out a little bit from the light just because the cord is going to stick out at least that much so it's going to sit out a little bit the other option would be to turn it around which is a so much better choice i'm back so you know i could edit out a bunch of my fuck-ups and you know but you know what this is a learning channel i figure so you know you start with a design like this and you think oh this is going to work just great but then you realize after you start actually actually implementing it and don't get me wrong i'm kind of loosely designing this i didn't go crazy and measure all the i could have went and measured everything and laid it all out and figured it all out but i just kind of wanted to just do it this way this is the way most people would probably do it so i put it up there and turns out this is going to stick out way too far because this is too close to the edge it's a lot closer than i thought was and this quartz takes out too far so how do we solve that nope no worries no worries at all we turn it 90 degrees it's fine it's fine we turn 90 degrees and now we don't have to worry about it just got to make sure that we have it on the right side because it's got to go this direction boom so that's how we'll do that not complicated at all and we'll start by adding this again you know how we go through here and through there round two we go actually let's turn it around it's easier to cut from behind it really is so we'll do it this way if you have to cut these off it's it's better to have a little extra room of course the problem with when you do it this way is getting it past that second one right it doesn't want to behave it wants to do this and then that and then this and then that so let's unplug the cords make life simple for me turn it around i had this trouble last time because i'm trying to get it right as far as i can all right come here you haven't gone nowhere whoa whoa whoa where we at there we go now that is the hardest part finding the damned hole isn't it don't say it okay guys it's always a harder one too to do isn't it you try to do it and you want to do it the right way there we go we got it i think we're happy with that see if we can get it to tighten i always want to be a pain in the ass we're still on the right side of it sometimes these don't want to behave like they should this is one of those days still not behaving the way it should we we will figure it out awesome we got it that's better now once again i always like to leave a little bit in case i gotta tighten it a little bit more that's up to you how you want to roll with that so then we slide it in now we can bring this around here and uh figure out probably like right here and we'll grab one of these like that and this is probably too big really overkill but that's what i got so if it's what you got it's what you use there we go yep move it a little if i have to but it's not too bad pop that off now we'll go over there and see how it fits see if it's happy all right we're back let's see how this baby fits if i up again or do i make it work the question is remains something like that looks pretty good now let's grab our mock-up for the other side and see what that looks like if we can get that mounted that will be like this so we definitely have enough room got plenty of room on the backside so i'll trim that as i need but for now we're gonna use that and go with that and uh i'm real curious to see what the par increase is gonna be now so let's uh go ahead and get this run we'll get the wiring run get it all run up and over and we'll see what our pars look like and what the increase is this is the cannabis reviewer i well we'll be right back cannabis reviewer back we got it on she's doing her thing and i'm checking her to keep making sure she's not too hot uh what we'll do is we'll wait we'll get the other one installed and then uh i will do a par reading measurement and let you know how it goes all right and you hear my music playing the other thing i realized i cannot use can i use this because if you look over here and up and over [Music] you can see there well you can't tell maybe but that plug right there is not there's not enough room for that to go so what we're going to do is i'm going to mount i'm gonna mount one [Music] right i'm gonna mount a terminal strip right on that wall right there i've already got the mark we'll hang it and then i'll just run the cord over there and then i have plenty of connections for lights i don't have to worry about it it works that works too there's more than one way to skin that cat i don't know what they hate what that even means but that's an old saying anyway we'll come back i'm going to grab to get wait for the other one to come in get it mounted and we'll go from there check some part levels can't wait this is the cannabis reviewer we'll be back thanks for watching hello cannabis reviewer back got my other rapid led in and it's time to put it on the other side i swapped this from the last time you seen me uh because it's been a couple of days but here's the next one yeah i know the lights suck in here but you see it there it is and we're gonna mount that over on this other side put this back in the middle right now it's on the side just because i wanted to get the light to that side and i'm gonna tell you what i am really impressed with these i am really impressed i had this on the front and by the next day i was starting to see orange hairs already not so interesting right so i'm going to go ahead i've unplugged this i'm going to go ahead and move it over and and mount it and then i'll show you what i got i'll be right back this is the cannabis reviewer we're back it's installed it's installed check this out this is how bright just these two little lights are i just wanted to show you give an example of how much red i'm adding ready watch this isn't that something beautiful i love it i cannot wait to get two more i got two more coming for the other side and we'll do the same thing we did with this one it's perfect i love it i'm very happy i'll get some power measurements get it all down but roughly we're around 700 par right now give or take you know in the middle is going to be closer to nine but towards the edges it's going to be around seven so hey i'm i'm in the mood i'm in the place i'm in the

keep coming back and watching my stuff i do appreciate it also i just love appreciating what can i say i am happy i'm excited everything's going great this is the cannabis reviewer i'll see you on the next video and as i always say happy smoking", "KBXRxpqveek": "well that's the problem like you know California would legalized recreational marijuana and sessions yeah yeah he doesn't know he literally is on record saying that good people don't smoke marijuana yeah what about drink scotch they're good people drink scotch what about cigars a good people smoke cigars Jeff and does that work and I think that that's you know if you look at it every I think you young people know what side of history they want to be on like we're all like we all know it's gonna be legalized yeah we all know it's gonna be there it's gonna be like say three years maybe five years and then all this [ __ ] all those people in jail don't have to be in jail all this money all this tax money can go and look at what happened to Colorado all the cartels all the power all this stuff it's just like it's gonna happen so anybody who comes along and says no [ __ ] that you're like well you're on the wrong side of history brother well he's left it up to what Trump has said is that he's gonna leave it up to the states so if you leaves it up this date it's just gonna go across the country and what are they gonna do federally once it becomes state legal everywhere and then the federal government still says it's illegal what do they do then I mean do they change then because they have to change the law because in Colorado it's legal but you can't you know bank it you know that's a [ __ ] masa messy if armored cars and guys good I know a lot of guys who are former seals yeah and and you know guys who work for Blackwater and now they're [ __ ] holding guns at sweet shops because they got a million dollars in cash in the back which is bad enough with one state but when it's 20 states [ __ ] places in that state think about one state how many marks do you have weren't roads to be cash means you have to grow your own [ __ ] in Colorado too that's the other thing you're not buying it from somebody you have to grow it if you're selling it so the hole it's you're creating a dangerous situation and people have already been robbed correct and you know the whole thing to me it's it was really disappointing when the DEA didn't change the classification from schedule one in August like they had they had the opportunity all the evidence was there they know the evidence is there and they [ __ ] lied about it yeah and this is under Obama also the problem with that is because of schedule one you can't do research on cancer or you know all of the CBD stuff you know that's it's not psychoactive which is so important correct for people who have issues like arthritis and I had Joe Valtellina here was a former kickboxing champion he's a commentator now for glory he told me that he was locked in a room after one of his concussions from his last fight locked in a room in the dark for three weeks because you couldn't even see the light on the power button on a migrant to charge a cell phone but the little red light shows you that would give him a headache and so CBD oil cured him of that and it's not illegal and that's the thing is again what side of history to be on like we know all of this stuff we know where it's going yeah why the [ __ ] are we slowing down now well it's a bunch of old people that's really what it is it's a bunch of old people who don't get high and you know and they're scared of it and instead of looking at it pragmatically objectively looking at the science they're looking at it like some goddamn 1950s episode of dragnet you know Joe Friday is coming in and said it's for losers it's frustrating are you a loser Mickey I know it's like that's that's really what's going on it's it's it's very strange yeah yeah we did this story you know the kings of cannabis you know these guys they they're like the seed hunters they fly around the world and they find like the best seed strains and then they go back to Holland and they they make like they won the cannabis cup like six eight years and ruther you know they did why Twitter and they tell you some about the cannabis cup real quick I was one of the [ __ ] judges okay well you know these guys are too Dutch guys I don't know I only did it once I'm gonna do it again it's a farce okay this is what they give you they give you you know how those old ladies to take pills like if you're like someone else to take your arthritis medication and you have like seven days things can they give you one of those each one of those things has weed and you just start [ __ ] smoking and you're gonna welcome to the races no idea the first couple hits you're on this was great and you just [ __ ] hammer in it and then everybody's talking in this like ridiculous jargon like oh this is really tasty they're a [ __ ] super annoying and stinky they're talking about the cannabis community right I had this weird conversation with this one who one when they when you took [ __ ] I don't know who I voted for have no idea I was so high afterwards I was having out-of-body experiences because people were giving me cookies and candies one if not the highest one of the highest I've ever been in my life maybe the highest yeah because we were at this place on Melrose it was a head shop in the back they had this pot thing and it was just filled with [ __ ] people and there's no ventilation just filled with pot smoke and this is an Amsterdam this is a Los Angeles yeah they didn't know that oh sure and they're passing around bongs and pipes and cookies and cakes and they had security there to make sure no one had come and you know they had it all blocked off they did a smart job like the way they handled it but as far as like actually judging what's the best pot get the [ __ ] out of here no one has any idea it's like giving you seven glasses of whiskey and then telling you to drink some wine what wine do you live change that's how most of our podcasts are I don't remember what I judged I don't remember what the pot was like I was I was a poor judge and everybody else is a poor judge too but I'm being honest about it there you go if you wanted a judge camp that you wanted to have a real cannabis cup you would give someone a strain for a week and then give them another strain for a week and have to make them keep a journal and then make them send in that journal like this is my experience on this is how much I smoke this is what it felt like body high you know head high it's too [ __ ] strong some of that [ __ ] is like it's getting to a strange place now for sure because what's interesting to me is when people who don't smoke it smoke it then I get to see because we're sour tolerance is so high cuz you smoke it I smoke it almost every day at least five days a week I probably smoke weed so when I see people that that tried for the first time and you see that terrified look in their eyes confronted with their own mortality and they feel the earth spinning and they're like Jesus I've got a question for you mr. smoker okay because my problem is I'm an ex-smoker not an X weed smoker my current leads from an ex smoker smoker right and so smoking always makes me want to smoke cigarettes a B so I do like you know the have all the different things now the one the one I like is is this high-cbd sort of but it's it gets you so high still the honey you know oh yeah and it's [ __ ] awesome whatever you need I can get okay but the thing is I got a question because I was singing about this the other day because I'm I'm like reading all about the you know how it stops cancer this is great for this is great for that stuff so much [ __ ] yeah but isn't smoking it still bad for you no apparently not actually scientists exactly it actually acts as an expectorant on your lungs it's actually good for people that have emphysema it's actually good for people that have issues with their lungs which is really strange asthma really good for asthma definitely yeah crazy doesn't seem to make sense no it more much better though because smoking is still kind of harsh but the effect of the cannabis smoke cannabis smoke is not toxic the same way cigarette smoke is and one of the reasons why cigarette smoke is toxic is not just the tobacco which is Jacek 599 [ __ ] chemicals or whatever the hell it is now marijuana users have good lungs for transplanting so if you get hi walk off a building but you don't have to smoke it here's here's what I'm down with these [ __ ] things that I got charging right here mmm these vape pens some of them suck because some of them the ones that look like like an e-cigarette those suck they don't have enough juice they're not powerful enough you want one that has a really good pull because these these get you high like getting high getting high where's the other ones you got to keep hitting them over and over and over and over again to get high right these when the [ __ ] get hot because that battery's fat see how fat that battery is it's much fatter the other ones when you get the ones that are skinny like this the other problem with the ones that are skinny Miz oh you get a lot of duds right like they're making a lot of them in China sorry China but a lot of them suck man like my friend Gino who sells me everything he gave me three no four pens and three of them were duds really three out of [ __ ] four were duds there was if it was all legal then exactly your quality control and control yeah well you they were packaged to see the whole deal is that are packaged already and when you're getting these ones that are prepackaged like the you you throw them away when they're done it's very wasteful so this you just get this little cartridge you slide the cartridge into this big fat battery thing and no scared it's a good boy it's a good time man it's a good time for that and it's a good time for people to do the problem as the research is still federal research is still impossible you know doing real real hardcore research on you know large-scale research nationwide and we should be going anything that shows some promise re cancer we should be going whole hog yeah after in the fact that we're not as I'm worried that he has such a Trump as such incredible connections to money and that you know all the good parts that's going to come from that like his no-nonsense approach to infrastructure wanted to rebuild a lot of things put a lot of people to work because that and a lot of people benefit from that what scares me is that money connection with the pharmaceutical companies who have just gone way way out of their way to just try to stifle marijuana research at every possible turn and legalization at every possible turn and it's just criminal what what they do is awful you know the because when you make something illegal it's not just making something illegal which is why I had like drill this into the head of a friend of mine who was pro-hillary and you know he's asking why I'm upset with her and I said look dude there's a [ __ ] email that was leaked the WikiLeaks email that said she's against mayor in every sense of the word this was a she was making a promise to some organization I don't remember who it was but they were asking her what is her stance on marijuana she's against it in every sense of the word how could you be that's like saying I'm against peanut butter in every sense the word you know like what are you a monster yeah you want people to go to jail for peanut butter yeah you know like the problem is it's not just that you don't like it which I'm fine with the problem is you could make people get locked in a cage that's a crime it's a crime we know this is innocuous like I just hid it we're having a conversation there's no problems this is not some devil weed it's not gonna ruin lives I pay taxes I have a family everything's fine wake up when the alarm goes off so we wouldn't fete [ __ ] and when someone who is in the position of running for president like Hillary says something crazy like that she's against marijuana legalization in every sense of the word that means people are going to go to jail that means people are gonna get shot that means more Mexican drug gangs are gonna ship more illegal product over here the more research is being done no research is being done people gonna die from cancer that don't have to die people are gonna get diseases they don't have it this is my problem because again it's what side of history do you want to be on and I think that most people who grew up the way we did or sane people are just saying what exactly exactly exactly", "u6jd4pCoTPk": "nervous i have to cut a hole like a bun like that much i'm trying like in the mood it's probably almost five inches oh that's not what that's good i thought it was gonna be way more yeah cut it off get it out of here you want to see it before oh my god you can't even get the full head in there

like 15 and i feel like i thought because okay this lady does hair but i didn't know that hairdressers listened to people so i'm like she just loves to to talk to me this lady loves talking to me she loves me well i always came back because you were always right here like always i needed my hair done really badly too because of my mom is you know she's colombian she's never dealt with like mixed hair like this so i never had anybody to teach me like this is how you do your hair this is the proper way to comb it and like brush it and wash it and stuff like that i never had that so like when i came in here and saw that you know here's somebody that had a dark skin doing darker people's hair i felt like at home in here it was really nice to have like a whole bunch of people in here doing the same thing it was nice then you tell them i need to bring you some flowers it's okay it was so nice to have you and to see you and they know that you're well today that makes i'll bring you some flowers that's made of chocolate or something some cool [ __ ] or like some some corn so you have diabetes oh never mind edible rangers yeah no no no no no it's so nice to see you and to know that you're doing well though where's my heart oh my god are you doing my hair still she's been doing my hair for like 12 years dog 12 freaking years has been in my hairdresser and i love her i'm telling you come through and then we gonna smoke a blunt no killing maria doesn't smoke [Applause] [Music] damn it's the next day you already know i slept on it i slept on it oh my god but maria's a boss she came to my house and she's gonna redo it she's gonna make it like nice and straight again and then i'm gonna like if i smoke out all my rigs or something really cool huh i'm gonna do something cool with it i feel like one of those superstars just like getting members oh crap like oh bro i'm oprah they don't find the drugs and stuff sometimes then when they get into the freaking cell they literally take it out their ass and they give it what they this one girl did she gave some meth to everybody like a piece of methamphetamine i didn't tell her where [Music] does it look amazing it looks really good really yeah i feel amazing because it took like five bucks before this you see but you look so different pretty thank you very much i feel pretty oh so shiny and pretty oh with the light yeah wow i brought the salon to my house it was amazing now i'm finna get high yes sir maria made me look fat once again so we can take a bomb right for her even though she don't smoke it is what it is yes sir now we ready to smoke i got three different joints all different raws three different raw papers here i'll show you we got the raw blacks organic hemp all of them organic hemp we got the raw classics we got the raw organic hemp you can see a color difference sort of the most difference is like we'll see in the burn you can kind of sort of see a color difference in them the real difference is we're gonna see when they swoon we smoke them you know i'm saying i mean i've had all of these i never like put them side by side compared them all though so this is the wrong black big shout out to maria for coming to my crib doing my hair like two days in a row that's nope so far i feel like these burn fast i feel like this is pretty quick the black i feel like i can't get a real review unless i i sparked them all at once i don't really know how to review papers we're all classic so now we got the black and the classic i don't know like what's the difference it tastes different because like okay these are the same weeds and they taste a little different it's weird this one's a little bit more see-through already like gets like more resonated already than more than this one it looks like you can see it [Music] classic now black and now we're gonna spark up the organic hemp well that immediately is like a slow like way slower burn i like the blacks every time i buy like a big pack i always buy in the blacks i think i'm about to start getting those organic hemps that's nice that's way nicer like like i'm telling you the black the classic the organic hemp that's dope i feel the difference with all three well i got them all here i might as well i like them all i like raws i i mean this was supposed to be like a comparison i guess i i mean look i sparked this one first and it's still cooler like i sparked that one second it's kind of like short to be like the second one sparked look i just asked that let me ask all of them like compared it's still a little shorter than the first one so that burns quick the blacks don't burn as quick and what i thought was slow burning i mean it just feels like it i guess it was just a harder pull again i don't really know if i hit a ball equally but that smoke look really dark and thick when i pulled off this wow the black that wasn't that dark of smoke but that that was let me see if it does it again slightly darker i don't know if you guys can see that not only judging the color of the [ __ ] cloud it matters whoo these are nice and i put no tobacco in these i put no wax in these it's just straight up one gram each so i wanted to see like the authentic burn of this [ __ ] just straight up the weed and all the same flower too so it wasn't like they were burned differently anyways they were all burned the same if i grind them all up the same that's the black that's the classic and here is the organic hemp it looks a little like not lit anymore almost drop that [ __ ] am i hot boxing [ __ ] i didn't open any windows the smoothest one i would say like to hit though is the classic it feels it just feels like way better to hit this [Music] feels nice but then the black feels so nice too i don't know these all feel very nice bras in general get you a pack [ __ ] with it they don't pay me or nothing right they don't pay me for [ __ ] i just [ __ ] ross i just like them and i can't wait for the next [ __ ] festival though for uh i don't know when they're going to have so i heard they were going to do like edc but i haven't seen anybody like put like saying oh i'm going or nothing i know a lot of [ __ ] who rave and i haven't seen nobody be like oh i'm going but then again they made the tickets expensive if there is going to be any festivals because of coronavirus but i don't even know if i would want to go right now because you know how it gets books they be yo they be wookie they don't they don't shower they don't give a [ __ ] about nothing it just be like that be

the roach and", "wRuY6JSRoME": "oh yeah I got caught smoking weed at universities I had my girl bring my kid away and I was outside of the Jurassic Park I didn't get called by the police but I was outside of the jurassic park ride and i was like all right you know bring him to go get a soda or whatever i'm gonna sit here and smoke my vape pen and there's like one of the handlers they have a thing where they have a velociraptors I get person into costume but it's again i'ma try to cost ya and they're pretending to be like a velociraptor and the the trainers like trying to calm him down it's a whole display with the kids and everyone's really excited so I'm just like how I watching it like getting stone zoning out and at one point the girls got like one of those you know microphone face pieces on she just goes she goes sir not here and that was it I went up and then I just sir not here fade it off yeah I know I wonder if they're cooler about it now now this is a year ago oh there's not that long ago Wow I was very surprised I was like this is California well not only that would it would if it was a vape pen with tobacco or CBD or are you allowed to do that probably not I think they're smoking areas that are designated but she knew what it was she saw my face my mouth was a gape watching real velociraptors walking around I was losing my mind it was all dude like get out of here stoner yeah that was listening to the radio in Utah and they were talking about how they have to re they have to figure out what to do with their drug sniffing dogs now cuz there's no reason it must be some is there a change in Utah as Utah changing their their drug policy because it was funny that's listening to this old dude on just for the for the [ __ ] of it I was listening the AM radio rock radio and this old dude was talking about how they they're gonna decommission some of these drug sniffing dogs because they'd use him on like traffic stops there we go medical marijuana in Utah could mean retirement for generation of drug canines just [ __ ] putting these dogs down well they also were worried about the police officers themselves losing jobs you when you hear about pot that's making its way into a place like Utah you know first of all you realize goddamn pot is really you can't stop it's here the genies out of the bottle it's here the revenues and Grandma feels better ya know the alzheimer the people that have all these serious issues that CBD is fixing brightest patients people with like real problems that are not finding any other solution that works the way cannabis does they just give it in and then they're making all this money but then you see these old folks that are from a different time and they're talking about it and they they look at it in terms of like how many police jobs are gonna go away bright how many dogs are gonna be one of them smoke weed so they're like it's not really my problem and interesting to watch them look at it as an economic issue the problem is you have pot heads that are leading the charge so it's it for a long time it was difficult to take him serious yeah you needed straight-laced guys to come in and you know there's a lot of money there there's so much money in it that you're getting that but when you have [ __ ] hippies playing hacky sack and you know you know weren't puka-shell necklace is is sort of hard to take them seriously when the reality is they kind of want to be legalized for recreational purposes and you know yeah I don't like for I don't I don't use we SS doesn't try to I do take CBD I did literally during that fight I was using topical CBD the whole time so I guess you take whirl - I do I take CBD excellent daily but I don't know infinite CBD sponsors are our podcast and great festivals well they're also I'll get you a bunch of products is there a really great company that supports comedy they sponsored my tour when I was prepare for my special they're [ __ ] dope but I take it daily I take the the oil just because you know apparently all of the the benefits that it has with getting your body back into homeostasis and making you feel better and getting back in line I don't know the [ __ ] effects I smoke weed every day as well so I'm sure i'm getting CBD effects as well but in my mind I'm going to I have a bunch of this stuff I know that since I started taking it i weirdly feel better but i can't really connect you said before you take CBD and you go into another realm well I was taking one and one it's like one gram of CBD - one gram of THC like it's it's one part well so whatever milligrams you have it's Bo like it's ten milligrams CBD it's ten milligrams we as well its Pope yeah I take regular CBD too though I take oil I feel like it's it's very beneficial and much more potent in terms of its anti-inflammatory benefits then just smoking it smoking it does something for you definitely reduces inflammation makes you feel better I was taking sore joints a topical I was using topical is good too but I think the real combination is topical plus the oil you don't have to say but people a lot of people find that they have better pain relief from one versus one plus one like one part THC one part so it's like edible like you know marijuana mixed with CBD a lot of people find great benefit in that for some reason yeah I had a trick my aunt because my aunt so anti drugs and if I told her that CBD was derived from hemp shoot she wouldn't take it was just bad arthritis and I gave it to her for for that and she loves it and I told her after the fact but it's grabbing dude it's just a plant folks and if you just get straight CBD it has no psychoactive properties there's no it's not gonna the only thing it's gonna do is for some folks and it works a little bit left wave with me it alleviates some anxiety just relaxes you yeah yeah that's uh that's why I smoke weed - yeah I smile and I've been arrested probably ten times in my life and every time was for smoking a joint in the street every single time dude the arrested they take you in yeah New York Turkey [ __ ] cell it's crazy still there still do the last time I was put into a cell for smoking weed was a year and a half ago me and Dave Smith two years ago maybe me and you tell me you were Lewis J Gomez guy told me Louis calm eyes that's when I start using the middle in - I was like you know what it's problems election [ __ ] Lewis Gomez's must have rap sheets doggy every time I come back into the country I'm pulled into a room and they [ __ ] they look like they're about to fist [ __ ] me with a rubber glove every time have you been to Panama honey ton recently sir yes come right this way every single any time Bolivia sir but yet dude when in New York City the way it works is you its dude it sucks it's happened so many times it's the worst because it's just a major inconvenience you know pay me ask to get into Canada I can do it now cuz they changed the laws but I didn't go to Canada for like three years because of weed for being arrested for a joint we're not talking about like I have an ounce that I just bought from my dealer and they found a large amount on me a joint smoking on the street what they do is they they at first they they take the weed and they go all right we're gonna give you a ticket just hang tight relax we're gonna put cuffs on you this is just keep you calm and just to [ __ ] get you in the paddy wagon this is all a process then they put you in a paddy wagon they used to have sweet nights in New York where all it was was they would go and try to find kids smoking weed kid drunk kids college kids pissing in public public intoxication and the entire night they would just pick up everybody and fill up paddy wagons and create criminals just create criminals out of teenagers you know kitten they were targeted that's why the stop and frisk law has happened in New York they changed it because they were just targeting black and Hispanic kids", "7OwitA_s6yA": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] what's up to all my pal fellow hello fellow pot smokers out there sucio 1813 rickity tickity

anyway so rat for that joint how would you wait how would you rate that as a CVD enjoy from one to five on a scale yeah I really enjoyed it I think it tasted nice it didn't burn too slow very pretty fast but it was I gave it like I give what I could sue and a half maybe three it was cool to smoke I feel all right you know but said two and a half two maybe three cuz like you know I'm just not really high you know I could definitely smell the regular joint you know this is good for like a pregame type of ish you know Sam you smoked this real quick and then you rolled up a fatty of some fire then you'd be straight you know I think this is good to let you you tight you like you upset at the moment you're heated and you just [ __ ] smoke a CBD in it just like everything gonna be okay that's what these is for you know anyway if you like what you see please like and subscribe to our Channel oh and we'll catch you guys", "YPpV4xE_R3c": "what I'll put up guys I've had several requests to make a video on CBD vs. THC if you have never met me before my name is Gabriel Santos from GF Santos comm but onto the topic of the video just as a disclaimer I am NOT a professional in terms of THC and CBD knowledge I'm just gonna share from my experience so I tried CBD for the first time about a month and a half ago from a vape pen and I've since done it up to a handful of times on average I take about five to even 12 puffs out of the pen and each time has been pretty consistent in terms of experience and the experience from the CBD pen being definitely an increase in happiness you could say more ease you definitely feel a change in your mental and emotional state in a great way positive way but you don't experience the like being spawned blown and stoned and in terms of results in my experience when I took CBD I was still motivated to do things without having to try so hard to motivate myself because when I don't smoke and I'm just so bur so to speak I'm very highly motivated extremely had am highly motivated it makes me happy to achieve things and to be active and so when I take CBD that part of me is still very much there naturally whereas when I smoke weed THC we'd like your ear flower you're here Douglas you're you know your joints and stuff like that I you know I I feel hi and there's more there's more possibility for anxiety and paranoia when I'm on CBD there's none of that at least from this one as I've taken and with THC you definitely there's like a fog and like I come down like a heavy harsh come down for me obviously depending on how much I smoke and I'm typically smoking like maybe a quarter of a gram even half a gram I know that's not a lot to some people but for me that's a lot and then when I'm high off the THC based stuff like I don't want to do anything even if it's the Teva I don't want to do anything like I just want to [ __ ] sit um and and watch youtube videos and and to be perfectly frank I'm willing to consider that that's not all just the THC that part of my intention when I smoke THC is to do nothing and so you know take that for what it is but in terms of like raw chemical effect definitely with THC there's a heaviness in my brain and body afterward and there's like a longer recovery period whereas with CBD it's not as intense but it's very satisfactory and as a quick little side fact before I did CBD I had learned recently that apparently CBD based marijuana is what in the ancient times was considered medicinal and that's where the history of medical marijuana really comes from is CBD based oil whereas THC is more so of like the stoner culture type marijuana and that loci is kind of harmful in the sense that like when you consume too many types of chemicals that can harm your brain things like that whereas CBD again again guys I'm not a professional but that's apparently the case do your own research you know take this for what it is but if you are someone who is looking to use cannabis medicinally and not to run away from life consider CBD consider CBD and you know if you're someone who when you smoke weed you just like to chill out and do nothing just understand that when you want to chill and do nothing that's a great way to do it and if you want to be productive and achieve stuff probably not the best thing to do it's kind of like if I want to run a marathon I'm not gonna I'm not gonna eat an entire pizza while I'm running it you get I'm saying and like if I'm running a marathon I'm not gonna put on slippers right you want to equip yourself with the right stuff and so if you want to be productive and you want to maybe reduce some anxiety you know like symptom based stuff check out CBD if you want to chill out be a bum eat a ton of stuff okay all right anyways guys and I'm not saying that you can't smoke weed this is all what works for you okay so my recommendation is to try it out and to see what happens and if it works for you it works for you if it doesn't work for you it doesn't work for you for Snoop Dog smoking blunts works for me smokin blunts doesn't work for you smoking blunts might work for you CBD my work who knows and CBD might not work okay I'll see ya that's it i hope this video found you well and i'm glad to finally get this video out because i know some people have been requesting it I appreciate your requests very much so and that's it I hope this really helped i'm really hoping and praying and wishing to the universe or God or whoever that that these videos are bringing you a lot of support and that for yourself regardless of these videos that you are moving forward in the direction of the life that you love and that you want to live and that weed is weed is not bad weed is not good it's great it's whatever it's whatever you want it to be but life is so much more than smoking weed and my sincere and real message to all that is that there's a way to be high on life without weed and that you can you can really enjoy your life in so many ways both in achievement as well as emotion and spirituality and that you deserve a life that you love and that when you die you're ready because you simply exhausted your time on earth all right a little deep message for you at the end I really appreciate you all I hope to see you soon but until next video peace", "dPHT72UwbR0": "- What's up everyone? Caleb here with Hemp Daddy's Therapeutics. And I'm here today to\nanswer one of the questions I get asked the most, and it's Does CBD make you high? And how does it make you feel? This is one of the\nnumber one search queries in Google that lands\npeople on our website, so I know a lot of you are answering it so I thought I'd do a\nlittle YouTube video on it. But before we get started, we gotta talk about what the\ndifference in THC and CBD is. So, THC is the component of\nthe plant that gets you high. CBD is a whole 'nother\ncomponent of the plant. It's another cannabinoid. So, the cannabis plant, hemp as well, has a whole array of cannabinoids. All of them have medicinal\nand therapeutic benefits. CBD being the number one\nmedicinal and therapeutic benefit out of all of the cannabinoids. That's why all these\ncompanies are isolating CBD. One of the things you're\ngonna start seeing here in the future is people isolating other\nthings like CBC and CBG. Because they all have unique medicinal and therapeutic benefits. So THC, on the other hand, is the component that is responsible for getting you high. But it does also have therapeutic benefits such as reducing the size of tumors and helping with pain management as well. But CBD, on the other hand, it's got all those medicinal\nand therapeutic benefits and many, many more, but there's no high associated with it. So if you have, whatever it is, whether it's a moral issue, or you just don't like\nthe feeling of being high, like CBD will not get you high. There's no chance of it at all. You could probably drink an entire bottle and not even get high. You know, don't go out and try that, I'm not advocating that at all. But because there's so much CBD to THC, like basically CBD counteracts the psychoactive effects of THC. So, let's say you smoked a joint, for say, if you did that along with a dose of CBD, you're not gonna feel as high as you would if you just took THC alone. So CBD has no psychoactive effects, so there's not risk of\ngetting high with CBD. It just has all the medicinal\nand therapeutic benefits. So let's talk about how it makes you feel. So, basically, it just\nmakes you feel good. So, I kinda relate it to a runner's high. When you get that flood of endorphins and you just feel great,\nyou feel positive, you're completely lucid, your\nmind is in the right place. It's kind of the same as CBD. And honestly, it kinda\nbecomes like your new normal. So let's say you take\nCBD for the first time, you're probably gonna\nreally feel the effects. But after you've been\ntaking it for a full month, you're not gonna notice\nthe effects as much even though they're still there, it just becomes the new normal. Like, you start feeling better. So if struggle with stress,\nor anxiety, or depression, like those things can\nreally benefit from CBD. And so, if you just wanna take CBD just to relax at the end of the day, to wind down, to sleep better, CBD is great for these things. You'll feel nothing but positive benefits. There's no negative side effects. You're not gonna feel tired and drowsy just because you took CBD. So basically, CBD works by\ncalming your mind, that's, so when I say it helps with sleep, it helps with sleep by calming your mind. So if you're the type of person whose mind is always racing when you go to bed and you\nhave a hard time sleeping, CBD is gonna help with that. But if you take CBD during the day, it's not gonna make you sleepy, so don't worry about that. And again, CBD does not\nmake you high whatsoever. It's the THC that gets you high. So if you're taking CBD oil, if it's a full spectrum,\nor a broad spectrum, it doesn't matter, there's not gonna be enough THC content in order to get you high, so consume CBD and you're\ngonna get all of these positive and great benefits with no risk of getting high.

noticed the audio of my videos has been a little bit hard to hear if you don't use headphones to watch the videos so just got done busting a dab of some of this cherry wine from extracts labs easily some of the tastiest CBD that I've had and I have a very tasty product to review for you tonight as well so I got this earlier today this is something I've been wanting to try for a while secret nature's vape cartridges now I did a video on secret nature's but back in the past so if you'd like to see that go ahead and check it out but this is secret nature's vape cartridges these are some of the most highly regarded cartridges that I've seen online everyone says they're top of the line and the reason why is because they're you they use cannabis drive terpenes so they use terpenes derived from actual but this particular cartridge i'm going to be reviewing is the gelato strain gelato if you don't know is one of the most popular top-shelf cannabis strains right now in legal states it's like 30 percent THC I think and it's a cross between well it was the gelato strain was created using the famous strain Girl Scout cookies or GSC so this is supposed to be a extremely popular top-shelf cannabis strain and I've never tried it so I decided to go with the gelato cartridge flavor it is a hybrid because the gelato cannabis strain is a hybrid so they extract the terpenes and they mix it with CBD distillate this particular distillate that they use is 51% CBD 0.2 three percent THC so you get that full spectrum entourage effect the only thing that this oil is lacking that I would have liked to see is CBG and CBC those are some other cannabinoids when you get high concentrations of all these cannabinoids you get what is called the entourage effect which means you get its more full spectrum and they work together to produce the effects that they would have it would have naturally caused or produced in like but if you're smoking bud so the more cannabinoid spectrum you have the more effects you are likely to feel so this is a 1/2 gram 500 milligram cartridges if it's 50% CBD there's 250 milligrams of CBD in this so the first thing I noticed when I open this package up is the packaging on secret nature this packaging is super professional-looking in just premium and it sits like a hard cardboard stock it almost reminds me of like when you buy a new phone the black cardboard box it comes in that's kind of what this is and I like that they use cardboard versus plastic the amount of plastic that we use as humans is getting out of control it's not good so any company that's using a paper or cardboard I applaud them for that so I'm gonna go ahead and show you this packaging it is beautiful it's black and it's got gold ink and it's even like indented and raised up in some parts so when you open it up it slides open which is cool and then the cartridge was sitting right in there so really cool packaging in the front says secret nature artisan cvd gelato hybrid vapor cartridge full spectrum CBD distillate 500 milligrams on the back that secret nature our goal is to help people enhance their chosen lifestyle through relaxation meditation relief in creativity this 100% organic extract is a true full-spectrum CBD distillate has been purified to concentrate beneficial compounds while removing unwanted plant materials full-spectrum oils contain a wide wide array of cannabinoids like I explained together these compounds synergize entourage effect to create the desired effects from the planet we use real cannabis flower terpenes THC free source from artisan cultivators in California to enhance our extracts and give a true plant experience this company is out of Rogue Valley Oregon without further ado so 10 out of 10 for the packaging let's get into it I'm going to show you the cartridge before I taste it so this oil is like really light in color it almost looks if you've ever poured a mountain Dew in a clear glass that's kind of what the color looks like and it's got this really nice metal mouthpiece I'm not sure what kind of cartridge this is it doesn't say C cell on it but it's definitely a ceramic coiled cartridge the oil is very thick as you can see the bubbles are not moving which is expected CBD oil is usually very thick because it crystallizes around 60% so these are supposed to be some of the tastiest cartridges available because they have real cannabis terpenes so we'll go ahead and try this gelato so the first thing I noticed when hitting this cartridge is it kind of has a a hard you have to kind of pull a little bit harder than you wouldn't normally then I've had to pull on cartridges in the past which doesn't bother me sometimes I like having to pull a little bit harder because you can almost feel how much smoke you're taking in a little bit easier and the mouthpiece has a really sturdy feel to it I don't know it feels good on the lips Wow so the flavor on this stuff is amazing you get all flavor and nothing else you don't get any weird taste you're just getting the terpene flavor so it kind of has like a woody fruity taste to it I know that sounds weird woody but that's literally what it I'm getting and it's an enjoyable taste yeah I don't know how to describe it a head it's like oh like a woody fruity taste like almost like if you I don't know I'm almost getting like some strawberries what I want to say but extremely tasty um if you want a cartridge that for the flavor check out secret nature because this is the best tasting cartridge I've probably ever tried this blows for the people's card Church out of the watermelon taste I mean I thought this tasted pretty good but I mean this is this is the real deal Wow amazing taste I'm I would actually really like to try all their flavors now too rather not like a sample pack because it's really that tasty so I got this from the chrome leaf if you watch my videos you know I've been getting a lot of cartridge from the Khalif website it's because the cone Lee's hat the chrome leaf has the cheapest cartridge prices that I've found online so the cone leaf is a reseller so they'll buy also from a company and then sell but they're pricing their pride it's very very cheap I went to the secret nature website and the cartridge on the secret nature website are even more expensive than what you'll find that the column leaves so if you're interested in cartridges check out the palm leaf and I would highly recommend secret nature I think this 1/2 gram cartridge runs at about 40 maybe like 44 dollars for a half gram so it is expensive but it's not uncommon for what we're seeing CBD cartridges being priced at right now and this is I'll tell you what a premium product I would choose this over for the people for sure just based on the taste and the looks of the oil but like I said the only thing lacking in this is the CBG and cbc that's okay it still is a full spectrum product I have to give this 10 out of 10 the effects on this stuff I did hit it a few times before I did this video just to try to give you guys good effects I'm not tired at all it is a hybrid so just with the terpenes you're not gonna get sedated or anything like that and especially it's got the lower CBD not lower CBD percentage but right around 50 so this would be a great daytime product to use I feel energetic but focused as well and I'm also used to CBD so if you're not used to seedy trying a cartridge like this may make you very tired you know it kind of just depends on your tolerance your body type what time of the day you're using it but overall good effects on this stuff I definitely feel it with any constancy be concentrate you will feel it if it's full-spectrum and I feel just a little bit lighter a little bit more uplifted a little bit happier more and more content with life that's my review on secret nature gelato cartridge I couldn't give this anything less than a 10 out of 10 to be honest with you well I've give it a 9 out of 10 because me personally I would like a little bit more full-spectrum maybe a little bit more THC like right cut off maybe even some thca to really bring out the full spectrum effects and hit yet but nonetheless this is a very uplifting cartridge and extremely flavorful that's all for this review I hope everyone's having a great day night whatever it is as always peace
