{"eTb7xVO_FE0": "what's going on it's Little Miss cannabis and this is my part two video on how to use the pure distillate in the syringe form so earlier I told you how to warm it up to loosen up the consistency so it was easier to use so when it's in that state the best thing to do is if you want to eat it on a cookie just put a little rice grain piece on there and directly eat it that way and if that's not enough you can always up the dose and make your little amount on there bigger another great way to use it when it's heated up in the syringe is you can directly put it into say like a cup of hot tea or warm coffee and that's a great way to use it as well so another way you can use it at is you can vaporize it so if you have a vaporizer that looks like this this is a barbed coil vaporizer you see right in there there's a coil in there and that's what you're going to want to put the actual you know little des of medicine right in there and that coil is going to burn it pretty hot and you're going to be able to be braise it in that way now the best way to use the distillate is a way called dabbing and that's something that they are not allowed to talk to you about at the dispensaries so that's why I'm gonna do this video and show you exactly how to dab it so there's different devices you can use to dab this right here is called a dab straw so what you need to do is use a little torch and heat up the end of it you're gonna want to get it nice and hot it's going to turn a little bit once it does and you can see mine is a little bit you're gonna want to bring that parchment paper out of the freezer put it right on there and go ahead and take an inhale now this is gonna go way down in so you can tell it is definitely a deep hit for sure but this is gonna affect you really really well so another way to dab excuse me is to use add a brick so this is gonna be probably the most beneficial way to use it so what the daybreak looks like is this right here you heat this piece up right here until that gets red you put this piece on and then what you're going to do is have your little piece of distill it on here put it down in hit it that way and then feel it go away down in and then the party begins I have a good one see y'all later", "YqOfMsLmCIY": "[lighter clicks] [inhale] [exhale] Hi, I'm Eric from Green Goddess Supply! Today I want to talk to you about our Syringes for filling oil cartridges. When you have a vaporizer (or personal vape) such as the MiniVape2, you can fill your own cartridges with CBD or other oils. The way most cartridges work is that you unscrew the mouthpiece to open it, and then you can put your oil in. Now, a lot of these oils are fairly thick -  they don't pour easily and you get about an eighth to a quarter inch little gap here to try to put it into the tube, which is pretty maddening and usually you end up making a mess and spilling more than you get into the cartridge. So the solution to that is use a blunt tip medical syringe. Okay... We have them in green and silver, and they come in a little box like this. And when you open it, you get the syringe [mutters under his breath]: Of course I opened it for the wrong end - I always do that! You get a syringe and a little needle adapter. Now... the way these work -- just like in hospitals they have what's called a luer lock on the end. This is so that you can just twist and it's a Quick Connect. So you can just connect it into tubing when people do IVs and things like that... The blunt tip also just snaps in. So now you have a nice little precision fine point tip that you can stick into the cartridge to fill it. You can put it in and draw... and then stick it back in and Push it. OK... The other thing that you can do is -- these do come off if you pull them off -- and you get just a glass blunt tip. This can be used for dabbing oils directly into a hot banger. Our syringes are made of borosilicate glass and stainless steel plungers. So there's no plastic in this, so you can take off the plastic Luer lock tip and you can directly dab into your hot bangers and you're not gonna melt anything. You can easily just snap it right back on. Okay They come in green and in silver.  And they make filling cartridges a breeze! I'm Eric Robichaud from Green Goddess  Supply! [click sound from lighter] [inhale] [exhale]", "d6MdM9AE3Rc": "hey everybody my name is Vito I am bender educator for iodine labs today we're going to talk about RSO Rick Simpson oil RSO is a popular form of cannabis concentrate it was developed by the cannabis advocate Rick Simpson who used this extract to treat his own medical conditions in 2003 so what is our so what makes our so so special our so is a whole plant extract we begin with the cannabis plant which we strip of essentially everything all of us active chemical compounds resulting in a final product that is not distilled or purified it looks different than other concentrates when you see it you see that it's very very very dark and it has a rich sludgy consistency this is due to the fact that it is not processed this extract is potent it is rich in THC meaning that when you use it you will feel that you for yeah that high associated with the cannabinoid however because it is a whole plant extract you can expect a beautiful well-rounded whole full body effect making this product perfect for patients who use cannabis to treat insomnia muscle spasms chronic pain nausea or chilly for any patient who is looking for a body hi so how do we use RSL aerosol is an ingestible oil meaning that it is already activated it is already ready to go all you have to do is just squeeze it into your favorite food squeeze it into your coffee squeeze it into empty capsules or even just squeeze a little bit right onto your finger and eating it right off your finger there is no heat required it is ready to go this means that RSO is very easy to use portable and discreet when dosing RSO think in terms of grains of rice so like a half a grain of rice or a full grain of rice a little goes a long way how much exactly will depend from patient to patient and the patient's tolerance and what exactly that patients trying to do Rick Simpson suggest our regimen or a protocol to use our so for healing purposes to learn more about that check out Phoenix tears CA however we recommend starting low and moving up slowly another way to use RSO is to apply it directly on the skin it just depends on what the patient is trying to do so here are adenine labs we have three versions of our RSO we have the house blend which is a blend of different strains we have the single string RSL as well as the high CBD RSL they all come in airtight syringes which are perfect for perfect dosing and all the syringes are fitted with the luer lock tape so for patients who are not familiar with these syringes it can throw them off a little bit at first but I assure you actually quite simple so let's talk about that so when you pick up ourselves it will come in this syringe so let's go ahead and get another package so you can see a little bit better and this is the syringe so these two guys here the cap and the lock adapter are the culprits are the culprits of all the confusion so as you can see here these are two separate parts the cap on the top and the adapter at the bottom so what we want to do is pull and twist on the cap alone the adapter really does simply apart into it so just firmly I confidently pull and twist pull and twist pull it twist and there you go so you see it I didn't break it it feels like you gotta break it but you're not gonna break it and then when you're done just put the cap back into the adapter and twist it shut and there you go alright guys so the pending on the temperature depending on how cold your RSO is it could be difficult to push it out but there's really no need to force it just a couple of seconds heating it up either with a hair blow-dryer or running it under warm water will do if you squeeze too much out just pull back on the plunger and that will make the oil go back into the syringe that is all for our show today thank you for joining me for this five-minute video if you have any questions feel free to email me my email is Veronica at idle nightlapse calm bye have a good one", "2iOpA-P3VSs": "hey guys Peter with their vapor here and I'm back with another pro tip video on how to fill syringes specifically these small 1 ml glass syringes that we carry these syringes are a popular packaging option for high quality material but they can be difficult to fill so today I'm going to show you two methods that will save you hours of work especially if you have to fill hundreds or thousands of these things let's dive in the first method we are going to cover is the syringe coupler method this tiny white thing here is a syringe coupler we have them available for purchase and they allow you to connect a big syringe to a small syringe which is really cool because that is going to allow you to fill these at a much faster rate you're just going to take your larger syringe and make sure it's filled with your material then put the coupler on it by twisting it on to the luer lock then take the cap off your smaller syringe after it's fully assembled attach it to the coupler and begin your filth by gently pushing material from the bigger syringe into the smaller syringe after the fill is complete remove the small syringe from the coupler place the cap on it and there you have it a filled 1 ml syringe the second method will cover preferred method of filling because it does not require as many assembly steps which saves a lot of time there's a special tool that I'll be using to perform this fill and you can probably find it at your local sporting goods store or Walmart it's ten pound fishing line I have a roll of it right here first we're gonna cut about a four-inch section of the fishing line or whatever you can comfortably hold in your hand some of our clients like to take the fishing line and tape it to a chopstick or popsicle stick to make it easier to grasp but the basic technique remains the same you will still need a larger syringe filled with your material such as this 10 ml syringe I have here or you can even make this work with a filling machine you're going to start by taking the syringe you want to fill with a cap on and no plunger then place it in a position where it can be held upright luckily this is exactly how they come packaged if you buy from us then holding the larger syringe above the smaller syringe gently begin to fill the syringe from the top dead center taking care not to get any material on the sidewall of the syringe above the fill line this is actually really important after filling you're gonna place your fishing line into the syringe like this allowing it to hover right above the liquid then slowly push the plunger down and tell it meets the liquid inside then pull the vent cord out as you can see if this technique is used correctly it allows you to hand fill these syringes at light speed compared to other methods and there you have it a filled 1 ml glass syringe thanks for watching this video please hit us up with any questions in the comment section hit that subscribe button below

MJ 4/20 here today I'm going to be opening my latest haul from true leaf Panama City Beach dispensary location let's see what we got we've got some 9 pound hammer Rosen man 83.5% TCA and 3.1 percent of THC for a grand total of eighty eight point six and we've got some co2 oil this one we have a Skywalker og and this one gorillas grapes will see the Skywalker og eighty point three percent THC an eighty percent THC on a gorilla grapes last but definitely also least is the I got a little syringe warmer because you know I've been using hot water and all kinds of stuff like that for a long time and I just figured I'd give it a try seems like it might be more convenient let's take a look at the total here they actually forgot to put the warmer on the first time I use my trigger points they let me stack it for twenty percent this time that's the first time I've ever had them do that I don't know if that's a new thing or what but I was allowed to get twenty percent discount from my true liver points and so instead of being two twenty five that came out to 180 so that makes each one of these sixty bucks apiece 60 bucks for the co2 and sixty bucks for the rosin I think that's a pretty decent deal you make rosin at home you're gonna be paying probably forty to fifty bucks or so to make it grandma rosin maybe a little bit more depending on the strain and you know $60.00 co2 oil is just a great deal because usually it's their regular distill it that's at $60 price point and I don't really like the regular distill it that much I mean it's just not the same level as the co2 this syringe warmer right here is $20 normally with the 20% off that 16 bucks total and here it is so this thing right here what you will do is take your battery mod that fits a 5-10 cartridge on it and hopefully you can unscrew it I guess mine's a little bit leaky we have to well there we go whoo yeah that'll loosen it up just enough darn I can't get it here we go finally how'd you get a glove alright so yeah that's the problem is I've got a bunch of leakage right here so I need to get a q-tip with some alcohol on it and cleaning that thing out that can also cause your your mod to stop working I actually found this on the ground somebody just threw it out and this thing was all gunked up and so there you go now it works let's see if this works even though it's still all gunky you just screw in the syringe warmer on your battery mod see if I can feel it it doesn't really have any structions with it smells like it's heating up in there yeah you just take this sucker look how pretty it is I love how pretty the co2 oil is just take this and stick it in there I guess maybe you take off this cap I'm not really totally sure what you do I've never used it and there's no instructions but see if this does anything hmm wonder how long this thing takes there we go it's certainly heat up right here I don't know it might be easier just to do a lighter guys seriously like what in the heck maybe I gotta try it like this take this thing off it doesn't seem to make much sense to me but I'll try it when the heck was that oh there's a spring I don't know the here is like a spring weird okay let's see this is holder for ten seconds to see if that doesn't so the video cut out there right after I held it down for ten seconds but yeah it does it does heat it up you know it's not as fast as a lighter and you have to sit here and hold it so mmm if you don't want to mess with a lighter I guess it could be worth it but yes here we go there it's all it's all melted now it really doesn't take that long you don't get sick all over it you don't have to worry about using all your butane there you go you can just keep this thing plugged in if you want really so it looks like that works pretty well I didn't get any flour because I'm all out of my flour recommendation you know I got caught up in the one plant slash three boys farm ordeal and so I spent my recommendation on that now I mean I'm not regretting it you know it's like it was a really good deal hundred twenty-five dollars for an ounce so 250 for two ounces that's pretty awesome I mean a quarter pound for 500 bucks you know medical grade pretty awesome but you know I I do miss the variety I wish I had I definitely wish I had my recommendation open when I went to the grand opening of this truly Panama City Beach because they had a nice selection of strains they had like four or five strains that day and they also had all the cups I'd use all the cups I got I went back and I only had there yesterday it was just cups of what is it wine wine dream Dutch wine yeah Dutch wine and I just I've already got cups of that so I don't really care about it yeah you know it's good stuff but I like a variety so I should my recommendation should be coming up here and about a week or so so I'll be getting a bunch more reviews on actual flour in here soon hopefully maybe I'll take a couple deliveries from other dispensaries to and branch out with what I'm reviewing instead of just doing and all the stuff that's closed or that I've gotten from before but like fluent I know I can get deliveries from them and possibly vitae can and med men I'm not really sure but yeah I'm ready to taste some variety I've been stuck on the same strains for a while now and that'll teach me something in the future too you know don't get stuck on the big old hype trap if if you might have some new openings coming in your area but it's all good I just got to say that that the employees at the Panama City Beach location seem pretty cool they're all very friendly and polite so far the atmosphere in general up there is really nice you know it's not there's not a bunch of grumpy people I mean it's not a bunch of people arguing or whatever perhaps the limit on minis help that I don't know but they said that the minis I talked to I guess my team in a shift manager I'm not sure but he said that the minis are still selling out and they'll be you know usually they'll be gone by early afternoon even with the two person or two per person limit so it's just a really popular item and you can't blame them when they're you know giving out really fat jars of minis they just baton for social media with those things you know they want to get on in line they want to get their message out they want people who don't have a card and who are getting from a dealer to say hey wait whoa whoa you can get four grams for the price of 3.5 and it looks good you know like that I mean so you know it's a work in progress this is like the Wild West phase that we're in right now once everything gets sorted out you know once the competition gets more firmly rooted wants some acquisitions take place then we're gonna start to see a more stable environment with better prices and better customer or care I think right now they're just you know that some of these people are some of these dispensaries are gonna get snapped up some of them are gonna get bought out some of them are gonna you know have really bad financial problems I mean just depends you know you got to see how it plays out and in the next two years I think we'll see the market stabilize a lot we'll see a bunch of acquisitions and stuff like that and it'll be a lot better for us at that point you know we just got a grin and bear it for now it is a kind of a [ __ ] show you know trying to get flour in this state hang in there and we can do it and you know another thing I just wanted to say I think I'm gonna start adding this as much as I can to everything I say because I just noticed that online we've got so much negativity not just in our forum not just in the medical marijuana community but in America we just in our whole country everyone is so negative everyone is always wants to be right everyone always wants to prove someone wrong everyone always wants to knock somebody down a peg and I'm guilty I'm just as guilty as anybody else or more so and you know we got to just start being kind man just please please please be kind", "PWJC0CrU2mE": "top of chagas here first of all we're glad you're anywhere okay let's talk about still your yeah alright Tommy one half of the classic comedy duo Cheech and Chong between the records and the movies of the reunion shows they've been doing it for more than 40 years yeah

that's the reason we asked you had the prostate cancer a few years ago yeah yep still have still have in remission mm-hmm okay and now you have yeah rectal rectal culated yeah is it real no apparently not apparently not I look at the body you know like a car you know I'm an old car now I got a little rust in the exhaust pipe that's about it you're you're in your 70s right yeah yeah almost 80 almost really kitty close getting close now you've been I know you've been really vocal about how you're using even a cannabis suppositories right and how would that helped or do you think that's hurt oh no dog helps little helps well first of all it's not when you do suppositories you don't get the head high you know you get a little but I but no way okay whatever that is oh it's good but highs good because you can still sing I know people who graduated from bud high no but no no the cannabis oil is is I think cannabis oil has really kept me from mark kept me healthy kept me young you know kept me undone Singh with the Stars you were amazing you brought your swag to that did you had you danced before then uh you know I learned how to dance salsa you know I had to pick my pencil salsa dance so we're watching you hear the state of your health then was what I had cancer all right at that point I think I think probably is you know this my own opinion the stress of the show probably brought writers write it out and it is just it is stressful touches father it's stressful seven days a week rehearsals like four five hours a day rehearsal is did you know your cancer like that had you been getting your colonoscopies did you know for three years that was that was the problem yeah but they give you a propofol I'm surprised you want to do it Tommy on a serious note here you have always been in the forefront of saying let's legalize marijuana yes it's a ridiculous thing if Mara would start out another way marijuana would be legal and alcohol wouldn't be etcetera etcetera yeah what are your doctors say when you talk to them every doctor the straight doctors and the hip doctors they all the straight doctors they don't discourage it I tell them I'm treating the cancer with with marijuana and they go okay let's see what happens you know the the the cancer I mean the marijuana doctor like there's a dr. Frankel he's been researching and he's one of the top Marijuana doctors in in the world actually he encourages the use of the cannabis oil with cancer for a number of reasons you know and and how does the medical profession officially look at this officially what depends in in Israel there's research going where they've done great strides dr. Sanjay Gupta did a great show on CNN where they showed the cannabis oil actually curing a little girl's epilepsy a little girl had hep-c these are episodes but what about the medical establishment it would say to you what well the medical establishment really don't know they don't know no more than anybody else the medical establishment it when you see the establishment the ones that push pharmaceutical the AMA for instance yeah yeah the one they're way behind the curb you know we were there they don't even allow marijuana research the federal government does it so so I mean they're behind but we're you you know this stuff to be blurry well we call Big Pharma in the pharmaceutical industry are they waiting for the total legalization do they already have I don't know what Varma's not waiting for anybody don't way ahead of the game yes so they they're ready to go as a product much as it can the United States government tried to patent or did patent marijuana years ago when they made it legal because illegal because American government knew at that time knew the medical benefits and and and the reason it was made illegal was pure political you know and racist it's a marijuana laws are very racist there's no probably the only blatant racist law that we have you know and and the reason I say that is before it was called marijuana it was called hemp and was growing all over the world especially in in America there's hemp Bill Hempstead there's him towns named after so people in Long Island who live in Hempstead don't know they live in marijuana stead that's what she said that's right interesting thought a lot of them don't okay it's not like you've dedicated your life to the pursuit of marijuana but I have but but you have and and the interesting thing is that I think most people back in the 70s and early 80s would have thought that you wouldn't be alive now that's right that's right and you've outlasted a lot of those people absolutely because of the the marijuana you think I'm like I say I'm almost 80 years old mm-hmm I still do everything that I did when I was 40 you know everything about about this prognosis the doctors feel confident when you're in there doctors are very very confident but with me it's stage one it's not that serious I'm going to treat it with like I say with marijuana and radiate chemo radiation right yeah and the chemo and the radiation the good thing about marijuana what marijuana does more than anything it relaxes the mind and it relaxes the anxiety and when you relax anything then things get done you know it relaxes the immune system so the immune system will will take over you know because we don't when we have illnesses in that you know the doctors can only do so much doctors are like mechanics they can fix things that are broken but they can't really keep you from getting the disease unless you you treat your body like like a car and you make sure you know what you're putting into it you know like good nutrition exercise and marijuana all right so we have to go you're going to come back next year after your on so you think it can dance after all this time we'll good to see Tommy John thank you very

supply of oil confiscated at Heathrow Airport she tried to bring it into the UK insisting it's the only solution to help her son who has multiple epileptic fits we've also highlighted the story of Alfie Dingley from Kenilworth who also has a rare form of epilepsy after successful cannabis oil treatment in the Netherlands the Home Office agreed here he could use it on compassionate grounds but many doctors remain skeptical cannabis is an illegal substance generally but when you take out the psychoactive substance the part that gives you a high it may have some medicinal properties so if it is able to be shown to help people safely I think there is a good argument for considering its legal use within the medical profession we spoke to the home office who again reiterated that cannabis is a drug for which there are no known medicinal benefits it's illegal to supply and possess it in the UK and in a statement the charity Cancer Research UK told us we don't advise patients to use can the soil or any alternative therapies to treat cancer or alongside treatment they're having currently there's not enough scientific evidence to say that cannabis oil is a safe or effective treatment in rare cases it's claimed some people systems can produce the same effects as the oil but it can also exacerbate cancers nevertheless Joyce Smith told me she's proof cannabis oil can make a difference

it's me Medical Mary and we're gonna have an RS snow day the first thing that you have to do is learn how to open one of these packages so there's usually place right up here where you squeeze it and boom there it is microscope packaging is a little different so when this is closed you have to pinch it and then squeeze it open so a lot of the irises are a little thicker and you don't want to break the packaging so I soaked them in a cup of hot water for about two minutes the Terrapin click cartridges can be a little tricky to open you have to pinch and pull and it's real easy because you just dial it up to pull it anything out so what do we put that stuff in a lot of people bake with it but I have a little trick package of starbursts take them flatten it out kind of like this you take the RSO you click out the amount that you want and you just put it on there and roll it up in a ball the Crisco dispensers are a little easier to use but harder to dose see you twist and pull on this and with the plunger you have to push out but not too much make sure you put the dose right in there put that right back on there and then that you have your starburst you roll that up into a ball and there's your nose from the road so that's my little trick on how to make one day with 2dos fine doses to carry with you why did the cattle keep coming back to the marijuana fields it was calling the cattle back that's my easy trick to make as many doses of RSO as you want and why did the cattle keep coming back to the marijuana fields it was the pot calling the cattle back you", "V_Tym8zyoGA": "-

level it's a whole nother level of Highness gross like it's a different thing but the problem with these it's so thick you have to warm it up so you kind of got a rubber in your hand a little but they heat it up because I really don't want to come out of the applicator that if you don't give it a little warmth so I usually just rub it in my hands if you don't want to taste it make sure you wet your mouth take a drink of something first before you eat it squirt oh right if you want to eat it it's squirting your tongue bloom swallow right down or what I usually do I'll get like a dab mat or silicone tray and just squirt up you know the mean point three point three point three throw it in the freezer they freeze on the pad and you can eat them right off their heart as a pill you can swallow them you don't even taste it at all or anything it's the only kind of pain in the butt about it is you got a warm enough to get it to come out of the okay now you get this part here comes in two pieces this part goes in bruges all which is not really good for like recovering addicts to turn these needles like this but it's real thick it like literally sticks to this cap anyone come out boom alright but let's just go right in my mouth was wet boom I went straight down I was only 0.1 of that still a little more it's kind of hard to get out man I started to freaking get out you litter better off boiling it in water and taking it ain't this before it dropped yeah if you keep your mouth wet it's up about 4.4 almost keep your mouth wet you really don't even taste it a little bit on my tongue there but terrapin it's nice for the price you just can't beat it if you ever see these around and want to try or I so highly recommend them their distance they're the same way $60.00 for the whole gram and you know Terrapins they're good you know they're not the best but they're definitely not the worst I don't think the price is awesome it's totally different than dabs like it's gonna take about probably 40 minutes to kick in [Music] this here you can't dab I wouldn't have this it's not it is I think so I love crass cos guerrilla blue I love it I love air or grass Reese's triple distilled too but I mean for the price of this it's just it's worth it to me if it's around I would grab this over any of the other but my second pick would be Cresco Gorilla Glue so they have a better applicator which I mean I like this new applicator but literally my fingers hurt from squeezing that thing on there yeah you guys are [ __ ] awesome make sure you I mean it's terrapin prices you just can't beat always jamming a trigger $11 I've bought an 11 grams multiple times right here Terrapin is the best bang for your buck well this just came out and it was $95 for a whole it is nothing and it this is downing dog mostly like little nuttin no big bugs but yeah it was good I ate I took the RSL yesterday like I said I took about I guess a little bit less than I thought I thought I took about 0.3 we'll try about 22 somewhere I got a little bit stuck on my tongue but uh it took about 45 minutes and then I kicked that it was real smooth mellow just an all-day your lit all day like it lasts if you take enough you'll be ripped for the whole day but they say like in the beginning just take like a grain of rice sized piece to start out but I've been eating for a little bit so I took a little little bit more but best bang for your buck well guess what Marilla glue is like what $7 $10 more than this I guess I mean alright this I just when I've just been around like indica blend even one way to the tea for me like that there's no such differences we don't even smoke on anything good anything how's this birthday today you know goshawk a wonderful day make sure you subscribe make sure you that like button hit that like button it is right up there bling bling bling bling and I'll have a great day or so wrongs it totally rocks she was just like an edible it's like exactly the same thing as an edible", "GeWKH9RxNZ8": "[Music] hello friends welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help all you find folks make sense of that weird kind of confusing i'm not really sure what i'm seeing here place you call your local dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at a kind of product we've been reviewing a lot recently uh and that is the good old-fashioned weed tincture the thc tincture i've been doing a lot of those uh recently i'm a big fan of thc tinctures but this one is a little bit different in that it is not just a tincture but it is actually my first foray into the sort of um i don't know what you would call uh the quasi-branded world of rso or also otherwise known as rick simpson's oil so rick simpson's oil is a very specific type of tincture developed by well the eponymous rick simpson maybe a canadian i'm not sure forgot didn't do my history um but it is a uh kind of tincture uh formulated in a specific way that's been around for many years now um and uh it is the sort of tincture method that many people swear by they say that this is the like most potent formulation of different kinds of tinctures um and again it is not too dissimilar it's um the process is different making rick simpson oil than other different oil methods but not crazy different um but it's also not like um a branded thing anybody can make their own rso uh normally comes in the way i see it most often is in a syringe form i think maybe that's the way uh it was originally sort of distributed as well the plastic syringe which is what i guess is in here this is the remedy rso relax tincture uh by cresco labs look at things from cresco before this is a sort of confusing conglomerate of a bunch of different companies uh i think cresco labs is maybe the distributor um and remedy is the people who are making it but then on our back with our lab information and all that fun stuff we do see some other uh names on there as well uh all these different companies have a variety of different umbrellas that they operate under so it's not too uncommon to not really be sure where this is from or who it comes from ultimately um but i'm just gonna call it under the umbrella umbrella of cresco um their name is on it a couple of places so we'll say it's a cresco product um but i do love this name that you see the url maybe for uh there if it'll uh focus there it is uh it's uh atla atlas sex tracks i mean of course it's just atlas extracts but when i first saw it because i guess maybe a pervert i don't know i just was like what the [ __ ] because it just blurted out to me as atla atlas sextrax which is a great name sex tracks if you're a punk band out there that one's for you so uh this tincture which i'm again not 100 sure what is going on in this big um rectangular piece of packaging there's something bulky and thin in there that's a contradiction in terms but um there's a long thin thing but that is also um got some girth to it um so we have a strange packaging here it looks like um actually kind of doesn't really fit it seems uh it doesn't really close properly it's got a little seal there at the top um but it's like these old bags you used to see old new bags from the recent changeover and california laws where they required these like seal child proof bags although that's gone out the window in the pandemic i have not seen anybody using those not sure why but now everybody's just using paper bags but it's one of those like obnoxious child seal packages i think the key is to open from underneath but they're all so obnoxious and this one's especially oh there we go okay ah and it is a big old syringe next things we need to know is how potent is this well this is 600 milligrams of thc in here as advertised as 601.1 milligrams that's quite precise and 2.2 milligrams of cbd uh the most amazing thing about this was the price i picked this up from what was once connected in long beach now as catalyst changed names on me recently uh dispensaries couple of them in long beach uh for only 30 bucks which is an outrageously good deal for a 600 milligram tincture now that is i i don't know if that's necessarily characteristic of rso but that is way darker than most oil you are going to see um especially in tincture um tinctures are going to be usually a bit lighter than that that's very very dark probably from the rso processes um i don't think this is true but they say the only ingredient in this entire thing here is cannabis um well so this is as i said 600 milligrams of thc it doesn't really know us any or doesn't really give us any specific um instructions in terms of dosing on what is what so i guess we'll have to do some math it's one gram that's 600 milligrams of thc we like to do about uh a hundred milligrams so um we'll go on the safe side we'll do a little bit extra so uh let's say it's 500 milligrams i would need to do what uh 0.2 grams to get about 100 milligrams a little bit less but i'll do 0.2 grams and that should be over uh 100 milligrams of thc so uh that is not a lot that's like down to here on our tincture syringe excuse me i'm gonna do it sublingually so i'm gonna maybe do i don't know see how much i can get under the tongue for now and then once i get it under there i'll leave it there for a little bit i'll annoy you like i do all of these just you know i'll swallow it after a minute or so uh and then um i'll uh do the last bit however much i have to do not sure we'll see how much comes out um like all of our wheat's reviews at that point i'll come back to you guys after about two hours let you know if this rso tincture is everything that i hope it to be and i do i've got some real expectations here um from the amount of praise i've heard about rso so let's get ready to relax with remedy by cresco labs oh [ __ ] oh my god wow uh you hear that right it's like tar when i was here huh all of my beard uh i am not oh well i'm back it's been a mild uh disaster here at wheat's hq with this rso i guess i really didn't know what i was in store for and now i've got hands that are gonna be sticky what feels like for a month i mean it feels like that uh gross feeling you get after you clean out your bong and it's been way too long you get that like just um an indestructible resin that's just permanently bonded to your hand and that's what's happened here it's just my hands are utterly gross and sticky as is my lip and a gross little patch of hair right here just sticky beyond belief um i was not expecting it to be like that as thick as that not nearly um i guess on me um i'm not sure how one would take that sublingually which is what the directions uh very clearly state on the packaging excuse me just through it they say take this sublingually you can't even reliably get it out of the applicator that reliably enough to take it sublingually um good news is uh i was able to salvage 90 percent or more of what uh came out uh actually probably quite a bit more than that uh the little bit that did not get in my system got under my fingers didn't really take it sublingually just took it probably can see to my teeth actually it's real gross um just took it uh swallowed it uh but i am now um more than halfway uh done i have done a little bit over uh one uh milliliter there um excuse me one tenth of a gram is that what they're measuring as is one gram i can't remember i think it says it's measured in grams and not milliliters which is odd but that's probably what should have clued me in that it was going to be so thick if they're measuring it in weight and not fluid uh by uh volume um but yeah uh so i have another uh one tenth of a gram to go uh i'm not gonna do it that way i'm gonna just uh take this um i'm gonna go pour like a drink and shoot some in there mix it up real nice and take it that way um and then that will get us to our one gram mark uh i would say my initial experiences with rso are um complicated but the proof is ultimately going to in how strong it is how if it makes you feel as good makes you feel as pleasant as it's uh many many fans and supporters say uh for that we'll have to wait a little over two hours i'm gonna work on getting this last half or so done in the next little bit um uh and i will also be doing a live stream so i hope uh it's obviously too late if you're watching this now but we do a lot of live streams now i'm gonna do one after i get this other half in uh so i hope to see you then otherwise i'll see you guys for the back half of this review sorry it's taking so long for this first part but we had a little bit of cleanup to do so see you guys soon let's hope the second half goes a little better bye-bye [Music] well hello again friends it's been uh right at actually two hours since our first check-in on our rso remedy relax journey experience extravaganza and if any of you are watching this that were happening be uh watching god i can't even say words our live stream uh that was going on in the middle of this review well then you know that um well uh i'm not sure it's a different high in any way shape or form than a traditional high but it is definitely a high um wowzer pauser uh this is disgusting um i forgot to tell you i how i did the other part i because i did you can see my syringe down to that point eight i just took it uh my original goal was to suspend it in some liquid swirl it around and drink it however it very much resists um being dispersed in another liquid it just mostly stays there as a big disgusting globule of oil um that looks disconcertingly like well um um i won't even say what it looks like a big uh oval shaped thing with a tail but it's black instead of another color um and uh just took it as if it were like the worm and athena tequila just down the hatch uh that was two hours ago and holy bananas um as the stream went on i just kept getting higher and higher and i feel still uh i feel quite high um hate the way this works um and i'm not even a hundred percent sure i actually uh it's it's good that i'm here um because i recapped this after i suspended it in my liquid but i'm not sure if it's going how well it's going to work going forward if there's like excess oil all over the place it's obviously incredibly sticky so maybe we'll experiment with that as well but i do have this to say uh as a kind of experience this oil is disgusting um and i don't want to have to consume it because it's just a big glob but taking it basically like a shot didn't taste it at all went down and this 600 milligrams is 30 was 30 bucks which is very reasonably priced and it this 100 milligrams or slightly more than 100 milligrams that i did um wow it is so potent um it is i don't know how to feel about it um maybe if you could continue to do it um pinch your nose stick it in some water and take it that way it's a really good deal and it's a really strong high let's see i'm curious to see how this resealing method is going to do um what am i going to do uh i guess i'll well shoot i don't even think about it um i promised i was gonna do it i better do it let's see if it still works uh-oh there it goes there it goes well plunge baby plunge ew ew go on oh oh and oh no oh no oh no oh no well there's gonna be a sticky spot somewhere that's what she said um and now i've done uh another tenth of that so it's gonna be a really fun night for me uh seems to seal just fine came right out so you know what it's disgusting it's gross you gotta figure out a way to do it um i seen online a lot of people take it with food like checking into food to each their own um if you can stomach it and you can find it at this price wow there's not much there's not a really a whole lot better out there for dollar to high ratio which is a pretty important one to me so that's been a fun experience our cresco remedy relax thc rso acronym letters hi fun good times wow i'm still kind of reeling at how high i am so that's been a really fun experience with the rso i don't even have composed thoughts other than it's gross but it's really good and for 30 bucks i am very impressed but it is gross so with that that's going to do it for this review i normally give you a cherry on top but oh my god that just seems so impossible right now i owe you one stay high more importantly stay healthy and i'll see all you guys on a future review bye", "lxrhXWVQT_g": "what's going on guys my name's rich can see and I am a 6-time cancer survivor and founder of 5-time foundation and today we're going to talk about a really hot topic cannabis oil and dosing aka I don't like using this term nobody should use it he was the founding father yes but it's not called Rick Simpson oil it is called eco full extract cannabis oil and before we start this is gonna be a video about dosing because there's a whole misconception about it but first I would like to give a shout out to a very special woman who was almost like a mentor and she is my mentor Robin Swan Firebird touch therapy I love you very much and thank you for changing my life for the better so we're dumped we're gonna jump right into dosing okay and there's a misconception and it's you know it's 60 grams in 90 days or a gram a day and you know what I'm sure it works yes it does work but you're gonna you're gonna you're not gonna function Dara Daley okay I don't care if you smoked for 20 years if you wait 100 brownies you're not functioning okay it's tough and this is just a more effective way to have your body saturate in it okay I look really time with the white t-shirt and the chain but let's get into it okay well we like to call it what she started was a thing called micro dosing and this is a really great way to start and this is the way to do it and it allows your body to saturate in this and and it really absorbs it and you're still able to function throughout the day and do your thing okay if you're taking a gram a day you're gonna be tripping balls somewhere in a bush or they're gonna just be sleeping a lot like you know mommy likes her valium like one it always you know you don't want to do that okay my crack jokes in this video once in a while they might not be appropriate but I hope you still share it so I had this little card here that they made I kind of memorized it but if I look down at it you know don't frown upon I still know what I'm talking about okay so like it says here you know first of all I want to say make sure you know you're getting there there are people out there who mean well and they want to make this oil and they're making they're freaking backyard okay good stuff ain't cheap and cheap stuff ain't good remember that know what you're getting you want that golden color you know that golden tint to it you want to you know if you can get the lab certificate you know that'd be great tells you the percentages you want that eighty percent mark it's it's gonna work okay um and like they said you know you want to work up to 150 to 300 milligrams a day you could do the math you know five grams syringe obviously if there's 800 gram 800 milligrams in here per you know the deal will get into a to another time that'll be another video okay so this is called micro dosing okay and instead of starting instead of starting in the morning we're gonna start at night and we're gonna work our way backwards and we'll get into that so pretty much it's gonna it's called micro dosing I know if I said that already we're gonna you're gonna unscrew this top you're gonna take a toothpick you're gonna slide that just a tip just a tip like in high school you take the tip the cannabis oil eat it whatever your bedtime is an hour before bed I'll take it 10 p.m. by 11:00 I'm feeling nice it goes off you're good to go do this for two three days if you feel like it didn't affect you then you could skip the two to three day thing you're gonna go for hours prior which would be if you took it at 10:00 p.m. it would be 6 p.m. so now after that third day take that toothpick again do it at 6 p.m. then again I 10:00 p.m. go to bed guess what do that for 3 days another 3 days you're gonna jump another 4 hours prior that would be 2 p.m. I had to look down I'm bad at math ok so you're gonna start at 2 p.m. with the toothpick 6 p.m. with the toothpick 10 p.m. with the toothpick your fourth dose for fourth dose will be at 10:00 a.m. okay after another 3 days your body should be getting accustomed to that toothpick dose and guess what you can either decide to continue this way start it backwards or the scheduled start at 10:00 a.m. and work your way down to 10 p.m. and see how you feel and increase the dose every week you know I think I go I just go just go with it you know if you feel like oh I really didn't feel that drop at 6:00 p.m. take a little bit bigger drop at 2:00 p.m. but remember you can always eat more you can never eat less okay so be cautious what you're dosing cuz this stuff is strong okay and it is you shouldn't have any crazy side effects except rip balls and you know if you get really that hot you can end up like panicking I don't know or sleeping too long forget the picky kiddo from school I don't know whatever you got going on with yourself okay but this is called micro dosing okay it's 2019 no disrespect to the founding father and all this stuff that's 60 grams and 90 days is just a whole new thing you know and and don't forget this is the this is the basic way of taking it there's other ways to use cannabis oil dabbing it smoking it guess what for lung cancer yeah people vape this stuff and it's healthy for you okay and for cancers like I've seen like in the lower back or like cervical : you know prostate suppositories okay look into this stuff do your research me and Robin are gonna go on Facebook live and do our own videos and we're gonna get deeper into this stuff but this was on my head and there's a lot of you know you know they people don't know they're not educated on it you know and this stuff is medicine and it helps people and it helped me and I'm excited about taking it this way because the other way I could not do I was getting too high I couldn't function throughout the day I got fat it's not a bad thing some people need to gain weight and eat I'm

and tricks for how you can use your RSO from anywhere really we have one here from move which tasted excellent had what seems like strong indications of an actual full-spectrum product here with actual CBD milligrams in it unlike what I've seen from truly where they don't even be be able to have a cannabinoid profile on it of CBD there's none whatsoever when finding a preferred intake method for your artisan you really either want to just take it straight since it's already activated or find a way to mix it into something that isn't going to be heated so I chose icing icings on top of a brownie I get to dose it as I please to each bite that I'd take I don't have to share it in the banner with everyone else because it's my icing in my medicine so this was honestly the best thing for everyone everyone still got to eat a brownie I got to keep the medicine to myself because I stuck my fingers in it and I enjoyed dosing smally as I ate my brownies like I was definitely able to watch how I was able to medicate from this rather than necessarily eat a big fat brownie per se and then find out how strong this RSO is but the reason you don't want to be actually reheating your RSO while cooking it into say a brownie batter is because when you start reheating your THC that's already activated you're actually going to degrade it into CBN which isn't necessarily something bad some people actually may like a higher percentage of CBN which can help you with all kinds of sleep and pain needs it's a great cannabinoid but it will definitely alter what the product was already if you were choose to heat it again say in the brownie batter rather than something like icing that's never heated again thanks again for watching Florida medical marijuana abuse", "yJ_82Qimufk": "hey guys are going to highlight Rick Simpson oil our so stands for Rick Simpson oil Rick Simpson is from Canada he got a head injury in 1997 and he was put on a ton of pharmaceuticals and it didn't really help with his with his injury and the symptoms he he would get dizzy he wasn't able to walk well he had short term memory loss he's very high blood pressure from all the pills so he had asked his doctor if he could get his cannabis farm because cannabis has been legal in Canada for god knows how long and his doctor would not prescribe it to him so he just went and did it anyway I did a little bit of research on him and he said that on with me decided to use cannabis was a show called the nature of things and it was an episode on cannabis and it was just healing people left and right it intrigued him to try it so again he went to his doctor and he got shot down for his medical card again but he continued to smoke and his symptoms for his head injury just kept getting worse and the medication isn't making it any better so he had to went to his doctor asking like hey you know what if I take the essential oils of cannabis and ingest that instead of smoking cannabis and the doctor had agreed that the medicinal benefits were much better but still would not give him a card so he decided to go ahead and make the extract enemies but he kind of got scared because he was thinking like you know they wouldn't they would not give him his card so there had to have like some bad side effects to the extract or smoking that something bad had to be part of it that they were not allowing him to do it so he just kind of sat on it for a couple of years in 2001 there was nothing more the docs could do they pretty much said you're [ __ ] out of luck shit's creek without a paddle we don't know how to help you so he then proceeded to ask for a card again they still denied him so he decided to go get these essential oils from cannabis that were the extract that was sitting on a shelf in his medicine cabinet and try it and they actually choked him [Music] sorry guys I took a lot of notes when he went home and took extract he had awesome results his thinking cleared up his arthritis got a lot better he had better blood pressure he had better memory he didn't have any more how do I say that Josh late he didn't have memory losses his memory got better yeah his memory got better sorry guys I'm super stoned his memory got better so yeah and I'll get before-and-after pictures for you guys on all of our social media accounts so you can see like the before and after pictures are ridiculous the resemblance between this guy and my dad so he just kept treating himself with cannabis extract in 2003 he weet TV doctor because he had skin lesions on his chest he had three of them on his arms he had one bite i'ii buy his nose and he was concerned they were cancerous and um they operate he wanted to operate on only a couple spots at the time so they operated on the spot by his note irv by his eye by his eyes sorry i can't read my own writing and they got inspected so he had heard this report on a radio in 1975 about cannabis curing cancer and this was in 1975 lake 30 plus your prior to 2003 and he thought it was BS that I mean it was 1975 there's no research or anything so I I mean I get it so he decided to put some of it anyways he decided to put some of the extract on the lesions on his arm and the one on his chest and he put a bandage over it and after four days he took it off they were pretty much gone because he wasn't thinking anything would have happened because when he put the extract on it made like the discomfort go away but really nothing else so like he was amazed and he told everybody and nobody believed him which I get it because 2003 still is pretty sheltered and I'm time marijuana so um about seven weeks later the spot that was operated on on his I came back and he decided the spots that were treated with the extract before and he decided to just go big and help anybody and everybody he could with his extract so that's a little bit about Rick Simpson who he is how he came about with the extract and I'm sorry my cat sneezing in the background here so now I'm gonna get a little bit into how our so is made um I I'll put links that I used Tilly take that let me try that again I'll put the links that I used in to take notes in the comment section of this conceit all of my references um pretty much you get an ounce of flour you have to do carve it um all flour is THC a before you d carbon or you put a plane to it in a bowl or blunt the flame is what turns activate THC aid so you have the psychoactive effects um to do car but all you have to do is put the bud up on a sheet pan grind it I know you've earned it after you decrepit sorry guys um put it on a sheet been in the oven for 220 at 225 for like 45 minutes and you're gonna want to check on it to make sure it doesn't burn if it does start burning it I turn it down a little bit because once you do that like I said before the THC a turned into plain THC and it's activated so once it's the carb do you grunt in the flour and put it into a mason jar I was gonna try and do it for you but here's the thing we're kind of gonna walk down again and ever here ever clear is a little bit hard to find so once all of this quarantine thing stops I'll make another video and show you guys how to make the Rick Simpson oil um so once you get the flour out of the oven you grind it you put it in a mason jar and you fill the mason jar with Everclear just enough to cover the flour and then you shake it and stir it really good and like if you have a mortar and pestle kinda just grind the bud up with the Everclear for about 10-15 minutes until it turns to like this almost mud green kind of color and then you put it in cheesecloth in a strainer and just strain it and then you have to reduce it in a double boiler you just boil water and put the jar in the water and boil it for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours until it reduces to pretty much nothing and when it's done it you put it in the syringes I do have an RSO syringe though guys it's from grassroots and from my local dispensary justice ground in Pennsylvania uh you see what I mean it's really dark from the bud just sit when you put the Everclear and you shake it this particular syringe is a garlic cookies are so it's one gram it's from grassroots and it is an eighty-two percent THC 2.4 percent CVG 1.7 percent THC point nine one percent of CBC wait four seven five of th TV and point one four four of cbn and if you don't know what those are I'm gonna start on Tuesdays a video series about different terpenes and cannabinoids all right there is another type of syringe called THC distillate it's fully activated like the lake er so syringes but the distillate process takes all of the impurities out so it's the purest form of cannabis you can consume and it's not necessarily just a syringe it could be any kind of concentrate a wax a shatter a crumble Beach then so on and so forth so um pretty much would a THC distil is translucent little devoid of all the undesirable compounds from the original plant it's one like I said it's one of the most popular forms of cannabis it's really not any flavorful so a lot of the people who manufacture the displacer and just add terpenes like limonene Karpin allene nice or myrrh seem so you can get that cannabis flavor that you get from the flower so distillate process is like huge long process and I don't have the attention span to even watch a video to figure out how it is but it starts with butane hash oil and then they put it through distillation process where they take out all of the impurities from the BHO and then they turn it into like I said any kind of concentrate one of the distillate syringes right now I have a distillate syringe from allure healthcare essentials it is the blueberry blunt I'll show you guys the difference between a be THC distillate and the RSO it's definitely a noticeable difference shake this is the THC distillate if you remember the are so syringes like is much much darker than the hologram it out because you see the difference in color so that's about all I have for you guys today [Music] feel free to subscribe to our channel and check out our merchandise store on bonfire

"0y2EiO7UNxM": "[Music] how to use the precise dosing applicator from sir taro wellness first remove the protective cap and set it aside the color of the cap indicates which product formula you're using so be sure to hold on to it the first time you use a new precise dosing applicator you'll need to prime it by twisting the device two or three times to remove any air bubbles you'll feel it click as you twist to dispense the product you want to twist the device very slowly remember the pure reserve oil is highly concentrated the top of the device will rise to reveal these black lines these lines are small but they're extremely important to monitor closely now that you have your desired dose gently push the top of the precise dosing applicator down you'll see the pure reserve oils start to dispense from the metal tip of the applicator and there you go the precise dosing applicator makes it easy to see and dispense the exact amount of oil you need with less mass and less potential for wasted product", "_BDg1eBJRWc": "[Applause] get over there folks what is going on my name is Steve Stevenson with melih marijuana review that was James Brown the king of soul with sex machine young James man I like James Brown he's a good guy I've been watching uh I don't watch a lot of TV or TV shows or series of anything I'm more of an educational individual but um I've been watching tales from the tour bus a Mike Judd the creator of all beavis and butthead king of the hill yeah he's doing our videos on musicians it's very entertaining I'm not a spokesperson for him but it's something I've been watching and I yeah thought I would say that huh so yeah let's get into the review today my name is Steve Stephenson this is male marijuana review and I'm bringing you my honest opinion on the things that I personally buy but I just did my first review for the day that was some diamonds and we're gonna step it up a notch with the grass roots or if so sitting at 81.28 THC I don't know that any of that's going to come in but we're gonna do our best to show it anyways so from Laura so last last time I had a lesser that was grass roots it was a little bit less than caliber I want to say was in the 60 range or low 70 something like that and I asked myself a personal question what difference really does 10% make actually it makes a good bit of difference I was surprised by and like I said maybe it's just me because I don't eat wheat a lot I've just started eating weed here since I started doing these reviews I'll be damned so yeah this is a crush mix I believe yeah yeah push mix Oso so this doesn't have a specific oh yeah it sounds like it's a mix of cush buds which I'm not complaining you know I'm just here to give the review I got this from nature's medicines on route 40 these things are typically supposed to use something along the lines of a a grain of rice I believe is the the standard applicator I don't know that that's going to work for me and usually I put this in a gel capsule I get gel capsules from a place in Eldersburg next to the Super Walmart they've got a yeah they saw those gelatin capsules I get them for all kinds of stuff you know like anything that you don't really want to ingest so we're going to take a dab of this and try to eat it they've never I can't say I've never done it like this I just preferred not to do it like this I don't like to feel this stuff on my teeth okay that's hmm the taste is very good [ __ ] actually the taste is really flavorful it's in my arm its encompassing the whole palate and it's it's taken over my must scent like maybe a gal alone hmm [ __ ] Houston I don't think I can burn this [ __ ] off my finger either maybe I can dab it but yeah needless to say um after eating it like that and not putting in a gelatin capsule I'm assuming it's gonna hit a little quicker and harder I still poke a little hole in my gelatin capsules because time release I don't have time for that true story so um I feel it all over my beard in my teeth it's like stuck to the top of my mouth it's very piney it's it's a good taste I mean if I got done smoking a bowl and I you know glob some of that [ __ ] in my mouth they'd be good to go hmm oh no well see but this is a [ __ ] this is push mix grassroots cannabis or s oh I like last roots um at least there are a series I'm not sure the place I go to for weed is uh nature's medicines on route 40 typically I'm not a spokesperson for you I'm not even loosely affiliated with them it's just a place that I get a lot of my buds they have a lot of selection but um yeah damn I'm all come together but this was good stuff like I say this is a my personal opinion DuBose is superior it hits hard yeah I don't even think it's uh it's coming up on like 11 o'clock I've been up for been up since 8:00 and uh yeah that's why put me back down but nonetheless folks this has been Steve stephenson with mail and marijuana review wishing you a personal Merry Christmas whatever you celebrate Yule celebration this is the start of my you'll season whatever it is y'all getting to do it well do it safe and I'll try your best to enjoy thank you

have surgery last week and what was it Saturday night I started throwing up and it put on until this morning so hopefully it is done it over with and we will be doing better so today I'm going to talk a little bit about RSO and I freeze my or so and what I do exactly how I process my RSO what I do I've had a lot of questions with people asking fruit what happens when you freeze it what does anything happen to it when you freeze it a PEZ how you doing sweetie let me go ahead and share this out and I will be right with you so I have a fun day planned we are going to do a few videos today one we have an unboxing to do well you know that's one of my favorite things to do it is a blast I love it so we have a daily high club box ready to go we are going to got a shared out almost done one more and I will be right with you how is everybody I hope everybody had a great weekend I am so sorry I missed you guys yesterday I started throwing up again yesterday morning and it's just been hell in a handbasket so I decided what better way to start off this week's videos than with Amy in Stowe's so give me just a moment okay let's do this so I have my maintenance dose already here it's already measured up it's 2 grams of Rick Simpson oil all I do is I take a regular clean q-tip take it around the frozen part now because it's been sitting here a little while it has started to unfreeze but it's not too too bad it's still holds form pretty well so basically I'm gonna take I'm gonna take this frozen chunk of ours so I'm gonna put it in my mouth and swallow it down and try not to taste anything because the taste is horrific and the taste you will burp it up for a couple of hours after eating it for those of you that don't do Rick Simpson oil on the regular this would knock anybody out actually a little pea-sized bit would knock anybody out but because my body is so used to doing it on a weekly basis it helps me function so as always guys [ __ ] cancer and that's it swallow it down and off we go so I went ahead I know this is a quick video it is actually really really simple you don't swallow that RSO down it goes to your intestine melts down it gets into all those bluesy crap crevasses and creeps now let me tell you when it has when I'm having GI issues or bowel issues RSO helps me out phenomenally it takes a lot of gas pressure away it takes a lot of that gas pain away because I have all sort of colitis that pain in your intestines is there quite often so it is difficult hey Michelle Ken how you doin I'm so glad they're hanging in there I made gummy pot leaves yesterday for those of you guys that are on my Instagram I was actually gonna bring one out here and I was gonna eat one and I totally forgot to grab one so we will do that onto one of the other shows that I do today will eat one of that little pot gummies but they are so good the the taste I mean the only way I could really describe it is it's like a berry pop it is so good and I started the new weed balls so I'm gonna grab the new wheat ball want you guys to see it I'm so excited it looks so cool so I have just started this this is the newest wheat ball these are actually pot leaves that I am putting them on this ball this one we will give it away when we hit 2000 subscribers so you guys have a chance at waiting your very own little wheat ball the only thing I do require is that you hit that subscribe button at the bottom of this page and join the ladies family that is it and you can get a beach ball of your own so let's do this we are gonna smoke and then I'm gonna set up for an outside review because we do still have our week reviews to do today we still have all kinds of fun stuff and we have a box open I see Monday yeah this is my happy Monday my happy Monday was spent with my kidding 20 so I apologize guys I do like to be here Monday through Friday between 10 and 11 I really do but you do not want to see me yesterday and what I wouldn't make you to never want to be crying it was not pretty and so not pretty so I have my little eyes the lead shirt on today we are out here and about we are going to breach that free the lead you know it helps so many people at this point in time if you haven't tried it might as well we don't want to try it I get that I understand it's kind of the same way that I don't want to be out opening lights anymore so I got that I totally totally get that and I wouldn't force anybody on that however I will say that I have found much better practices in smoking cannabis to help with my pain and with my anxiety and with my stress levels than I have the joyful feelings so you know with the cannabis I don't get constipated which is so amazing I don't know I can't handle the constipation anymore so and those opioid constipations are like the worst so I have here I made a little bit of I cleaned out my oil rigs so this is some oil resin it actually tastes kind of like a butter cream it's really kind of it's really good I'm going to guess that it has a lower THC basically what I do is I take Everclear and I run my borrowing Everclear through my loyal bonds or throw my lil rigs and clean it out and then I boil that Everclear off and then I can smoke it like so so as always guys [ __ ] cancer I guess I could turn it on [Music] so one thing that I do want to make very clear that when you are doing this anytime you're working with butane especially large bottles like what I'm doing make sure you do it in a well-ventilated area you don't want to be sucking that down it's I mean I wouldn't put my lips on it you don't want to do that so make sure you do have a well ventilated area we built this into our window so it's safe and secure and we can keep this venting out which is nice and then right outside it I can see both and so I can pretend that we go out on the water at some point done so that is pretty much it for today or for now we are gonna do an unboxing and a week review today still yet so don't forget to hit that subscribe button don't forget to keep watching me out I am going to set up my other studio outside human moment and then we are going to start our next week review good man trying to see what we're doing our next we'd review on I think it's Liberty haze and blue dots I think but I'm not a hundred percent sure I got full book out and it's not out yet so and don't forget we have a daily high club unboxing so stay tuned guys I will be back and we were gonna have some fun today have a great day guys more Mad Love as always", "hwhUjdXVwyY": "I hope my YouTube subscribers so I wanted to go ahead update you guys it's officially now one month and three days since I started the Rick Simpson oil protocol also known as fecal full extract kind of a soil so definitely I've been taking it very very well I'm taking a lot more so I'm going to show you guys at the end of the video how much I'm consuming now at this 4 plus week mark basically over a month so the goal that I'm trying to achieve here is to get an undetectable thyroglobulin number on my blood work I just recently did blood work on Friday and on Saturday morning so I'm gonna get those results this week I'm not sure if I'm gonna use that too much because I barely have a month using our so so I'm not really gonna expect an undetectable number because that's what I'm aiming for and that's what the doctors are aiming for and in order for them to classify me as cancer-free also in their terms it is called disease-free or no sign of disease which is NSD so I'm trying to get no sign of disease in my body at this time and the only way that will be for sure no that is if we check the thyroid globulin numbers and they basically have to be undetectable right now I'm at zero point zero zero point zero three okay I have to be at nothing basically the blood work shouldn't even be putting any number on that part of the blood work if it's gonna be considered undetectable so I'm going to show you guys a chart of what I've been going through these past few months as far as my numbers so on the first in the beginning of this year which is January 2018 which is the first line where it says TG that stands for thyroid globulin so sorry globulin was 37.6 in January which is realistic because at that time I didn't have the neck dissection yet I still had a lot of lymph nodes that had positive for papillary cancers so you know we had to go based on newer results as you can see as the time went on March it was 3.2 that's literally a few days a week after actually a week after my neck dissection okay so that's a huge improvement from 37.6 to 3.2 but I have to be undetectable so as you see I win from 3.2 to 0 which is great this is great so even though that I have great numbers here the doctors for some reason still wanted me to do external radiation immunotherapy of course I did go ahead and get a first opinion I mean a second and a third opinion the first opinion was the aggressive way which is to give me more radiation as I explained in the other video I sought a second opinion and the second opinion says well we don't need to do radiation right now let's just do it me no therapy immunotherapy is literally like for my understanding so far is and basically infusions so injections and infusions into your body to help with your immune system and I learned about this when my second opinion doctor sent me an authorization for his services even though I didn't actually tell him that wasn't do it I just said I'll think about it and here prove me for this all these services which is crazy like look at all these codes for immunotherapy well I'm not gonna do it either because my third opinion says I don't need it I'm too young for all of that to happen right now my numbers are looking great as you guys saw that my numbers have dropped that's why it's a good idea till we seek second and third opinions so for my third opinion I went to USC CAC Medicine and they literally looked at my whole case because my case is a little like fluctuated because of the way that they treated me and that radiologist agreed with me that it's okay for me to be to the beast going under active surveillance I don't need to do radiation he says that it's too it's too harming for my for me as cuz I'm too young he performs that external radiation every single day that's what he does and he says that the side effects from that are gonna be a lot worse for me so it's better not to do that I don't my cancer is literally like slow growing now but it's all at least I know it's always available if I run out of options or if I find out that Rick Simpson oil didn't help or something happens and and if I have terrible symptoms and maybe I'll consider it in the long long final run but I'm not gonna let these doctors get to my head tell me I need all this stuff when in fact I actually do not so I'm happy that I sought those authorizations I was complaining with the insurance letting them know hey you know this isn't fair you know I need to get where I want to be I need to go with a doctor that's updated with the most recent information based on my complicated case and they ended up saying that yeah we'll send you there after a big fight they ended up approving me to go there so I had to fight to get there just wanted to give you guys some insight about how I got to my third opinion don't give up if you feel like you're being pressured by your doctor or any new doctor you barely even know the doctor do not always just take their advice there's nothing wrong with getting a second even a third opinion take your time you know because honestly now that I've learned this much I really wish I would have done this when I first got diagnosed like I really wish then that I would have sought a second opinion and got everything like my first surgery like done well instead of having two different surgeries things would have been a little bit I mean a little different but I learned and Here I am like still you know going through it so that's my advice to everybody if you feel like pressured by a doctor or telling they're telling you that you need an aggressive treatment or anything that doesn't sit well with you go ahead and seek another opinion sometimes they won't tell you about other options that may help you or maybe open to you don't give up you know there's just too much you know information out there you can easily like ask them anything and don't let them rush you and also bring your documents this is literally a whole year years worth of imaging and everything since I got diagnosed so I don't play around I have everything so that when I wanted a doctor they have no excuses I have it all you know so that's that's my insight and my advice on getting yourself proper diagnosis proper treatments and proper care because we all deserve it I also wanted to share with you guys that I did get my state medical marijuana card I got it obviously you know to have my back up and just to pretty much have it on hand since this is related to a medical condition so it looks like this it doesn't have any information on it as far as your private information it only had identified you as an ID number and an expiration date so it looks like this so that's ID number myself and then the Department of Public Health so I recommend getting it just for backup there are gonna raise the prices of your in California eventually so you can have this and they'll take away the tax and also I may be seeking for further for future positions and I wanted to just be able to present it even if you know marijuana still considered illegal under federal law but still I wanted to make sure that any employer that hires me I'm gonna be you know ingesting oil by then I'm sure so I'm gonna be positive for marijuana so I just wanted to make sure I covered all my bases and you know it's just good to always make sure that when you're out there ingesting it you know try to hop back up otherwise if you don't need it then it's fine all right so here are the syringes I mentioned in the first video that I didn't that I said I didn't order separate syringes what I meant is that I didn't get separate 15 of these single grams there's literally there was 10 grams in here or 10 milliliters okay this right here was at the 10 I have now consumed 1 2 3 4 5 grams 5 milliliters of Rick Simpson oil efficiently so I keep this one by the kitchen the fat one because I eat I'm passing by the kitchen most of the times I'll eat this and then I have one upstairs in my room this one has 5 milliliters also known has 5 grams so I probably haven't jested like what 2 grams yeah that's to 2 grams so and in basically a month in 3 days what I've adjusted 7 grams so that means I need I need to order 45 more grams so that's like almost over $100 worth but I'm doing it little by little because it's a financial thing I'm not working right now so I got to get it little by little but I'm glad but I'm trying it out I'm really really striving for this and I'm gonna show you guys how much I am now in taking but definitely and the first video I also mentioned that I was putting in bread cuz I was getting to know the texture getting to know the oil getting to know the way it's gonna get stuck on my teeth now I understand why people just take it out and then they put it under their tongue and let it sit there a while and then and then you can just eat it so I've been doing that so I don't have to get bread plus I don't even eat bread like that so I just was like I thought I'll just do it that way it was it's faster plus when I'm on the go or something also yeah and I now I adapted now I can have a dose in the morning and I don't not not even my eyes are red not even and my feeling I'm nothing I just feel like a totally normal sober when I hit my 2nd or almost to my third dose that's when I feel the high of the day so I wait till the end of the day to because I already know I'm done working I'm sorry doing errands are working out or doing whatever then that's when I will take the rest so if you think you know you're gonna be really really really faded yeah you probably will be in the first few weeks I can say around third to fourth week fine like I can hit this all day and I'm fine nothing you know nothing will happen also it's really really oily like it literally sticks and it looks like this like [ __ ] oil straight up so this is how much I can now take so I'll be before I started here which was like a little dose now I can take this much or more but I can pretty much take this lunch and then I just put it under what's on there you go I'm just leaved there wearing it a little bit nice hole oh this is pretty good so used to it I totally get why people are saying that it really helps them like I'm really glad I found you know this protocol that people have been doing I really hope it works for me and I really hope it works for you so if you have any questions or anything like that let me know I'm gonna probably update another video maybe in a few weeks or a month I don't know whatever you if you guys have any suggestions let me know I'll probably do another one like a two month follow-up because this is literally what like 90 days that I'm supposed to be doing this so stay tuned guys I'm gonna go ahead and keep updating if there's anything else you guys want me to talk about or I didn't clarify or anything like that let me know because I know a lot of us that have hot thyroid cancer or have current Theret cancer is very confusing and all that so I'll see you guys later enjoy your guys's day bye", "75uA97peU98": "On RSO suppositories RSO stands for Rick Simpson oil which is a concentrated form of cannabis made using an alcohol extraction process It comes in about a 1 gram syringe, so it'll look something like this and can find at most dispensaries What you find with suppositories is you get extended pain relief that lasts for a very long time without being Unable to function throughout your day one hour patients come in they're usually treating something like Crohn's disease or they have a severe lower back pain or sciatica or Sometimes they'll even use suppositories to deal with their menstrual cramps as well When making suppositories, what you're going to need is your RSO coconut oil or cocoa butter or some combination thereof? You're going to need you're suppose to Tory molds a syringe or a funnel something that you can pour the suppository into the mold with you're gonna need a heating element and you're also going to need a freezer and Plastic gloves for the end as well. The ratio I'm going to be using is with coconut butter I'm gonna be having about a hundred grams of coconut butter. You can also use cocoa butter or a combination thereof whatever combination works best for you a Hundred grams of coconut butter looks about like this And the first thing I'm going to be doing is taking it and actually getting it liquid So I'm going to be throwing it into the stove here and heating it up on low heat The coconut butter will melt very quickly. So you need it on a low temp so you're not burning it Again, the ratio I'm using right now is about a hundred grams of coconut butter to 1 gram of RSO Some places we'll have our so available in 10 grams. This is one gram right here as You can see this is kind of like a more runny consistency here So it's gonna be a little hard to get all out at once so this is just What it looks like when you're combining the RSO? with the coconut butter as you can see It starts to get a little more of just like an overall brownish greenish color to it You just want to make sure that when you're stirring it up here that you're not seeing any clear lines It wants to be thoroughly mixed This is the color that the RSO and coconut butter turned out for me for my suppository mix If you use coconut oil or cocoa butter or a combination of any of those oils or if you even use two grams So instead of one you're gonna have some color variation and that's okay Okay, so as you can see here, what I have ready to go is the RSO is really mixed. Well with that coconut butter So what I'm going to be doing next is I'm going to be using this syringe here to draw it out of this pot here And actually place it into our suppository molds. Both of these things you can get at any local pharmacy or online I definitely recommend using something that's easy to tear apart like this too because you get single dosing as well So then over here this is gonna be Here What I usually do is I put the suppository Moulds into a cup like this because it's really easy to fill them up and just be ready to go I'm not using both hands. I can actually do it like this, but for this video I'm actually going to hold it out So you can see it this way when you're filling them You kind of just pop them right into there and you'll start to see it fill up The part that I usually stop at is just where this little bend is here The main thing is to make sure that each part of the bullet is filled up at the bottom and there isn't any air bubbles in there And the third one It does come out really slowly so you got to be patient with it if you try to rush it You can spill out your suppository mold everywhere, and that's no good Perfect So when they're done? When you look down into them You'll be able to see just a little bit of the oil right there when they're filled up They're ready to go into the freezer or into your fridge to set Once the suppository molds are all filled. You're gonna want to put them in the freezer for about 15 to 20 minutes if you don't have room in your freezer, you can put them in the refrigerator you're just gonna want to wait a little bit longer because what you want to make sure is that the Suppositories are completely solid before you start taking them out of their package It's gonna actually look a lot like how the original coconut butter did before we started mixing it So I'm just gonna put these in the freezer It's been about 10 minutes now the suppositories should be ready to come out of the freezer Don't forget to put on gloves when you're using your suppositories because that coconut butter will kind of make your hands a little oily, too So when you've got your cup here The suppository molds here are nice and solid some suppository molds come perforated like these ones here so you can just break one off Some of them though, you're gonna have to cut so keep an eye out for that one to try and get the preffer ated ones So this is the one dose suppository still in its mold. It's not ready to go just yet We need to actually take the suppository out of this plastic casing some suppository moulds We'll have a little preparation right on the end here This one doesn't so I'm actually going to have to take it some scissors and cut it here just to get it started Just like that there and then what you'll do here is you'll tear it open Just like that and This is your suppository. You're ready to go See, I've only been holding on to it for a few minutes while making this video and it's already starting to liquify and get really oily all over my hands which is why you want to make sure you're using gloves when you're Inserting it and applying it also when you're inserting it You're gonna only need to put it about as far as one knuckle deep You don't need to go much further than that, and there may be a little bit of mess afterwards But the pain relief is definitely worth a little mess because everybody's body processes THC and CBD a little bit differently You're going to want to make sure that your monitor how your body is reacting to using Suppositories by even just taking a note and checking in on how you're feeling every hour what I like to do is I'll actually set an alarm on my phone to go off and then I'll actually put notes on my Phone so that I can monitor how it's worth", "8mj6E0-aLLo": "what is rso and why did rick simpson create it as simpson describes it it all began in 1997 when he was working as an engineer in a canadian hospital as a result of a dramatic sequence of events he was exposed to toxic fumes before falling off a ladder and being knocked unconscious after going to the er simpson recovered quickly but he suffered from constant dizziness and tinnitus unfortunately the drugs prescribed to him only made things worse despite the challenges simpson encountered he was about to realize something very important in spite of his doctor's dismissal of what was still a taboo subject simpson began smoking cannabis after watching a documentary on medical marijuana as a result of using marijuana simpson's ringing in his ears reduced pharmaceutical medications hadn't helped him however a type of skin cancer basal cell carcinoma was diagnosed on simpson in late 2002. simpson returned to the marijuana plant with a renewed intensity further research led to an intriguing idea how about topical marijuana directly applied to the cancer a study published decades ago in the national cancer institute's scientific journal offered some inspiration a 10-day treatment of animals with delta 9 thc beginning the day after tumor implantation results in a dose-dependent effect that retards tumor growth keeping this in mind simpson harvested his usual cannabis flower made a crude extract and placed a few drops on band-aids when he put these directly onto cancerous lesions and removed them four days later he says he found no signs of cancer simpson experimented with cannabis oil different extraction methods and solvents in his quest to provide cannabis oil to others a highly purified decarboxylated substance was selected after extensive trials and errors by simpson a substance that was well suited to both oral and topical use how cbd oil differs from rso cbd oil is diluted and contains little to no thc rso can reach levels of up to 90 thc when undiluted although cbd oil and rso are both cannabis infused oils they differ more than they are similar rso is a pure thc rich extract while cbd oil is diluted cbd rich and is often mixed with carrier oils rick simpson oil has much greater versatility than cbd oil which is a sublingual and oral drug the pharmaceutical differences are significant as well rick simpson oil's high thc content interacts the strongest with cb1 receptors throughout the brain's central nervous system this medication may also affect the serotonin 5-ht2a receptor which impacts memory development and learning being a concentrate of thc rso has a strong sedative effect as well simpson himself describes it as narcotic this can be very beneficial for cancer patients who may suffer from chronic pain and significant adverse reactions to chemotherapy and other treatments newbies on the other hand can be overwhelmed by the effects additionally making rso is less effective than other extraction options which may lead to a reduction in beneficial terpenes that influence cannabis effects there is not much activity on the brain's psychotropic receptors when it comes to cbd oil because of this it does not cause a high though it may mildly activate serotonin 5 ht1a receptors and thereby relieve anxiety but cbd's unique molecular structure enables it to extend beyond the endocannabinoid system activating trpv1 receptors and for receptors which may reduce inflammation rso may still be more effective for pain relief however because of its high thc content different medical conditions and health needs will determine which oil is most appropriate for each individual it may be appropriate to apply both oils perhaps at different times especially since rso can be intoxicating cbd oil could even be effective in reducing the psychoactive effects of high thc can rick simpson oil be used to treat cancer some patients claim that rick simpson oil went beyond just pain relief and actually cured their cancer but this is still purely anecdotal and no scientific studies have examined the use of rso to treat cancer in rick simpson's traditional cannabis oil cancer treatment the end goal is to expose cancer to ultra-high doses of thc which will kill it early research indicates that thc may induce program cell death apoptosis in cancer cells by causing them to produce more ceramide a fat that eats away at them it is possible that another of the cannabis terpenes limonene also promotes apoptosis in addition via activation of ampk thc may help shift metabolism towards fat burning dr bob melamed a molecular biologist says this is a big deal with more fat metabolism comes a lower level of free radical production and a more aerobic cellular environment these subtle shifts in dna sequences have been discovered to be protective in the fight against cancer although rick simpson oil has only been anecdotally proven to be an effective cancer treatment there is no definitive conclusive evidence of its effectiveness yet although cannabis has a relatively clear role in trying to treat the symptoms of chemotherapy more clinical research will be needed before rso can be considered a potentially effective cancer treatment rick simpson oil may offer other benefits testimonials indicate that rso may lower blood pressure enough to reduce or eliminate the need for high blood pressure medications any prescription changes should be discussed with your doctor further patients who take marijuana to treat diabetes talk about reducing or stopping their use of exogenous insulin while taking rick simpson oil that's because thc has been found to be a powerful insulin sensitizer it is also possible that rso may decrease diabetic's risk of having further complications such as neurological damage that are often accompanied by the disease research has also shown that rso is an efficient agent against pain whether cancer related or not that makes it an attractive alternative to opiates of which the overuse has led to epidemics all over the world there is some evidence that cannabis in patients taking opioids for chronic pain has an opioid sparing effect where patients who use medical cannabis require fewer opioids but this relationship is still under dispute the potential side effects of rick simpson oil given rick simpson oil's high thc concentration careful dosing is necessary given the oil's consistency as with other thc concentrates rso can result in side effects and these can be minimized with careful planning it is important to consult your doctor before using rso since both concentrates and rso have high thc concentrations side effects are more likely to occur in the wrong individual thc can result in cognitive impairment memory problems and even psychosis it may also lower blood pressure so caution should be exercised by those with a history of hypotension or taking medications to deal with blood pressure where can you buy rick simpson oil rso isn't as easy to find in dispensaries as you might think in dispensaries across medical and adult use states you can find high thc concentrates and oils but very few have the same levels and concentrations as those described by rick simpson rick simpson has also noted that there are a number of independent websites in california that are selling products labeled as rso and made by different companies with thc levels as high as 70 percent however he clarifies that these are specific products if you are purchasing a sample of rso online make sure you are dealing with a reputable company and that the analysis comes with a certificate of analysis that is current please consult your doctor before changing any medications this is for educational purposes and is not medical advice i am not a medical doctor or a scientist thank you have a great day video by my420spot.com [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "exIABukh7PM": "hey guys today is day 75 of taking Rick Simpson oil or RSO or FEC oh so full extract cannabis oil and Wow kinda I'm getting into the flow of it I'm getting in the rhythm it's been 75 days I am at the full one gram a day dose which is really exciting to be feeling like okay I'm taking the full dose I'm doing it all of the healing is going to happen and is happening so for anybody just tuning in to these videos I have a really rare form of Crohn's disease that attacks my GI tract and causes a lot of bleeding and open wounds throughout my entire GI tract as well as tumors in my bones in my spine and my femur that are crazy crazy painful and so I've been doing this protocol to work to heal them so where we are right now I wanted to give you a couple updates of some changes in what's going on yesterday was the first day I was able to add in some CBD only so I've been taking the concentrate made out of Gorilla Glue so it's homegrown Sam and I made it and now I've been able to have some access to some concentrated oil that CBD only from LeBeau and Joe's CBD which is amazing there are two rad guys out of Massachusetts that are making this beautiful farm-to-table farm-to-table farm - its kind of farm-to-table depending on how you ingested a beautiful extract and so I'm adding that in and I did 1/10 of a gram orally yesterday and in addition to the full gorilla glue THC suppositories with RSO that I've been making and today was really exciting actually because I woke up in the morning and I felt a little less like hungover and wiped out and had a little less brain fog this morning waking up that was just with a 1/10 of a gram orally added in last night so I'm really excited and really hopeful about adding that CBD in to hopefully balance out some of the brain fog and the other side effects of it as well as for all of the other amazing properties that CBD can bring to the experience I mean I'll go into that a little bit more detail and some other videos but there's some research and some accounts being done of what's the best streams to help heal whatever you're taking the cannabis concentrates for and CBD has been shown to help a lot with breast cancer and especially estrogen induced problems or illnesses diseases whatever you want to call them another thing that has been interesting is my hormones have always been really regular at least my menstrual cycle has been really regular ever since I got my first period when I was 10 actually so every like 28 or 29 days I'm usually pretty exact but since I've been starting on the RSL protocol my cycles have been a whole lot shorter so right around 25 days and a lot more period cramps and symptoms and really really really hormonal and emotional and like all the tears the waterworks factor is like super on like a couple days before and during my period so that's been interesting and I'm so I'm interested about like the correlation between the cannabis and the hormones in my body since the your hormones affect your menstrual cycle so all that being said 75 days it's because I didn't can't believe I made it this far 26 days left for me to get the full 60 grams of RSO within 90 days so that I'm still counting only for the concentrated THC RSO and so I'll have some additional grams of the CBD on top of it all right I hope everybody has a beautiful day and thanks for checking in with me", "b6DP4pI4igs": "yo what's good everybody j ping here checking in live respectmyregion.com i am here with a west coast wheat tour review today's product is a cannabis extract it is the full spectrum oil whoops from emerald bay extracts here in california this is a blue dream rso so one gram syringe squeeze it on out we're looking at thc 79.35 percent 70 793.5 milligrams cbd 1.7 milligrams so this is definitely more of a sativa dominant product not so much a lot of cbd inside of it just a little bit though to give it that enrage effect pick this up at the royal healing emporium and lamb poke so super dope product we're gonna get this on open i'm gonna do a small tasting of it and then give you guys um you know kind of like describe the taste the flavor any kind of immediate feelings things like that so important to know that rso is rick simpson oil it is ideally what kind of got cannabis legalized in a lot of senses is the medicinal properties that this kind of product really brings smoking does a lot for a lot of people but unfortunately it just isn't healthy for a lot of people as well so you think about cancer patients needing a true product and that's where this medicinal item comes into play the syringe again full plant extract here we go check this out you guys so definitely something you want to keep away from the kids keep away from pets all that good stuff this is real real real medicine y'all so for me i use sativas and cbd's cbd rsos for my ibs i treat my back pain i've got some spine issues and some some things like that and so um you know the long hours on the road and standing and even doing these videos and things like that i have to kind of be aware of managing my my pain and my symptoms and cbd desert and and these blue dream rso specifically do a really good job of helping with that so all we're going to do here is open this on up i think i can just yep twist right there give you guys a view oh oh oh oh oh let me just say oh yeah i can just twist off that cap there we go there we go all right all right so it's pretty simple uh you can run hot water over it to squeeze it out um this one should be good though yeah nothing too hard um when it comes to the amount that you're supposed to do ideally you want to do a great rice or a grain size piece i'm gonna do about half of that just because it's the middle of the day for me and i've already smoked and stuff so i don't need this by itself right now i like to put it underneath the tongue it tends to work a little quicker flavor-wise this is supposed to taste like weed you're definitely not trying to mask it there's no sugar nothing like that it's 100 plant extract you can see it kind of stains the fingers just a little bit i don't think i got any of my teeth but yeah it's a very much a high quality product meant for patients meant for people in need of strain specific effects i do enjoy rso products that blend strains you know a high thc product with four strains in it is awesome but i also like you know these strain specific blue dreams and things like that i think there's value in both sides so when i think about the experience on this you know i really enjoy blue dream as a strain it's light it's energetic provides a little bit of focus has usually it has a higher higher quantities of cbg uh and thc on this particular product it doesn't list the terpene information or some of the other like factoids you know it has thc and cbd but it could have some of the other cannabinoids tested on there and i think that would be important uh cbc cbgs thcvs things like that um but this does taste very good um i know that i'm going to have a good jolt of energy and focus here for the next few hours if not for the next like six hours this tends to come in waves for me so flavor was very good nice and earthy definitely no alcohol taste which is huge some brands you can definitely get the alcohol it wasn't purged right or whatever it is um perhaps but this one really good so score out of 10 price point was pretty affordable 45 gram a little on the high side but there was there was actually about 110 to 120 milligrams of thc higher than some of the other brands that we like to buy rso wise here in cali so i'm willing to pay that higher price for that extra 120 milligrams um i'm gonna give it a nine out of ten it's kind of where i'm leaning um i would like some more cbd this is where it's like a high thc blue dream at 79 80 percent would have been great to have another strain blended in for some more cbd but i can't complain i think a 9 out of 10 is a really great score this is a product that if someone needs 800 milligrams of thc for the day smoke a little bit eat an edible and pop this in and you're good to go so something i really recommend emerald bay extracts this is a west coast weed tour review jay ping here checking in live

simple terms you can so as we hear that term a lot tomorrow RSO is basically a full plant extracted with ethanol oil so you get all the benefits of the you know the fact that wax is the lipids and the terpenes of the cannabis plant we more focus on we use freeze pure hundred proof of ethanol we use we get our ethanol down to freezing temperatures and do a quick wash so we focus more on extracting just the cannabinoids experiment the fats and waxes that go there give you three process yeah okay that's why ours is usually a lot better color than your traditional RSM oh so we don't really consider it too much our our Morikawa a CEO for alcohol but it is all fully activated it is generally it's just harvested over which is what you're actually wanted to take this", "Me6cluxDlx4": "mrs. underscore 420 underscore Jenny with an eye and that's where we can find you on Instagram yes and I post there David all right so let's why don't you tell us why you take RSL well I started taking RSO basically out of desperation a little over 60 days ago with a multitude of issues and basically I was flat on my back between an unruptured brain aneurism multi knobs or says and my thyroid possible breast cancer which has to be rechecked and a tumor in my abdomen everything how how much RSO are you currently taking today are so I'm taking a full oh I say a full syringe which is 758 milligrams of active THC and it's essentially twice what you see in the package here that I'd say you're taking one of those full surrenders today yes every day what do you experience from that taking that much not at all and and you know I thought it was going to be but you know the point where I started I was already flat on my back I was very sick my skin was gray I couldn't drive my car because of bubble in my head would seem to be getting worse and I could barely move around the house so compared to that I mean this is like living again do I feel high no no I feel healthy and I feel an inner goodness that I didn't feel before it's totally not what I expected I expected that I would be stunned and in the bed but instead got me out of the bed and gave me motivation and a drive that I haven't had inside of me actually in years Wow yeah that is that's what it does it's a healthy lifestyle actually gives me clarity and focus I feel more clear than I've been in years I had a head injury in 2011 and I went with post-concussive syndrome for about a year after that I was hit in the head with an ashtray right the Murano glass ashtray and for about a year after that I had to lay down during the day for you know before I could get back up and it gave me a brain fog and it was taking away my clarity and I just figured that over time my brain would deteriorate it was just something I had accepted and this is changing that I believe is completely healing my brain my brain is more clear than it has been huge I feel like it's reversing everything that happened up here over the last seven eight years since my injury all right well I know that you said you know you have a lot of tests of coming up so we're gonna check back in with you around 100 120 day mark you said you're gonna keep

us around 100 days subscribe at the button and we'll see you soon take care", "zyUgOzbJwek": "hey Jordan with TYT still at foster buds here in Portland Oregon I'm here with Angela who you have a really interesting story kind of makes me think of my story which we'll get to later but you have been using cannabis to treat treat an illness and it's working for you yes my name is Angela Valdes and I am a longtime business owner here in Portland my husband and I started a tea shop and now a tea company back in 2003 so I've been working with chronic illness my entire adult life I was diagnosed with lupus when I was 18 out of high school and I lived with it for 18 years the first man just saw my audience because many some might not know what lupus is lupus is well they told us at first it was basically like the body attacking itself and now they're finding out there's a lot more science that they don't understand and so we went from in 97 me having a diagnosis of you're never going to live to be 30 you're never going to get married and you're never having children and you need to come to terms with this now too telling my doctors I'm cured they didn't know what caused it we think maybe some neurological issues genetically have been a result of my body reacting that way but I had migraines from the time I was eight very bad physical pain my entire life and I've been on a lot of Western medicines so I'm a patient who has been an American that's trusted every system I've been put into wholeheartedly taking the pills done my homework as far as exercising and eating and it still wasn't enough so after nine years of Western medicine I was in remission and I asked my doctors if I could go off of all of the medications and they agreed and I turned to cannabis and from there I had a couple babies and had to stop taking cannabis during those times and my migraines and the lupus was so bad that it blocked my vision and my hearing so there was a couple months I was breastfeeding and having a toddler and I had my husband taking care of our tea shops and our tea company and I couldn't see or hear so it was it's something where I've come from the depths of despair when it comes to chronic pain and have fought for my life for it and cannabis is one of the biggest things that's helped me and tell me in terms of cannabis cuz there's I'm learning now there's just like a lot of different kinds and that kind of do different things if you want sleep if you want relief from pain these kinds of things how specifically has it helped you I know you're not a scientist but you know you have migraines and other things with lupus what is it done for you specifically to alleviate those well one of the things that I did is I just started smoking it because that's what people did back in 2006 seven eight there wasn't a lot of information about the Rick Simpson oil and so I tried that and noticed immediate pain relief a lot of it was the nerve pain and the jolting and the extreme swollen joints I was having would go away from smoking with like a water pipe so I got my medical card my medical marijuana card here and I started working with my grower to grow strains that were specific for my headaches and for the problems I was having with my lupus symptoms what is a grower for those who aren't from here well medical grower is someone who specializes in growing cannabis so what they do is they really focus on the plant to make sure that the right chemical constituents come out of the plant so the person who is consuming it either in vaporizing eating as an edible if it's baked or in a in a raw form they'll be getting the most cannabinoids and other types of things that come out of the plant I actually went from smoking to vaporizing I tried vape pens for a while I've used the Simpson oil and found a lot of it's not called the Simpson oil but I've found a lot of relief from that on a daily basis a tiny amount of that and I ingested I have no side effects I do receive some side effects if I eat edibles so I've been very cautious to warn people that you really need to understand your body's limitations and don't put yourself in a situation you'll feel uncomfortable because I was terrified to try cannabis I grew up as a conservative Republican I went to plan I went to college at a private Christian College I was told cannabis now you're living in Portland yeah I was told to fear cannabis it was illegal don't ever do it and so it took a lot for me to be someone to try it and I am someone that can say I I wish I could have told my dad sooner about it because he had epilepsy from the time he was 18 and he died two years ago having a seizure in a sleep and he knew I was taking cannabis and was finding a lot of results in my pain relief but he was still too scared to try it because he was a conservative who really believed that if it says it's illegal federally we should follow the law and I think that is a reason that he's not alive today because he was trying to be such a patriot he was someone who wanted to serve in our military and never got a chance because he had epilepsy so he was someone who was a true American patriot as far as they could be in their heart and he believed the system was right and so that's why he chose not to follow it it's that social stigma that his may have led to him never trying and I want to stand up and make sure no one else is afraid of it and that's why I feel like the social stigma has to come down and Bernie Sanders has been speaking out against it and that's that's why I'm voting for him for sure and uh did your father did your father try Western medicine for epilepsy and get any relief in his lifetime no he had many seizures almost daily um he had a lot of grand mal seizures I did not realize growing up in the next room how horrifying epilepsy is for people who have it but he was literally having the fight of his life every time he had a seizure and I didn't understand that growing up his brain would take quite a few minutes for him to reset and it was extremely jarring so imagine being in a public place and having a seizure you know so he tried everything they told him to take and he dealt with many bad side effects his gums were destroyed his teeth were destroyed because of die Latin and different medications they put him on he would go through some really bad seizure episodes in trying to change medications to find a better fit because it would stop working and the whole time I'm taking cannabis and having great results and starting to thrive and he was overworked and tired and he fell asleep face down and couldn't couldn't survive the seizure so it's one of those things where I'm gonna speak out now as much as I can because there could be another David out there that's terrified to try it and he's maybe his granddaughter maybe his daughter has been smoking weed and he's thought well she's not hurting her but I would never try it I hope they will think about I hope they'll consider it because I don't think my dad would have died if he knew that it would him and I believe now it would have saved him for sure I think it would have stopped seizures for sure I think something that struck me is just you saying the word weed even though I've partaken many it many a times Society has even made the term weed sound negative and criminalized and these kinds of things an older school you know we know older school people older people in politics whether it's the cannabis issue or anything else are more traditional and close minded to new things particularly if they see it's really a lot of young people kind of leading the charge so for you you said you're going to do as much as you can how do you kind of get your message which a lot of people will connect when it's about a human and it's a human interest kind of thing how do we get that to more places because for every time you say a story you know a chris Christie and all these know-it-all non-scientists politicians will tell you why you know you're the exception it creates industry it creates jobs it creates uh money revenue look at California look at Colorado what yeah well money they soon let me just stop you right there he you say it's gonna come down the road you know when it may come down the road when I'm gone it's not gonna come off here I think it takes a special kind of courage that I myself am in the process of trying to cultivate even at this moment because I've been keeping a collection of all my journals from all of my years of pain I've seen myself go through many different mindsets from fear to acceptance to rage to understanding and it's something that is consistently fluid in everybody's lives and I think that if we can be more accepting of the fact that when people are in pain it's not what we see in a snapshot is not what they're really experiencing all the time we could see the moment of relief and believe they're fine we could see their worst moment and think that it's always going to be that way and you know what my dad taught me with with his epileptic seizures is he would have a seizure and he would still be smiling and trying to cheer us up even though he couldn't remember his name at the moment and that kind of dedication to his own Drive inner drive to survive is definitely some Carrie and myself and so I would love to just shout from the rooftops anywhere into anyone guess what I'm cured because the truth is is that I am cured and I've been shocked my doctors are shocked my dentist is shocked we're just we can't believe I haven't I have a healthy white t-cell count I have healthy antibodies I'm I am so healthy that I've never been this healthy and it's it's amazing to me I'm willing to be someone to be studied or to offer information up to others I just don't know what how to do that do you know what I mean and it does take courage because I've had people say just write a book just tell everyone your story and it's not that simple I mean I think I could tell someone my story but for me to type it myself just takes a lot of courage and the more that people accept that others are using cannabis and finding finding relief the easier it gets everyday for me to speak up a little more to because I don't want to come across to Chris Christie and have to say well how am i cured like explain this to me and have have him say well I'm not accepting that you must have done something behind the scenes must have done what to be cured of lupus the one thing that people say was impossible to be cured of I mean I'm 37 I have two children I have a wonderful tea company a wonderful husband I beat every single thing that my first doctor told me I would not survive and I refuse to accept that other people are going to have to live a life of pain that if we go back if we have someone like Hillary Clinton come into presidency and she says I just don't believe it let the state's decide I'm I think that it's going to get harder for me to keep my mouth shut because I can't keep living this life and crossing things off my bucket list being cured and know that other people in chronic pain are sitting by and in Portland next door down the street and they can't get the same kind of care because they're not speaking out like AM or because their hair color is darker and so they're stigmatizing or like ostracized from the opportunity to get care it's infuriating as a patient and as a human and I as the supporter of Bernie Sanders who stood up for the for humans in every form in every color by voting for the Affordable Care Act by supporting some who pay our health care by understanding that cannabis is not something to be feared to men Americans have seen their lives destroyed because they have criminal records as a result of marijuana use that is wrong that has got to change we need our doctors to stop being worried about being sent to jail or being charged with something because they're helping patients who are looking into a very healthy I would say very miraculous plant that we have been hiding from the world and we need to start accepting it the amount of happiness quotient would go up in this country would be unbelievable if people could live to their potential instead of living it what I would say was like a fraction of the life there they're actually wanting to put out there does that make sense yeah and from a human level I just want to know because I actually have I don't I don't have lupus that I know of but I've had some issues with energy and fatigue and sleep for many years it sounds to me like you kind of had a rebirth I mean you're a woman in her late 20s maybe early 30s were really this was stopping you from having children so you were kind of living in a quasi you know prison you couldn't do all the things that naturally a woman would want to do or a man if he wants to have a family how is your energy now how is your stamina with two children are you able to do more active things just because not only your symptoms have been relieved but are you able to now do more than you used to be able to do yeah well when I was diagnosed with lupus I was 18 I was studying I was training to be a cheerleader in college so I was working my body very hard and I wasn't eating properly I ate a lot of candy bars for snacks I didn't really take care of myself like I should have and I also really didn't have medical and like I guess medical advice to help me gain weight I was always just it was like oh he's she's skinny it's okay she's fine it was never like Angela how many calories are you eating a day let's work on this you should have at least 10 pounds more there so it was kind of something that was just ignored and when I got really sick they just kind of just thought oh she's whittling away you know and there's nothing we can do it changed my relationships with everyone which changed my energy level I couldn't cheer I was supposed to do low-impact things from then on which is very different from going from a life of dancing for four hours a day and suddenly not you know being told to lightly swim because you could average aggravate symptoms and the swollen joints was so bad that I couldn't drive sometimes it couldn't move my wrists or my my shoulders and so it was very debilitating for me I managed to have a pretty good life through it in college fighting in a rebellious way I was raised to follow the rules I was raised as a conservative Christian I went to a private Christian College majoring in political science and broadcasting I went to an internship in Washington DC with the Leadership Institute it was with a conservative nonprofit and I worked in the print media center training politicians how to stay on talking points so I but I can't stand talking books myself I immersed myself in my belief system in the political belief system I was raised I believed every bit of it one voice one vote I believed it and so I carried that moral core with me but when I got to DC we were going to war in Iraq and I saw a few things while I was there that just just shredded me as a person I couldn't understand how we could be hurting another country and it didn't feel like we were liberating Iraq it looked like we were conquering them and it felt like that to me from what I was hearing and the way that we were all responding is a bunch of conservatives so when I came back from poor back to Portland my husband asked me if I wanted to open up a tea shop with him instead and do something different with my life so I blocked out media and politics altogether I came to Portland and after a few years of being here started meeting the most incredible people and what it was is I lived a very sheltered life and didn't meet people outside of that particular lifestyle and because of it I didn't know there was more than there was more to it than that and so when I came back I blacked everything out I ended up becoming a Democrat later on I realized that I really stood up for environmental issues I was very angry in DC when I when they were talking about environmental issues and I noticed that inside was like this bubbling surface why are we not carrying because the Bible tells me we're supposed to be stewards of the land so I mean I had all these little core beliefs that we're pulling out of my conservative values that just weren't meeting the need wasn't met when it came to the platform for the conservative and Republican Party and so I ended up deciding that what was best for me was to just give love out to the world so I focused on tea I made tea for every four people every day seriously cups of tea working my tail off through the physical chronic pain and they a lot of those people introduced me to cannabis here in Oregon and that's how I found out about it I would say that the biggest thing that changed my life and the core values I had was being in DC it was like being in a crucible 24 hours a day 7 days a week of Fox News circa 2000 sorry sorry I'm sorry but I worked there for five minutes so oh man it changes you to your core and I mean I came back and my family did not understand no one understood why I wasn't saying I'm not a Christian now I'm not a conservative I'm not a Republican I don't know what I am but I still believe everyone matters and I don't know why the political party I'm a part of doesn't seem to understand that so I chose to continue that path and that path led me on a very healthy path because I was no longer afraid to talk to people who were talking about cannabis I was actually talking with people who are very different for me I learned a lot from people who were bisexual and lesbian and homosexual that I had no idea and I had a cousin who was homosexual so there was you know some things you talk about in these communities but most of the time you don't accept people you just glaze over the subject and just say well that's them and I became a person that wanted to be transparent I didn't want to glaze over anything anymore I see people I see them for the color of their skin and I see what their struggles are and I'm tired of ignoring them I'm tired of them being stomped on and having standing next to someone and knowing that the a cop could walk by and choose to target my friend because she's Hispanic and I'm the one with the medical card and the joint in my pocket that kind of stigma just has to fall and the only way it's going to fall is if people like me stand up and I know it takes a lot more courage than I've been giving out because I've done things like volunteering for Bernie 2016 TV it's a group of volunteers who support Bernie Sanders I've done things like working in groups behind the scenes for delegates for Bernie Sanders and on the National Arena and also with the Oregon delegates because I want people to know that we are very productive cannabis patients are very productive in fact more people are cannabis patients than others realize and the reason we don't say anything is because we don't want the chris Christie's to start running their mouths over someone they don't understand you know well two things I think a your father would be very proud and be I think people in DC sitting in cubicles or in Capitol Hill slowly having their souls die are going to really like your message so I appreciate you talking to us thank you very much it's nice to meet you", "F1TemFivYnw": "but we begin with one of the first patients in the Houston area to start using medically prescribed marijuana this comes in the form of cannabis oil and only a small group of Texans are able to use it epilepsy patients who are not getting any relief from any other medications yeah we've been telling you about the medical cannabis dispensaries that have started growing marijuana now the drug is in the hands of patient on Trevino talked to the family at their church in southeast Houston and Ron they told you this is something they've been praying for for years that's right Rick Landis family is very involved in their church community Sage Mont Church in fact the patient is the grandson of one of the associate pastors there they know there may be a stigma surrounding marijuana but they feel this has been a godsend 10 year-old James Challenger relies heavily on his service dog that's about 15 pills a day from the neurologist and all the pills he takes to control his seizures but now his parents have new hope in this small bottle I can show you school records of just horrible marks to where we've we've not had one bad mark since we started the medicine on Tuesday afternoon they recorded the moment on their cell phone the CBD oil the family says has already had a positive effect we saw a drastic improvement in him his face lit up his personality just lit up he's he is much happier their goal is to get him off the daily dose of over a dozen powerful pills that have major side effects he had been described as being unhinged and just out of his mind he wasn't there you'd look at him and his eyes just weren't there now they say their son is back thanks to the oil he takes twice a day it comes from marijuana it's not the same thing that you know people use for recreational purposes you know this is a medicine that's highly controlled the family says their fellow parishioners at Sage Mont Church have been very supportive the way the family sees it the cannabis oil is the answer to their prayers and the oil here is being prescribed by their neurologist dr. Josh rothenburg and it's not covered by their insurance they figure they'll be spending $200 a week on the oil but if James continues to show improvement they're ok with that Lennon Rica yeah no money no money is too much when your kid is showing improvement after the negative lease sounds like afford it thank you Ron", "ubOiVHbCkwU": "is this a medicine cannabis has been a medicine for 3,000 years it only hasn't been a medicine in this country for 70 years I mean first of all I think just to talk about the the polarization of marijuana you know as a plan I think people have some ideas but people don't really understand like the journey so we tried to put in a little bit of history and context you know without it being like a big you know kind of write film it's not that kind of film but you know we put in the history so I think people are surprised to learn about that it's in the same schedule as LSD and you know that cocaine is in a less dangerous schedule and people are surprised to learn that the US government has a patent on the compounds in marijuana at the same time the US government is saying it has no medical value this is her cannabis oil regimen that we have right now we give her the size of about a half a grain of rice two times a day with baby food and in fact that it's actually at doing something with these can't with cancer on these children I mean we you know what we were able to follow from five years of making this film watching these subjects get better from this medicine not everyone not not everyone but yeah you know most of the kids and so it's it certainly is something that should people more people should know about and we're looking at this window I mean I think what's amazing when you really start learning about cannabis is honestly like how many people that could help I mean we're talking about like autism a DD Crohn's disease you know it's just this huge list of conditions we focus on pediatric and society we we focus on pediatric cancer because it's dramatic and also it's you know takes the stigma away it's not smoking joints and what people think you're really looking at you know medicinal properties but I think like we were amazed we went to Israel and we went to Jerusalem we went to like the top laboratories to look at the science because of course there are light years ahead of the us because they didn't have all the research blocks and you know it's fascinating to see like different strains killed different cancers but the same strain doesn't kill the same cancer and just the mechanism of how cannabis fights against cancers like super interesting so it's you know it's it's just this world of potential of healing and it's so criminal that it has been kept from us for 80 years there is some cell death the tumor is actually dying in certain areas there's no new growth I'm just thrilled this is the most amazing news we could have ever gotten", "EdoUnJuENuQ": "I'm gonna meet up with John

breast cancer it's a very frightening journey there are three different types of primary types of breast cancer you have ERP are positive you have her2 positive and you have triple negative each one of these are treated a little differently about 60% of all breast cancer cases or ERP are positive so there's wonderful treatments the success rates of allopathic medicine chemotherapy raishin are quite effective by using cannabis along with that we have found that people come through on the other side of their traditional treatments much more successfully much more quickly without missing some of their treatments because they're so debilitated from them that they have to extend their treatments etc I recommend that you start with a 1 to 2 ratio of THC to CBD so for example if you're taking 10 milligrams of THC you would take 20 of CBD you have to start low and increase slowly just like anything else there is no milligram per kilogram calculation that we can give you for cannabis it just doesn't work all the evidence we see in the research is it is not best dosed that way so unfortunately it does take a little bit more work on your part besides stepping on the scale and doing the math but by having the ratio to start with you know that you start and keep increasing the reason that we say to start with that ratio is because we know that there are something called the ID 1 gene and the ID 1 gene is what causes cancer cells to metastasize and spread throughout your body and it the CBD will aggressively intercept the translation or cancel out the translation of this gene that causes the cells to metastasize the THC is necessary because of the way that it activates this the cb1 and cb2 receptors to actually kill the cancer cells so on an average 40 year old female your dose might be somewhere between 75 milligrams of THC 50 to 100 milligrams of THC and your CBD might between 1 and 200 milligrams of CBD I know this sounds like an awful lot but when you're treating cancer that's often what it takes the older the patient we found that the lower the dose is with exceptions we've had children that are on very very high doses so don't be afraid of it because interestingly enough when you need these high doses your body will accept it in a way that it won't if you're just taking it as a healthy person so don't be afraid of the the numbers wait till you get your scans back and see what's working if you're only treating the side effects of the treatment for the breast cancer when they start working and you're not having the side effects you know you've you've reached your therapeutic dose if the one to two doesn't work you can always go to a one to one ratio I wouldn't go any further the other way though with a one two three or one to four if you're not having success with a one to two ratio the one that I would increase would be the THC not the CBD one of the things that's very important though is whole plant medicine whole plant THC and whole plant CBD medicines work better than the distillate or the isolates that are being put to that are being put out and marketed as those products they're mass-produced so you want to make sure that when you're picking your products that you pick those that are made from whole plant how do you know this you asked to see the lab results of the medicine asked how it was made asked how what was in it asked who do it and do your research you have to be more actively involved when you're selecting a product than you would if you're going to the pharmacy because as long as we don't have federal FDA approval we're not having licensed pharmacists we have bud tenders that are giving you the medicine the research that we've done on THC killing her to positive breast cancer cells and triple negative breast cancer cells are so exciting in fact in the case of her2 positive we have found in preclinical now this is only in petri dishes and in mice and not in humans but we have found from in a clinical setting that THC works as effectively is lapatinib which is a targeted first round drug used to treat many of these patients triple negative we have found exactly the same thing there is no targeted treatment for triple negative and it's often the most frightening words that a woman hears as her diagnosis that you have triple negative but there is hope with cannabis because we're finding in petri dishes in mice and in our patients that are still walking around that using THC and CBD together is very very effective in helping them to get to a therapeutic dose and have it be tolerable in such a way that they still have quality of life so give it a try see you're gonna have to get your dose I would also start out with a one to one in this case not a one to two the ERP are positive one to two ratio with her2 positive and triple negative I would do a one to one ratio from the very beginning start low and increase as quickly as you can", "dwo0gEOClKY": "good afternoon everyone thank you for joining us uh today for our next webinar um we're gonna do introductions we're just waiting people are still quickly joining so give us one second and we're going to get started we know this is a pretty topic to our community so we will be recording this and sharing uh after the fact uh and we will also make sure that if you need contact information we'll happily provide that as well okay i think i'm going to get started just because we have so much to get through today so um first of all we'd like to thank you for joining us uh today we have a rash tag thee did i say right yeah uh who is um from apollo cannabis clinics and uh this company um reached out to us to offer their information and expertise around cannabis and use for people living with als so we have decided to go ahead and do this presentation because it is very much a topic of interest in our community uh by no means are we encouraging people to do uh to take cannabis it is really a listen and learn information session uh we know there will be a lot of questions and we have presented a lot of um als specific information to you today to speak about but also if you have questions please put them in the chat box at the end of the presentation we will make sure that we address those if they are very specific questions to your specific question uh condition we're going to ask you to reach out to the company directly where we can make sure that you're connected with the right people more of today is general information so i'm going to go ahead and let you kind of do a little bit of introduction and make sure that uh everyone knows who you are sure thank yeah so as mentioned my name is arash and i am one of the international medical graduates that works at the apollo cannabis clinics i grew up in calgary alberta so proud canadian kid and i went to most of my middle school was a medical school was completed in the states so i spent a significant amount of time in atlanta georgia and i also did a couple of rotations my elective rotations in cook county hospital in chicago illinois so that is where i was before i moved to toronto so that's a little bit about me um when you graduate medical school you got to put in your time into the community and you have to build up your resume and then you apply for residency and that's kind of where i am at now so i work closely with all the healthcare professionals at apollo and i also work very closely with the research department um we have several ongoing research projects at apollo and that's something i'm going to discuss as i go so without further ado i'll start the presentation and as kim had mentioned um if you have questions put them into the question box i encourage questions the more the better i think and obviously i'll take them off right a webinar on thursday which pals okay so i'm gonna get started guys um first and foremost who is apollo apollo was a research institution that started in 2013 from a group of pain management physicians that were running out of treatment options for the patients that they were treating they would have to say mr mr smith i'm sorry i no longer have any other protocol to treat the condition that you are suffering from and the patient's turned back to the healthcare professionals and ask them well what about medical mechanics this is something that i am interested in and let's give it a shot and the doctors got together and they recognized that they knew very little about medical cannabis and they thought well let's research a small group of chronic pain patients to see what benefits we can find and they monitor them very closely and they started with you know the very entry level products for medical cannabis and they saw very very good results very early on and the group started to kind of communicate that to the people around them and they went from a small group of 30 to 60 then to 120 and then it became exponentially larger so the research institution was converted into a cannabis clinic inadvertently they didn't really plan it that way but they had no other choice with the number of patients that were coming in they had to dedicate a nurse to dedicate a couple of doctors just to that patient base so we now have um this number is a bit dated we have well over 50 000 patients rostered in our emr we do see patients coast to coast all over canada we have a team of physiatrists anesthesiologists we have pain specialists we have a psychiatrist mental health is a very big issue at apollo and that's something we address all the time and of course we have family doctors and we have academics and researchers that follow all of the information so as i'm sure a lot of people in this audience will know medical cannabis is kind of new and it has a lot of interest towards it a lot of people are gravitating towards it to see if it can benefit them but what we have to do as medical professionals is pay attention to the information because we all know that collecting retrospectively or proactively for research is just as important as the treatment options that we give patients on a daily basis so as mentioned we've been involved in a lot of research projects the current pandemic has slowed down a few of course since we have had to have some distance put between us and our patients but we have been doing research since 2013 as mentioned we've been published for ptsd with the use of medical cannabis and we have a couple other papers that i can't speak too much on because they are still in peer-to-peer review but again that is where we started that is our foundation and it's it's something that's very important to the fabric of apollo because without knowledge and information about what you were doing it's it's sometimes shooting in the dark and we fully understand that when it comes to this medication sometimes the dosing is us trying to learn but what we promise our patients is we will follow we will learn and we will understand what can help them so that brings us to our patients medical cannabis comes with a level of stigma to it we all know that um and we we have to counsel other physicians or other institutions about it all the time people think when you go to a medical cannabis clinic well you're going to be stepping into a place that has you know some slow playing music a lot of snacks in the background people are laughing a lot and guys i'm gonna make it very clear that is not the case we are a doctor's office like any other we have a waiting room we have consultation rooms we have education rooms so it's it's very regimented and you would be surprised the amount of people that walk in there wondering if there's something going to be out of the ordinary but again it is just the doctor's office oh and also worth mentioning on this slide um when it comes to our patient base the epidemiology the reports the numbers have come back since the legalization of recreational cannabis in 2017 which is what kind of started the trend for medical cannabis as well interestingly enough medical cannabis has been legal since 2001. recreational cannabis became legal in 2017. so medical cannabis has almost got 20 years behind it but everybody thinks well 2017 is when the leaf was turned that's not the case it's just when it became more popular so our patient demographics now with the new numbers that have come back to us since 2017 shows that the age category of 18 to 35 for the use of cannabis has not changed it's the 65 and over audience crowd demographic whatever you want to call them that has gone up exponentially and again it is a treatment option for many people who suffer from chronic conditions and that's why i think that that age group is looking more towards an alternative with medical cannabis as opposed to the traditional treatments so our medical process i wanted to make sure that i went over this quickly just so people understood there's again a lot of mystery when it comes to medical cannabis and medical cancer clinics why is there a clinic that is dedicated to just one medication well that's because a lot goes into it first and foremost we'll start at the top step one when anybody comes to apollo whether it's virtually over the phone or in person when we were open before the pandemic they must go through what is called a triage that is designed for us to attain all your past medical history the current reason you're looking to use medical cannabis and the current list of medications and any other information that the physician would like to have before consulting for medical cannabis step two is your doctor's appointment right this is where you will have a consultation with a healthcare professional they will go over all things that you need to know and ensure a safety profile is in place for that individual step three is the medical document this is your prescription the prescription must go to what is called a licensed producer there are about 350 of them in canada now licensed producers are just basically your pharmacies we do not choose one or the other we will send the prescription or the medical document wherever the patient wishes now most people come to clinic and have no idea what a licensed producer is so we explain it these are companies that have approval from health canada to grow medical cannabis and we can send a doctor's prescription to them to give you access for medical campus and again that's all nlp is once a licensed producer is chosen we go to step five and this is where apollo's bread and butter is this is what we're really proud of we spend a lot of time with our patients we fully educate them on what to expect when using cbd what to expect if using thc and everything in between that can happen between side effects or or help with the condition all of this stuff is discussed and again that's what an education entitles after the education it's important to know that the medication will be sent directly to the patient's door we are inadvertently contactless right the medication comes from the license producer directly to the patient's home that is a registered address and as i present to you now that is the only legal way to attain medical cannabis if ever you come across a clinic that is giving you cannabis in the clinic that is illegal so again just so you understand the medication must be sent in the mail licensed producers i've added this slide just so people have a better understanding again these are health canada approved state-of-the-art facilities these guys have positive airway pressure in large warehouses and greenhouses they're amazing to experience if you ever have the opportunity you step into a facility and you're hit with a a warm air it's almost tropical and then you close the store and there's a whole bunch of people in white jumpsuits again it's to keep everything sterile and to keep out contaminants they have licenses to grow the plant which they can turn into oils capsules sprays nowadays they also do vape cartridges and edibles and again i'll discuss all the different methods of consumption when we get there i was a little off about my number i apologize guys i said about 350 um i guess the marketing teams updated that for me it's about 380. needless to say there are many options when it comes to medical cannabis so we try to clarify that we have a list of top 10 or top 15 licensed producers that we really like and that number and those ratings have come from our patients to us if someone says to me hey you know what i tried this license producer they were really quick with their shipping and they were excellent in understanding what i needed well then guess what they're going to get bumped up in our list because i know that a patient has had a positive experience there these licensed producers are armed to grow two plants and there's a third that i will also discuss the first plant just a bit of background guys i'm going to discuss the two different plants and then we'll get into the medical compounds i have yet to say anything about cbd or thc sativa plants were initially discovered in south america they are big they are tall um if you ever see a fully grown sativa plant and you look at the base of the plant it's almost you know as thick as the end of a baseball bat you won't be able to pull it out of the ground with your hands they're strong strong plants they actually kind of grew feral in a lot of places in south america and that's how they were initially discovered farmers were trying to keep them off their land and a few farmers reported that they plucked some of these strange smelling buds from these plants and they would chew on them while they were working and they all reported a better mood and less back pain and they weren't as tired so again that's generally where the plant sativa started they are known to be uplifting and energizing the memory trick for a sativa plant is sativa as for sun again it can be uplifting the next plant that they grow is called the indica plant now indica we remember this way indica in the couch they're supposed to be calming and relaxing okay so again and i'm not talking about cbd or thc yet but the indica plant was discovered um in asia remembering that the sativa plants are big and strong and tall the indica plants are short and stubby and they're actually kind of sensitive plants um their properties again are the opposite of the sativas they're calming and relaxing where the sativas are uplifting and energizing but the two plants are genetically identical okay so that's important to note genetically identical but phenotypically different and what i mean by that is that they have different characteristics phenotypes are what distinguish the differences between all species including humans so phenotypes will choose the color of our eyes the color of our hair our bone density there's a lot of different factors within any species that are different and differentiated by phenotypes and again sativas and indicas are identical genetically but phenotypically different and that's the difference between them i mentioned the third plant sometimes a license for two producers will want the strengths of a sativa plant and they'll want the properties of an indica plant so they will cross pollinate them and they'll call that a hybrid i'm not a botanist i don't know too much about how it occurs but i know that most medical cannabis providers will have a hybrid version of their plants just to ensure that a patient will have access to that as well medical compounds drum roll this is what we've all been waiting for right this is where the important stuff can come come forward now when i first started giving these presentations there wasn't many people who knew what cbd was right i have to take a long pause on this slide to describe you know cbd this is cannabidiol this is the non-psychoactive component of medical cannabis fast forward two and a half years feels like it's been a lot longer but now everybody knows what cbd is now there is a person that doesn't understand what cbd is when i have these presentations so i've just put a list of some of the things we've seen in clinic and what we've recorded as the benefits of cbd for for us to discuss here um if i had to choose a couple off this list that were probably the the more important ones i would say the analgesic effect it's a fancy way of saying painkiller and the anti-inflammatory properties these are very very important as well one of the main conditions we see in clinic is the simple run-of-the-mill osteoarthritis right the painful knee or the bad back or the bad neck i've even seen a lot of hip discomfort as well in clinic and again this is a person who through time has worn down the joint and you have site inflammation when things get too close there's pain there and there's inflammation and that site inflammation if left untreated can graduate into systemic inflammation and now you have pain that started in the hip but you also have a headache and your shoulder hurts again you can't understand why and again that's all from systemic inflammation and again the anti-inflammatory properties of cbd play strong role for those patients another one here that's also important is an anti-enzyme right mental health we do see a lot of the pediatric population coming to our clinic now because of the epilepsy that can be controlled with cbd as well again it isn't anti-epileptic it can help that way as well remembering guys um cbd does not have a psychoactive effect and to translate that into more simple terms it will not get anybody quote-unquote high as the kids call it these days that's not going to be a risk factor for cbd the side effects of high use cbd are an upset stomach or diarrhea or a headache and again these are all things that we've seen in clinic and documented and recorded at a very low percentage the next chemical compound that comes off of the plant is called thc so this is the infamous one this is the one that people watch out for this is the one that sometimes people are scared of when they come into clinic guys i want to make this very very clear thc plays a very important role no i have no volume sorry guys i'm getting a little bit of background noise um so thc is not the component that most people are started with when it comes to medical cannabis but again it can be a very very helpful tool in the physician's belt when we discuss medical cannabis for certain cases remembering it also is a powerful anti-inflammatory okay it also helps a lot with insomnia a sleep disturbance is probably the number one complaint when it comes to any chronic condition it is the primary psychoactive component of medical cannabis but that is dose dependent it's very important for people to understand i always say the dose is the drug not the chemical component because recreational cannabis has its starting point and medical cannabis stays beneath it and we ensure that our patients do not feel the ill effects of thc in fact if people do feel them well then that's a miss that's a that's uh we have failed that patient we need to go back and discuss the treatment plan and their doses and how we can lower and still help our goal is to attain the lowest therapeutic dose when it comes to medical cannabis again i i tell you now from experience thc is a very helpful component on this list is also appetite stimulating anti-medic you know in a world in which everybody is trying to lose weight why would we ever want to stimulate the appetite with thc and the answer to that is it has its place medical oncology is one of those places people who go through chemotherapy or radiation will have a complete loss of appetite in fact they'll suffer from a lot of nausea and again a little bit of thc can reignite that appetite for them a little bit and also help with some of the nausea they're experiencing also there's anorexia and bulimia people who struggle to have an appetite can find some assistance when it comes to thc drag homes i thought this was an interesting slide maybe not all will agree but um these tiny little projections oh let me rewind this is a microscopic photograph of the plant so cannabis has a little over 100 different chemical compounds that come off of it 100 different types of cannabinoids and they're all housed in these tiny little oily projections called trichomes this is important to know because this means that a plant that is 97 carbohydrate based has a small percentage of fat that grows on it and that that soluble medication or fat soluble chemical compound that comes off of the plant has receptors in our body and it can affect the human body that way because again it is fat soluble so at the end of the day these big fancy licensed producers and all of these numerous medical cannabis clinics are all trying to harness this tiny little microscopic fat that comes from the plant a licensed producer will take five to ten grams of a bud from a particular plant and they will crush it and they will heat it at a very high rate and they are basically melting off these trichomes and when they melt them off they attain a small concentrated amount of it and then health canada tells them they must dilute that with healthy oil they now choose medium chain triglycerides or mct oil which is a coconut derivative which is one of the healthier oils that we can ingest and they mix with with the oils that come off of the cannabis plant that allows the medication to be unmixable so now you have an even amount of medication throughout that oil and again remembering that it's fat based and you're mixing a fat with the fat you can't unmix it so again it's the safest method in which we can that we can consume medical cannabis so we've talked about thc and cbd we've talked about sativas and indicas and now we're going to discuss what is called the endocannabinoid system this is a system in our body that is already in place there are several different ways we can plug cannabinoids into this system and starting from the top we have cannabis or cannabinoids these are the ones that are being put into the body from either a plant base or a synthetic base endocannabinoids the word endo in latin just means endogenous which means us endocannabinoids are the ones that our body naturally produces and then there are synthetic cannabinoids as well and these are the nabalone and side effects that's what they're known for for any given reason we have observed in clinic that both nabalone and satovx not to be confused with sativa plants sativex is the synthetic version of thc they don't respond well for long and what do i mean by that sometimes you have a patient who will come in and they started on 20 milligrams of sativex they come in a week later and say it worked for three days and it hasn't worked for the past two well the physician will say okay well though maybe we need a higher dose we'll go from 20 to 40 and the same will occur they get about a one to 48 hours 72 hours of benefit and then that falls off again it is quick to be tolerated for some reason that we do not understand when it comes to the cannabis plants and what they produce they're called phytocannabinoids so the ones that come from plants are called phytocannabinoids and they tend to work far better in the system we've observed small percentage of tolerance and again we can easily combat that and we teach our patients how to do that on a daily basis for reference it's important to know that cb1 is the thc receptor and cb2 is the cbd receptor so if we look at this they are everywhere and when something is widely found throughout the body we use a fancy medical term we call it ubiquitous again just a fancy way of saying they're everywhere and this is probably the reason why medical cannabis can be used in so many different conditions which is why we have such a massive variety of patients in our clinic this is another slide just further breaking down the systems that are involved and the receptors that can be found so obviously first and foremost the very top of the list is the brain right upper motor neuron is your brain and spinal cord lower motor neurons will be your peripheral nervous system so everything after the brain and spinal cord will be considered the lower motor neurons or the peripheral nervous system but if we look closely in the brain there's both cb1 and cb2 receptors so everybody always thinks that thc affects the brain and cbd affects the body it's not necessarily true cbd alone can affect people's mental health in a positive way thc can help with sleep in the central nervous system and a physician may choose to go that route depending on what the sleep disturbance is caused by so if you think about it i'm going to talk about chronic pain as an example for the brain chronic pain is consistent signaling that goes to the brain it doesn't allow us to really think of anything else so a patient who is suffering from let's just say fibromyalgia is lying in bed struggling with pain and they're just constantly getting messages not allowing them to rest so cbd can play a role in helping control that anxiety that comes with chronic pain thc will help initiate sleep so again they play important roles and both these things can be discussed at a doctor's appointment other important organs to recognize here would be probably the large intestine if i had it my way that would probably take up half of this slide um the gi is one of the areas of largest free radical damage in our body every time we eat we're causing a lot of cell turnover so the large intestines need some antioxidant help cbd is a very very good antioxidant for the digestive system and also the central nervous system there are set conditions that we see for the large intestines or the digestive tract in general as well there is ulcerative colitis there's crohn's disease celiac is another big one that we see and sometimes the patients will say well i still react the same way to those foods but instead of being sick for 10 days or 15 days after a poor reaction when i use cbd i'm only really feeling poor about 48 hours after so it's really helping with my recovery again these are things we hear the immune system is also another big one here guys way at the bottom almost off the slide but the immune system is where we find a lot of benefits when it comes to rheumatology or autoimmune conditions as well i'm assuming there will be many questions about this slide so i'll come back to it at the end we can stop on it this photo is every medical student's nightmare this is where we spend a lot of time understanding the exact physiology of of the human body in this particular case we're looking at the pre and the post-synaptic cleft i assume in this group this picture will not be so foreign to us sometimes when i do these presentations a hand will go up and people will say well i don't even know what i'm looking at is that an elbow is that me guys this is the pre and post-synaptic clef this is how the neurological system communicates okay so there are receptors in place and what i want to make very clear before i i leave this slide because to me it's boring is that there's 2ag and anandamide those are the two chemical components that our body naturally produces in the endo cannabinoid system and there is cb1 receptors that also affect the central nervous system that act in a very similar way again in this particular photo it's showing thc but cbd also has receptors in both the pre and postsynaptic left so it can affect how we perceive pain it can also help with the inflammatory process that follows pain and we can also kind of address some of the other symptomatologies that follow chronic conditions so when it comes to the endocannabinoid system these are again some of the things that we have seen that are benefiting our patients comes down to inflammation pain digestion sleep bone density is an interesting one mood stress regulation and even reproduction these are the conditions that we have documented well in clinic chronic pain being at the top of the list neuropathic pain second to that when it comes to als most people do not discuss pain but they do report pain in about sixty percent from my readings even as high as seventy times as well so pain is a neuropathic origin when it happens with als from my understanding and again cannabis does play a role with that fibromyalgia is after that ms an autoimmune condition in which the central nervous system is being attacked i've already discussed epilepsy and ptsd with you guys we have anxiety and stress insomnia is huge i think that um anytime you walk into any room i it's fair to assume that more than half the people in that room aren't sleeping properly and that's again something we hear in clinic and some people say i started taking cbd for my migraines but i've never slept better so even when i don't have a migraine i'd like to continue and the doctor turns to them and says that's okay with me as long as you check in every three months and we're on the understanding that this is an as needed medication when you need it you can stop if you wish you can use regularly if you wish as well so this is an additional slide that i put in here um regarding als um again when when i did a lot of my homework with this stuff i went back into my medical books and then i read up on what was new um and we're we're still struggling guys obviously i mean i don't need to spend too much time stating that to this audience but i just put some of the facts that i've come across the second most common neural disease second to alzheimer's very high incidence in caucasians and slightly higher in males is also what i found there's a sporadic and hereditary route i'm looking forward to the questioning portion of this because i'm hoping that you guys can even fill this in for me a little bit further but again i've found again from my recent readings that it's 90 sporadic and about 10 hereditary average age of onset between 40 and 55 but seen as young as 25. and now we're kind of circling back to how medical cannabis can play a role with als symptom control with the sleep disturbances and obviously with the pain management i've also added here from what we have observed in clinic reduced fasciculations and again reduced neuropathic pain is something that we have seen from the als patients in our clinic now what does that mean when you see and observe something in a condition like als all that we can do is document all that we can do is share that information with the next patient that comes in but we must be very clear just because it works for one person doesn't mean it will work the same way for everyone and that is the case for any medication guys not just medical cannabis when when medication is released into the market and it has gone through all of the battery of tests that come from the cdc and health canada they still say these are the side effects that we observed these are the positive benefits we observed and within two standard deviations of the norm ninety percent of people started at this dose the only difference between medical cannabis and most other medications is that we never got a chance to do the bell curve of the dosing so to combat that what we do in our clinic is to start at the lowest possible dose that you can and i always tell patients this is interesting we're going to start a dose that you probably feel nothing and then we're going to move up slowly and once we've attained therapeutic benefit we might push a little bit further if it's the same we'll come back to reduce cost that's the method that we use to ensure proper dosing in our clinic methods of consumption this is a big one now initially and when i say initially i mean two and a half three years ago um there were only oils that can be used okay so like i explained the trichomes were being melted off and put into an mct based coconut oil and patients would only have to dry out what was a small oral syringe and they would measure the dose and that would go into their mouth there was a huge conception of do i put it under my tongue is it absorbed under my tongue no it is not remembering that it is a fat based medication the liver is required for digestion we call that first past metabolism and that is what causes the delay or the kick-in for medical cannabis products at times if they're ingested if they're edible so you consume that oil it goes down into your stomach over into your intestines your liver picks that up stamps it sends it everywhere that prospect takes about an hour and a half to two hours depending on that person's metabolism once the medication is in your system it should last anywhere from four to eight hours again i put the longest window of variability most people tell us it's about four to six sometimes people say it goes past eight again it'll depend on that person's metabolism nowadays we have capsules which have just been concentrated oils into a capsule and it's much much easier to use in that way um patients are very very happy about the capsules and so were we we had a lot of trouble with you know drawing out a dose in public or people who have arthritis and have trouble getting the bottles open now we just move on to capsules it's much much easier i put here it is important to start low and go slow which is just again referencing our titration methodology the second form of um in uh medical cannabis and the method that can be used is inhalation guys i always take a hard pause when i do this presentation to make it very clear we do not promote that anybody smoke anything in apollo but there are health canada approved vaporizers that have the ability to take a dry flower and you put the dry flower into a unit this photo is one of them and that unit will heat the plant to the point of dehydration that plant will let off a steam or a mist and you're inhaling a very small amount of steam that is very different than the recreational vaporizers that are out there the jewels or whatever brands that are out there that people are using that are within seconds giving them huge clouds of smoke those products are are burning plastics and they have vitamin e acetate and there's a lot of inhaled oil and plastic that goes into the lungs and that's causing a whole array of problems for people i can get into that during the questions if someone wishes the condition has been called popcorn lung and i can explain why but what's important to remember is the only difference between vaporizing the correct way and ingesting is that vaporizing will act much much faster there are certain patients that benefit from this and there are certain patients that absolutely need it um and those patients would be our veterans right ptsd is a condition in which a person's mindset is in a war zone they don't have an hour and a half to two hours to wait they grab their vaporizer and they turn it on and there's also a misconception that people think as soon as you are vaporizing cannabis you're using thc that is not the case you can attain pure cbd flower and inhale that and again they unanimously report symptom control they say that you know i'm calm again i avoided panic attacks this month i was able to stay away from the unpleasant trees of my inner self when i'm going through a struggle with ptsd and again these are things that we've documented recorded and they come back to us and their families come back to us and they're all very very thankful they say thank you for giving my husband back or my wife back to me um he wasn't himself or he wasn't herself when she come back so this is helping again i put here it's within five minutes as quick as it comes it also leaves a little bit faster it's about one to four hours before the efficacy is passed i've added a couple slides for terpenes guys this is um something that a lot of patients are telling us um in clinic it's very interesting remembering back to the trichomes that grow off of medical cannabis those tiny little fat projections because they are fat they can have particles settle on them dust settles on them pollen will settle on them so if a medical cannabis plant or any cannabis plant is growing next to a lavender field chances are that it will adapt to some of its environment it can pull in some lavender pollen and that becomes a part of the plant's genetics it's very interesting so plants that have a bit of the lavender terpene profile to them have a calmer relaxing feel a terpene i should explain is any scent or aroma or flavor that comes from all plant matter so if anyone has a basil plant at home and they pluck a leaf off of that and they smell it you are smelling the terpene profile of that plant cannabis has recorded all of these different terpenes within the plant so linolol was the one that i was referring to lavender that is again it can be used to have calming effects um it's a bit sedating it helps with insomnia naturally chirophiline is another one that one's a little bit hard to say but that is the one that comes off of black cloves um spicy woody scent to it again these are all things that we document in clinic pinene is a very popular one as well this one's an interesting one we have patients who use cbd with a high level of pinene and they come back and say hey guess what i don't need my asthma inhaler nearly as much anymore i feel that it really dilates my lungs and i can breathe a little better when i use my cbd well we have to listen we have to document and that is what we have done here there will never be a time when someone you know goes into a clinic or or a bit of an acute setting in an emergency setting and says you know i need to shut a little or i'm not going to make it it doesn't have direct medical value but it's helping and we're paying attention guys side effects this is another hot topic when it comes to these presentations a lot of people love to ask me well i heard so and so tried it and they went crazy and they were never the same person again that is not what happens when it comes to medical cannabis this is a very very controlled and monitored situation that people get into when it comes to medical cannabis all of these side effects that are seen here are from the use of high thc i pause for dramatic effect remembering that cbd side effects are an upset stomach or a headache these are all from high thc and again of course dry mouth is on the top of the list here drowsiness well i thought about adding this one and i took it off and i put it back on i thought is it really a side effect if we're using thc for sleep assistance and a patient is feeling drowsy isn't that what the goal was but again i put it there in case someone didn't want to feel drowsy thc would have to be avoided and that's common practice some of the more uncommon side effects are a panic attack paranoia or psychosis guys these are so uncommon that we hardly ever see them and if it is something that is a danger to the patient we protect the patient the only time a patient would suffer from a panic attack paranoia or psychosis is if they were predisposed to it if they were diagnosed with schizophrenia if they're diagnosed with bipolar if there's a family history of schizophrenia all these questions are asked and documented and recorded by the doctor before a prescription is even put into place so again the old tale of someone using cannabis and never being the same is not true mental disease is just not well known enough and a lot of people who are struggling with mental disease will go into alternatives to try and attain some form of benefit and it's not always a healthy practice but these things can occur any stimulant can cause psychosis in a person who is schizophrenic this is uh also something that i wanted to add and discuss with you guys a very in a sneaky way added the opioid overdose and i wanted to compare and contrast to cannabis because the opioid crisis is no secret guys i don't want to throw shadow at modern medicine but at a time opioids were helping so many different conditions that physicians started to write it more and more and unfortunately they're incredibly addictive and when the doctor would say no to a person well they were left with alternative methods to attain it it wasn't ever safe to begin with the reason why opioids can be so dangerous is because they do have receptors in our respiratory center our breathing center it is considered a neurological suppressant there was a time in which a lot of movie stars and famous people were passing away from opioids and that's because the physician would give them the prescription and tell them please do not use this with any with any other neurological suppressants and they'd say yeah sure doc don't worry about it they would take their medication and then they would sit and have a couple glasses of wine and the next thing you know you have not just one neurological suppressant you have two and they would go to sleep and they would simply stop breathing due to opioids having receptors in the breathing center it was very sad that is called an accidental overdose the comparison and contrast is that thc does not have receptors in the breathing centers of our brain and there is no way that it can slow down our breathing again very important to this group very important for everybody to understand that there has never been a reported case of death due to the use of cannabis addiction i think some of the questions that came our way before this presentation were asking me about addiction so i i brought forth this slide i absolutely hate this slide but i have to give you guys something um if we look at the bottom here it's very dated it came out of washington dc in 2001 but this was a study that was done and it was respectful enough for us to post it here cannabis is reported to have about a nine percent dependency rate now dependency in medicine is described as somebody who requires a substance or they are at risk from a physical standpoint if you take alcohol away from an alcoholic there's a chance that they can suffer from a heart attack seizures renal renal dysfunction they want to call it so regardless there's lots of different things that can happen if you remove the substance with cannabis there are none of those things nine percent of people said they were living better with it and they wanted it again so and again this list is talking about people who smoked cannabis it has nothing to do with medical cannabis i hate that we're even in the same arena as some of the substances in this slide you know heroin and cocaine and tranquilizers those are very heavy street drugs but at the top of the list is tobacco which is readily available at a very young age in this country and then of course alcohol which we celebrate with and that's quite a a a very very toxic substance when you think about it alcohol kills people there are several hundred deaths in toronto every month based on alcohol dependency again under the radon right we're okay with it because it's been around for a while but cannabis has all this stigma so it's important to know the facts this is another one that i've added here um because i thought it was very interesting to share with you guys one of our physicians came to us from a substance abuse recovery program and he said his patients were all unanimously asking more about medical cannabis so he decided to join the apollo team the apollo family and he wanted to learn more and he started paying attention to the medications that were dropping off the list when patients were using medical cannabis and these are some of the results that we found so again alcohol substitution more than 40 percent that's an enormous number illicit drug use this is what he saw in his private clinic not us but about 26 of those patients were able to substitute cannabis the big one the most important one that we like to talk about is obviously prescription medications more than 65 were able to reduce prescription medications with the use of medical cannabis and of course you have these buds in the background that we now understand the reason why they're fuzzy and sticky is because of those tiny little trichomes that brings me to the end guys um i'll stop here because i anticipate questions and maybe some discussion so let me get back to everybody can you see me kim i can see you i can't see you i can still see your screen okay what about you know perfect we're good thank you so much uh aaresh okay so we have a few questions that have been coming in if people have any more questions please type them in now uh before we end the presentation we will follow up with you though and and your clinic uh if there so one of the questions um was how can cannabis help muscular atrophy and not neurological so muscular yeah a lot of clients suffer from muscular issues and it's not yeah of course of course i mean let's look at a big picture okay als is a loss of communication with central nervous system let's leave it at that any muscle who that is not used over a period of time will atrophy okay i have to be 100 honest with you guys medical cannabis does not play a role when it comes to the physiological physiological atrophy of muscle we don't i i can't even sit here and connect it in any way shape or form we do not play a role that way the best combat for atrophy is physiotherapy guys you got to use that muscle to build that muscle and of course i understand that's not always available but that is that is the combat atrophy good question can you tell us some of the benefits for someone who has bulb or onset symptoms yeah remembering that almost 80 percent of all als will graduate into bulbar symptoms this is something that we must discuss with als patients right if a patient is having trouble swallowing or trouble breathing and medical cannabis can help relax that nerve or thc at a micro dose can help as a muscle relaxant then we can say that we're some way benefiting it would have to be a trial and air basis we would start again at the lowest dose possibly move up slowly to see if there is a benefit sometimes they come back to us and say it's still the same we will have a very serious conversation you see well we understand that we have tried and this is not a treatment option for you but it would be with the relaxation of muscles and that's the only role we can play um does cannabis help with anxiety around you know people who have an als diagnosis but also people who are suffering from severe copd copd yeah if a patient comes in with anxiety and copd you better believe the physician is check marking no inhaled forms of cannabis okay we're going to be ingestible only cbd plays a role as an anti-inflammatory copd is inflamed airways that have been clogged up and now we're going the other opposite direction you can't get oxygen out so to not bore us with all the details spoken patients do come to our clinic and we do give them cbd and then ingestible forms of a combination of both cbd and thc can help with the anxiety right remembering that both anxiety and depression are two conditions from the same area of the brain one is an overcompensation one is an under but they're definitely linked right so you can help kind of regulate people we put people back into what we call homeostasis which is balance that's not always easy to find it's ghost dependent but i promise you we'll find it okay um is there medical cannabis that's available in edibles yeah you know it's funny edibles is an interesting term people are thinking now well edibles are out so where's the cookies and the chocolates and the brownies and all that fun stuff you guys remember cannabis is a fat soluble medication so when you consume a brownie that has cannabis versus a capsule that is medical cannabis or an oil they all get digested the same way right they're still first past metabolism a lot of the licensed producers now have chocolates a lot of them have cookies the only kind of restriction that help canada has put on these license producers when it comes to the fun quote-unquote edibles is that they must be broken down by dose in the past you would get someone telling you hey here's a cookie you know eat half of it don't eat the whole thing it's too much well how do you know the medication isn't all sitting on one side of that cookie you have to feel one way you meet the other half of you you feel completely different so canada has said that is not allowed you have to give individually sized dose dependent edibles so i guess the energy questions yes they do exist i think there will be some people on the call that will be quite happy to know that it comes to chocolate form yes um so one of the questions we're having is who pays for medical cannabis and then the second question was did ohip cover that cost good questions uh there's a couple there so first and foremost your entire process will apollo is completely free all right it is overhead covered and it doesn't matter what province you live in right now we are able to see patients from coast to coast like mentioned so the six steps that i showed are all covered the medication is still considered private so that is on the patient unfortunately we are at the top of our lungs with health canada we want this stuff covered just as much as patients do we do have a lot of different avenues that we can travel if a patient is looking for some form of financial relief a lot of these companies offer compassionate pricing there are certain companies that are higher priced or lower priced we can find out exactly what would best keep the individual but as it stands now it is uh is private it'll range in price anywhere from 25 to 100 a month depending on what the patient needs um is there a typical timeframe one of the things you you may reference to a few times was low and slow and is there a typical time frame for a patient to start feeling like they've really reached that perfect dose yes it usually takes us anywhere from four to six weeks to learn and what we do with our patients is they have their first appointment and we drop a treatment plan that's gonna slowly increase their dose with a phone number to our call center that's open seven days a week if they need it and we don't want anyone feeling abandoned and we always tell patients after their first visit look you've been here a while this is a long process the one thing you must remember when you leave is if you feel any side effects stop immediately and call us okay there is no weaning schedule with medical cannabis but because it is fat soluble it can take time to build up in the system and we see those benefits anywhere from four to six weeks out a lot of people are like wondering i took that one dose how come i'm not okay guys you cannot obtain a benefit from any medication with a single dose we have to try over time so we have a question from a client who's been taking um cannabis over for overnight for sleeping um just wondering is there a benefit of increasing that to take it during the day so what's the benefit the difference between maybe regular dosing versus time-specific dosing the the benefits would be based on the half-life of the medication okay so let's say someone is taking and actually i'm gonna give you a real case we had a patient who came in um who had really really bad osteoarthritis in both knees okay former soccer player he says my knees are killing me i take cbd first thing in the morning and it really helps me until about one o'clock so after one o'clock i'm kind of just left with my pain and in the evening i take my sleeping dose and that really helps as well what he has inadvertently discovered is that it takes him about four to six hours for it to come out of his system so his eight am dose is done by about one o'clock so i asked him well why don't we take another dose at 12 30 because i didn't know i could do that i said well if you're feeling the pain again that means that the medication has come out of your system the advantage to using it more regularly is symptom control and more hours of anti-inflammation or anti-inflammatory properties of cannabis so good question you can extend daytime products in the day and then obviously your evening product will be your even product um one of the words that you use and i'm going to try to say efficacy um explain that to people yeah efficacy is where we attain a clinical benefit okay if something is ineffective it's not high efficacy that means that it's not affecting anything it's not helpful but we try to retain the lowest therapeutic dose and the highest efficacy which means we want to use as little as possible with the maximum effect and the only way you can do that is to get to a dose where you're feeling something push a little past that and see if there's any more benefit if not you come back to the lower dose sometimes and very rarely patients will call us and say well i tried one evening capsule and didn't work so i went to two it was okay i went to three and that was not pleasant for me i didn't like how i felt well i will say well mrs smith mr smith we now know what we don't want to feel okay we will go back to a lower dose that is more effective there's a higher efficacy for you i hope i answered that one other questions we had was is a little bit more complicated but um a person who received um a prescription for medical cannabis and and picked that up from their pharmacy um but feels like they don't have they've never been given any actual instructions where do people turn for that support you have to go back to the clinic that is that is our our number one problem with medical cannabis unfortunately i i'm in the industry myself and i see it all the time we have patients that come to our clinic and say well i went to so-and-so and they told me to use this but that's all i heard and talked to me since well like a doctor's office if they give you a prescription and you call and say this isn't working yet the doctor will say well we've got to give it four more weeks so we got to give it two more weeks so if it didn't work stop and i'll come back in for a follow-up we treat cannabis the exact same the problem is that there are a lot of clinics that are opening that are not correctly situated to support the patient base so it's it's it's unequivocally important for patients to understand that your support system is just as important as access to the medication right so if i was a patient that had nowhere to call for medication odds are i'll stop using it and then the whole process is undermined by a lack of education so i promise you actually let me rewind that person should go back to the clinic that prescribed to them to have their questions answered and if not they can always give us a call all right can people if they've had not a great experience it's not an issue to switch to another another clinic if they like they're not getting the support they need at one clinic they could go to another clinic and for example being your clinic being one of them i encourage that anytime someone doesn't get what they need from a family doctor they're quick to change right and sometimes people think well this physician didn't treat me right or this nurse practitioner didn't treat me right i want to go somewhere else and they go somewhere else and they attain an entirely different experience i'm not trying to say we're you know we're walking this golden line here but in actuality if a medical facility is not fulfilling the need for a patient the next question we had was around cannabis salves so creams and lotions uh and and the benefit around that yeah topicals topicals so a big hot topic um it's interesting to say but i'll do my best to explain it when we think about our bodies we always tend to look past the skin right one of our biggest and most important organs it is a fat soluble protective layer cannabis is fat soluble yes it will absorb yes it will affect the joint that is put on that being said we have seen benefit from smaller more peripheral joints right so a bad elbow wrist ankles maybe a knee but if we're talking about back pain shoulder pain or hip pain anything that's deeper you got to go systemic and like i explained when it comes to you know osteoarthritis chronic pain which is more than 70 of what we see in clinic any site inflammation will graduate into systemic inflammation and it's important to address systemic inflammation with the systemic anti-inflammatory i love topicals and i love how people are gravitating towards them well they're saying well i don't want to use cannabis i just want to use it on my joint and kind of get away with it that's great give it a shot but i promise you you will probably attain a better benefit if using it systemically this has been so helpful in terms of the education for all of us listening um so we know that there will be follow-up questions we are going to to pass them on to you for sure we appreciate everyone listening today but we also really appreciate the information it was very unbiased and really general so if you have a question and you want to talk to a medical professional at your clinic please call you can call any clinic but these guys are offering to to answer questions and and and help give some direction it seems like there's some people that have been posting some comments about that they just feel very lost and so it sounds like from from listening to you speak is that it's really important that people feel well supported in this in terms of the decision making around what works for them and we've heard a lot of times i think the one comment that was made is that um the two things one is low and slow is very important but also um it takes time and it it's not just uh let's do the first dose and be done with things um it doesn't work for people wow right away but for long-term use that's not going to be something that's going to be exactly that's exactly right and again like i mean i always draw on on clinical examples so we have certain patients that tell us my condition is really bad in the winter right so from end of october to march i am able to stay afloat with medical cannabis i don't need it in the summer and that's brilliant like i love to hear that that means that patient is in complete control of their health and their understanding of the signals that are coming to them from their body other people will tell me well i tried it twice and it didn't work and again it's not an antibiotic you have to use it for a long period of time you have to understand what you do for after 90 days and the support systems that are lacking for people discourage that so i i don't want to you know sound like a bit of a broken record but the support system is just as important as access one more thing i wanted to quickly add as you mentioned the pandemic has kind of slowed down some of the more uh research initiatives that we've wanted to do als is is unequivocally important and if we do have those patients what we do is we kind of mark them in our emr we attain their permission to follow them from a category standpoint like i will give you a number not in you won't be written down names but i want to know what we are helping with and what your symptoms were and and how long we treat from the date that you came to us compared to the date of diagnosis moving forward again that information will be way more important to us down the line than any kind of commercial you know posting here so i'm happy to hear you said it was objective and kind of detached from the commercial side of things because our goal is to turn the dial of human understanding we want to know if this thing will be something that we can continue to grow on so as we were wrapping up we're getting rapid questions coming in because people realize so one of the questions is uh what's the best method of ingestion for someone who can't tolerate solid foods and might uh need a feeding tube is there a and i i don't know if you want to address that in this group setting or you'd like to just do that on an individual one no that's fine no that's fine i'm just thinking about it in my head a little bit i would have to know more about the individual but my understanding is if there is a gi-2 then we would want to avoid oils and go to a very small capsule again i don't know if they were able to take that capsule via the gi tube we'd have to do some more investigation but my thinking is less is better for that individual and at a concentrated dose so i would want to have 20 milligrams of cbd at night to start and only at night and then we can graduate into daytime use but we have to understand what it will do first so yes is the short answer okay um can you juice cannabis yeah you can um the process of juicing is interesting some people will juice it cold and then you have unactivated cannabis which just means you have to consume a lot more of it some people juice it and follow some of the cooking recipes a lot of helpful people on youtube um your the process is called decarboxylation which is what licensed producers are doing before they send the medication out the only difference between people doing it at home and people getting it from a licensed producer is that the license producer is health canada certified they have an exact set precise dose whereas if you're doing it at home you're kind of guessing now i've seen a tremendous number of people benefit from home cooking recipes and saying you know it's controlling my sleep and my fibro again so thank you i just don't know how much i'm using i'm making the same recipe week in and week out and sometimes it works better than others i left in the oven for an extra five minutes and that's less effective now again those are problems that some people want most people will think a licensed producer can prepare it for me and that's just the easier way um does does the person need a referral from their gp to work with you or any other clinic i don't know about other clinics for us we do not require a referral anymore this is so interesting some patients were telling us well i don't want my family doctor to know can i come in anyways and we'd say no we need a referral and then we decided one day it's not fair for us to say no to people if they're reaching out for an alternative for their health we need to say yes so we opened our doors to walk-ins and it just flooded in and then we got a whole bunch of enthusiasts saying well now i want my family doctor he told me not to search this out but i've been able to get rid of my sleeping man and some of my pain meds and he should know so we're happy to send a consult note with the full treatment plan highlighted to any physician that refers to us we prefer it but we don't have to have it i always say the more minds involved are better the bigger the circle of care the more care is involved and the last question is where is your clinic so we have um five brick and mortar locations in the toronto the greater area of toronto so i don't know if people are all from ontario but we start in aurora we go down to north york then we have a couple of locations downtown and then out west as well but with the current pandemic in place all of our appointments are over the phone or virtual so you would call you would be given an appointment within 48 hours and then you would have it from the comfort of your own home so that can be anywhere in ontario someone could be referred to your clinic anywhere in canada okay yeah anywhere in canada we have patients all over the country awesome thank you so much uh i think we're done because i think people continue to send stuff in but i really appreciate irish like this was awesome and so helpful for people uh thank you everyone for attending and i hope wish everyone a wonderful rest of the day if you do have any questions please feel free to reach out to us and we'll happily answer those awesome thank you so much for having me you guys want to end with a big token of gratitude it's always great to connect when we're also disconnected awesome thank you so much goodbye", "i0OEbKzAujQ": "how cannabis can help Alzheimer's patients [Music] remember the tearjerker romance movie The Notebook it tells the love story of Noah and Allie in long flashbacks [Music] the couple is old and Allie suffers from Alzheimer's disease [Music] so Noah reads their life story tour in an attempt to bring her memories back [Music] the process of memorizing is critical to human life as we collect experiences in everything we do and we use them in our daily life as an imitation game [Music] unfortunately a large number of people suffer from memory diseases such as Alzheimer's disease [Music] alzheimer is the most common type of dementia and has no cure so far [Music] aggravating continuously until death [Music] the disease causes the victim to lose memories and gradually prevents him or her from performing daily activities without help around five million Americans are suffering from it and it kills about one out of three seniors which makes it the sixth leading cause of death one of the key factors in Alzheimer's disease is the existence of beta amyloid proteins in the patient though there are a good number of traditional medicines such as done pestle and tatran we search have shown that cannabis can outperform all of them at preventing or delaying the onset of Alzheimer's and slow the disease's progression the psychoactive compound in cannabis tetrahydrocannabinol THC slows beta amyloid production and thereby the disease itself when applied in the right dose a report published in molecular pharmaceutics in 2006 theorized that cannabinoids might be shedding the amyloid plaque from affected neurons it concluded compared to currently approved drugs prescribed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease THC is a considerably superior inhibitor of amyloid beta aggression this finding was supported by 2013 2014 and 2016 study gradually conducted the Ross Kamp Institute University of Florida and the Salk Institute a 2006 study revealed the THC stimulated appetite and reduced nighttime agitation providing relief for Alzheimer's patients another study from the Journal of Alzheimer's disease reported that cannabis extract does reduce the negative symptoms of Alzheimer's including anxiety depression aggression insomnia hallucinations based on the research is done so far it seems clear that both THC and CBD exerts positive effects on Alzheimer's patients finally Alzheimer is a qualifying illness for a medical cannabis license in California State and patients can restraint the

extract crap video so we have a couple of patients who we want to try and use our Harlequin and make some RS oh so we will have some CBD in our RS Oh for those familiar RS o is the Rick Simpson oil you can check that out on Phoenix tears CA but we're gonna do this quick recipe and so what I did I took an ounce of our Harlequin 28 grams put a cup of Everclear into the jar and I shook it up for two minutes I put my timer on my phone and shook it up and now I'm bringing it into the bowl here when I'm done I'm going to put it in the extract craft we're gonna boil it down and we're gonna see how it turns out alright so I've got a couple of strainers here I don't want any any material in my liquid no I might even do one more process to get all these solids out let me set that out okay let me just show you here real quick I'm gonna get all this out of here and this filter does a great job you can use a coffee filter but look at all this stuff that I got out of here that's just gonna lead to a better product when we're done by the alcohol in there okay we good now we've got some beautiful green light green liquid we'll be filling up our extract craft tent nothing but luscious goodness in the old cup let's do this machines I had to send it back to get it updated but it is all up to date I've got the turbo mode and all that all the improvements that they've made and I'm just going to get some ice for the ball we will make sure that our screw is all the way plugged in I've made that mistake before my lid goes on and grab some ice dick of the Internet I will speed this up and hopefully hang on hang on it'll be done just a second here we go BAM wow this turbo mode is crazy this is only one hour gone by and we're gonna be done soon so I'm gonna let this go a little bit further but not a whole lot because I am going to be transferring it from the metal bowl here to a silicone container and we'll finish in the silicone silicone container and it will make your life a lot easier so next update I will have it transferred into actually I'll video that so we will do an update here in a few minutes and see how we're doing so here's an example of what I am talking about I will be taking the oil that is left in the in the container and transfer it into one of these obviously not this one because I've already done that so as you can see this is a finished product and the beauty of this is you can get it out easily trying to show you with one hand and I can't so I'll show you with the Harlequin when we're done so shortly I will pour the remaining liquid probably into this one depends on how much is in there but probably this one and we'll boil it down and then we will have it right in the finished container and it will be get out and and try so there you go that's coming up okay guys so I stopped it and I've got a little corner left in here but it's still very liquidy but when you look at it there's some settlement sediment in there and I want to get that out okay so I'm not sure if you're able to see probably not but I want to get that out so I took one of those big filters cut it and now I am going to just filter this little bit and I will be putting it into this little silicon which I believe it will not overflow and we'll see how pretty we can get it all that particle down in the bottom so there you go now I am going to see if I can squeeze the last drop out of here oh yeah I got a couple of good drops alright here we go Oh smells good okay now I am putting the magic potion in I'm praying I'm praying I'm not a praying guy but looks good all right YouTube so quick update I finished the Harlequin RSO and I have to say it turned out pretty darn good disappointing that I only got probably a couple of grams I didn't even measure it if you remember we used how much did we use we use probably an ounce and a half in the beginning but it is very stable I mean look at it will fold up on each other and and you can touch it and not I mean get a little oil but it's it's it's not bad so our patience I have somebody that has MS that we're gonna have try this he uses regular RSO takes it daily for his disease and it's going to give this a try so I will report back on that but in the meantime we really need to give this thing a test and I will volunteer to do that so I've got a DAB on my tool and I'm going to use my doctored ever to dab a little Harlequin RS oh and let's see how smooth it is how it tastes all right here we go it tastes really good so that tasted really good that was strictly Harlequin first time I've done it made RSO a lot of it and I have to say I kind of like that I don't know if it's gonna be economical maybe we're gonna have to grow a bunch of Harlequin outside this year and make a bunch of RSO out of it to be cost-effective but I can't wait to see how our patient likes it as well anyway that's our update this this time hope you liked it if you liked it down below like subscribe

you're new here welcome to you as well hope everybody's doing okay during this coronavirus self quarantine or whatever you want to call it hope everybody's doing okay we're still doing okay hope

this one this was clocking in at seven hundred thirty one point five milligrams of THC at one point eight milligrams of CBDs that means it's about 73 percent or so THC let's take a look at the syringes okay here's the RSO let's see if we can get it closed up whoa there we go take a look at that please forgive my shaking attempt we need to take some of this real soon please ignore my shaking I'm trying to control it I really need a dose of RSL I've been conserving it because as we all know there's a shortage right now so I cut back excuse me for the cough I don't have coronavirus I just baked before I started doing this video so I'm good don't worry of course I'm gonna be using this for a little while before I review it also I want to review the strawberry switchblade real quick I accidentally threw away two container guys I'm sorry I'm going I'm just not really what's the word I'm looking for organized during this crisis and I accidentally screwed up and threw away the container I went ahead and did a video for the strawberry switchblade if you want to go take a look at it I'll link it somewhere in the comments or in the video description it shows the close-ups and the weight and everything basically it's just a really good hybrid I like it during the day it's really tasty especially if I turn down the temperature on my vaporizer to like 365 I can really taste the strawberry and it really tastes good it's a good hybrid for during the day I don't usually use it too close to bed because it's not an indica and I'm usually an indica person but this one I actually like and it works pretty well for me if you have any questions about the strawberries witchblade please ask me in the comments and I'll get back to you as soon as I can last but not least I wanted to show you a quick sneak peek of this little box I've got vyvanse sent me they sent me a new device to try out and I'm really liking it a lot they said I'm not allowed to show the device or the name of the device or anything like that I can just show the box that I've got I think it's being released on the 26th I think that's what they said which is tomorrow if I'm not mistaken then I can get to going on the review for this and show you the product I really like it a lot it's a really cool little device wish I could show you more I'm dying to show you more but they won't let me so we'll just have to wait a little while on that and oops there goes the bag okay that's it just wanted to let you guys see the move RSO I'll be using it for a little while and then I'll review that the

evening a woman from Derbyshire says cannabis has helped her fight breast cancer without resorting to chemotherapy Linda Carson from Willington near Derby has been using cannabis oil since shortly after her diagnosis her doctors were amazed to find that her tumor has indeed shrunk by two-thirds since she started taking the oil Linda is now calling for more research on how cannabis could help fight one day maybe cure some cancers gareth own report linda Coxon takes her daily medication this is cannabis oil derived from the same plant used in the recreational drug remarkably it appears to have helped shrink the aggressive cancerous tumour in Linda's breast to 1/8 of its original size and means for now she can avoid chemotherapy I hadn't known whether it would do anything at all really because it's untried and and so on but to shrink by two-thirds in what effectively was five weeks was just amazing and it sent me into a total spin if I'm honest I've had another ultrasound scan and it did shrink by four millimeters and I've also had a CT scan which confirmed it still shrinking although the oil is made from the cannabis plant it's not hallucinogenic or addictive it's freely available in shops but health campaigners fear the stigma around cannabis could hold back research we need trials of this you know proper trials on people to see whether it works on other cancers do you think the research in this has been delayed because people reacting to that word cannabis absolutely I'm absolutely certain it has cannabis is a drug and everything we read about it it's illegal and people are frightened of it I do think that the mood music is changing because it isn't just me there are lots of people there's also scientific evidence dr. Wei Lu is researching the effect of cannabis on cancer at some George's University in London science backs up these cannabis based products as having an effect in patients with cancer especially in cancer cells so more informations required more research is needed and it's really to lay down once the thought whether or not we can use these chemicals in in patients but cannabis is a long way from being an approved treatment for cancer in a statement Cancer Research UK warned we don't advise taking cannabis outside of a clinical trial because it might interfere with other treatments there's no scientific evidence from clinical trials that cannabis or chemicals found in cannabis helped to treat breast cancer but Linda remains convinced I've started to become evangelical about it because it's being ignored and it shouldn't be she's already taken in her story to Parliament and will continue to campaign Gareth Owen ITV News", "xvOEzUvjP94": "[Music] and just that quickly Riley mailer takes from medical marijuana I take it four times a day one in the morning and then during lunch and then during dinner and then at night before I go to bed the thirteen year olds from Delaware says cannabis oil has helped treat the tumor that was eating away at her bones in second grade and my face started to grow and it was getting bigger my mom decided to take me to the hospital the news from the doctor was grim Riley who was seven at the time was diagnosed with aggressive giant cell granuloma only a handful of people in the world have the disease I was just like so uncomfortable because you know like seeing my face in the mirror and it's like Oh big and it made me really sad and stuff I was also in pain because of my seizures that I started having my stomach would cramp up and I would start I started to hallucinate it's an actually like a gut emptiness of when the doctors you know first described to us what was happening and what they thought was gonna happen after surgery Riley's mom decided to give her medical marijuana to see if it would help her symptoms I was so scared anytime you give your child any kind of new prescription you're scared to do you're looking for those side effects we just researched a lot and came across you know medical cannabis as a possible alternative that could help her heal and I couldn't find anything that was detrimental with using that the tumor it shrunk the seizures they stopped the way smaller than it was before I haven't had a reoccurrence in about four I'm taking cannabis oil it made me feel so much better and my bone was growing back the roots of my teeth were growing back before they were held in with stitches and I was told they wouldn't live but the roots regenerated and I still have my teeth dr. Andrew ordered with the doctor says there's not enough evidence to support whether this type of treatment works the key is if you're thinking about trying it you need to see a pediatrician who specializes in using marijuana and especially in dosing marijuana CBD oil for your kid before I took cannabis my brain was normal and then after I took cannabis all of these years my brain was the same and it didn't harm anything Riley's now made it her mission to help other sick kids get the medicine they need speaking in front of legislature she's already pushed to pass three laws in Delaware one makes it legal for kids in the state to be administered medical marijuana another lets children take it at school O'Reilly law was to make cannabis legal for children because it was illegal and when my mom gave me cannabis it made me feel so much better and I didn't understand why other kids wouldn't have it I wanted to help those kids hi she's also created the nonprofit Riley's smile foundation it's very hard knowing what helped you and seeing other people who could be helped by it bringing smiles to sick children and their families by giving them a better quality of life just like she she is very inspiring to a lot of people and I love seeing that but what she's doing changing kids lives one law at the time the chef's for Inside Edition com [Music]", "U0-5JLykrVU": "it's known to be relaxant and sometimes a pain reliever but can cannabis do more than just treat symptoms of disease can it actually cure serious illnesses the reason for thinking it might stems from the fact that the medical use of marijuana has become legal in almost half of all American states and anecdotal evidence has been accumulating that cannabis in oil form can actually reduce cancerous tumors anecdotal evidence isn't enough but pharmaceutical companies are starting human clinical trials Alistair Lee's head has been investigating in California I watch women die every day I watched children bury their moms so I know what is in front of me and I'm doing everything I can to prevent that Serah amento and her family are running out of time she has stage 4 cancer the chemotherapy isn't working and the doctors say there's nothing more they can do left with no options everybody speaks about cannabis oil there's a certain stigma especially being a mother of doing cannabis oil you know everyone looks at it like you're getting high and it's not it's a medical it's it's a natural option that the government's ignoring and I knew I want to live I have to live cannabis has been used as a medicine for millennia nearly half all US states have legalized it for medicinal use research into its cancer fighting properties is limited but the signs are strong enough to get britain's leading cancer research group interested and even trialing cannabis treatments cannabinoids are certainly very interesting molecules and there's a lot of research there's hundreds of papers being published looking at their chemical properties against cancer cells turning that into effective treatments is a long road and certainly it's not going to be the one cure for cancer because nothing is this is how you're able to engage what level of activities going on in your body it's all about scientific proof collecting case studies with medical evidence I have many many thick books of medical records but this is really one that matters Stephanie LaRue says she has proof the impact of taking cannabis oil was the fact that the cancer is gone all the tumors are gone they dissipated in my body with no evidence of metastatic disease they're just gone Stephanie's doctor confirmed to the BBC the tumors had gone despite her opting out of conventional medicine but stopped short of endorsing cannabis oil cannabis works no chemo I only did cannabis and the tumors are gone and the scans I have is evidence and proof of that kind of like what more do you need a lot more according to one of the world's leading oncologists this is chemotherapy so these are natural products you know man who helped cure Lance Armstrong's cancer needs data and real scientific evidence until somebody proves it whether it be the manufacturers who put together a clinical trial whether it be doctors who get government funding to do it or patients who say here my records and let's put it in a medical journal and be transparent with what I had what I was treated with him what my outcome was then until that it's snake-oil again I'm not trying to impede progress or say it's bad but at the same time I don't want people to get false hope so cannabis snake oil or can this plant cure some forms of cancer what is the evidence there have been hundreds of scientific papers published this study came out of the University of East Anglia last year showed that mice with cancer had the tumors reduced using cannabis this the first human tickle trial eight out of nine patients responded but they will died within the time we'd expect despite that there's a long list of charities and research groups that say it's an interesting development it may have a clinical use and now the big pharmaceutical companies are getting involved this huge cannabis garden is in Britain GW Pharmaceuticals is developing drugs from the cannabis plant the latest human trial is a cannabis oil to treat brain cancer we understand how some of these molecules work we have the preclinical evidence and the regulators have given us permission therefore to expose humans in a clinical trial setting at this point in time but for now it's an underground industry a bloke in a backyard with a stick a bucket and a jar of solvent who's making the cannabis oil he wanted to be known only as cell not because the cannabis is illegal in California but because of the flammable materials he's using we then pour the liquid into the pen so this is this is the finished product yes that's the finished product there's about one gram of oil in there and do you think this is a cure the cancer in many instances it is and it can be it depends on the person's particular condition or their state how the cancer is but we've seen thousands and thousands of people get better from using this oil squeeze out at very little and now and then I just and swallow it but to be effective Sarah needs to take a lot more than this and eating a gram a day is too much for many people when you ingest it you get 20% of the medication the properties that actually attack the cancer when you do it rectally you get 70% so you're actually getting more benefit from doing it that way and you don't get high and not only do you not get high there's no sleepiness there's snow there is no side effects it is her only hope but it's also unproven medicine I'll continue doing it until the cancer is gone I believe it's the best option I've seen it work for others and I'm hoping it'll work for me Alice Solis had their and just to reiterate what he reported there is as yet no clinical evidence that shows where the cannabis can reduce or destroy tumors but it's a question that more and more researchers are trying to answer", "FsqTJZjyj-g": "hello everybody and thank you so much for joining me I am so excited to share this video with you I'm gonna be teaching you how to make cannabis infused oil in five minutes or less and you do not need any special equipment to make this happen my name is Andrea McHargue I'm a cannabis wellness coach and educator and I'm really passionate about teaching you how you can incorporate cannabis into a healthy lifestyle for you I offer private consultations I'm soon to be offering group classes please check out my website at wwlp.com so that you are always in the lead all right I'm going to talk to you about why I love this recipe so much the first reason is that you do not have to use coconut oil if you don't like it or you have something else that you want to infuse go for it use olive oil use grapeseed oil use butter you can even warm up honey and infuse honey this exact same way there is no need to decarbonise I will teach you really quickly how to dose this after the video and I want to point out before we dive in that the recipe is linked in the description below in a handy PDF for you to print out so let's dive in here we have everything that you need to make cannabis infused coconut oil we have 1 cup of coconut oil a knife a spoon something to heat up the coconut oil with and this is the star of the show so this is a vial a 1 gram vial of something called Rick Simpson oil so it's also called RSO that stands for Rick Simpson oil it's also called FICO's which just sounds like a terrible name for full extract cannabis oil and basically what it is I in most cases is its cannabis that has been extracted into alcohol and then the alcohol has been boiled off and you're left with this really sticky goo sometimes it's extracted using co2 extraction which is also excellent so if you can find super concentrated cannabis oil that you know meets all the standards if you can get it with lab testing all of that then this is a fantastic way to make your edibles because it's very easy the first thing that you were gonna do is to make our coconut oil really warm because basically what we're gonna do is heat up our coconut oil or butter or whatever it is and then we're just gonna squirt this in - they are and stir it around until it's dissolved so I'm gonna go heat it up in my microwave and we'll be back in a sec the coconut oil was in the microwave for about 2 and 1/2 minutes now that depends on how cold your coconut oil is if you're in cold cold Canada then sometimes your coconut oil can be really freezing so you want it really warm this is very liquidy you you don't want it boiling or anything but you want it very warm because this stuff is so sticky and it's gonna take a while to dissolve so basically all I'm going to do you can see it looks gross actually whew I've got it all over the side you just squirt that in and you can see how green oh maybe you can't yeah you can see how green it is and you can see why it's sort in a syringe it is so so sticky so I'm just gonna try to get this off I'm not sure what I can do with the stuff that's left in the syringe I'm sure there's a way to get what's left out of there out oh yeah this is quite green I'm not sure if it's picking up on screen very well but this is a very green extraction sometimes they turn out black like almost Atari color and sometimes they turn out more like this all right that actually seemed to dissolve really really well so I'm just gonna spend some time stirring it just to make sure it's all the way through you definitely don't want to see any chunks in there you want to make sure that this is really really well incorporated into your coconut oil and then we're going to let the oil cool down and it's gonna take quite a while because we got it quite hot and then you can use this beautiful oil for anything so the cannabis infused fake 5 I posted last week absolutely any recipe that uses a cup of coconut oil sure half a cup sure cut it in half if you did butter instead make some cookies or put it on your toast you can do whatever you want alright wasn't that fantastically easy I hope you want to dive in the other reason why I love this recipe is because of dosing so let's talk really quickly about how to figure out doses for this cup of cannabis oil that we have first of all if you have lab tested cannabis then you will have the entire everything you need right on the label so check the label see how many milligrams of THC or CBD or the combination of both is in there and then you can use the same process to divide up your doses as we do down below if you don't have access to lab testing and you are going to go for an estimate then you can estimate that that one milligram that one milliliter vial of RSO has about seven to eight hundred milligrams of THC total so that's a that's 800 milligrams about for one cup of oil there's 48 teaspoons in a cup I looked it up so that leaves you with about 17 milligrams of THC per teaspoon so that makes it easy to know how to dose out your edibles or how to dose yourself if you have questions about this if you have comments please leave them below it really helps other people to find my videos when you make a comment so and I really like to read your comments and answer them so please do that and as I said before exciting things are happening at reveal especially if you live in and around

please subscribe to my channel and like this video I really appreciate I will see you next Saturday", "JjTiqvrpnFA": "what you think that this the oil the would have a positive effect on these chil I and I definitely believe it would yes because it's any seizure you know anything like this so I mean I'm never treated in anyone with this condition but I would definitely if this was my child I definitely put this child on the oil try it I mean the main thing here is you're not giving the child something that can harm it no no's arm factor yeah no danger so but I think we have good results with this I really do I think there's hope here that's an awful thing I mean you have to live like that my god that's not a life at all no this gives a child a chance and this is the same way to see with these autistic children you know yeah yeah it just does amazing maturity I trust each other their autistic - yeah most of them yeah well I think that doing your would probably well I believe if it can't cure it is probably gonna be best control you're gonna find and like I said it's harmless so I would definitely try it that's what we're we have been aiming for we've been trying to get this oil here in Iceland legally right for a year now hmm the doctors are working against us Corsair yeah but so now we're coming to a point where we have to say okay are we going to continue on this path and and do this for the next ten years or are we gonna get the oil somewhere else if you thought about taking the channel to the US yeah I've thought about that yeah but I mean illegally and in the system there it's not gonna be eligible but well the problem - I mean the oils available and me dispensaries and things in the US now but but the quality to see that there's no quality control there's no standards in place yet you know we need the freedom to do this simple research in no time we can you know bring this a little too much better levels but I would I definitely would if this is my child I would definitely try that and I think and you know I mean I can't make guarantees but I think you're gonna have good results with this oh yeah yeah I've seen well I mean any like epilepsy or any of these other diseases that you know that it's very similar because you're into seizures yeah and it's great anti-seizure medication even you all's that I produce you know like Sanjay Gupta did that piece on CNN you know and it showed the epileptic children and it was reducing it reduced the number of seizures no question but it didn't stop them they still had seizures here and there even when they were taking off but as soon as I watched that I said if there was some THC and more can't seeing that oh I bet you the seizures would cease completely okay so he's very important yeah that's that's another question I had for you because many people are supporting the use of CBD or an or THC free oil yeah well that's a stupid I mean it's it is it's a synergetic effect of all those well over a hundred different cannabinoids working together that creates these effects these healing effects so the two eleven eight th seeds mean that's stupid I'm just plain stupid so you would recommend a THC high I tried I would try something like a 50-50 yeah CBD THC about the same strength and just small tiny doses we're child up over a few days but I'd be willing to bet that it would have quite a dramatic effect on a child like this okay yeah but norm so the dosage what what would you do a drop or no not even a drop when you're starting and even when I start an adult off in this oil it's really I tell people to start with it's just like a little tiny speck like 1/4 of a drop not much bigger than that okay nothing you know and then over every eight hours and then after four days try to double the dose because that gives us the body time to adjust to it this is a very strong if you got the clear oil it's a very strong medication but again no her almost could have caused the child do is sleep so just keep just doubling the doses every four days and then just watch the child and see what happens and I'm willing to bet after you start doubling dose a couple times I think you'd start seeing some pretty dramatic results I would definitely do this and so you would continue this throughout well not necessarily because I mean the oil might be able to correct the illness you know I think it's a good idea that every child well everybody should be taking you all to protect themselves anyway but you know in case like this if we can bring that loss like y'all to autistic children once you get their body detoxify get these toxins gone they're no longer autistic well they don't have to keep taking you if they don't want it but I really believe in the near future I mean everything I'm seeing now the whole future of medicine is going to be in cannabinoids and you know I so I think it's a good idea to continue taking it but I would you know even if you just got a small quantity of oil like 2 3 grams or four grams not very much just because you know it's gonna take quite a while you're only giving us a tiny little doses like that it takes quite a while you use that much oil up yeah but just keep doing and I can't imagine it not I can't imagine it not helping and everything I firmly believe it would help yeah I think it gives you the best and safest option possible look I'm all I can do for your brother yeah thank you completed yeah I presented a message do some research look into it look what's going on in the internet go on YouTube look at all these children and everything people that are using this now this is no damn joke you'll get this marijuana nonsense out of your head says this this is a medicine and it's a wonderful medicine and it's safe non-addictive what else is are out there like this well PubMed they have hundreds and hundreds of peer-reviewed studies and all types of different things you know they're like well even now they're coming up with evidence now and I knew this years ago because we were treating schizophrenia experice that very effectively now they're admitting finally it's a very attractive treatment for schizophrenia yes but the thing is it's a safety of it no you're not giving your child something that's going to harm it and there's a good possibility that it could save the child's life and free the parents I mean the same thing with this if you have up to an autistic child or you have a child like this you're going to have to take care of that child for the rest it's like it'll never have a life at least with the oil it offers them an opportunity you know it gives them a chance what have you got to lose", "v5CTzVpxblk": "hey guys no way we're just running a little light to that song just bear with me guys okay what we're going to go through today is we're going to go through down our filtration so we're going to show you how to make a shout out a definitely product and a product you can make the effect it's okay so we're going to do three different grades through filtration again with this I'm using the pronoun to need a fuse with the parsley you can use dry us so these guys here they're half-gallon units and I don't know what's name is still again the status still tubes it does come with the weed which would we're going to discontinue and on one of these parts will go with it with the grass shooter but anyway there we have sorry there are double warm unit we're going to fill these halfway and just so we can get some sort of white bearing yep of the plant picture so I'm gonna actually put eight ounces of dry white material here mr. phone doesn't work that - eh - for the little boy I think actually sorry little list so I'll anyway it's going to be one cup we're gonna completely hear us just so we can keep an average on what we're doing the DL home usage in the plant material the material that I've ground up is it's very fine fine and we've used everything from as you can see here guys I've missed out on nothing so you're going to see a lot of stem everything routes everything lead families get one cup okay so we go luckily here you can see the powder that okay we got one cup now how much we're tooled up he's probably this area here for one cup so right that's a second cup okay that's the plan for trail 10 like I said that is up well they need to stem everything I have not missed out on anything everything is fine okay what I've been doing is I've been cooling down the alcohol with liquid nitrogen because alcohol again freezes at 172 so I've got the alcohol frozen then you know you're around the minus 150 seats inside that area or around that person we're gonna be pouring a little bit of this yeah this one again so what I'm doing something I'm bringing down the temperature planta - so when I can the alcohol with the plant material so I'm not going to release and undo the chloroform are we locking up just about everything in the planet just releasing the resin what you can do you can do this without your bridges you get a cryogenic fridge or you can do this with just your normal box freezer do is get some dry ice divide the preaches into segments where you can what I'm just about to show you can do these in each segments without disturbing the other require so nothing about your eyes preferably cryogenic freezers - 85 I'll let that sit for a couple of minutes five minutes or so to bring it down to temp and then we'll therefore what we're going to do is is those two units we're going to make sure we break it up because the liquid nitrogen is in there and if there is any moisture in the planet so it's going to stiffen it up so you've gotta break it up so you can freely have the alcohol interactive advantage oh okay that's why the smallest of the particle you get the faster the more interaction we'll have with the alcohol and that's what you want especially in cold temperatures because it takes such a long time for the alcohol at those cold-turkey to interact with people okay I'm going to be showing you we're just using get old coffee filters doing is we're gonna have three different models coming from this extraction so the first extraction we're going to do is from those two containers we're going to be pouring through one of these okay it's going to be your first one first pour and when I have my alcohol with that plant until i sterling fairly quickly little bit of vegetation and we didn't that 60 seconds I will poured straight through the filtration River and there we go so another thing to our I'll explain to it's about in about filtration so when you're saying in the filtration you don't want to go straight into eg a copy basically what you're doing is are walking out the filters and you're taking something so much more time to filtrate that let's say you're training out those lipids fats and waxes and what might be the root the particles pitching my god so you want to do it through something like like this year this that uses to clean water and the alcohol one's really pretty through this but it picks up much of a bigger cut out I have now then once you've got rid of that plant not out of it I'm looking at some of the other particulars because it's sort of called Dan you can line up to you call me and it's gonna save you so much time the alcohol running through this couple filled up will be flat - quick because you've taken most of it through this filtration so and the reason you do that - because the quickly running on all through it in temperatures the less bleed through you can get unless bleed through can change color and get that in and out and you can start your distillation or or something able to shatter to evaporation a little ball the way it's good to be and the most important thing it's always spend a little extra time in making sure that your alcohol he's down to ten to one of the ten thirties and make sure you plant mature is it the same sanction as the alcohol and the UH products that you use to to mix everything like you another thing the least amount of air coming in contact with the water natural process right now checking the planet Oh here it sounds very crunchy so you know there is now putting a little more in the alcohol so I'll let that alcohol crystallize out top and I know you've got intense the alcohol busy here so we can see here that the alcohol speaking up there we have it - taking the temperature down on the alcohol alcohol into one suppose you want to know how much alcohol the guys for it so we're going to show you okay I'm going to be pouring one feet up off of the time it's hoppy website caused by the chances every kid I'm doing quickly know when you're not even three dollars I wouldn't know we do it like this always you want the first poll you can leave it in there for one minute maybe then 15 minutes half an hour to do temperatures all right you can leave it there for Lisa helping out without that core stability experiment so I have to I'm going to 5 minutes 10 minutes 15 minutes and find out where you think you old fuel your best plan these four you'll the old plant material and the style about expression you doing okay so now we're going to get don't forget I'm doing this in and out of the environment normally if you have a cryogenic reach you wouldn't be doing this everything will be all employers and you've got to know I'm doing so I can do this fairly quick so if you don't get to see it this we wanted it's pretty much self-explanatory so yeah shorten filter oh so we have the alcohol run through pretty quickly again with the French compress basically when we push down the plunger it's taken out most of the deadly to admitting exceeds and the longer you do sit through duration or the clients will sit as well by pushing the budget down pouring this down my skull the color coming out I hope you are and what I'm gonna do so here we go pulling down the alcohol grab your coffee pots so now we're doing our second run first pull that was the first one first ball which is going to be predominately up you know you took beans the flash off really quickly and you know the Warsaw you could think about doing these plots as long as you can - it hurted at the opportunity we're going to let that sit for a couple of more minutes and we're going to do an export in a separate unit so yeah and then we're going to filter it through different filtrations and then you're going to see the variance between the colors of the first run stick around Thoreau and what have a look at where we come up with and then again letting you nurture the inverse three different runs is going to be different percentages of the THC in each of all and different chirping curve balls well multiples of a different profile will come through more in the first and in some of the I mean more than the third we need depending on the on the style of tips that are in the package though anyway that's for your experiment and that we need to work out what dandy history board about all these experiments so we can all share the information and give it another middle sir getting back to the preach so yeah what'd you do get your bridges you can buy a second-hand box which if you want sir that's the hard way better so yeah you've got to make more footage you can divided into four units with again you're not going to get smaller tips because you're going to need to draw us in this whole fridge probably minus 10 good night it's better than nothing if you want to go to quite get it okay try Jenny's can start again about four and a half to five delt for a 17 cubic in cubic foot and up to 25 foot and you can get them all the way up to the - a DS that just breezes in stand-ups and it just you know when you using the system like this with the coffee pots you can you can my daughter we can put 50 litres you know fifty of those canisters in the fridge and you can do you can fill up as quickly is quickly arrived so and we just like that you've got salt and donors double wool same school principal interest yeah you're not going to expose it to the air no oxidization the coracle on duty the DC side you know I stretched out some of those runs well pumps were maybe seven runs in about 1215 pools to those rocks off he plated everything out of it without even being exposed can be done okay and that's when you do get everything back so if there's 18 percent like if you measure the plant material about 18 percent and in what I'm going to do is the first one I'm going to be doing that through a she's going to be the center up I'm just going to call and we got pouring it through Oh God and alcohol again we're holding it down was all these guys walk this is just coming from so we have to put more interaction with that virtue and the alcohol took up the dome dude over there and you can just go straight this goes with Lepidus government meets you can do this thing is an absolute alcohol to show you guys okay so the first one I took down okay you can see the planet chillin here okay there you go well the chlorophyll is caught and locked up okay head come through beautiful gold material your see a bit of a dragon tail in it and that's because you've got some fliers coming through very fine so what we're gonna do is we're going to freeze this again right start what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna grab one I'm gonna quit many times you want to go just helps the alcohol slick without a jar you know sorry and just kind of put some students up a minute and now with the spending focus on here we're going to be putting that in there this is like a possibly towards action you'll be doing a senior three to ESP what I do now so quite literally dark twice a week you still want to breathe Oh very tall so what we're doing now through that process we're now gone from one filtration which knocks most of the bigger bigger particles which I'll show you we can see those bigger particles that we took out now that's right little white because what you can do is you can keep these filters and they be doing your interval I saw the previous bill doesn't put that material into our cell because there's a lot of immature left in here and you can tell that why like this even nicer it's a bit powdery it's gonna go but we can tighten up to that all the material so you know disagree direct rebels don't win sir and a host we're going check out the other one now okay let's go what I'd like to do is it's all about it's all about getting the system to flex we're very very appreciative even later because it's all moving as quickly as I want on you see is all the second run to a school on its first filtration there we have it this is the second run I'm trying to there's no ever so slightly it's not important and you see the clock was going to pull back - and there is a little bit of alcohol wipes that you don't have to waste the alcohol you can see that in another pot let it let it run out and then alcohol just add that to your there we have it it's right through much prickly writer there we have it clean that this one again always use new new filters all the time you're going to be pouring anything that you've done with filtration it make sure it's clean because a lot of abuse mistake people who they they use the cotton coffee filters but they do it in the environment where someone's pruning or mulching down there to do the next Buster's in the air that passes just got back in here so why are you using coffee filters to filter out all the fires wing to the air so do it in another room obviously to be coming up in a clean room Pandora yeah pleats it you don't have to places but you can't help there do other that you can see this guy's this is hello I show you I stayed in that hold it there now now we're going to do a third row first pool and then then we'll just have a look at the different colleges between all three and then again throughout the week I'll win to bend down and then bring the oil to the lab next week and then what we'll do is we'll test all three and then find out where they come and the first one fight between them to a show so we get to see the difference in the percentage of THC to that officer we're really not going to do the only compression I'm going to do on this next one is I'm just going to be doing the shortening filter I'm not going to be able to enjoy patient J discussing different percentage at GHC coming through this is more plant material left to get sick less plant material more tears okay they just imagine when you got 13 you're doing 50 of these in the fridge so you can just imagine how much maturity actually does with Hitler spinning what 160 thousand [ __ ] dollars on a co2 the [ __ ] it's crazy you could you could you could set yourself up pretty big for one tennis balls 50 50 times another these units my five units up twenty liters takes 24 hours or a complete turn results and really the 20 leads to basically between 18 minutes well 18 ladies are in about five pounds some way here though so just imagine I look 25 keep twisting rich well throw like technique we went and that's just working out so that we take me so much better than co2 much more probable beginning you're out lace them up so it expired and you return the bed here we go that's not with you there we go Punky's check down a little bit she's my sister today we have that the temperature India is going to be at least killing the alcohol ways how high these super shook I reckon were to really be able to the 1 145 150 months anyway reddit or myself will bring something positive - the city poster world forget about the whole industry play what'd he say he thinks queen is so important because you don't want to reach antimonite something that works so hard to play equalization of temperatures and for going to the next one there's some good to pick up parts of the planet coming through this one some of the heavier pops coming through on the planet make sure your temperature is okay so we've done now three months in the first one the first one we use half a liter of alcohol by month we had two cups in two units so what we're doing is we're pouring our alpha leader in each of those Spanish build French colonies presses and then agitate it that's the first rock first pour let it sit in there for at least 60 seconds and then we take them out in the pouring into a new filter or a filter that allows the alcohol okay the next one which is the second month with wool including port aliza someone neither have we pulled that out for shortening filter again and as I'm doing that I'm cleaning the other one is finished I put that through so you can see this a sort of a system that if you work out the system every time that you're doing one part you can do another possibly not to preach and just working on one sit yourself up we need to do multiple run so that's why it's good to keep notepad board where you've got your history notes on there for that that entire row and then you just want it again on temperature how it's reacting color like last week I showed you how to do another gram count how much saturated I think we had about 200 milligrams just you can work at that equation with how much these in every go and then you would have to be 50 government up north in your notes or every quarter per gallon you had my nose what else here so we went so we go through one two three ones for single pool hall and on the third one we're just going tomorrow through that through that shorty filter that's the last bite people this is the one that we're not gonna winterize just going to keep just running through the short legs over here the first one we definitely gonna change to share so we're probably gonna go through to the Torah session a few other techniques sick and what I'm going to only utilize it wants alcohol in here and it's up to you this is what I do just for this one I'm actually going before it alcohol into these guys and I'm going to be late at sea for a period of time and that can be as long as you want two hours 24 hours to pour out whatever I'm just going to be having the alcohol sitting here and sitting every now and again I'll welcome welcome start up on that accentuate everything and remove everything and then you can either turn these into the topical again that's kind it's a filtration long as you kept your temperature spot so what was that dirt is we're going to call this alcohol so what I'd like to say what I do now is I'll just push everything down and let that sit for as long as she walked you stood that you know give reality every two hours see a little difference in colors here advice now you first got your centerr definitely long not always like that here and that's basically it guys it's just showing you that filtration dictates on the strength of your product are you using carbon paper filters filters that people tell you no like that or 0:45 we the pressure up which large amounts of alcohol and you know and a -100 through some beautiful treasure to the low surface area at minus 45 and you can get a crystal crystal clay Thompson right yes I know filters what made you put Stalin that's about it a short one today I have to help out with with drawing cannabis through the alcohol the technique that that'd be coming out is going to be do they see up into that City Council that's better any question guys to help out a little bit but keep the temperatures high alcohol fine food people talking about you 23 if you're not doing it in that closed environment or our backyard you know rocket using the 203 and then on back an area way to keep after the bond we justify it's worse than you want but if you don't mind Western mind you want to do our first run we'd be 200 very quickly to my jokes very royal but did he get anywhere reaches very lovely reliable free Jaffa theoretical the old abrasions better than the newer newer versions coming out of the new competition so the footprint is much smaller anyway so the old legit what else filtration and that's basically it and have you rented that doubt for the week all up to 96% of ER anyway so that's it I really hope I helped up just before I do on that cooking show yes first second litter so the colors it seems to be getting adopted down there but anyway I'll wear the beads down and again bringing the next week and I will be in three different parts so we can break them down really quickly and then get a mission next door again like I said to you I'm going to go to this totally another three times in a roundabout a - sporting environment and believe in walk out what if it's affecting the path and this month like I said to you this will let me get the one filtration and this one here I'm going to be doing there we go so I pulled that walk down it's all old content but anyway thank you very much an honor to enjoy this and uh happy distilling and that's it any questions about that extracting cannabis just already my little Tex or whatever okay please do something still the best that a lot anybody know worry about just stopped", "d4z4TYZGYY8": "hey guys it's adrian the naturalist and we're just finishing our very clean 16 car wash that my dad gave me say what hey guys we just finished the car wash it's adrian the naturalist having a great day hope you guys are having a great humble day it is wednesday it is beautiful it is sunny it is awesome here love you guys well hey guys hey it's adrienne the naturalist and we are back my hair is a little goldish blondish in the front sides it's still got the brown rocking it in the back and your girl's in uh bubble gum pink with cotton candy lips i swear to god that's what it looks like just want to hop on real quick before i take a drive here to go to the nursery with my mask on of course i want to show you guys that i got an order from a company this has really helped my headaches and migraines you can find them online they're called lazarus naturals and they send me this really cute little free sticker they sent me a little pamphlet on their products and how they work and how they make them let's see what it says from the farm to your door our process start to finish your cbd starts as hemp grows on central oregon farms this is out of oregon i guess it starts at oregon and then after harvest the hemp is dried baked and tagged cannabinoids terps and flavonoids are extracted and filtered to remove impurities plant material is tested for heavy metals pesticides and levels of potent potential potency sorry um cbd is formulated with active effective ingredients and a third-party test for residual solvulence heavy metals pesticides microbial impurities and potencies and finally they're packaged at our at their fda listed ccmp facility and it says at the bottom we fill every order ourselves using biodegradable and recyclable materials this part is printed on 100 post consumer waste paper and in the front it talks about them there's a picture i think of the owner and with a bunch of hemp plant and it says made to work we do it all from our farm to your front door we deliver consistent high quality and effective products thank you for choosing lazarus naturals and you can find them at i'll link it down below ladrissnationals.com they sell two sizes and what i got from that's really been working for my headaches and migraines is putting into capsules twice a day of their full spectrum cbd rso which is known as rick simpson oil rick simpson is a canadian who patented a marijuana oil and now it can be made derived from cbd hemp plant and this uh extraction process of rso has been known to dissolve tumors in the body and with what's going on in my head my head pain it'll help just you know continue to make it smaller and manageable and it really seems to work each small syringe they sell their one gram syringes are 39.99 i believe on their website and for one of those you get 20 doses out of it you literally put like there's you'll see half a milliliter in a capsule and it'll fill a double size zero capsule like halfway to three quarters just perfectly so 50 milligrams of full spectrum cbd rso and i want to show you guys what they throw in for free right now and then we all need this with a virus going around the good old coronavirus they sent me some lemon scented 80 alcohol antiseptic topical solution spray naturally kills 99 of germs and this is about four three and a half ounces almost 3.4 fluid ounces all right well i will show you guys the rso here in a second i promised you guys i was going to show you the full spectrum rick simpson oil cbd version that i was talking about that i showed you guys i read the pamphlet on the left show you the sticker on the bottom middle and here's how i do my doses so these are a hundred or a thousand milligram syringes each they're 40 on their website i believe it's 39.99 plus tax and shipping um each syringe has 20 doses at 50 milligrams of cbd rso full spectrum um i take two a day i wait six hours apart and i take them with a little bit of like a cracker or starch because they're hard on the stomach because they're you know an rso rick simpson oil version of um cbd um and what was i gonna say with that and i also do it with a little bit of fat mixed in so like a glass of milk would be good or some kind of other like coconut milk if you don't do dairy something just a little bit of fat to bind the oil with in your stomach it is harsh you do not necessarily have to take it in capsule it takes longer to activate it takes two hours to activate its potential peak at three hours and lasts for another two so it lasts longer but it takes longer to take effect um it's more cost efficient um to take it this way but if you were to per say take it on a little piece of cracker or bread or under your tongue if you can actually um adhere to the taste of it's a little earthy a little kind of you know earthy tasting but under the tongue sublingually is the fastest way next to vaping or smoking and no you cannot vapor smoke rick simpson oil it can also at last be put on topically to um for things like rashes or cancers rick simpson oil was created by canadian his name was rick simpson hence why it's called rick simpson oil and this is the full spectrum cbd version this is actually helping patients dissolve cancerous tumors you can put on skin cancer and it'll dissolve away the skin cancer it's really good for headaches and migraines which i suffer from if you haven't been to my channel yet it's good for chronic pain issues like fibromyalgia arthritis like i suffer from it's fantastic because it's full spectrum cbd for anxiety and depression mood disorders schizophrenia paranoia it's a good level out this has up to three percent thc in it so it is technically a marijuana product but in my program that i do for recovery from drugs and alcohol this is considered cbd and it is a supplement you only have to be 18 to buy this online or in washington state where it's made locally in oregon um these expire in may of 2022 so i just bought these so these last each you know they're good for about a year and a half to store them away i would say don't store them in a hot area not too cold either as you can see this oil fills up about half the capsule at 50 milligrams i can't zoom in with my hand with a tripod but here's what it is um and you can't really see it either it's kind of oh there we go 1 000 milligrams total of cbd 100 milligrams cbd per milliliter and i take half a milliliter twice a day that's what's in each one of these capsules and then in addition to that i wanted to show you guys another video on the other cbd oil that i combine with this on a daily basis i take this with these twice a day and i'll take a dose in the afternoon to relieve some pain and anxiety i suffer from as you can see my hands shaking because i get chronic headaches and migraines almost daily for the last couple years my higher power god is healing me he's healing me on my cluster headaches as well um i'm also doing it through diet and exercise meditation prayer um it's a full it's a full job to take care of headaches and migraines and chronic pain issues so i cut out sugar again no sugar sugar substitutes unless i'm treating myself and i go out like during the week for a coffee to go and there's maybe a little sugar in the oat milk that they have at the coffee stand and i'm also going to look into cutting out processed foods more my body's detoxing right now but yeah definitely check out lazarusnaturals.com and check out their products they also sell tinctures and creams and all that fun good cbd stuff that helps with uh mental and physical ailments and disabilities in life so this was adrian the naturalist i definitely give this a 10 a time this combined with the relax full spectrum cbd oil i get from cbd diamond.com or maybe it's diamondcbd.com i was getting mixed up that one i just showed you i will do a separate video on that too as well and give you a review but this is a definitely like i said a 10 out of 10 star rating is the only thing combined with the other cbd oil and even on its own that helps with my headaches and migraines and it's actually reducing them down the amount during the week as well as the intensity so check this product out you will not be disappointed i love you guys i'm sorry i'm getting this out a day late here on thursday i filmed the rest of it yesterday on wednesday i had a really nice good sunny day um and i hope you guys are having a good morning or afternoon or evening wherever you're at thanks for tuning in to my channel my name was eight my name is adrian the naturalist i'm still waking up it's almost 8 39 a.m here i'm just eating some crackers and taking my medications for the morning and my cbd oils um for my pain anxiety migraines headaches you know all that fun stuff that i deal with on a daily basis that can be managed and can get better um but yeah i should make a video if you guys want on my full approach to how i help my pain and mental disabilities through natural medicine and we've got some pharmaceutical medicine here i take that i talked about maybe in a video there's my crackers there's my water putting some more capsules together you guys got some sweet potatoes some pears lots of good whole foods that i've been eating that i've been helping so i'm detoxing that like i said all right guys hope you have a nice day i'll see you later hi guys it's adrian the naturalist and my mom and i and her dog are at christensen's nursery flower store outdoor store all masked up and ready wipes and hand sanitizer so this is my lucky brand clothing mask that i really like and i wear it and then off of the day when i go out a couple times a week and then i will throw it in the wash and let it hang dry so we're gonna go look

everybody this is Tino from peace love and pitbulls and this is my sweet shorty and today is kind of a big deal March 14th 2015 three years ago today I got some of the worst news I've ever received from a vet that my girl had lymphoma cancer and it was so bad that he said it would take her in about eight weeks that's what he said quote it's going to take her that was three years ago today and she is still here alive and well this is not a poltergeist this is not CGI she is here 100% because of cannabis oil we did no chemo we did a little bit of prednisone we weaned her off that about a month into the cannabis oil but my girl is here three years later because of cannabis oil and the dog cancer survival guide we'll get more into that in a minute my vet said it's a miracle I've never seen a dog last longer than a year I said no it's not a miracle it's cannabis oil let me show you her this is the date and then the diagnosis right there we recently did bloodwork the lymphocytes test came back 17% normal is 12 to 30 her white blood cell count was six point nine five to 15 is normal and with lymphoma you see higher her liver values looked great quote looked great the other quote from my vet is she her blood work didn't look like a dog who had cancer who had a lymphoma and I want to show you how so what happens is what happened is piece 11 pimples kind of has a bigger big following on Facebook so I was getting barrage of questions and messages how did you do it with you so three years ago I started a group Facebook called my dog beat cancer with cannabis oil if you just punch in my dog beat cancer it'll take you right there there's about 3,000 people in there and I want it and I just so what I'm doing is I created that to shout from the rooftops rooftops to spread the gospel that is cannabis oil and to let everybody know what we did exactly and what we did exactly is cannabis oil THC and CBD together from cannabis not hemp let me repeat that not just CBD not from him CBD and THC from cannabis not him from the flower not the shake it should look something like this this is what our protocol looks like syringes one has THC one has CBD this is for night it's it's called fille co full extract cannabis oil it's a little more potent so we do that at night so they can go to sleep and it's fights the cancer and then we have during the day tinctures now depending on your weight your illness four legs or two this works on people too is going to determine how much dissipating shoes you take during the day for her it was three times a day different teachers and then the Figo at night always so I can't stress this enough I see forums I see threads I see people always talking about CBD anything that you order that's being advertised online is most likely hemp if you're fighting disease especially cancer you need cannabis oil look from my research from my anecdotal evidence I'm sharing what we did to beat this we did the cannabis oil THC CBD from cannabis not hemp and we did the dr. demian dressler dog cancer survival guide I will tag him his book in this post you can go directly to it download that book immediately he's very big on staying positive as we know dog picks dogs pickup are on our energy we need to be strong we need to and that's that's a huge part of this I I don't want to get all woowoo on you but that was huge I kept my attitude positive I had it in my head we're gonna beat this we watched nothing but comedies if we did watch TV I kept my schedule I didn't I treated her like everything was fine but we did the cannabis oil and we did the dog cancer survival guide demian dressler also mentions if you're feeding raw which all my dogs are fed raw not to feed raw during their illness their stomachs are strong they can eat stuff they can bury stuff that'll kill humans but they have the strong stomachs what he's what he said was why stress and already taxed immune system with stuff they may be fighting in their food makes sense to me so he's got a diet he's got a plan cooked food as you're fighting the cancer fighting the disease since then we're back on Raw so she beat it we're back three years later she's here if you don't get the cannabis oil from if you want to know where we got it it was from this guy named Jesse from OC consultants I started off with him at another company but now he's got OC consultants and you can reach him directly at me the number six two six eight nine zero zero four seven four six two six eight nine zero zero four seven four you can talk to Jesse directly from OC consultants if you don't get your cannabis oil from Jesse make sure that it is pure that it's lab tested that it's from the flower and not the shake which jesse is and they should be able to wherever you get it they should be able to give you a protocol for what you're fighting the illness weight age all that stuff I want to keep this short so happy anniversary to my girl three years going strong thirteen years old no lymph nodes if you guys are fighting lymphoma you know lymph nodes are back to normal I don't even feel him anymore she's she's getting old if she slowed down a lot because of old back injury she has but she's still here three years later she beat it we beat it with cannabis thank you guys for watching and if you have any questions hit up Jesse don't waste your time messaging me call Jesse immediately thank you guys and peace eleven pit bulls and kisses before we go yeah give him air give it that nostril bye guys", "L5-94-kFwsw": "[Music] this isn't a nice lift I don't take in and just take THD out no we've learned that the entourage effect of this all the constituents in the plant is what benefits the body our body has it's a whole unit of symbiotic relationships and cannabis is like the conductor in the meantime I've also had a chronic pain problem I have a bone spur on my lower vertebrae I had been on gabapentin vicodin flexural I had a nerve stimulator that I wore on my back well now I had these edibles and I'm making for other people and I thought well you know I'm gonna give it a try first I went off the flexural I had already gone off the gabapentin I was like I'm sleeping good at night and and it was I never went after this for myself it was all about cancer I wasn't trying to help myself but it's helped me it made me remember everything I ever wanted to do since I was young I always tell my mom I don't know what I want to be when I grow up I want to help people and therefore I was like okay so she's basically explaining to me that I need to inform people just inform them give them some knowledge and if they take it and they run with it great if they don't then they don't okay before I met Eddie I pen after I met Eddie I got a little better because now I'm applying this made of healing oil to my gums and I'm doing baked goods doing other products I started relieving the pain in the back you know and I'm like okay I have something here that gave me hope then Eddie had reached out to me and said because I take the medicine myself my wife passed away two weeks after my mom passed away in an accident a block up the street from my home and it put me in a depressed depressed Satan where I couldn't sleep I started taking the medicine myself because he told me you need to take this so you can sleep it'll give you the right kind of sleep and it'll help with that I was able to take the medicine and find out like you know what this is what I want to do I want to help people that are like me and like my mom and so what I started to do is I talked to him and he saw me I have these medicines this medicine and it's available to people but people don't know about it so what I did is I would take his pamphlet and I would see people that needed to help and I would explain to them how this helps and this is who you need to contact now to get on to somebody that was really helped by this my husband he had quit work years ago he had a mental breakdown he's been diabetic since he was a kid bad arthritis he's had a few heart attacks and he was diagnosed with dementia I didn't even think to give him any of the edibles and stuff that I was working with or any any of this oil even though I thought you know I thought this this really is a tool that everybody should have if they want it if it's gonna help him but I didn't think about it helping him because he's already confused you know I'm how could I make it worse I went I forgot to order his sleeping medication and the doctor was just getting ready to put him on it's the step just before hospice because I told her I said I am just overwhelmed I said I cannot take care of him the way I need to and take care of my grandson who I ads and the grandbaby that my daughter had and I was just totally overwhelmed and she says what we're gonna put him on a pre hospice and get you some more help well I ran out of sleeping pills for him and I was he's just like frantic I'm not gonna sleep I'm not gonna sleep so I gave him a cookie I said here have this the next morning he woke up and he said he slept so good and he felt so good that he wanted to try that again well now he is totally off of trazadone he's off most of his psych meds he was on prednisone every day for the horrible pain of arthritis in his joints is he can't lift his arms up because his shoulders are frozen no God he's fallen and broken his hip you know he's just a mess he is off prednisone completely for the first time in years his diabetes is way better controlled and his his mind is working again he takes care of all his own doctor's appointments all his prescriptions he's picked up chores back in the house again he does the dishes he does the laundry yeah he he doesn't he's not real good about separating the whites out you know but he converses like a normal person he remembers where we're going tomorrow this this was his miracle and my miracle this was it to be afraid to give it to me because I thought it'd make him more confused when he already had dementia and to have it be what has helped his mind recover because he's not on all those toxic drugs anymore I I just I think it's a tool that we should all be able to use if we need it but it should just be available to us I think it's a damn shame that the government has done things the way they have when they really need to be helping people not not hurting people and not denying him what can help them I watched cancer with double mastectomy 'zed and my family and I had watched throat voice boxes come out what am I going to do now you know so I just got serious about being anti chemo and once I went and got on YouTube my world changed you know ray is like a ray of sunshine for all his friends and I mean he'd walk through the hospital and just seeing him would make people smile and for me to lose this ray of sunshine to cancer was was just horrible and I said well Ray Ray Ray I said I'm gonna look some stuff up I said you want to try this oil I printed up a bunch of stuff for him to look at I said let's let's go get cards let's go find this oil we went from store to store and we couldn't we couldn't find this stuff we we couldn't find it at all we saw lots of lots of just marijuana bud and all kinds of different products and some edibles and stuff but we just couldn't find it and so I told ray I said well I said I'll make it", "3msoAj5S6ts": "oh hi I'm just catching up on my Einstein here you know I read that if you take CBD it increases your IQ but I think it must be a scam because I don't understand a word in this book hi I'm Greg welcome to happy talk and today I want to talk about syringes and how to use them these syringes that we carry come in one gram 1 gram syringes and which is a thousand milligrams of hemp and that's pure hemp extract there's no carrier oils there's no MCT there's no other oils in it and other additives just pure hemp and we carry two kinds one is has 17% CBD one is 25 percent so 17 percent of a thousand milligrams this one has 170 milligrams this is the gold 25% formula so that means it has 250 milligrams per each syringe these syringes are marked by 1/10 of a gram and that's generally a dose 1/10 you might want to take half of one tenth or one twentieth of a gram in the morning another one twenty the night or just you know one 1/10 once a day and these are really easy to use all you have to do is take off the cap at the end and then push off your dose easiest thing is just put it on your finger and then put it between your gums and cheek or you can also put it off in a spoon push it down and spoon that is so they push out your dose put it between your cheeks and gums and that's it now the gold formula tastes like normal hemp wood like you expect it to taste and the green formula 7 the 17% definitely has more it has more plant materials so it's definitely a stronger taste but both are work excellent and excellent way to get your daily CBD and now if you'll excuse me I got some Einstein to study you", "6sMmlRFC5Mk": "hi welcome to another discussion on cannabis facts with the Edinson tree my name is Jim Leslie and one of the directors here so today we're going to be talking about suppositories yes cannabis suppositories specifically rectal suppositories today now some of you might be wondering why would I ever put cannabis there well there's a very good reason why some people find themselves in a serious health crisis and they need to take increasing amounts of THC for instance to try and combat not only the symptoms for instance of cancer but the progression of the illness when you're fighting significant chronic progressive illness sometimes you need to get your doses up to higher levels and it's hard to do that especially if your cannabis naive if you've never used THC before it can get you very high particularly if you're not smoking it or inhaling it if you're eating it what happens is when you eat cannabis and THC is involved in cannabis it goes through your digestive tract ends up in your liver before the bloodstream now the liver is the magic here because it actually metabolizes THC into something called 11 hydroxy THC now what you need to remember is this product is four to five times more potent psychoactive Li than the THC you just consumed that's why eating an edible product can be so variable in the affect and why the effects can be so potent so in order to increase tolerance to THC and reduce the psycho activity that some would refer to as side effects you use suppositories now the reason why is when suppositories are placed into the right place in the lower end of the rectum just above the anal sphincter muscle you get absorption through the rectum into the bloodstream now the absorption there is very efficient I've seen figures that equated to upwards of 70 percent absorption potential in the rectum now when it gets through into the bloodstream it misses the liver that's important because guess what that THC compound doesn't go to your liver and get converted become much more psychoactive it goes through the body then it attaches to receptors in its original form Delta 9 THC and it retains its medical benefit but you don't have the extreme psychoactive potency that you get from the oral ingestion that's why suppositories work very well for many people and why I've personally seen senior citizens enter our dispensary afraid of THC they ate that brownie 20 years ago they had a bad time and they don't ever want to experience that again well let's say they have insomnia and THC is going to help them this can be a method that gets around the psycho activity of oral dosing", "iWF9MmiQUA4": "in this study we treated children with dravet syndrome which is a very serious genetic form of epilepsy that unfortunately has a very high seizure burden and a very high mortality from epilepsy that these children who had not responded to often five or ten other treatments were given cannabidiol or a placebo in addition to their existing medications cannabidiol is the major non psychoactive ingredient in cannabis also known as marijuana so cannabidiol does not produce any high or psychoactive properties and therefore has less potential side effects especially for use in children than a psychoactive compounds such as THC we were in the double-blind placebo-controlled phase of the study and we did that for 14 weeks and we were like totally convinced that she was in a placebo because her seizures didn't change at all and then we were able to roll into the open label extension and the second day that we're in open label and we knew that she was getting the actual drug she went seizure free like completely seizure free for two months which has never happened the main findings of the study were that there was a very statistically significant reduction in the convulsive seizure frequency in patients who are randomized to cannabidiol when compared to patients who are randomized to placebo so the message is that cannabidiol does work in reducing convulsive seizures in children with dravet syndrome my hope for the future is that this study will lead to more similar studies to assess cannabidiol and perhaps products containing both cannabidiol and THC in various forms of epilepsy you",

oil is a form of cannabinoid extraction which is become increasingly popular in the last few years was legit - its effectiveness as a medicine one form of cannabis oil is Wrexham snow Wrexham snow is a full spectrum cannabis extract which is dark in color and grease slick in texture like some snow is named after its creator reg Sampson who manufactured oil in 2003 to successfully treat his skin cancer as well as containing other cannabinoids such as CBD flextime snow also contains high levels of THC and as a result provides an intoxicating effect when consumed black Sam snow is most often consumed by taking race sized pieces of the oil orderly with the doses depending on the severity of the condition however black Sam snow can also apply topically by robbing oil directly onto the affected area of skin evidence is shown vaccines know to be effective in a variety of medical conditions including asthma fibromyalgia inflammation anxiety migraines arthritis Parkinson's and numerous cancers to name a few one of the great things about back some snails that can be made readily at home with the necessary equipment and ingredients have been relatively easy to acquire to make your exams now you will need at least one ounce of giant cannabis flower two liters of 99% isopropyl solvent or you can also use butane ethanol or other solvents a large bowl a wooden spoon a bucket for wax new material cheesecloth a rice cooker and a plastic catheter syringe or tank it's a dropper for collecting the material to make like some snow first place the dried carnage material into the bucket and pour the solvent and until the material is completely covered after that start and makes the solvent and cannabis material together for two or three minutes in order to wash off the cannabinoid faux trichomes on the surface there's an usher wash will remove around 75% of the trichomes then drain the solvent into the pool using the cheesecloth placed over the bowl as a filter after that you then place the carnage material back into the bucket and either solvent for a second wash any residual trichomes which still remain again place the cheesecloth over the ball and drain the solvent into the ball however you discard the kind of material after this team then place this over into the rice cooker and cook until all the solvent is completely evaporated this must be conducted in a well-ventilated area away from flames cigarettes are other potential forms of ignition and to reduce the risk of injury once this oven has been removed collect oil with syringe or pour into a temperature bottle for later consumption the main side effect from consuming likes temps now assuming it's made correctly is dated sleepiness or dry mouth however this is nothing compared to

"DCk4Dy_Joc8": "hi I'm Dr. Dani Gordon and welcome to\nDr. Dani TV and this is the cannabis wellness show where I talk about all\nthings CBD and cannabis medicine. I'm a medical doctor and I specialized in\nevidence-based natural medicine brain wellness and cannabis medicine and Ive\ntreated thousands of patients with CBD and cannabis medicines and this is where\nI share everything I've learned on this topic in this video I'm going to talk\nabout cannabis and depression so cannabis and depression is a really hot\ntopic it's a controversial topic for many people and before I started adding\ncannabis medicines to my own practice I have a lot of misconceptions myself\nabout cannabis and depression over a decade ago when I was in medical school\nwe didn't really learn anything about the endocannabinoids system about\ncannabis in general but the things I did learn were really negative I was told\nyou know people who smoke cannabis will be a bigger risk of depression it will\nmake their depression and mood disorders worse universally it didn't really\nmatter what was in the cannabis whether it was really high CBD low THC there was\nno even distinction in what we were talking about so there was a lot of fear\nin the medical community around cannabis of all forms even CBD around mood\ndisorders and depression in particular what I found when I started using\ncannabis medicines in my practice was that I was getting a lot of referrals\nwith patients who suffer with depression and as most people who have suffered\nwith depression will know or know someone who has suffered with depression\nit's not that depression is just in isolation and everything in there about\nfrom there life is amazing usually my patients who are suffering with\ndepression also have an element of anxiety with their depression they\nsometimes have sleep dysfunction they oftentimes have chronic pain they have\nother things that are going on so oftentimes depression is part of this\nbigger picture and sometimes depression is the final common endpoint for things\nthat have gone wrong in the brain in the body and it really the brain is in this\nwithdraw and protect mode not going out into the world and kind of you know\napproach behavior mode which we all kind of want to be in to really thrive and I\ndo a lot of brain stuff as well and when we look at eg studies of the brain when\nwe actually look at the electrical things that are going on in the brain\nwith depression we have an underactive left frontal lobe with depression so\nbasically in depression want to wake the brain back up and help\npeople interact with the world in a better way so this is where cannabis\nmedicines can come in handy - my initial surprise so initially when someone comes\nto me and depression is a main feature of why they're coming to see me they've\nusually already tried a gazillion different things for their depression\nthey've usually already tried things like therapy and CB CBT cognitive\nbehavioral therapy they've tried exercise a lot of times they've tried\nlots of drugs a lot of times they tried other herbal medicines and none of them\nreally worked that well so these are the times of patients who come to see me for\ncannabis medicine and usually what I do to start them off someone with\ndepression is I start out with a CBD oil as a base of their therapy and I started\nout with taking the CBD oil in the morning in the mid afternoon or around\nlunchtime with food always and then really around like 5:00 p.m. in the\nevening and if that you know I usually do that for four weeks or so see how\npeople respond and if they have sleep dysfunction which can be a major driver\nof depression because sleep dysfunction the next day makes the brain more\nirritable then sometimes I add in a little bit of THC before they go to bed\nto help with their sleep and very very very small those along with more CBD and\nthen if they're still having trouble with motivation and getting going in the\nmorning that's when I find that actually a little bit of vaporized cannabis which\ncontains some THC as well as some CBD can be very very helpful and it has to\nbe the right strain so with a lot of my patients who suffer with depression and\nanxious depression or anxiety and especially my patients who have chronic\npain on top of this it can take them three hours to get their day going in\nthe morning so that really leaves them quite crippled as far as not being able\nto work not being able to just do housework or to see their friends or to\nsee family members or take care of their children and the way that they want to\nand what we see with when I add cannabis in a vaporize form is it can help wake\nthe nervous system up if it's the right strain and help them get going so\ninstead of taking 3 hours to get their day going they can take them 20 minutes\nlike most of us without depression just kind of wake up and you know get going\nso usually what I you there is I would start with a strain\nthat's high in things like D limonene these citrusy uplifting terpenes and a\nmore sativa dominant strain again the genetics get tricky here because\neverything's kind of a hybrid now but to keep things simple really what you can\nthink about it as is using a sativa dominant delimiting rich strain of\ncannabis in a vaporizer and usually I like to combine it with a strain that's\nhigh in CBD so they're not getting that straight-up\nTHC in general with patients with depression I try to avoid THC only I\nreally really think that adding CBD is very important to keeping the mood\nstable and the reason that I do it this way is because there's been lots of\nstudies with the CBD in particular as an antipsychotic agent as a mood balancing\nagent and people who have mood balance issues so people with bipolar disorder\nfor example people with schizophrenia and psychosis so that's different than\ndepression but I still find in my patients that when we use more CBD a lot\nof CBD and then add a little bit of THC in if they need it is the best way to go\nwith depression another really interesting thing I found working with\nmy patients with depression using cannabis medicines is that often times\npart of the the reason that they're having trouble is because they really\nwant to engage with the world they want to do things like cognitive behavioral\ntherapy they want to do things like exercise socially engaging their friends\nand their family because we know all those things help with depression but\nthey have really low brain motivation because their left frontal lobe is under\nactive and they just can't engage so basically we can use cannabis medicines\nas a catalyst it kind of like is it is a catalyst to get everything going so what\nI do sometimes with patients is I get them to vaporize a little bit of\ncannabis before they want to go work out or before they want to go for a run and\nsometimes even before they want to go out socially and engage with the world\nand that can be really helpful to get them going and the really cool part is\nthat once they get going and they start doing all the other behaviors that are\nanti-depressive naturally like exercise getting social doing CBT doing therapy\nif that's part of their treatment plan they just get better and better and\nbetter and it's a snowball effect and then they need West cannabis\nto help them because as other things start to kind of take hold in the brain\nso if you liked this video please like it share

[ Woman speaking indistinctly,\nchild crying ] Woman: Hey. [ Crying continues ] Paul:\nAnd for the next six months,\nI was carried to the toilet. I had about 10% of my left body,\nat that point. I've had a headache\nfor 11 years.\nWow. Can you imagine having\na headache for 4,100 days? -Straight?\n-Straight -- absolutely. I never get a break. Imagine big, rolling\nboulders or marbles crashing\noff each other. It's like a tightening\nof a skull cap on my head. Did doctors sort of\nprescribe you anything to sort of help?\nOh, sure. Yeah, I-I've been on\npretty much all the medications that they're allowed\nto give me. I was on 14 pills a day\nat one point. So, on these pills, physically,\nit closed me down, and a couple of them depress you\nenough to kill you. This last Christmas,\nI decided no -- no more. And, uh, that's when\nI started, uh, smoking, because it dulled\nthe pain. \u266a\u266a It allows me to do the things\nthat I must do. It gives me potential. The pain's still there,\nbut it's in a bubble. But it's like\nthere's an extra layer between me and my pain. My kids\ndon't see me smoke. I only smoke\nin my room. I don't smoke anywhere else\nin the house. I'm a single dad.\nMy kids come first. Hello, you. -What'd you doin'?\n-Hi. There's word\nfor your brother you'll learn\nwhen you're older -- seven girlfriends,\nI mean... He's a player! Okay, that's one way\nof putting it. Yeah, sure. All right,\nhere's the view -- pizza. Can you bang it on?\nYou can do that, can't you, huh?\nMm-hmm. All right, homework --\nWhat about French?\nI got my history. What was your history like? 64%. 64%. -Yeah.\n-Well done, you. -Pizza's ready!\n-Okay. Thank you, sir. Please.\nYou're very welcome. Oh, thank you very much. Meat Feast or pepperoni? I think it's Meat Feast,\none of your favorites. -Meat Feast.\n-Looks like it's Meat Feast. Do you guys sort of,\nlike, realize that, like, the marijuana\nthat your dad's smoking is still, like,\ntechnically illegal? Yeah, we do. How does that make you feel?\nLike, what... Uh... Kind of scared that\nhe's gonna get caught. Paul: If I thought there\nwould be a situation where our life\nwould be threatened, I wouldn't smoke.\nMm-hmm. That's just\nblack and white. They're more important to me\nthan, uh -- than anything. [ Speaks indistinctly ] Ooh.\nHey, you okay? Yes, yes. Is it sort of scary\nto think that he has to do something that's illegal to,\nlike, feel better? If it's helping him,\nI allow it. But if he's doing it\nfor no reason, really, I would feel\nkind of upset. Right. But it doesn't seem like\nhe's doing it for no reason. It seems like\nit helps him a lot, right?\nMm-hmm. Well, she hates smoking --\nI think that's the main thing. And she's got a pretty good\nsense of values. And to her, whatever\nshe sees in the world, says pot's bad. And she thinks\nin black and white. And now we give her\nthis conundrum that daddy needs it. It kind of throws a bit\nof a wobbly at her, you know? Mm-hmm. So she's trying very hard\nto reconcile that. We had a bit of a cry together\nand a cuddle upstairs, and, uh, she'll be okay. I mean, it's hard, right?\nAnd it's -- It's lousy. I have to live a lie,\nand no parent, especially when you've got\nabsolute love for your kids, wants to do that. \u266a\u266a I've come\nto Limehouse Marina in London to see John on the final leg\nof his journey. Today he's gonna take\nhis tiny, little canal boat into the mighty River Thames\nto let his cannabis banner fly and to drum up support\nfor marijuana reform right in front of Parliament. What we've got here are\nsome CBD-rich cannabis seeds. They're very low in THCs. I'm gonna pop them\nin the balloon. Okay. [ Helium hissing ] We are gonna tie some notes\nto them from patients -- medicinal-cannabis patients\nacross the UK, and we're gonna send those\nup into the sky and hope they reach\ncommunities across Albion. Amazing. [ Hissing continues ] So, what do you reckon the day's\ngonna be like for you? Uh, I am...\nI mean,\nyou're taking a small boat into big old body of water. It's gonna be a big old\nbody of water out there, be nice and choppy. How is it different from the small canals\nthat you go in? Uh, it's tidal,\nso it's pretty dangerous. Do you think the boat's\ngonna handle it? The boat is gonna handle it,\nmy friend. We do not like pessimism...\nOkay. Right on. ...anywhere near my boat.\n[ Laughs ] \u266a\u266a [ Boat motor humming ] All right, John!\nSee you, man! Goodbye, Krishna.\nGood luck. Namaste. Whoo-whoo!\nWhoo-whoo! [ Laughs ] That's the little barge\nthat could. \u266a\u266a [ Crowd cheering ] It's to legalize\ncannabis in London. [ Cheering continues ] -Hey, how's it going?\n-Nice to meet you, man. Good to meet you.\nHey, man. I'm Krishna. You guys excited? \u266a\u266a [ Siren wailing ] Hey, Paul. -Krishna, how are you?\n-How's it going, man? Aw, it's good to see you. -What a great event.\n-I know. How are you feeling --\nYou excited? I'm very enthused\nand excited about it. It's not just talk. These are real people\ncoming out and demonstrating\nthe reality they believe in. And that's got to make a\ndifference, Krishna, in the end. And what's it like being sort of\nbeing amongst this group of, like,\nother like-minded people? -Brothers. Family.\n-You think so? -Yeah.\n-Amazing. They're just be so open\nand honest about it. I asked them, did they feel\nat all self-conscious? Hell no.\n[ Laughs ] You know, this is what\nthey believe and what they do. Yeah, people are just, like,\nsmoking weed next to the Thames, next to Parliament. The English are\nvery law-abiding. But I think now that we're starting to see\na movement that's gonna\ngive us a change. And this is the mother\nof Parliaments. If it can't start here... -This is where it starts.\n-This is where it starts. \u266a\u266a Andavolu:\nAll right, it looks like he's just about to go\nunder Westminster Bridge, and he's just gonna pop out right in front of the Houses\nof Parliament and Big Ben. I saw him for just this little\nbit right on the other side, and he looked really tiny. Like, the boat was small. And -- Oh, look! You can\njust see him right there. He's coming in. \u266a\u266a [ Cheers and applause ] He's releasing the balloons. [ Laughs ] Amazing. Man: Go on, John!\nKeep going! Get those seeds!\nYou tell Cameron! [ Cheering continues ] Hey, John!\nHey, John! He gave the wave!\n[ Laughs ] He waved at us. And he looks so small\ncompared to that building. \u266a\u266a [ Cheers and applause ] \u266a\u266a As an American,\ncoming to the UK and seeing how medical-marijuana\npatients are faring -- In one way, it's a little\ndispiriting to see that they have to improvise and sort of do\nthis underground stuff to get what they think is\nmedicine that's gonna help them. But another way -- I'm seeing\nsomething sort of special. The people I met here\nare kind of filling in the gaps. Guys like John,\nlike Paul, like Hidrow, who are making real sacrifices\nin order to help people -- Robin Hoods of sorts -- they're forming these kind of\nad hoc underground communities, taking weed\nfrom the black market, making it into oil\nand medicine, and then giving it\nto the needy. That's kind of\na beautiful thing. That sort of, like,\nmodel of compassion is something I think\nthat the world can learn from. What I've seen in the U.S. is that legal weed\ncan equal money. But here in the UK, it seems like illegal weed\nequals compassion. And what's cool\nis that compassion is free. \u266a\u266a", "vU59yesq0jw": "okay so we had some technical difficulties with the last couple of videos or glass videos and we don't know what the videos went they just went poof buh-bye so I have some notes up here on the on the wall we did start our so on the 24th of September and holy [ __ ] where did my [ __ ] might go yeah I was out for a good 12 hours first time I just slept that good in that in a very very very long time I did the second dose about 7:00 p.m. on the 25th woke up one time to go the bathroom but I'll tell you what the growing effects lasted all day today so do keep that in mind when you're doing these treatments and say you're going to be groggy and tired for the first couple of days before you really get used to what your body is is it's getting used to I mean it's you you're putting some pretty serious stuff in your system and Wow yeah you get behind you pretty it [ __ ] you up I'm taking so this I just got out of the freezer it's the easiest way to gather it up Madhu's I'm gonna stick money my scraper in here sometimes you can do it out there sometimes you can pull the silicone out of the plastic and that's easier sometimes you just pull it out okay so for those of you that have never seen what a gram of RSO looks like this is one gram of RS oh now this is guerrilla bomb RS oh it is a an indica hybrid it's a 28 percent THC its parents were Gorilla Glue I can speak number four and THC bomb which is an indica hybrid as well bottoms up and then it's been hard as well so then that's really all you do is you swallow it down and you're good go I'll believe that numb up my mouth that I've been having a problem with my 2/3 [Applause] so now I'm going to set up tomorrow's dose so you it's just a little easier to give your spoon heat [Music] so this is my one gram for tomorrow so all I'm gonna do is take this knock over my bomb right and you wake up pick this back in here now I'm gonna put this back in the refrigerator for tomorrow it's that simple you can also take it and put it in like your tea your hot tea at night and drink it or during the day but I", "A8NePHcifxs": "what's up everybody its dr.

Roman from Nature's Way medicine take care", "EeCyvVgqSjc": "you welcome back YouTube so today I want to give you a little demonstration on how to basically make your own personal use capsules my biggest issue when I make a big batch of oil is like sometimes I really don't want edibles I don't want cookies I don't want any of it sometimes I just want to you know consume I will hey is it that hard it's really not so what I usually do is I get this little capsule machine you go to GNC or Vitamin World or any any health food store they sell these capsules and they also sell this press right here so the capsules cost like a dollar you got like 200 oh and this cost about $10 money well spent let me tell you so all you're gonna do is you take your capsules okay your tops you put your bottoms in this really can't get any easier and the best part about this is these friggin things work you you can make your oil as strong as you want and then you can really really hone in on how strong is my caps and you you can really master this so you get it all filled out and it'll come back in a set but say if you don't have one of these fancy presses which isn't that fancy or expensive but you just you know you're not gonna spend the money it's just you don't you don't see the point so you could what you could do is get a bowl of sugar and say you take your tops put your tops to the side and then you just stick the bottoms into the sugar or the salt and it works pretty perfectly you'll lose say if you do about a hundred you're probably gonna lose a good 15 in falling and just not just whatever but that's not that bad and on the other half you're gonna put your tops so what's gonna happen is we're gonna put or oil and then we're gonna spread it around it's gonna fill up the caps perfectly and then we're gonna put this top on and then squeeze and then when you squeeze they all perfectly become capsules it's amazing and the best part is you give it to one of your friends or or a different medical patient they're gonna look at you like you're just how did you do that so before you go any further you really want to make sure that each one has a capsule in it because if you miss I'm just gonna have oil everywhere and you get a waste of money and you're gonna be pissed so next you take your card so I'm gonna take it I'm gonna pour it in a center round a little square and it'll disperse around and the best part about this thing is if you do too much oil you just pour it right back into your glass so you just spread it around so a little excess oil that I got all right so now I'm gonna take my tops and I'm gonna sit it on top and this is where you really got to be focused when I say really got you focused I mean not really but just squeezed evenly is really what I'm trying to tell you so you're gonna take it and give it a nice squeeze make sure it's all in then boom got canvas castles oh now you can go to work boom boom boom you know no big deal and now ain't no big deal but they work they look great and this is exactly what we're going we're not going for half-assed you know edibles that kind of work like we want stuff that's gonna work so give me a little close-up well thanks guys for watching like how easy was that get yourself out there instead of making cookies or being boring with your oil do something different make some capsules and and you're gonna find that you love these things because I know I did but if you liked what you saw today don't forget to check me out on Instagram at the NJ chef and as always smoke [Music]",

were desperately seeking some answers well now Darcy Spirit shows us how they are seeing the lights all thanks to cannabis cream for Carter gray that is the sound of relief I just got an oil up ahead a massage from mom that means so much more we first met Carter a year ago he suffers from lamellar ichthyosis a rare skin disorder with no cure that causes dark scales where dead skin cells don't flake off despite corrective surgery Carter's skin is so tight he can't even shut his eyes he's forced to spend most of his time inside but his family is hoping this it's a miracle plan that's what it is just might change that it showed us from the first time that we used it thought it was worth continuing to use when we first brought you Carter's story his parents were dealing with industrial sized vats of coconut oil and making some progress but nothing like what's contained in these small jars creams made from cannabis oil an extract of marijuana how would you describe your reaction when you realized you'd found something that worked I cried oh haha a lot I still cry I still I'll be in the bathtub just scrubbing his back and the scales just fall right off into the bathtub Carter's grandma makes the creams in her kitchen giving her grandson a gift no doctor could completely clear like soft as a newborn take a look at these before and after photos of Carter's back and head no

"INVzvJHc2PA": "hello everybody and welcome back to the channel in today's video we are going to be making cbd oil with a crock pot but before we get into today's video folks if you wouldn't mind if you're new here to the channel please consider subscribing and for those of you that have already subscribed thank you so much i really do appreciate all the support and if you all wouldn't mind please give this video a big thumbs up okay folks so you may or may not know but our farm is solely dependent on our sale of hemp flour and that's what we're going to be using today our hemp flour now if you guys are interested in cbd hemp flour to make your own cbd oil go ahead and check out the link in the description below also go ahead and check out this link up top okay so first and foremost we're going to need cbd flour to make cbd oil you will find an array of options on our website if you're purchasing from us you'll see large flour or regular flour you'll see small flowers you'll see trim and some other odds and ends on there as well but today we're going to be using regular sized hemp flour the variety that we're going to be using is biox which is our most popular flower which is my personal favorite but there's also cherry wine on there i'll sweeten it a bunch of others that are all great as well it really depends on what you're looking for um but today we're going to be using biox and that's probably our most potent flower as well and that really depends on your potency level also and the same thing goes with trim versus small flowers there's a whole bunch of different potencies if you guys have questions go ahead and email me i'll be absolutely happy to answer any and all questions that you guys have about the hemp flour okay so we're going to need some stuff to make cbd oil with a crock pot unlike using an expensive machine like the magical butter machine you're going to need some other kitchen gadgets in order to make cbd oil correctly at home with a crock pot and so first and foremost we need a carrier oil now this is obviously you use this for a magical butter machine or any other machine we're going to use mct oil today other popular carrier oils are hemp oil and olive oil i really don't like olive oil that's just my personal preference i do love mctl it's the best carrier oil of all of them but if you're looking for a little added flavor hemp oil if you can find it is really good as well but today we're going to be using mct oil and the reason why coconut oil and other oils aren't in this is well coconut oil will be solid at room temperature so that's not good for cbd oil and other ones don't have the necessary fats to be a superior carrier oil and you really need that absorption rate to be high especially for a crock pot okay obviously next you will need a crock pot um these are relatively inexpensive you can get them for like 15 online you don't need a large one uh your batches are going to be anywhere between one to two cups of oil and one to two ounces of flour so really you don't need a large crock pot a three to six quart crock pot is plenty um another thing you will need is something to decarb with now we're going to use our magical butter d card box i love it there's no point in using a pyrex dish if i have this but you can use a pyrex dish with a cover that works as well and this will be one of the first steps we do here as we make our cbd oil the next thing you definitely need is going to be a filter of some sort some people use a cheese cloth um i don't i've never used that i've always used the magical butter filters you can get this pack on their website or you can get any type of micron filter i believe it has to be 150 or more um that's just what we use uh you can go more or less probably depending on the amount of plant material that's going to go through or how many times you actually want to sift through it this package also comes with a silicone glove i really like using that too especially when we're squeezing out the oil but that's going to be later on in the video now this part isn't necessary um to use i'm going to show you how to get around this but a lot of people will use this to cut up or grind up their flower a nutribullet or a magic bullet of anything like this to cut up the flower pre-decarb but i'm going to teach you a trick today on how you can avoid that it takes a little time but there's a trick now if you buy your hem flower from us it's going to come in a package exactly like this this is a pre-packaged um one ounce pre-packaged from us and what we'll do is we're gonna throw this in the freezer for four to six hours and what that does is it makes the hemp fiber very brittle and once it's brittle you can scrunch it all up in the bag and boom you don't have to use a grinder to cut up a flower we've already done that process and here we go here is our scrunched up flower and a ziploc now you don't have to use the bag if you if you're not purchasing from us use a ziploc same exact method in there for four to six hours scrunch it up and we're good to go so we've already done this step i'm not going to time lapse it or anything like that you will need to cut it up one way or another whether it's the bullet or it's through uh freezing it so let's dive into making cb duo with your crock pot here at home and get into the next step okay folks let's get into making cbd oil with our crock pot here we have already measured out a cup of mct oil so we're going to get that in the crock pot now to get it warmed up this process doesn't take very long but this is going to be the first thing you're going to want to do is measure out your oil and get it into the crock pot we're going to put it on low and we're just going to let it sit all right we're going to move this off to the side here for a minute next thing we're going to do is we are going to use our magic butter d card box again you can use a pyrex dish as long as it has a cover or any other baking dish as long as it has a cover now what you're going to be doing is you're going to be de-carving so get your oven preheated to 250 degrees 250 all right so we're going to preheat our oven right now again 250 uh preheat and then once we put this stuff in there it's going to be going in for 30 minutes now again you're either going to this step you're going to be blending your hemp flour which i just don't like making a mess so that's really just not what i want to do but this is an option you can do that get that you take your um your shredded up flour whether you use the magic bullet or you use the freezer method like we did and you're just going to pour it in to your d carb box whether that's the pyrex or this particular box you're gonna make sure that it's nice and even you're gonna cover it and we're gonna throw it into the oven for about a half an hour once it's preheated to 250 degrees so that's what we're going to flash forward to next and then we'll start getting into making the cbd oil okay folks so let me move this out of the way here real quick all right so we have done we are done with the d-carb process again 250 degrees for 30 minutes and there is your nice fresh ground uh cbd hem flower so now we're ready to go um but before we dive into putting it into crop i want to make sure that this isn't the end-all be-all recipe so we used one cup of mct oil for one ounce of hemp flour you can use two cups you can use less flour you can use more flour it really depends on what you want but i'm going to stand by one cup per one ounce if you want to go less you know you can use 14 grams of flour per cup i really don't recommend anything less than that because i don't think you'll get a good experience with cbd i just don't think the potency will be there for you the other thing about the crock pot too it's not nearly as efficient as the magic butter machine so this is going to be a process it is going to be in the crock pot for four to eight hours really depends on when you're ready the longer it has to be in there to cook into the oil the more chance of a higher absorption rate so just remember that as well and again guys you can find all this stuff on our website or feel free to leave a comment or email me and you can find us on facebook and instagram as well if you need to get in touch with me through there okay so let's go ahead and get this going into the crock pot now remember we put this on low already the oil is already nice and warm we have our ounce of ground flour here and we're going to go ahead and dump it right into the crock pot okay so now that that's done we're just gonna move around the flower and we're going to let it cook down [Music] and that's really all we're doing now we're going to let this cook down absorb all into the oil we're gonna cover it again you can use more oil or or i wouldn't use anything less than a cup of oil but you can use more oil like two cups we're just doing a very small batch for the video but as you can see it's already starting to go right into the oil so now we're going to check it about every hour on low so we'll see in another hour and then we're going to repeat that for probably six hours for this particular batch so that is how we get started making our cbd hemp oil in a crock pot okay folks we have let this go for about eight hours i lost kind of track of time and we've been stirring about every hour and this is what it looks like right now very liquidy you know all broken down and that's what you want to look like again you got to go for the longer cook with the crock pot i know with the magic butter machine it's four hours but you're really safe with an eight hour on low cook um of course the setting is low for the crock pot so now what we're going to do is we're going to get our strainer again this is something you're going to have to purchase in order to make cbd oil and then we're going to get some gloves and we're going to slowly pour this into the strainer all right so here we go again it's a balancing act with the strainer just got to take your time get this out of the way here you're just going to let it all go into the strainer there kind of write it up a little bit now again we only did a cup of oil very small batch and what you can do now is get all the plant material in there much as you want because what you're going to do now is once it's in the strainer you can squeeze every last bit of oil out of the flour because the flour does absorb some of the oil okay now one of the things that you get with the magical butter kit uh when it comes to buying these strainers is they give you the silicone glove it's pretty important because it helps you squeeze out all the [Applause] oil all right that's about all you can have with that and then you can put it in your container whatever you desire whether it's a droplet bottle a mason jar but this is the finished product this is your cbd oil and you made it with a crock pot so that's really it for today's video guys if you have any questions feel free to comment in the video uh or you can reach us um via facebook or instagram or email if you guys are interested in the hemp flower that we use today go ahead and check out our website link in the description below but that is all i have for you guys

of people taking a capsule is a really familiar way to take medication so especially for people who are new to cannabis and might hold lots of stigma against it sometimes taking it in a capsule can feel really reassuring to them they're very easy to take just like regular capsules you just swallow them and they're easy to increase or decrease the dose so you can start out with one capsule and then see how you feel and then increase from there they're super easy to store you just keep them in a cool dry place maybe in the fridge if you'd like they're very discreet you can keep them in your purse or your pocket and medicate as you need and making them yourself saves you so much money over store-bought traditionally canna caps have been filled with cannabis infused oil so that's oil that's been infused with cannabis and then they strain the cannabis out they take the oil and they fill up the capsules with it but you don't have to go through that step if you don't want to so if you prefer you can simply D carve your cannabis in the oven grind it up slightly and then use the capsule filling machine like I'm going to show you in a couple of seconds and the scraper that comes with it to just scrape the cannabis flour into your capsules you want to bang the tray deee on every once in a while to make sure that you're getting about the same amount in each capsule but it really saves you a lot of work of doing the infusion if you do decide to do that just use ground D carb Canada make sure you take a little bit of fat with your kiddos capsules when you take them cannabis binds really well too fat so having some avocado or some cream or some butter on your toast is a good way to ensure that you're getting some of the fat that you need to help the cannabinoids bind well so for this project you're going to need cannabis infused oil and I have links to recipes and videos to make that down below or ground D carb cannabis so either one of those to start and then you do not need a capsule maker but it really does make the job a lot easier and a lot faster than hand filling capsules you need the empty capsules try to find it capsules that come with the tops and bottoms apart so you don't have to go through that step but it's really hard to find those so good luck you'll need tweezers for flipping the capsules when you're using the capsule machine a syringe or two or three because sometimes they get clogged up and a dish of hot water or a double boiler if you're using the coconut oil infusion method I get a lot of my capsule making supplies from Amazon but you can also get these at some pharmacies and you can get the capsules themselves at lots of health food stores so check that out as well I just want to give you a picture of what to look for this is the basic capsule filling machine yours might look slightly different but so long as it has these basic parts then you'll be good most of these capsule fillers only take zero and zero zero size capsules and I actually have a whole recipe quote unquote down below for you so that you have links to all of this as well here's a look at what your capsules will likely look like again if you can find them atop some bottom separated that's the best or even different colors is really helpful but this is what I can usually get my hands on make sure that you do check the capsule size there are different sizes and again you can read about that on the recipe down below these are the types of syringes that I buy you can buy literally a whole bunch of different kinds on Amazon I try to get them so that they are at least five milliliters so that you're not refilling your syringe often and some of them do come with the long metal tip I don't find it necessary but some people prefer it so here we go I'm going to show you how to do this the first thing that you need to do is separate your so bottoms from your capsule tops some of the packages come already separated and that's fantastic if not it's a little bit of an arduous job to do next you put this device I do not know what all the names for this stuff is it looks like it should be weight easier than it is and it takes some practice to learn how to use it and sometimes I wonder if it would just be faster for me to fill them by hand and then I go try and sell them by hand and I realize no not sure just taking out all the extras so I've got some here that are actually like upside down and some of the holes aren't filled so I'm going to go through and fix that way that I do it is by pushing down on the springs and just flipping these legs around that need flipped around sometimes I have to go and grab tweezers because just the way that it's set up but you do really want to make sure that you don't leave any of these unfilled especially with these clear caps it's hard to tell so make sure you do a super good like luff scan through because otherwise if you get cannabis oil all over this machine I know it's on machine but all over this capsule filler and it's hard to clean so yeah do your best to make sure that you learn from my many mistakes of capsule filling next we take this piece and put the filler on it again and we do the same thing that we did with the top after you're finished with the tops you can just set this aside for a couple of minutes because you're going to be filling up your cannabis capsules what I have here is cannabis infused into coconut oil and I'll link to a video on how to do that so that you can have that all ready to go and I have it sitting in a dish of really hot boiling water I do that on purpose because I want the coconut oil to be really warm otherwise it starts to solidify too quickly when I'm filling up the capsules and it clogs up your syringe and it makes it a real mess so try to keep this as warm as you can you'll get into a rhythm and you'll spill a whole bunch over the edge a whole bunch of times as well but you'll be able to fill these up relatively quickly and then we'll put the caps on them altogether that took me about seven minutes to fill those capsules up so it wasn't as bad as I thought so my capsules are filled with oil I'm going to put this orange thing on top of the capsule lid and then you flip it upside down smashing clothes they kind of clip closed then you have a bunch of Hana capsules now what I like to do with these right here is put them in the freezer for about ten or fifteen minutes and then you can store these in the fridge or the freezer for quite a long time it's just coconut oil and cannabis and then you have a really convenient way to dose full disclosure time before we get into dosing those kin of caps that I put in the freezer they're still in the freezer it's been about two weeks and you still haven't pulled them out because it's been busy but when you're done with your Kanak apps you can just pull them out of the freezer pop them out of the mold and store them in glass mason jar in the cupboard or in the fridge let's talk about how to dose them so I have on my website and I'll link to it down below a dosing calculator that makes this easy to figure out Emily how many milligrams of THC or CBD might be in each of your capsules again I really want to stress that this is an approximate range unless you're using lab tested cannabis and all of your procedures are really on point however even if you have lab tested cannabis and everything is perfect with your dosing with each new batch that you make you should always start low and go slow and see if everything is the same on the new batch do you have questions about this I love to answer your questions so please leave them down below and again head over to reveal cannabis calm to get your free stuff and to check out all my other offerings", "pW66iiVNJtY": "hey guys it's Nick with precision here and today I wanted to talk to you guys about the fundamentals between co2 and solvent based extraction what we want to talk about is the fundamentals of the solvent we're gonna start with co2 so co2 typically in the atmosphere as you guys probably well know is a gas right it's all surrounding us everywhere but in order to make it a solvent it needs to go into what's called subcritical or supercritical phase right and what happens with a supercritical phase is you're compressing and you're heating that gas in order to make it into a fluid form right so typically called supercritical fluid extraction or and if it's at the lower end of that range sub critical fluid extraction now this technology has been around for years right it's been used in coffee it's been used in vanilla types of artisanal extracts it's really really good for decaffeination they use it in dry cleaning right so the technology has been around and about 10 years ago when cannabis really started getting large and people started looking towards cannabis extracts they said hey why don't we try this supercritical co2 so the history of the solvent is that it's been used very widely and people look to repurposing it into the cannabis industry right which they started to do maybe you know eight nine years ago and it started to really get big about six or seven years ago right so all these supercritical co2 applications popped up for cannabis specifically and when you look at the fundamentals of the solvent right the the difference between co2 and a different solvent like hydro carbon or ethanol is co2 doesn't do a great job at actually extracting the cannabinoids right so you've got your your cannabinoid structure that's contained within your trichome right and your trichome is a a mushroom like shape on the outside of the leaf of the plant right and that's what contains all your goodies that you you know your turf beans your your CBD your THC your cbn your CBG all those things are contained within that mushroom trichome structure right so what we want to do with the solvent of any kind is dissolve that structure right and isolate those molecules now supercritical co2 can do this right but it's a very weak solid so if you think of a solvent and you think of a molecule like like a Lac on one side and a key on the other you want to find the perfect key that goes into the lock and you're kind of sliding it in there you're turning that turning that lock and that that that door is opening right away right now with supercritical co2 it's kind of similar to trying to jam a screwdriver into the lock right it's going to work right but it takes a lot of a lot of power a lot of pressure right which is why you see these systems that operate between 1,500 to 5000 psi and because of the nature of the solvent right the solvent has to be repeatedly passed over that trichome structure right so we're continuously passing this this solvent that doesn't have great solubility with cannabinoids and with that trichome structure of the plant over this plant in order to get our goodies out so to speak right so that's why co2 units have a long cycle time typically what you're gonna see is anywhere between on the very low end to hours which will diminish your yield and diminish your your returns on your actual processing and you're also going to see longer cycle times the more material that you put in there generally right so these can be manipulated in a number of different factors a lot of the co2 companies have drastically improved upon the old days you know the old days it was eight hours per run right they've improved that by running things like subcritical running things like a higher pressure sometimes up to 5,000 psi but it doesn't change the fundamentals of the solvent right the solvent is is is not the best key for our lock in order to get those cannabinoids and those those chemicals out of the plant that were that we're desiring right so that is a fundamental overview of why co2 technologies aren't as applicable now when you look at the equipment side of co2 right obviously it stands to common sense that if you got to have something that's going up to you know 1,500 2,000 5,000 psi right you can imagine at scale it's simply not economical or feasible in order to have those technologies at scale right because if you think about a gigantic vessel that needs to go to 5,000 psi right think about the amount of engineering that to go in there the shell thickness the the valve the safety precautions right obviously when you're working at those types of pressures there's a fundamental safety concern now if it's properly engineered equipment of course the machines operate safely there's not a thorough history of accidents or things like that but that it takes more dollars right which is why dollars two dollars when you're looking at co2 equipment the equipment is actually quite a bit more expensive than solvent based right so what really happens with with with all this total scenario right as you start weighing out all these variables between co2 and solvent based against the equipment against how how you're going to scale what's right for your business how you're going to apply these technologies to your end products right and that's a lot of what we do here at precision is we we look at our client's needs we understand what it takes for an end-to-end process to integrate and that's part of what differentiates our company is that you know we our end-to-end process integrators not just somebody that's gonna sell you a piece of equipment and walk away right so so what I'd like to do is really is compare that with you know the the fundamentals of solvent based extraction now right and when we talk about solvents we'll talk about the three most popular which would be butane propane and ethanol there's a lot of other solvents out there that work there's a lot of other solvents that that may come into play in the future but we're gonna focus around the primary three that are that are used today in the cannabis and hemp industry and we'll talk about how those apply more readily to large scale especially in CBD production and hemp production so on the other side of this coin I want to talk about solvent based extraction right I want to talk about how it compares with co2 specifically so let's go back to our lock and key analogy right our lock and key analogy is we want to find the the perfect key to go into the lock right and on this side is our molecule that we're trying to extract and on this side is our key our key is our solvent right and we've not found generally a better key in the history of extraction over the last decade or so then butane and propane right so butane and propane are nonpolar solvents with light boiling point right and what that's going to yield is it's going to it's going to go in there it's gonna bind to all of your cannabinoids or terpenes and the desirable aspects of the plant right so if you ever look at our teas '''l type of products most of them are made with butane and propane right you get that really beautiful light color that terpene rich smell right which is very very applicable to artisanal cannabis markets and it's also very very applicable to moderate scale right different types of manufacturing and making different products right now we start to make a little bit of a paradigm shift right because butane and propane as most of you probably well know are flammable solvents right so and they also contain a little bit of pressure which means it costs a little bit more money to engineer the equipment right the shell thicknesses on the equipment have to be a little bit thicker but not like co2 right at co2 we're talking about 5000 psi butane and propane we're talking about anywhere from 50 to 150 psi so much much lower pressure is much safer working environment over all right but we want to keep these vapors contained so they're not ignitable right and you want to stay in a class one division one room and take all these proper safety precautions now our company has done thousands of installations of hydrocarbon equipment across the entire world at this point and we can we can honestly say that I think we're experts in hydrocarbon extraction and we understand that hydrocarbon actually does pull the best terpene profile the best cannabinoid profile out of the cannabis plant however at large scale you can start to see where the actual hurdles come in so to speak right so now how do i process you know 2,000 pounds a day with hydrocarbon on a large scale it starts to get very costly and very engineering heavy let's call it right because you have to have all of these different vessels everything has to be under pressure everything has to be class 1 division 1 rated right so it's not really feasible for for large-scale CBD extraction or large-scale hemp extraction and what we like to usually say is is you know if you're an artisanal brand that means you're processing about a thousand pounds of input biomass per day or less right once you start crossing over that threshold the cost of engineering the equipment the cost of the redundancy and the batch equipment and and the cost of the hydrocarbon equipment becomes prohibitive right and it's why you see a large trend towards ethanol so let's talk about ethanol from a from a chemical standpoint for a minute right so going back to our lock and key method ethanol is also a very good key for our lock right but the problem with ethanol is because the polarity of the solvent it's an extremely polar solvent right so the extremely polar solvent yes it will bind to our cannabinoids and our terpenes the problem is is that it's also going to bind to chlorophylls and to other water-soluble or undesirable compounds within the plant now traditionally what everyone has done to combat both those water soluble molecules are those chlorophylls is they've chilled their ethanol down so those of you that are watching this video that are experienced you may very well know if you run your ethanol at negative 40 or below generally you're you're able to bypass a lot of the chlorophylls you're able to bypass a lot of the a lot of lipids and the phosphide profiles right things that are going to gum up your process downstream right but the problem is is that how do you chill now all this ethanol on a massive scale so we're in a different a different era now so to speak right how do we use ethanol a scale for CBD that we're doing 10,000 pounds a day well it comes down to properly engineered equipment right it comes down to proper mass balance it comes down to proper post processing procedures where you need an end to end in engineered solution which is what we've done with our KP D Series right so it's not just pouring ethanol over plant matter right there's refinement of the product there's variabilities in the biomass there's there's all sorts of things that are coming down the pipeline right that affect your yield they affect your your distillate quality they affect your crystallization right all these different variables that you need to have a thorough understanding of right so processing at scale it can be done you just need to have an understanding and a strong team that understands all these variables and how to combat but from a from a fundamental standpoint of scaled extraction ethanol is fantastic because you don't have the pressures there's absolutely zero vapor pressure which means none of your vessels are under pressure you're not operating under pressure it has significantly less flammability than then hydrocarbon and it's significantly safer than co2 and the fact that it's not pressurized right and people like ethanol because they know most of us go out to the bar every Friday and Saturday night and drink it right we ingest it it is a relatively safe solvent generally recognized as safe from the FDA so let's let's talk about an overview of the common misconceptions that come with solvent based extraction right people tell you all you extract with a solvent you extract with butane or propane you're gonna have residual butane and propane in your product that's absolutely not true so what happens is once the product is extracted there may be trace amounts of butane and propane but it goes through a heating and purging process right typically that's done either in vacuum drying ovens or in decarboxylation or in distillation right that's going to remove that solvent and there'll be zero parts per million of any sort of residual solvent right same thing with ethanol ethanol is a little bit harder to take off because it has a higher boiling point right it's not as volatile doesn't make Verizon's easy but the same thing right it's going to be pulled off and decarboxylation or in in distillation and it's ironic because a lot of the people that that preach anti solvent extraction right there in the CBD market and they realized once they get to crystallization that they're forced to use pentane H pentane is a group D hydrocarbon and you know needs to be purged needs to be dealt with in the class one division one room needs to have all these parameters so again understanding your process and and working with really I could say educated people not believing a lot of the marketing hype that's out there because everybody wants to sell you equipment but in the end of the day do they know how to integrate your process and and do they really understand the science of what's happening behind the process and have they done it before did they have a long operational history so these are things that I would definitely you know ask the people that here that you're potentially doing business with a lot of what we do here with our R&D team is that we test these processes we test new parameters we're working on ways to optimize the extraction process you know our company while we're an equipment manufacturer where a process integrator but we always focus as an innovative technology company right so we're always looking at disruptive disruptive technologies what's going to change in the future market trends what's going to happen to these markets how do we get the scale for lower cost and we look at all these variables and that all starts on the bench right which you guys can see the lab behind me we work with our team very closely and we're always working to find a more efficient more effective process right while still being able to integrate the existing processes and making them work really well right so I thank you guys for listening today you know you can shoot some comments below or shoot us an email give us a call if you have questions we're happy to help and we've got a large staff that can that can help you guys out and thanks for watching the video appreciate it [Music]", "BQgkVTCGKAg": "[Music] oh man got a full house alright sorry guys what's up sausage gravy biscuit glad grower forgot my ashtray got burned down with you guys make it some vape cards this morning testing them on yep being down at the dispensary cuz they ain't making them clean yet like uncle Harley so here's what I've been doing I made up my little necks I put my live rosin I decarboxylated it and my decarboxylate er see this now it's not rapid led it's ardent this is my D cardi carved the rosin and then I winterized it for a second that didn't really pull anything off so I just then I warmed it back up and cut it with this is what I cut it with little yellow bus honey liquidize oh come on these gaskets man they need oiled right off the get sometimes yeah these things are a pain and I'll ask so just use a little residual [ __ ] left over and oil the gaskets with it like that there's always a little stuck on the tip you gotta get one of these little blunt tip needles once you suck it up in your syringe this syringe was full they got a squirt in slow the D carbs the color it makes it dark I don't give a [ __ ] this cuz I know these pens don't get up to know 436 degrees my nicotine pen don't get up that high so I don't think you're really getting in those other pens I don't think you're really flashing that [ __ ] off it's not D carbon even says it's THC a you're not getting at all let's put it that way you're gonna get all of it miss it's gonna feel stronger even though the THC contents probably lower I'm guessing this morning 50 60 % maybe 70 I only cut it a third and use half well it's like a half half of what's there like I had 8 grams of live rosin and I used 4 milliliters of little yellow bus honey liquidizer there we go clean vape cartridge was all ready to hit that's shocking I didn't think they'd do that the librarians real thick and sticky you'd never even be able to get it in here right unless you like heated it up and then put it in scold him hot and then then did it but then it wouldn't burn it wouldn't even drain down anything so you have to like make liquidize it so that's an emulsifier it's flour terpenes right you can actually buy straight cannabis terpenes but they are unbelievably expensive you ain't gonna buy now 120 milliliters of it for you know 100 some dollars it's gonna be [ __ ] the one Scott has it's goddamn it [ __ ] gasket there you get like three drops for 20 bucks literally the actual cannabis terpenes that their wildly expensive I could see why you know your yields are just probably all the guy got off one freakin plan if you watch that in dokas channel at all Howie he always tries to show you how to make concentrates with a coffeepot and he they make excellent CBD products too by the way but they're I think they're in Europe sorry I gotta pay attention one doing I forgot what I'm saying that's how good that glue pen is I'm not a big favor either UK but you know anymore even though it's all legal and stuff here there's still a huge stigma so people love the stealth of the vape pen they're like man that could be at a family function I could literally walk outside for two seconds nobody knows I did [ __ ] and I could put up with their [ __ ] for another two hours yeah I'm almost out of juice I think that's about it I just might fill up this one I got here about last a little bit it's getting thick that's not good trick is go slow so yeah once you get your harvest alive rise and then after I harvested out the decarboxylate er I I warm it up in the microwave for 30 seconds inside this thing and then you then I measure out this little yellow bus honey liquidizer in the pen right and I like if first you got to make sure you you know your weight so my weight was like seven point nine right at eight so I use just under four milliliters of the little yellow bus honey liquidiser it come out almost perfect it was a little bit thick but I just didn't want to add any more so what's happening aap it's having to Jane joke grows that do a little work this morning getting these vape cards ready before I headed to the post office got packages going out today maybe these are gonna be better I don't know if you got any of these or not sausage these are definitely gonna be Wow way better it was taking me five polls to really feel it now I'm feeling that wanting to just like it's a yeah dee carbonate makes a huge difference wow that feels like it's twice as strong I love that glue it tastes just like gorilla glue to using this yeah I used to no flavor original orig sup j420 you came for 20 I know I said something to you already buddy and shout you out with a mess aap glad you still up in here I found your big bud see that I popped and then I hid my panty dropper with it so we collaborated on the string you didn't even know it what do you want to call the big panty dropper there's granny panties and then we got panty dropper we could have big-girl panties you know ladies they put your big-girl panties on here's what I done so far today these are all complete liquid gold so it looks like we don't make [ __ ] well once people taste my weed in there and they always oh man how much do some of that bud these are clean Jane no lead right because we don't use shitty coils no uh no vitamin E no coconut oil no butane harvested [ __ ] weed not washed with nothing no propane no MXZ 12 12 X or whatever it is MZ 12 X all we use is little yellow bus honey live liquidizer and live rosin I don't know if you guys have a pricey live rosin carts out but a real live rosin cart is not cheap a piece of email me the PayPal me the shipping I'll send you it to you something I say I send you something for your giveaway too I'll send you one of my earlier prototypes the one right before this fall harvest man I just put that grill glue into flour this morning nice she's gonna be nice so here's how we make our s oh I'll just do a quick tutorial and I'll do a whole other video when I actually make it so you got to get you one of these from Amazon you can get them anywhere between 40 and a hundred bucks and I'll tell you the price difference why I got what I got this is a counter top distiller okay see it plugs up the top part plugs into the back and then the back part plugs into the wall right it's got this digital temperature readout setting things this is a this is really handy I mean you can boil it off outside but it gets dangerous when you do that [ __ ] this is highly flammable liquid I mean you can light it on fire it's been this is what they the s alcohol is no joke this I have to pick up in Kentucky because they don't sell it high enough proof here see that that means it's 95% pure alcohol so what we do first is out pour two bottles into this right - fresh bottles pour it straight in and then I'll run it through and what that does is that flashes that most of that 5% or that yeah that 5% of water off because you don't want no water in your RSO is if you to get it evaporated off you got to get it to 212 degrees and we know that you lose your thtve at 2:15 so you don't want to do that and your THC delta-9 so then here's some alcohol that's come off the RSO already see it comes back I use this because that shit's not cheap that bottle is 50 bucks are you doing a gallon at a time you know you just flashed it otherwise if you don't have one of these you just flashed it off into the atmosphere and you're gonna get about 10 15 milliliters IRS oh maybe yeah so these are the setup fits together and then you're gonna make your distillate pour it in here set your temperature to 78 to 79 degrees centigrade okay that's where alcohol boils off I don't know what the Fahrenheit equivalent is because nobody uses that where they make these I guess so but they do list you know the alcohol flash off what these are made for is there wine distiller to turn wine into brandy right so or to clean your water up what's everybody saying my chest not scrolling anymore we got more than 14-inch at how's what tastes frosty the hybrid are the vape cartridge this one tastes just like real glue number four no [ __ ] I was like hell yeah to come from live rosin this shit's good it tastes like the live rosin it's real smooth this little tiny thing I'd give one of these kind of volt that's what I've been using or use you want to use our kind of vape cars head our airflow is the same as just about everybody else Platinum vape and all them you need a battery with let me see see how it's got these little notches for air flow if you don't have that you'll never get air I mean it's all it'll seal itself right up shut because the whole see it the airflow holes right there my joints off the power all right it's back to the IRS oh alright so this is what when I say we'll put it in the still this is the still and it's nice because it's safe it can sit around your counter time you don't have to worry about blowing up your house we have known some people here in Michigan their kids were making a shatter or whatever and they blew the burn their parents house aunt killed their parents we don't want that [ __ ] to happen here's the digital readout when you start out you hit set 79 degrees and then it'll fire up on its own but we don't want to do that because there's nothing in it and it catches all the alcohol this nice little thing I think mine was like a hundred bucks your you want the one where you can adjust the temperature so I'm come in there just set to distill water and they get too hot and you cook your RSO you're not getting that that stuff to the right consistency at the very end that's what separates the the good from the okay and it's a long process and the way I do it I do it the way I do it so that so that it also D carbs in because it's an oral medication you want it to hit right now this doesn't get quite hot enough to be carbon okay you need to get it up to 200 degrees so so what I do is I get to this big old pickle jar we got you still see I didn't want this alcohol had particulate in it and I didn't want to filter it out so I'll just run wash my next batch of weed in it right so because I don't want to run it through that I just got it all cleaned out so on I grind up my weed first and I just run some [ __ ] all right here's what I do and take the weed normal that way stick in the food processor stems it off cuz it's all got medicine on it right we're not smoking it we don't care how harsh it is pack this [ __ ] nice and full you candy stem it if you want it'll blow through the processor easier but it really doesn't matter you don't have to chop it up if you good I was really grinding the [ __ ] out of it yesterday cuz I was harvesting beans at the same time this isn't seedy outdoor bud this is this is just foxtail bud [Music] [Music] and do our pickle jar got some alcohol in there yeah you're gonna want to fill it up to where it's almost it's completely saturating the cannabis right it's almost got not enough weed in it right now man where's Mook at you just want to see this oh crap I don't think I put 21 plus up first I even put all the trim and [ __ ] back in the same bag with this looks like that's gonna be hash or honest low [ __ ] floods or foxtails out so bad guys the first time grower and I think he he was worried about Ripper put a security light on them what do you think happened to him they look humongous they're foxtail all out and they're frosty is all get-out fright you know smoke your brains out but I can't do nothing with it smoke it it's getting man all right so I need material for assault worse than I need bud or smoke that's kind of blood we use Ferrari so we don't use moldy bud Japan get away with it y'all you know you just give them dead mold spores and all that sick just it just doesn't seem a that : it besides what if one's for doesn't [ __ ] die and all sudden it's gonna put off thousands and millions more so I don't think they can Hamilton quite frankly I've had this discussion with my mom and she's the smartest person I know see you later Jane thanks for stopping in it wouldn't surprise me if they did that's for sure I mean all it takes is for it to stay on an air bubble and they are microscopic so they may be able to live through the they may be able to live through the alcohol bath but they're not gonna live through the decarboxylation process of mine that kills everything everything gets dead at 165 degrees and we go over that so so just in case anything did that I didn't see or you know even survived the bud wash survived this alcohol wash it's not clear surviving my deep car process but I still will not use moldy cannabis it's just the risk outweighs the reward that's why you gotta look at don't ever look at oh I'm losing this I'm losing that you know you might lose something more important like your ability to breathe will see the [ __ ] that fell on the desk normally I fill this jar fill it full and then I'll tell you how to make it even a nice like pretty color once you get this fluid filtered out of here right if you stick that jar a full liquid in the sunshine for a few hours five six hours it will take the green color out and they'll make it a nice golden color via Charlie Jackson there's let's keep this in the smaller jars push it out of your way should sleep that passion there Jackson where'd you put grandpa's we'll do that all right so then you gotta get your pretty black hair tie that your daughter leaves laying around everywhere because she's a slob yesterday first some of the rice strainer that's right first I strain it with the rice screener because this you have to be careful unless you'd like having one of those special cone funnels we want to squeeze the alcohol out of the material if we can that way if anything spills you're not 100% after we're gonna do the race for you some guys stop here you know they don't mind a little plant matter in their RS soul but it's not just for us so I start people you know a little cleaner look in frankly I think the more [ __ ] you leave it the better that works for you but I don't like it either tastes nasty we should God you look up in the house I'll leave it up for you brother I told my girlfriend want to conserve water and stop showering you so much she told me I I don't think you have a showering problem I think you have a digging up corpses all groan oh my god it's horrible they're gonna give a little squeeze over it's just a little squeeze then we'll throw this in the trash and they'll be back to add the rest this is how we Satan on the alcohol squeeze that [ __ ] out of there oh this one fits way nicer and it's a tighter screen I like that I got an invention for this too I just come up with it yesterday Scott's gonna help we work on the prototype one thing I miss while working at GM in have it shop no more clean this bowl out there so then I like to filter eyes down a little bit more so next I grab me a coffee filter rubber band I gotta be careful with this we in a recovering alcoholic this alcohol that's so strong you really should wear rubber gloves you can literally get drunk from the [ __ ] soaking into your skin so cuz I'm hardly wants to stay on the wagon and I don't want my life to fall into shreds I'm not gonna get drunk on blue-eyes Moses today got my rubber band I got my coffee filter come on maybe I don't have my coffee filter right because I don't have on my coffee music put the coffee saucer over the jar what I just do with my rubber band I just had at the back of the tape and see what the [ __ ] I did with it Oh see I need smokes weed alright ready guys so then this is a long process cuz this [ __ ] takes forever to drain no that ain't gonna work I'm gonna fall oh my goodness sakes well because this has so much alcohol in it disinfect the st. erst okay all right I was going to leave this propped up in the corner on the desk you have to take my word for it drinking but it goes really slow there see it running down in there it's gonna take a while I had a mail this morning I had a mail from mr. green body but he told me he runs rings I like running rigs and you can see how healthy his [ __ ] is you can see the difference is it's not a big one at first but I could tell over the overall health of the plant like how well they they handle [ __ ] like right now we're doing a breeding project with some Brazil Amazonia it's supposed to be the most mold resistant strain there is I mean it fights off mold in the Amazon those kind of wet conditions cassoulet and and it's supposed to be highly pest resistant I can say it's probably the one plant in my grow area that I haven't seen any spider mite damage on whatsoever so in our p.m. that we've had like a spot here and there there's all come from the spider mite damage so it didn't get in OPM but it really hasn't been exposed to any yeah it only happens when your leaves get really damaged nice that's cool Hamilton I gotta make sure that chats still scrolling it hasn't won usually when I get more than four 14 people in there it wants to stop so so back to regs and Femmes I think just the overall health of the plant they just seemed to I don't know maybe because it's not scientifically propagated I guess but even with like even with good solid back breeding and I was listening to Vader talk about this they kept asking Vader well I don't you have feminized see why don't you have feminized seed and this he may have him now this is right before he started ocean grown or right when he started it and he said I can't get it better than ten percent female seeds and until I can get I mean ten percent Hermes or you know our males he said until I can get it better than that I don't want to say they're feminized well I mean that's what everybody else is calling from a nice seed so even at that there's a 10% chance right you can still get a male right so that means the math should be 1 out of 10 so if you're getting 2 or 3 males out of 10 the chances are you got you you might not know it but you've got red pollen from somewhere if you're in an area where somebody's grown within literally if you're outside growing if you're within two miles of somebody with a male plant outside there's a height there is a probability that your plant could get pollinated they can go up to 2 miles in the air that's another reason our area is surrounded by trees and overgrowth and [ __ ] try to filter that [ __ ] out I'm excited for that Sour Diesel means soil life we're talking about that Sour Diesel last night what would get a good run on average that shit's [ __ ] just [ __ ] because it was farm-sauce it ran yeah got pregnant I'm gonna try to run a sense of million see what happens so then after this shit's all done we put it up in our still of course with this still this big you're gonna want to make dual you know a larger quantity at a time even if you just got us save it well some guys do is they'll take their product from here from the jar and then cap it and stick it in the freezer and what that does there's all the fats and lipids that are in that mix well glob you late just like on spaghetti or chili you know you see if you leave it sit out the sauce you'll get that grease I'll come coagulate on top so then they'll filter it again and what happens and they do it through a vacuum process because it has to be quick before the fats melt back again right so then they filter it again cold filter it and then that's how you pull the fats out but once you do that boy it's really hard to work with I mean you got a harvest at all is liquid and then hope it doesn't get too hard in the syringe so I stopped I stopped winterizing the RSO for that reason it was really really strong I mean stupid strong I didn't take a single pain pill for this seven fusions I had my back my mom my mom helps her with that bad breeding stuff cuz before I started I was like nah I don't I don't understand this is Mendelian charm yeah so what that's I mean the probability I'm a math guy and it just everything's a guess you know what I mean it's like you got a mom and a dad you're gonna get brothers and sisters now you're not identical to your brothers and sisters in any way shape or form so you have to take the the biggest baddest brother or sister and sister right in this case and then you got to try to then even have to isolate her genetics so how do you do that so then you got to find a male with similar structure I've all these beans you pop and then you cross them right and then you do this five more times so breeding males males very difficult bought there's way to skip a step and this is why feminized seeds became so popular besides the fact that you have a high probability right 90% chance of getting a female say well it's actually seventy-eight percent chance you know 22 percent 28% chance 72 percent chance I'll be female the rest are gonna be Hermes er or males and that was a study if you're into Korean farming at all this Korean guy did a study where he did 300 beans and that's what the numbers he came up with and he did it like more than once so he said that's the you know that was the probability so so it'd mean breeding is never an exact science right it never but if I would say if you're unsure whether or not things were I check all my beans anyway because you don't know I mean you could get powned from outside blow in the window and hit your plant and you get some beans that came from somebody else's mail who knows just keep checking your sacks it's not that difficult you guys behave c'mon I had a feeling one of them mr. greenbags was gonna be a boy the way that [ __ ] was ahead and I was like come on girl but I did pop pop too because the regs in the math you know the math doesn't always come out one time I popped all my pain wrappers a ridge right first time I popped them I got eight nails out of ten eight I was like well [ __ ] man and then one died cuz I mean it was just it was one of them weird fee tones you know the first f1 something once in a while you get you get something incredibly stellar out of f1 your chances of getting something just ridiculously whole new great strain is really high but you also have that that chance that you're gonna get the really weird one you know the stunt did you know the mass always the same right it's got to equal out that's what the yin and yang is all about Santa and mrs. Mook he yeah he's uh why don't have any of his new stuff but I have his like his uh his ice applesauce and that last batch he ran but I told him to wait because I want I still haven't put his library together I got a whole library for him but I still gotta finish just putting it together I just finished harvesting all the seeds and sausage helped me get that done last week by prompting this [Music] I got more stuff coming off yeah I just thought yesterday I hit a hit my panty dropper with glass big blood that I've feminized pollen that I harvested this summer so I'm going to get a few beans from that and then I'm gonna feminized that clone you know what I mean great now I have oh my god I lost count last time at like 67 strain different strains and beans and I just popped should I pop another six this week I think all right you know scared Roby me too I want to make sure he'd get onto YouTube it's gonna be staggered of course because there's no way I'm gonna be able to flowering out 24 they're not gonna be it already at the same time the only getting on his grow off though email me or whatever you need to do you ain't got pay power whatever all right guys I am going to hit the head get me something to eat take a break and I'll be back at it later if I do something different if I harvest something else or if I do another step on this oh let me show you my last step okay once you start cooking this in this still up here right get it all cooked off and I still puts the alcohol in the is a clean jar when you open it up when this kicks off that the temperature I got it set at it'll be real liquidy normally you guys will keep running keep running it and then harvest it out of here but this thing's so big and it's hard to get up in the syringe when it's real thin it gets real stinky real easy so so what I do is I leave it the alcohol in it so it's easy to make handle and then I bring it to the oven I'll put it on bake 200 until it comes up to temp and then I cut the oven off and this is a D car process as well as the finishing process you see it bubbling right now that's alcohol coming out of it see how little is left and that was from a gallon of liquid this is why you don't see a lot of our sou needs a ton of product to make it to be able to harvest it in any kind of quantity but that's it guys I am Harley grower I'm a mission County misfit architected tank and a bearded bud brother and I'm out of here", "qqvJOAV7oAc": "it was 2012 at the age of 12 that you then became one of a very very exclusive club one that you never want to get into one in seven billion five people on the planet have Langerhans cell sarcoma what's that there's not a lot of research into it so I'm not too sure on what it is it's it's very confusing yeah so that should treatment you were facing that the doctors recommended was a bone-marrow transplant yeah it was extensive chemo radiotherapy and then yeah and then bone marrow transplant and you didn't have just one transplant this was three that you had to have and and how did you get on with that well they failed until the first free yeah they were not - it's not too trouble so it's not it's not a big problem to have and then after that this isn't as a mum because he then really began to suffer ya have to watch himself and how bad was it um well after the fourth transplant they told us that you know the first three had failed and and literally all they had was one more chance for him they had one more bag of his own cells no more they were there you know they'd stress the the the thing to us that there was no more chances after this and and unfortunately three days after he had his final transplant he tracked his fingers down side of the bed and then picked up some infections now obviously infections with no immune system whatsoever and no way for an immune system to even even start to build within his body he was literally being kept alive by antibiotics that's what they told us he did get incredibly ill throughout his whole treatment he'd been very happy and smiley and he'd always been tried to be quite jovial but actually those last those last couple of months are very very difficult he was in a lot of pain you would given I think three days three days a week at most is what they told me when I asked him the the timescale you planned your funeral haven't you yeah to what extent all of it we're gonna do it was gonna be fancy dress and I'd chosen all the costumes for people and it was gonna be quite embarrassing for some of the people though yeah who actually said you want you wanted to go yeah I did he was looking forward to it after four years of treatment it's enough enough was enough so this story then takes at him yeah entirely different turn how did that happen through lots of research I've done lots of research on to see when his secondary cancer arrived and it was so unknown I then said I turned to the internet inside looking and and over the over the following months and couple of years afterwards cannabis just kept popping up people kept emailing me you need to try this you need to nice if he hasn't got cancer you know the cancers have gone this is now a completely different issue it won't work for him is no but I would dismiss it and dismiss it and actually came to the point where I was in hospital with Darren and he was so incredibly ill and really on a high dose of morphine he was actually now on fentanyl which they can't go any further than that and it wasn't working against his hand and and the other issues he had with his stomach and I asked the doctor for bedrock on which is a cannabis based pain relief so it's available in Europe and because I've done I didn't you know I don't know I wanted to go through the proper measures and she actually told me we can't because it hasn't been licensed for children so you know and and more of it came out but people just kept saying and I thought you know what what to lose and you've got nothing nothing nothing to lose it that's dying anyway you know so they just rejoin your antibiotics at this point there was no other treatment so you took this yeah and you asked him and you said yeah yeah I was happy to what did you notice how quickly to think oh my god I mean I honestly do the effect of it blew my mind it wasn't what I expected all I expected too it's done live a research and some people use cannabis to kind of alleviate their anxiety and and some pain and that's what Devin was really experiencing on day 17 when they said there's definitely nothing in his bone marrow there's nothing there you've now just got to wait seven got very anxious and said well how much longer do I have to wait they started to trying up the morphine introduced sleeping tablets and so that's when I actually gave it and within half an hour's hours it administered under the tongue sublingually it's just a tincture it's it's it's not the oil that people talk about it was just a teenager then what we know it's within half an hour to an hour but he was just chilled out he just relaxed the anxiety stopped he no longer was panicking and he was able to just he was able to be compas mentis which he wasn't able to be on the belly always the health-wise I mean actually things being tested against you your white blood cells began to go up yeah after five days or C they told us nothing in his bone marrow so gave it to him five days later when the bandages came off his hand and we saw a healthy fingers which we were told there was no way they were under there when we saw a healthy finger see the doctor started panicking this was now based 75 after the transplant and he was then Tony be there for three three days yeah and nobody has ever engrafted after fifty days so day 75 and all of a sudden his white count has appeared the doctors start running around frantically doctors from Bristol Children's Hospital were called in to do some more blood tests which I said well there's no point you told me on your week ago there's nothing there and obviously in the blood count it was there it's very small but it was there and to test the theory you actually withdrew the cannabis after a little while and the blood count started to go down okay so where are you now how are you now perfectly healthy I'm glad you're normal you stress this is this is this doesn't work for everybody this is not a cure no this is something that worked for you and you could be prosecuted let's be honest well the under current laws in England the world's cannabis is not registered as having any therapeutic value anyone using the drug if medical reasons could be charged for possession possession carrying a maximum sentence of five years in jail or an unlimited fine fascinating

the boy in seven billion yes you", "pkMLk5amiQg": "all right what is good what is poppin it's wool I'm coming with you guys with another we're coming at you guys with another video this is gonna be a quick one this is just gonna be a quick little tutorial on how to make kids she capsules like pills basically um out of oil that you buy from your dispensary you can do this if you're using black market oil and stuff but it's a long process and you have to decode the loyal and make your own our tips Rick Simpson oil alone so basically you're going to go to your dispensary and or you know just a choir i've been sick lately but you need to apply or some RSO or are while this is activated activated oil there's it's a 1 gram syringe let me get it off for you guys so you can see what I'm talking about yeah it's a 1 gram syringe I'm down on my last dose of it I'm gonna get another one but I just wanted to show you guys before this one was gone just what's up with it and all the hype and everything so basically it comes in a 1 milliliter syringe obviously you can tell I'm getting down to the last of it and with these these are technically a thousand milligrams like there is a thousand milligrams it's one milliliter of fluid so it is a gram of oil but for the usable THC you have to pay more attention to the percentage of the THC on the package so when you are dosing this into your capsules and Oh for the capsules you can you you can buy you can buy empty capsules they're fairly inexpensive em in there they don't cost much at all for me I'm super super cheap so I go to Walgreens or Walmart or whatever I go to the like there herb kind of area well I go to the pharmacy section but then I go to like to all the herbs and the vitamins and all that stuff and I find whatever's on sale that's in cat form and I find stuff that's in caps I buy it for whatever I buy for like a dollar or whatever like this one I got a hundred caps for like I think there's like eighty nine cents on clearance or something so I got a hundred cats for the nine cents so I open the caps wash them out a little bit you're not gonna get sick or anything this stuff item its little vitamins like it's good for you so it's whatever but yeah that's just how you acquire cats or you can buy empty ones online it's just more expensive to buy empty for some reason I don't know why and that's your but I million of them but you don't need a million them because you're only gonna be dosing maybe once a day probably um if that like I use this stuff every every couple every couple days I would use it every day if I have a larger amount but it's kind of expensive so but going off on a tangent let's get back on topic so back to the dosing so when you are dosing these yes there is a gram of oil in this one milliliter syringe but when it comes down to the Tate's you have to look at the THC percentage because that's how much THC is gonna be in each point out of all ten points of the of the milliliter you know so it be point one point two point zero point oh point four point five you know all the way up to one so this one for instance this strain that I have it's just an indica blend so it's uh it's a mixture of multiple different indica strains it's a little bit of a cheaper buy because it's a mix of different strains but it's still a really good it's still really good like it's still top-notch stuff but yeah so this stuff the THC the total analysis is 85 point five percent so we'll just call that 85% to make it easier on ourselves so if it's 85% that means that point one milliliter in your syringe so that means that one of these lines if it'll focus a little bit yep so like say from point 6 to point 7 right there that'd be 85 milligrams of THC and what I have left is just about point 1 let's see how many are these scored into 1 2 3 so I have a point 1 5 so yeah I have a point 1 5 so if you did the math on that it would be like about let's see if it's 85 that'd be about a hundred and sixty yeah no no no it'd be 85 plus half of 85 so f 85 is forty two point five so 85 plus forty two point five would be a hundred and twenty two point five so I have a hundred and twenty two point five milligrams of THC left in here roughly like I can't be exact because I can't tell you the exact line and there's no way to be fully 100% exact with what you have because I mean there's still oil on the end of it too so that could easily be another another twenty milligrams right there I mean the if I pull it up will see if it if it pulls and and we can actually see how much we have okay so there once it gets to the bottom yeah we're more or more on the ballpark of almost a point two so that's where we're gonna go for we're gonna go it's about it's about a it's about a point one eight so we're looking at about 100 and 150 160 yeah 100 150 hundred yeah yeah about 100 45 milligrams I'd say just off the top of my head I'm not trying to do math and talk to you guys and make a video at the same time but I could have had this all written down everything and been prepared but I don't do that I just make videos I use an iPhone I get an idea or I get a new product or something if I like it I make a video about it and then hopefully the video is good enough and I don't sound like I'm like really stupid or I don't articulate my words correctly or my vocabulary or anything but yeah so let's get to making these capsules so basically the capsules when you when you pull them apart they just twist right apart if you need to empty em if you don't have done same concept is choice right apart and you'll have a longer part and so you think that longer part you'll take your RI so you'll take it right here and some of this stuff since I haven't used it in a few days it's gonna be a little thick right off the bat um but yeah I'm gonna use the rest of it so I can press as hard as I want um so yeah just kind of squirts right in there just like that it's really hard to press the last little and a little bit but the last big old glob there when the syringes are brand new they're a bit easier to work with this one's you know you're at the end of it so you're trying to squeeze out every last little bit you can get we got a little bit right there bee I don't know if you guys have ever heard of Rick Simpson oil but you should do some research Rick Simpson oil is what there is what they actually recommend to most people that use cannabis to help with cancer Rick Simpson oil is one of the most beneficial ways to medically take cannabis yeah Rick Simpson oil is is really good stuff I can talk too much about it because I really just don't know all every every little fact about it but I will be more research and talk about it in the future when I make more videos about RSO and stuff because that means Rick Simpson oil so I will learn more of our Rick Simpson oil and stuff but yeah today that was just a quick little video to bang out about how to make THC capsules or pills or whatever you want to say from from oil that you can just buy from your dispensary and this is by far much cheaper than buying edibles I love edibles I've got nothing against them at all I love I love them to death like I drink THC syrup all the time I eat chocolate gummies I ate everything but this stuff in comparison is gonna cost you about a twentieth of what edibles would cost you realistically I mean edibles they go are for medical and only no edibles go for around like 30 bucks on our milligrams so just putting that in perspective for you know you get a Rick Simpson oil syringe for you know 50 60 70 80 bucks depending on what you buy you know 200 milligrams compared to 800 to a thousand is pretty is a pretty big difference so but that's all I had for you guys today please hit that like button and subscribe I'm gonna be more active I'm trying to crank videos out every three days I just like don't know what like format to make them and I don't I'm just not experienced enough to do this thing I'm really I'm really trying to learn I'm watching I'm watching all kinds of vlogging and all kinds of stuff to learn more about how to get the right camera angles and how to talk in the videos and how to try to grab the audience's attention earlier you guys as a viewers attention just so I don't bore the hell out of you um so I'm still working on what like my thing is gonna be you know what I'm known for but I'm really hoping that this channel is gonna move forward because I'm nowhere near done with it I just started I'm ready to go I've been doing YouTube for years and years and years I used to do it for video games I've done it for multiple other things I've done it for clothes reselling shoe reselling blah blah blah like I just really like YouTube a lot and I've watched probably 15 hours a day YouTube so I figured might as well contribute to the community and try it out and especially if I have something unique like this there's not there's not a lot of illinois medical marijuana patients so for people that are interested in what in what illinois is producing because obviously we can't be bringing stuff across state lines to our dispensaries you know the black markets one thing you can ship [ __ ] all over the place but in the legal market like it's state legal not federally so that means that if I were to take if I were a dispensary owner and I were to take a pound of weed or if I were a grower and I were to take a pound of weed from Indiana to Illinois that's federal trafficking but we can grow and we can grow all of our own weed and everything obviously as well I have all this stuff that I have but yeah it's it's just something that I that I find interesting personally and I could never really find much on YouTube about Illinois's medical market and what they had really to offer I didn't know any of the brands any of the cultivators none of the dispensaries anything and now I'm up-to-date on most of it and I've learned a ton I love my dispensary I love my bud tenders I love everything about this whole about this whole movement I really hope it keeps going and the cannabis finally gets recognized as the as the medical I don't want to call it a drug but the the medical benefit and just the the magic that this plant has and what it has to offer us so yeah that's ramen in the video because I'll just keep going on stupid little rants like that that are going forever but I hope you guys have a blessed day it's cold out where I live I live in the Midwest it's real cold out nice and windy so bundle up if it's warm where you live you're lucky I'm jealous hope you guys have a great day it's been will or midwestern buds and I'm out I'll see you guys next time", "WCZkmm2w3UM": "[Music] we don't know that much right now especially compared to what we know regarding the effects on the brain lungs and heart for example but research on the effects of cannabis on kidney function is largely limited to a few retrospective cohort studies those studies have included smoked recreational cannabis either in healthy people or they've evaluated any lifetime use among people with kidney disease so there are some differences between recreational benefits and medicinal cannabis such as the route of administration uh the dose the frequency of use and all of these can have different effects on long-term outcomes so these studies did not demonstrate any association between cannabis use and the development or progression of kidney disease because of this though in order to answer this question we conducted a study among people at high risk for kidney disease and we did demonstrate an association between chronic cannabis use and a more rapid decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate among people with kidney disease we presented this research at kidney with 2018 and the uh we're planning to submit the manuscript for publication shortly so many people use cannabis to treat a variety of ailments among people living with kidney disease it's estimated that about one quarter to one half of patients experience chronic symptoms such as pain nausea anorexia sleep disturbance anxiety and depression and several of these are approved indications for medical cannabis uh in across the united states in various states additionally anxiety depression and insomnia are the most common psychiatric conditions that people self-treat with cannabis so there's evidence supporting the use of cannabis in the in patient populations without kidney disease for treating several of these symptoms most of the evidence is focused on chronic pain nausea and anorexia or loss of appetite additionally many patients living with kidney disease and those on dialysis experience substantial chronic being it's estimated up to 50 percent of patients can experience chronic pain now over 60 percent of dialysis patients have received at least one opiate prescription annually and approximately 20 of dialysis patients take prescription opiates chronically but we know that the short-term and chronic use of of opiates are associated with increased morbidity and mortality uh among people with kidney disease so cannabis could have a potential therapeutic role in the pain management among these patients and in fact the national academies concluded that there's substantial evidence for the use of cannabis and cannabinoids to treat chronic pain while several meta-analyses and systematic reviews on cannabis use including the prescription cannabinoids have given some mixed results for treating chronic pain well one thing that i could think of is that you know cannabis consumers are no longer the stereotypical lazy stoner the prevalence of cannabis use in the united states and worldwide has increased considerably over the last decade but particularly among people over the age of 50 and even more so over the age of 65 and and this patient population is enriched with chronic illness including chronic kidney disease we know that adults with chronic medical conditions are more likely to consume cannabis than healthy individuals however we don't really know the long-term health effects of cannabis use on some of these conditions so it's that much more important to understand its impact on kidney disease", "f_5JRVPh5jk": "[Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] you know

could be grass roots are so all the flavors ain't even make a waxed I swear there's number two this week and a bit eat it babe it s okay it's still perfectly butter yellow thanks guys for watching you can turn that's all I use for oh I still got a half a John left I really ain't ate something today and put some on Blondes but yeah oh Claire comes when it's actually an all the - look it's just clear that get you some of that you want the full spectrum are as you know it's are nice and it's a little bit of syrup on and then I give it that extra little flavor but still it's a good strain flavor still no burn marks nice and clear nice and clear yeah I'm digging this I'm digging this alright it did work that cartridge I use the other one was a junk cartridge came up pretty good actually get you medicated but any bad grassroots RSO could be turning to a cartridge it's early people sorry love you guys subscribe there will be more cartridges to be made", "Wm3xANxxohM": "yo yo yo what up everybody it's been a minute i l w a and i'm here today to show you guys the easiest way to use rso otherwise known as rick simpson oil a lot of medical programs they don't have edibles this is the closest that you can get to edibles in pennsylvania not sure about a lot of states but uh it's very very potent stuff and you can make your own edibles with it but i will show you the easiest way to use it just to properly dose yourself out if you don't feel like cooking or you ain't a good cook in the kitchen you ain't about all that life so this gram of rso has is 90.94 thc almost pure thc 1.2 terpenes too so if you enjoy the entourage effect if you believe that terpenes accentuate the experience uh more than just taste if you believe they have some type of psychoactive effect there's sign there's science at the base that does there's signs that the beta doesn't but the uh this is farm fx gorilla glue rso and they do have a lot of terpenes the um grassroots rso also has quite a lot of terpenes but i don't have any of that i got this on sale for valentine's day it was my gift to myself 54. gram so one thing is you got these [ __ ] caps farm fx has these caps they suck there you go run the cap run it under hot water if it has a screw cap like this these are [ __ ] pain in the ass pran uses these too and i don't really get why they do them uh grassroots has just like a stopper cresco has a stopper another one just has a little stopper it's they're a lot easier to use i don't [ __ ] get it where the [ __ ] there you go all right let me look real quick so like i said this is 90 thc so there we go so like right right here if you guys can see that that's about point one so there's ten of those point ones in here and like i said it's ninety percent thc thousand milligrams to a gram of rso so one point one is going to be 90 milligrams and for me about a 45 milligram 40 milligram 30 milligrams dose in that range that is perfect for me if i'm not trying to get destroyed if i'm trying to get destroyed i'll eat a lot more you could put this on crackers you could put it on bread you can mix it in peanut butter i've made chocolate with it but honestly this is the easiest way to do it get yourself a cold glass of water i'm a weirdo i fill up my gatorade balls with water so i stay hydrated all day and then push out a little bit of rso this has been sitting in my kitchen my kitchen is cold so this [ __ ] is actually pretty tight in there actually normally it flows a lot easier it hit the gym it's like awkward i don't want to bust the syringe i've never used the form fx or so yeah so if it's moving like this i'm going to just keep pushing it for the sake of video but um if it's ever really tight like this you can just uh you can run it under hot water warm water and that'll loosen it up don't do like boiling hot water damn i'm surprised at how tight this [ __ ] is coming out you can see there's a little bit coming out of the bottom this like this [ __ ] is thick uh rick simpson got the name because that's the dude who came up with this it's just potent [ __ ] i believe he cured himself of cancer rubbing it all over his body i don't know wrapping himself in like bandages with it i can't say that would be that pleasant but it's [ __ ] crazy you got rid of all these tumors i believe all right so there's a nice little globber in there it's starting to curl up but like i said the easiest way to do it if you put it on something you chew it up it's going to get all stuck in your teeth if you cook with it that's great but you have to cook the easiest way for me is just that was actually it usually works better than that but you just rip it off with your teeth real quick toss it on your tongue the cold water will make it fall right off of like any tooth that you have stuck to and just swallow like a pill i'm gonna try to even maybe eat some more i guess i could use a toothpick too i didn't even think about that just like i said this is the first time using the cresco you also could put it on like a dab a piece of dab and or like a dab mat stick that in the fridge and uh you'll be good to go yeah there's some on the toothpick so it takes usually you know hour or like 45 minutes i feel that kick in with edibles you don't need to uh you don't need to eat food with rso it's good if you have something fatty on your stomach because the thc you'll have more areas to bind but this is already like cooked up decarboxylated like this is t it's like i said ninety percent thc not that that's that's not thca so you could eat this raw and it'll be great thca you can't eat raw it needs the heat to be activated this has already been activated so that's the simplest way to do it guys i'm going to keep pumping out some more videos i got a sunday drama driver by enso amazing but i really want to review that but not a lot of people uh people over complicate rso in my opinion they want to cook with it they want to they don't know they should dab it they like trying to dose it out correctly just multiply your percentage divide it by 10 basically your percentage and that will be your milligrams per tenth and then just squeeze out as much as you want and just heat it straight proper dosage i just got about 30 milligrams gorilla glue put me out for a nice night all right everybody appreciate the love as always thank you for the subs thank you for the love thanks for watching hope this was informative and if you guys have any more questions please feel free to hit me up in the comments uh much love as always peace guys", "wU4Y_c-6rUE": "well it's a very Flint behavior now I think partially because there's laws as to access to both myth medicinal cannabis marijuana and then also now many states including mine have recreational marijuana that's available and I say marijuana but it's actually the cannabis products and there's now very many of them THC specific and the CBD and then there's even more so there's 60 different cannabinoids so it's it's really a very heterogeneous product so that's the first thing and so my patients I tell them we have pretty limited data to help us in terms of informing them about safety and about sort of health benefits and health risks certainly it's a very active area of research but recognize that it's sort of a natural product and because it's natural it it we're not always clear and a given product exactly what's in that product and that I treat it like any other herbal supplement so when my patients asked me about whether they should use the latest and greatest thing they saw on the internet for their liver I tell them that I I think that that's not a good thing to do because we don't always know if that herb is going to be pure whether there's going to be contaminates in that and many of them have not been studied in the context of individuals with liver disease I take the same tact with with the cannabis cannabis products is that we really don't have a lot of data about their safety we don't know about their purity there may be things that are in them that can be beneficial but also potentially harmful so patients should go into it with the knowledge that there's limited data to help us and so in general I'm advising people to treat it as a little bit of a unknown and and I think physicians we need to counsel our patients that you know there are potentially some harms that we just you know we can't assume that it's because it's natural because all the things they read on the internet that it's going to be a beneficial product and that really they have to I think when they're using it recognize there could be some potential harms so I'm trying to you know be open-minded because many people do feel like they do want to try it and see if there's some health benefits for a particular health problem but I think ours we say for the point of view of your liver disease we have less information about sort of potential benefits versus harms there is some data in the Hep C arena so that's a hepatitis C is probably where there actually are some human studies and some publications and for individuals who have hepatitis C who are using daily cannabis we have prior studies that suggest that those those individuals were at higher risk of having fibrosis progression and there's some animal data to support that we know that when the liver develops fibrosis that there is expression of CB c v1 a cb2 receptor so so the cannabinoid receptors are expressed on fibrotic tissue some of them are pro fibre genic some of them are anti fiber genic and you know depending on the cannabinoid product those receptors could be affected differently so in a given individual with this very variable product that we have of marijuana it may actually be a potential risk for a pro fiber genic effect so you could have acceleration so I think the cautious thing to do when I tell patients is if you're going to use marijuana products then don't use them daily because the data is most consistent for daily use of marijuana less frequent use it's the the studies don't suggest that there's a relationship so my counseling to patients is first of all know that it's an area where we have very limited data and then if you feel you are getting a benefit from its use then really from the liver standpoint if you have an underlying liver disease we've had I would advise not to use it daily so those are the two main messages that I give to patients so that's the counseling information I give them I think the other area where at least my colleagues my physician colleagues often we have great discussions is around this area of what about the patients that have advanced liver disease and then our being considered for transplant and will their use of cannabis impact their ability to get on a waiting list and that's where we have to recognize that there's a lot of program by program variation varies by state and it varies within states on the programs policy in California where we now have very liberal laws regarding use of marijuana our transplant program no longer considers that use of marijuana to be a reason that individuals are prohibited from being listed and we there's no penalty in terms of their use of marijuana we do actually still test for it so we actually know that people are using it and we then council along about what we think are the potential risks of them being on marijuana but it doesn't limit anybody from being considered for listing but there are states where marijuana is not in any form legal and where they do prohibit the use of marijuana and so if individuals test positive for it they will either not be able to be listed or if they use marijuana while on the list it could be taken off the list so I think the message should be that unless is of you know again patients should be told that we're not clear what the benefits are and in the context of you potentially being a transplant candidate it could in fact have a negative impact on your ability to be listed so the best thing to do would be to not use so we still counsel generally that we don't want individuals to be using marijuana and certainly in states where there's very specific laws against its use then that could potentially be a barrier to the patient being considered for trans done so we as physicians need to inform our patients of those kinds of limitations that might be in place that programs do have rules about this and we don't want to in fact have anybody minimize their chance of being eligible for a transplant", "uIiYs0lWbCI": "today we're gonna talk about cannabis and diabetes hi my name is Andrea McHargue I'm a cannabis coach and educator I love to teach people about how they can incorporate cannabis into their healthy lifestyle and if you would like more information on that you can head to my website to get a free video on how to get started with cannabis and there's also a free recipe book there for you you just have to sign up for my web for my newsletter when you get there alright today we're gonna talk about the possible benefits of THC and CBD as they relate to diabetes what about the myth that cannabis makes you really fat and unhealthy what about the side effects of cannabis and the different ways to consume so let's talk about some of the possible benefits of THC so this is if you were to consume a THC rich product or something that has a lot of THC in it these are the potential benefits that you might experience so feeling high or stoned or your phoric that for some people is a real benefit they want to feel uplifted and happy and for some people that is a real downer so if you're trying to avoid the stoned euphoric feeling then steer clear of THC but it does have other benefits so it's a great appetite stimulant it helps with sleep now as for diabetes specific things THC acts as an immuno modulator which means it helps regulate out your immune system it reduces intraocular eye pressure so that's when your eye feels very swollen and painful THC can help reduce that it helps with restless leg syndrome and it has an Amelia trve effect on kidneys that have been affected by diabetes let's take a look at the benefits of CBD so this is CBD specific benefits so although you will never feel stoned or you fork or hi while taking CBD it is a really good mood booster so you might feel a little bit happier a little bit more calm as you go about your day to day business it is a very potent anti-inflammatory so think about neuro inflammation in the brain arterial information inflammation for those who suffer with diabetes it's an excellent antioxidant and it acts access of antibacterial agent as well so for diabetes specific it really helps with infant inflammation nerve inflammation the pain of nerve inflammation CBD is excellent for it protects against it protects the metabolism against problems that are caused by cerebral XCX key Mia thought I had that one which is where there's not enough blood flow to your brain CBD can be helpful with that there is evidence that it lowers the incidence of diabetes in lab rats now I know we're not lab rats but there are stage ii trials in process right now so those are trials on humans so we'll have more information soon this one's really interesting CBD provoke promotes fat browning so that's when it helps change our white fat which is not easy for our body to burn into brown fat which is much easier for our body to burn so it helps people to lose weight a little bit more easily in one study it showed that it decreased blood sugar levels by 27 percent and these are benefits that you could get from either THC or CBD or if you're going to take a product that contained both so THC and CBD both help with pain anxiety depression nausea and they both act as a really excellent muscle relaxant anecdotally we don't have Studies on this cannabis in general stabilizes people's blood sugar levels you'll read about that all over the internet over time it contributes to lower blood pressure improves your circulation and cannabis can be used to make topical creams that can really help with some of the side effects of diabetes specifically in your hands and feet now let's talk about this enduring myth that consuming cannabis makes you fat and unhealthy so we have lots of data on this so even though people who can zooom cannabis tend to consume more calories than the average human in general daily cannabis users or people who use cannabis a lot have lower body mass index smaller waist and a reduced risk of diabetes and obesity that's cannabis users overall and in a study that had about 52,000 participants people who use cannabis were about 1/3 less likely to experience diabetes than those who didn't so you can see that there are some protective effects here in a study that was done on current cannabis users to see how cannabis affected their diabetes cannabis users had fasting insulin levels that were about 16% lower than their non using counterpart play ok underparts better levels of the good cholesterol that you want to have and lower levels of insulin resistance and what's interesting about this is that cannabis seems to have kind of a long-term protective effect so even people who are not currently consuming cannabis but who used to consume cannabis still have a small protective effect from the cannabis use let's talk about side effects because just like almost everything there are some side effects so especially for new users you'll experience lots of these side effects and they're up there all th see related actually there's very few side effects for CBD and most people find that if they continue to use the medication the side effects diminish so increased pulse rate dry mouth increased appetite bloodshot eyes lightheadedness sometimes people can get dizzy people have problems with memory and concentration and perception and movement especially if they've taken a high dose of THC so those are the the side effects of THC kind of in general and you can see that these side effects well although maybe not pleasant are potentially much less life interrupting than some of the side effects of regular pharmaceutical medications one caution that I do want to give for those who are interested in taking CBD if you are already on prescription medication that your doctor has cautioned you against using grapefruit with make sure that you talk to your doctor before you incorporate CBD into your wellness routine because it has some contrary to to indicate and contraindications with grapefruit all right what are the ways that you can take cannabis if you're interested to see how it may affect your diabetes well we know that the most common ways are smoking and vaping the reason people like to smoke and vape is that relief of your symptoms is pretty much immediate as soon as you smoke or vapor you start to feel better relief lasts for one to four hours but sometimes people don't want a vapor smoke so next on the list are tinctures so this is cannabis that's been soaked in either alcohol or oil then they strain the cannabis flower out and you're left with an infused alcohol or oil you drip that underneath your tongue and let it sit there for about thirty minutes the advantage to tinctures is that the relief comes on fairly quickly about fifteen or twenty minutes not not so long as edibles as you'll see not as quick as smoking but the relief lasts for two to four hours and then some people prefer oils or edibles or drinks things that have to be consumed they do take a lot longer to kick in maybe one to three hours for you to start feeling relief of your symptoms but the reason people like or oral consumption edibles etc is because the really look relief lasts from 6-8 to 10 or more hours so you can potentially have symptom relief for a much longer time and then finally topical so topicals is when you take cannabis and infuse it into an oil that you mixed with other things like maybe shea butter or beeswax and then you rub that onto your skin relief from pain or inflammation is pretty quick about 15 minutes and the relief from that can last from two to four hours as well so there's lots of different ways to incorporate cannabis into your life and if you're anti smoking then you still have a lot of options alright so today we talked about a lot of the potential benefits of THC and CBD for diabetes we know that although there's a stigma that cannabis does not actually make you fat and I'm healthy in fact much more likely to be lean and have a smaller waist there are side effects to using cannabis but they are pretty mild and we talked about all the different ways to consume if you have any questions about this or anything else please just drop them below I love reading your questions I answer all of them so please read - and what about me how

video thanks for watching bye", "jyAGlb8PMRc": "hello in 1996 my life was forever changed when after a botched back surgery I was left with severe chronic pain this began a cycle that lasted over a decade of fentanyl patch neurontin methadone Norco a myriad of pharmaceuticals that at the height had me over the next decade on 26 different drugs a day what I was left with was overweight depressed unable to work unable to even drive a car but more importantly what I was also left with was chronic pain because we're opioids are an excellent option for people that are in acute suffering they are not the best solution for people having chronic suffering such as mine so I went looking for other solutions about this time I met a woman by the name of K kurta Posse and k was a self-described waken Baker each morning she would wake up and she would pull out her little pink Hello Kitty pipe and she would have a couple of Puffy's so I judged K very harshly I saw her as a drug user but she also told me something very interesting and that was that she was making pot brownies for her boyfriend who had chronic neck pain and that he was able to use or eat one of her brownies before bed at night and not have to use any harmful pharmaceuticals to sleep through the night and that got my interest because up to that point we all had heard the hype around this but all of a sudden I'm like there's got to be some science here so I I started looking for solutions and the first thing I did is I went to a doctor in California who was willing to write me a recommendation to use cannabis and I thought great I'm gonna go and I'm gonna see this doctor and I'm gonna walk out of there with a prescription and know exactly what to do but instead what I got was a sheet of paper with a list of dispensaries and he pointed to one of them and he said this is the Nordstrom of dispensaries so I suggest you go there well I love nor DS so of course that's where I headed so I went over to the dispensary I stood in line I walked up to the counter and I said to the young man behind the counter now that I know is called a budtender and I said okay I have chronic pain what do I use what do I do and out from beneath the counter he pulled a rice krispies treat a bag of caramel corn and a chocolate brownie and I'm looking at this and I'm thinking what how do I use it what do I take and he's like well I have no idea you know I just like this one and it no it kind of makes me and I was like okay great this is not science this is not medicine I need to go and find out more information so I then made my next stop was it heme con well heme con fulfilled every stereotype that I had about cannabis I mean you had your young ladies with the body paint and the strategically placed pot leaves you had the I heart vagina signs along the wall you had the the deafening boom box you know boom boo-boom boo-boom and I'm trying to listen to the vendors and I'm asking them questions and they're giving me answers and and I can't hear anything but what I also heard while I was there was the same girl in the body paint was treating irritable bowel syndrome with cannabis you had the person with the chronic pain seeking answers the social anxiety looking for answers with cannabis so I thought there's got to be something here and I'm since I'm obviously not finding it I'm gonna have to go figure it out myself so I went next and I bought a couple of ounces of something called xxx chem dog and I got it at the granny rate and I went home into my kitchen and I started making this I could not believe that my pain had been so affected by this plant that I had gone from level 8 to a level 2 almost instantaneously when I had taken a puff of it and that no doctor up to this point had ever bothered to mention to me that cannabis was an option how was that even possible so I thought what is it going to take for a doctor to be able to recommend cannabis effectively for treating patients just me so I made this in the kitchen and I can add the oil and I'm looking at it and I'm trying it and I thought okay what is it gonna take so that a doctor feels comfortable actually recommending this for its patient so what are the keys that are gonna be there the first thing is there's gonna have to be lab tests associated with this product if you do not have a lab test associated with the medicine you do not know how many milligrams of each cannabinoid is in there you don't know what you're taking you don't know how to take it and you can't be consistent and frankly a doctor is only going to want to prescribe or recommend something that can be done consistently and accurately the next thing is the doctors going to have to do a very in-depth patient intake process because they're going to have to have all of the same questions that they would ask in treating any disease but then they have to incorporate a set of questions that are specific for cannabis use in itself the next thing is they're going to have to very well understand this plant and the properties of it there are over 500 chemical compounds within the cannabis plant and each one has its own medical potential within it and so how they work and how they work together is very important that a medical professional understands when making this sort of recommendation and the next thing is they're going to have to have a way of giving you specific dosing instructions for each disease that you're treating so that once they do start this feedback loop that they can see what's working and what's not working and refine the data and keep making it better and better I'm a process engineer finding patterns and establishing with data is just the logical way to figure out something and turn it from a plant into a medicine so I went out next and I got a whole bunch of different varieties of cannabis and I was very excited I made all these oils I sent them out for lab results our lab testing and lo and behold I sat down and I'm looking through all these labs and I'm like what am I looking at I have no idea what any of this means I do not understand I don't understand what beta carry a saline is I don't know what Elsa PI I don't know what any of these different components are this so I need to get more education on this because the thing that's fascinating about cannabis is that it is really a pharmacy and a flower because you have all these different compounds within there you know everybody knows about THC and CBD you hear about these in the press there's the misnomer that one gets you high and one is the medicine I would flip that and I would say one isn't of much value and the other one is really good medicine meaning the THC that's a different talk but let's go ahead and stick with this but you also have other cannabinoids in there like CBN and CBN is the one that helps to make you sleepy you have THC v which we believe regulates the insulin uptake in the body so there's all these other you then have all these things called terpenes what terpenes are what you taste and what you smell in a terpene for example in in lavender you have something that's called a little lool that's very calming if you've ever picked up a lemon and held it to your nose and smelled it and had that uplifting feeling that it gives you that's limonene that's also in cannabis so we know that it has all these various components within it and we have to see how they work together I learned about something called the entourage effect now this isn't an actor with a bunch of fans hanging around him this is how all the components of the plant work together in the case of cannabis the whole truly is greater than the sum of its parts because you can buy isolated where they just use one component of it but it is not going to work anywhere as near as well as when you have all of the components together so let's talk about a piece of chocolate cake you could have your flour your butter your sugar your eggs your vanilla your cocoa all of the ingredients that go into a piece of care of chocolate cake but you certainly are not going to have have the experience of eating a piece of chocolate cake and that is a nutshell what the entourage effect is so now we know that we have to have the whole plant so that we have this entourage effect we know that doctors are going to be able to have to dose it correctly but what is in fact a dose because people don't understand that so what a dose is is how much you take and how often you take it if the doctor says I want you to take two in the morning and two at bedtime that's your dose if the doctor says I want you to take one three times a day that's your dose if they say take ten milligrams in the morning and 20 milligrams in the evening that's your dose now what is the therapeutic dose a therapeutic dose is how much is required for you to accomplish what your objective is for example if your objective is to sleep eight hours a night the amount of cannabis that is required to get you asleep keep you asleep and allow you to wake up after eight hours feeling refreshed that is your therapeutic dose if you're suffering chronic pain it's not the amount that knocks you on your butt it's not the amount that gets you high it's the amount that gets your pain under control to a point where you were still a fully functional member of society that is the therapeutic dose it's not just how much you can use so now let's take a look at what is not a dose all right because I hear all the time from people I'll say how much are you taking and they'll say oh I take a one-to-one or I take a one to five or I take a twenty to one well that's great that's a ratio that tells me how much you have one component is in relation to another but it doesn't tell me what they are it doesn't tell me how much concentration of each one is in it just tells me the relationship between two different molecules it's also not the number of drops if I say how much do you take and you say four drops or two drops or five drops if I don't know how many milligrams are in the whole I have no way of knowing how much is in an individual drop and then lastly the most important in the United States in particular where we are not on the metric system however the medical community is a milligram and a milliliter are not interchangeable one is a weight and one is a volume so you need to know how many milligrams of the cannabinoids or whatever the chemical compound is within the volume of whatever the product is whether it's an oil or a cookie or a rice krispies treat alright so let's take a look here at a theoretical therapeutic dose now I want to stay right here before I go any further this is not a particular dose for our therapeutic dose for anything for anybody it's strictly for the purposes of the disc demonstration and I have it up here and I want you to also before I go any further I want to say that no doctor in their right mind would ever recommend somebody start out in a dose this high you always want to start out very very very low and increased slowly until you reach your therapeutic dose but let's take a look at this for a minute we have a recommendation here of a THC dominant medicine that from the doctor they want you to take 25 milligrams a day divided into two separate doses with 1 5 milligrams in the morning when you get up and 20 milligrams about 1 hour before bed they wanted to have several of these different terpenes in it if possible and they want you to take it sublingually which means under the tongue thus the picture of the person sticking their tongue out at you a little bit rolling stones so I'm going to take that and say ok now that you've got this how do we take that information and convert that over to going to a dispensary to buy a product to match it so I'm going to take this as a typical infused oil because it's sibling wool we need to use a tincture or something that can be done under the tongue and let's take a look into a blow-up of the label alright so this on this label I'm going to look along with you it says it's an extra-strength THC product it has 30 milligrams weight of THC within each milliliter the volume so 30 milligrams per milliliter tells you how much is in there we also know that this is going to be about one milligram per drop because we know that a rule of thumb is when you have an infused oil it's approximately 28 to 30 drops per milliliter so in this case because it's 30 milligrams per milliliter it's gonna be about one milligram per drop so in order to achieve the five milligrams in the morning it's going to be five drops and for the twenty milligrams before bedtime you're looking at about three-quarters of a dropper or 0.75 milliliters to achieve that and that will give you precisely what the doctor has recommended for you so I encourage you when you leave here to go to your local dispensaries and look at the myriad of products that are available on the shelves today they come in all forms they come in capsules and waters and all sorts of other things and take a look and go up to the budtender and ask to show you what some of these products are you have the benefit now of a regulated market which means that you now have proper labeling so everything is easier to tell what is in it which really makes eases the way for you to begin your exploration of what cannabis products may work for what ails you and I just one last word of caution remember always start very low and increase slowly thank you you", "syymNA-Xgao":

So we've got our solvent that we've manipulated a\nlittle bit here under the fume hood and what I'm going to do is I'm just going\nto take this solvent and dump it right in I'm sorry going to take the crude and\ndump it right into the solvent in order to show you how quickly this process\nworks so ultimately this is going to have to get taken into solution a little\nbit meaning it's going to have to dissolve within that solvent and once\nthat happens we're going to slow down the stir bar and we're gonna watch the\nlipids almost instantaneously crystallize and separate from your crude oil. So this is normal crude oil out of a hydrocarbon extract similar to any\nother crude oil that you would see coming out of a hydrocarbon application. Let's go ahead and dump her in and we're gonna have a little bit of\ntransfer loss here in this round bottom but we're gonna get just get it as good\nas we can and then we'll leave it alone from there... alright good enough. Let's go ahead and\nturn this stir bar up a little bit just so we can get it moving. So what we can see here is the lipids are\nactually crystallizing similar to how you would winterize in ethanol and as\nyou cool the ethanol you see the lipids start to precipitate - that's what's\nalready happening here instantaneously. And you can see that in most\ncircumstances the lipids are actually heavier than the miscella. Miscella for those of you that don't know is the mixture of the crude oil\nwith the solvent but with the lipids being more dense and heavier they're\ngonna fall to the bottom, so you're starting to see already the separatory\nlayer. And what I'm going to do now - I'm just going to turn off this so it stops\nstirring and we're going to watch that separation. So I'm going to go ahead and lift this\nup just so you guys can maybe see a little bit better. So all of that crude\noil is now in solution and you can see these lipids just absolutely, totally\ncrystallized within this solution. You can see try to get some different angles\nhere for you guys pretty cool though, so now that's ready to be filtered. That's\nthat's an instantaneous crystallization of the lipids. This can then be poured\nthrough any sort of filtration system whether you're doing a small batch, like\nthis like we do in the lab just on lab scale and throw it through a Buechner, or\nyou have a larger filter press whatever the circumstance it very drastically\ncrystallizes the lipids within solution and it's ready to be filtered very, very\nquickly. So if you're using a room-temperature process like this you\ncan generally speed up what took normally with ethanol say 24 hours at\nthe lowest say for four to six hours this just took four to six minutes to do.\nSo massive efficiency increase and we're very proud of the process that we've\nhelped to perfect in the lab here, so we hope you enjoyed it today.", "8satw2Ca-3M": "all right I need you to explain water is Asian okay no I don't do it Twitter eyes a Shana is in theory removing the fats waxes and lipids from your your crude oil or your BHO and bringing it to a higher potency so in theory let's say you this is you know in theory numbers let's say you have one gram of pho it's that 50 percent THC the other 20 percent is probably fats waxes lipids it's then that seventy percent total and you have 30 percent of the solvents terpenes everything else the yeah winterization is removing your fats your waxes in your lipids so it's no longer present and then your oil and therefore you have 70 percent THC and the only remaining elements or your solvents in your terpenes everything so the idea of winterization would be to take your crude oil soak it in ethanol you want to use you want to use a hundred proof ethanol just kids or dissolve everything better except in a particle but once it's fully dissolved you want to breathe sub-zero just saw your fax that your wax and will coagulate together therefore you can then filter them out through a filter and then reduced it and retrieve your ethanol and then that encouraging everywhere as well yet to recommend so this would be like a crude oil with just you know BHO down to the last of it and it's full the colorful and full of fats and waxes and this would be after it winterized and then we distill down Wow so this is starting product and there's not a finish this beautiful here THC", "dbd6q6X285o": "[Music] what's going on everybody making a different kind of video here and I don't know if I'm gonna actually upload this video to YouTube or if this is just a reference point for me but I'm making Rick Simpson oil using Keef today and isopropyl alcohol so here is a jar of it sitting and it's sifted all at the bottom I let it sit for long enough so it's pretty much separated already we're going to use a cheesecloth funnel into a mason jar to collect I already i poured as you can see one batch this is the CBD Keef from our CBD trim so dry sift Keef if you're wondering so it's good [ __ ] I'm gonna make pauses and breaks because kind of doing this at a slow pace so I've switched cheese cloths I cut I bought one bag of cheesecloth when I cut it in half and I used it for the CBD Keef and I'm going to use it for the regular people I only got one hand so I'm kind of just doing this very slowly and very carefully I'm going to be pouring it into I can already see this one up there I've got the griddle set at 250 and I'm gonna probably lower it down to 200 once it actually gets up to 250 just to kind of accelerate the process of tad bit now you will put a lid on but I'm gonna make sure that you have to be watching this the whole time you want to be very careful because it's very quick from full of alcohol to pretty much wasting away in evaporating on you so you got to be quick and careful at the same time so here we go with the point of this and I'm kind of just not giving a [ __ ] because it's pretty clear already because it's already sifted via just sitting oh [ __ ] I'm pulling into the wrong [ __ ] container because I'm stupid alright well since it really doesn't matter cuz I can just pour it back through I'm just kind of stupid as all its okay guys probably too high to be all right so I've muddled most of the process away and I am back with both of them here is the regular and here is the CBD oil now we know it looks quite green but I'll show you I actually did a batch yesterday and have already put it into a syringe and it came out the way it should the syringe kind of got a little messy because it got a little messy and I also put it into some bait cartridges so as you can see it is a little runny like just barely the can it's the consistency it should be it's very viscous I've already used it in a pen I've made a few of them and I put one on a pen and it is quite nice I've never actually vaped Rick Simpson oil until yesterday but or actually not to lie but I have done it before in the past and it was really good and I got it and it actually worked using this method that I'm doing right here which was isopropyl alcohol and Keith I let it I put them into mason jars and I shook him up for a couple of minutes and I let it sit for overnight and then I woke up and I did it again and shook it up and let it mix and then I let it sit and subtle and then I put it through the cheesecloth and here we are on the griddle at 250 I'm wait until I start to see like bubbles and stuff to tell me that it's actually boiling away before I take off the lens and then I will turn on the vent fan and open the window because it is evaporating alcohol and I don't know enough chemistry to tell you that that's good to inhale so alright just a mid-shift update I've got my cooking thermometer here and I'm gonna check the temperature both these the cooking griddle still at 250 this is let's alcohol starts to boil it about 174 to 177 or something like that Fahrenheit I don't know what that is Celsius I can tell you just cuz we're pretty close anyway switch this over to Celsius and about 60 degrees Celsius it would look like oh wait anyway so that's starting to boil but once I took the lid off it started to cool down so probably just put that back on there for a few more minutes let's check this one there's a lot more in here so it's probably not gonna read as hot where am i sorry it's getting there about another 17 degrees it would be boiling away that's the main video update so I got the vent fan going I got a window open these are Boylan so I will come back when they are pretty much done and being put into syringes all right we're just now getting to the little consistency that we want to see this is just another quick update real quick that's doing that and we'll be back when this is in a syringe well after all that we ended up with four grams of oil and I put it in the freezers to make it a little easier to handle one more thing before I wrap up the video here I know there's been a lot going on and I've had a lot of pauses and breaks but uh I just a little little thing I figured out if I make the if I put on a lid that's too big for the pot the water will hit the top and just drop off and evaporate out like this actually I'd imagine that's the alcohol evaporating because there's not much water in there but um yeah so it's a good way to keep it like ventilated but keep the heat inside to for the most part just like I found you still want to watch it make sure you can always just do that get rid of more of it but you want to keep an eye on it the whole time that's basically the idea whatever method you can do to get there works for you then do that [Music]", "CuqkdDtrmmk": "you kind of grieve the child that you

wise choices and not do anything without the help of a physician she says she supports medical marijuana but doesn't feel comfortable recommending it just yet it may be that it works with some that marijuana might work with some and not with others just like other medications we will certainly continue to watch the research we want to give out good information and we wanted information that we

"dbwjb94BBHo": "[Music] today I'm going to be talking to you about taking medicines sublingually this is done by putting a cannabis extract usually a tension under your tongue or rubbing it on your gums and letting it absorb there for a few minutes taking your medicine this way allows the extract to go straight into your bloodstream without passing through your stomach or your digestive tract now this is useful because it offers high bioavailability it has a longer effect at inhalation and is a really clean way to take medicine this intake method has a wide range of uses and it's a wonderful way to start your relationship with cannabis it's predictable and hasn't even killed onset and this can be really useful for a more subtle effect for instance when taken for general lifestyle enhancement here are some key things to keep in mind with sublingual intake products use sublingually come in the form of tinctures infusions or concentrates this method allows for extremely accurate doses tinctures are often measured by the drop and concentrates by weight and if you're using a concentrate we recommend that you use a high-quality digital scale as well because this will really help you with your accuracy it's really important to use clean safe medicine and be aware that not all cannabis extracts are created equally the concentration levels and the extract processes can vary quite a bit and as always we recommend lab tested as best as you can easily see what you're getting now the onset time with sublingual in takers generally between ten and thirty minutes and depending on your goals we suggest starting with a minimal dose and if more is wanted or needed you can easily increase in a really short period of time now if taking a THC dominant cannabis oil there is likely to be some cycle activity you may like to go back and revisit the introduction to cannabis intake methods video in which we shared some typical effects of psycho activity tinctures are typically dissolved in either olive oil coconut oil or alcohol we like the oil versions because cannabis interacts really well with fats and they also tend to be a little bit more pleasant to take as well in terms of taste today we have some examples of tinctures infused oils and concentrates to show you and they're going to demonstrate how to measure your dose and take each of them sublingually so let's get acquainted with products that can be used for sublingual use now remember sublingual use is when you put a product under your tongue or on your gums and inner cheek so that it can be absorbed into your body now today I'm going to show you concentrates as well as liquids or tinctures that can be used for something we'll use before I get into those specifically I want to make a point really with sublingual use and with any of these products you know the form of the product whether it's a concentrate that hasn't been dead looted into any other substance or a tincture for example that has been diluted into something like alcohol olive oil or coconut oil but remember no matter the form of the product you don't necessarily know by looking at it how concentrated it is you can dose it but without knowing the concentration of cannabis within that specific product you won't know exactly how many milligrams you're taking so it's a little bit of what we're gonna get into today now concentrates obviously from their name are one of the most potent purest form of cannabis usually this is a pure form of cannabis that has been extracted from the plant either from bud from shake or any other forms of the plant itself now given that how highly concentrated the medicine is you really want to be careful with it and be able to measure it one way to do that is through the syringe where it has actual measurements but the other tool you want to use is a digital scale so that you know exactly how concentrated the medicine is inside as well as the exact weight that you're getting when you take when you actually put it in your body and those two combinations of pieces of information really tell you what dose you're taking and that way you can track what dose measure its effects and then dose effectively going forward now a great way to do this for concentrates is to use a piece of a rice paper now rice paper paper because it's edible and it dissolves in your mouth and that way you can actually get to concentrate on the scale put it onto the rice paper weigh it know what you're taking and then simply put it into your mouth under your tongue and let it dissolve there that way it's not messy rice paper is also great if you want to just measure your medicine once maybe put it in the fridge or the freezer and then take it later you can have those doses for yourself ready for at a later date so that you don't have to create as much of a mess these products can be a little bit hard to deal with they're a little bit of molasses II as you can see from the color of this all right so constantly it's very effective usually they're used for much more severe conditions when you're trying to get much higher dose of medicine into your body let's move on to liquids or sometimes called tinctures now these can be infused into a number of liquids as I mentioned that you're usually alcohol or oils which can be usually coconut oil or olive oil what happens with this process is the medicine is extracted through various methods there's co2 there's butane there's other alcohol extracts and then that concentrate is then infused back into an oil or they leave a little bit of the alcohol and put it back into alcohol that way diluting the medicine a little bit to be able to take and be taken in liquid form when taking it's pretty intuitive it's nice because you can dose the medicine very effectively with the dropper now ideally your dropper has some type of measuring mechanism on it so you know exactly the milliliters that you're taking and can dose that again you really want to know how concentrated you dis medicine is it could have for example one corner oil and a lot of medicine that's a very concentrated tincture it could have you know 95% oil and 5% medicine those are very different products very different medicines depending on the dose okay so pay attention to that know from your labels and from your medicine providers how concentrated that medicine is now when taking medicine simply put it on your tongue as mentioned let it absorb there and that's how you can take a sublingual tincture all in all sublingual medicine is a great way to take medicine get it into your body effectively with high bioavailability remember the points that we touched on it's really important to know how concentrated your medicine is and it's important to measure it effectively to be able to track", "SgX4zwiYvDM": "UPLOADED TO THE SYSTEM.

Jason MacDougall I'm a professor of honestly 0 del University and I also too committee at the arthritis Society so cannabis is my family of hem the hem family and marijuana is pretty much the same thing it's just more of a slang term so we prefer to adhere to the scientific naming of cannabis cannabinoid is a hammock it's found within the plant the cannabis plant and it can also be a chemical that mimics the cannabis plant so it could be man-made or it could be naturally occurring in our bodies so they're actually three different types of cannabinoid there are the fatal cannabinoids which are the ones that are found within the cannabis plant the synthetic cannabinoids which are the man-made chemicals the pharmaceutical preparations and then they're the endocannabinoids which are the naturally occurring cannabis like compounds that a caramel produced in our bodies there were many active Cannabis the two most well known ones are THC and CBD THC stands for tetrahydrocannabinol and that's the psychoactive component of cannabis CBD is cannabidiol and that has been shown to be effective at controlling pain and inflammation and but it doesn't have the psychoactive properties the same way that THC does so medical cannabis is the cannabis that's prescribed by your doctor and could be an either the herbal form either a synthetic form and there's some evidence to show that it can be effective in alleviating arthritis pain as well as inflammation and fatigue different ways of administering cannabis can be either smoked or ingested in oral form baked into cookies or produced in the oil of butters but they're also synthetic cannabinoids that can be taken as a tablet or as a spray underneath the tongue different strains of cannabis different types of cannabis and they vary and the amount of THC and CBD that they contain and it's important to know that because they may have different impacts in various populations of patients we'll just like any drug there are a number of different side effects associated with cannabis and so it may not be appropriate for all arthritis patients so we really really need more research try and understand the safety profile of the different strains of cannabis there's been a lot of experimental evidence to show that cannabis can be effective in treating the pains of arthritis as well as the inflammation and helping with fatigue but we really need more clinical studies to try and understand benefits and potential limitations of using cannabis so further research into medical cannabis is required so we can understand the different subpopulations of patients who may be responsive to medical cannabis we need to find out the effective dose of medical cannabis some of the interactions with other drugs as well as looking

is my mom Louise school today we're bringing you a video on how to make suppositories it's much more easier to actually get the THC in your system through your bumbum uh-huh what do you think about that mom interesting the good thing about suppositories is that there is definitely a medical application that you can use this material with for example you can use a suppository for PMS premenstrual syndrome that can get pretty intense for the ladies and also there's a lot of uses for cancer for example colon cancer and as well general chronic pain in your spinal area when you use suppositories you get about 70% absorption rate because it goes directly into your blood as opposed having to smoke it which you would get 25% of the effects from so we're gonna show you a little bit of how easy this process is at Budds illa we make infused coconut butter which solidifies at room temperature a jar from bazzill a-- is a hundred and thirty milliliters you can melt this down at one minute in the microwave and then it becomes liquid at room temperature congeals like this and its really simple really we've picked up some silicone jars thank you very much Jen Bennett appreciate that shout out to Jen Bennett out there one love challenge yeah basically what you do is is you would gather some oil which has been melted right now we're using a a baby ear dropper because it's much easier to collect the oil and then you just put it into the cavities fill it up to the top it's a pretty color in pink too yes girl friendly yeah this is the the ladies version right we've got different molds here pink and blue now once you're done with your silicone cavities it's really as simple as just refrigerating it how long would be effective dis fast the effect is generally I would compare it to sort of like an edibles effect so you're looking at typically between four to eight hours of pain relief it lasts longer because the way that it's ingested and processed through your system so you don't need to have a go through your liver for people that have issues with consuming cannabis and having liver issues it gets dissolved like and it takes longer I guess yeah there's different degrees of pain right and so you could adjust as well or have us adjust the strength of the coconut oil you can make it really in a CBD blend where there's no euphoric effect you know so for older patients or much younger patients you don't want them to necessarily get high you just want people who don't use cannabis all the time obviously yeah so we make this product in-house here in Canada in Vancouver British Columbia we're located at two to six seven Kingsway their website is buds Ella dot CA these are CBD capsules they have no THC the CBD is grown off of hemp which Garrett's guarantees that there's no THC I might try it and now they even get my good buddy to try it yeah so hey yeah I spread the wealthy or whatever I mean if it works for me so this is what it looks like after the suppositories have congealed in the freezer you're gonna want to wear gloves because again this is going in the medical cavity right so super easy all you want to do is pop out the congealed oil out of the silicone tree now looks a little bit harder than it should be normally because these are coming out of the freezer normally these would just automatically slide out well they still do they're just a little bit harder right really simple really easy you want to take your time right because this is medication so this is what it looks like when the suppositories are inside the silicone inserts and this is what they look like once they have been pressed out of the silicone inserts thank you very much for joining us folks have fun with that big shout out to Freddy Prichard one-man smoke show and also a Jen Bennett for helping us out with the silicone tree insert that's the one love challenge take care folks so what but Zilla is doing is we're braiding in two for one so if you bring in one gram will give

instantly I was like wow look at this this effort put in now if you're not hip to the scene you wouldn't know that this is a fish kind of a fish pattern the drummer always wears a dress with the same pattern but that's not even the coolest part looked underneath how cool when I saw how cool the outside of the box was I knew the inside can only cooler and it was now I already ate quite a bit of what was in here so I can't review everything but they wrote a very sweet note in the box which I was very touched by Oh see you the only one is left these are the three two one THC CBD fruit punch now these these are the three two one CBD to THC now I am not sure how many milligrams any of this stuff is but I always just say there was only one way to know you know you throw down the hatch so I'm gonna do one of these because I'm going out a little bit later and I just you know why are you relaxed my life is very stressful mmm you know the candy itself is very delicious I'm tasting a little coconut oil base am I wrong very good not it's like sweet and tasty but not like gross you know nice green apple flavor like I'm not [ __ ] candy connoisseur rouse them and this was tasty too and okay they sent to Wally's lollies they sent to lollipops I ate those as soon as they send them I had one oh my god half an hour later I just felt like there was like a warm wrap around my skull I was like I feel [ __ ] good a minute slowly faded away and I didn't feel tired afterwards I didn't feel tired at all so I said bucket if one was a gun second one's gonna get had that same thing happened oh yeah that's something I noticed with the other candy - it's like you feel high but like everything feels like it just feels like a warm blanket you know it's nice now the store which I didn't even mention the name of the store the store is called High Times confection they're on Instagram I'll link it below check it out even if you just like looking at pictures of delicious weed candy which I'm a fan of if you like to torture yourself because apparently South Dakota is gonna legalize weed before New Hampshire of course I'm a legal cannabis patient so naturally naturally and 21 plus 21 plus ok so this is hemp CBD one to oneself I think you say solve just most like nice lotion I used once I don't know if it's supposed to be like a pain relieving or just like a nice lotion if you guys want to let me know ok so I've saved the best thing for last this is a two to one THC CBD suppository and each depository is 20 milligrams of THC and 10 milligrams of CBD so pretty nice a suppository you don't know goes either up the ass or up the vagina I was thinking this would be fantastic for cramps and then I had a horrible cramps the other day and I got to tell you the last thing I felt like doing was sticking Li hand of a bloodied vagina so I I just was like it was a war zone down there so I stayed away I mean I put a tampon that was about it there was no room for anything else dan and I are doing the float tomorrow night and I thought Oh like the sleep perfect I'll do the suppository I'll go to the float I'll be nice and high and then I'll report back do a little bit of a product review is but I need your help guys I need your help should I put this up the V or the V and I'm gonna post on Instagram now asking you and I'm gonna have you boat and then whatever you vote is what I'll do and this is how you really need to be following my Instagram for this type of content okay it's the next day and the results are in actually the results were very mixed a lot of people said but a lot of people said vag a lot of people said why not both actually that was like the most popular answer so I went with the but for now but then maybe in the future we can drive the vagina okay so anyway we are heading to a float I'm going back to NH folks and I inserted the suppository I don't know it was hard like it wasn't in an actual pill so I like you know I don't know but I washed my hands with soap after so hopefully that's you know I don't want to contaminate the tank okay so I'll let you know how it goes I know you're not supposed to get like super header high more of a body high but this should be perfect for the float so we'll see all right guys we're post float post depository I'm super relaxed no obviously that's partially because of the float but I will say that once I like got into the tank whatever I was really easily able to kind of just slip into a relaxation and fall asleep and it was maybe one of the best naps I've had in the tank since I started floating the suppository insertion like I think I need to get a little more clarity on that I'm assuming I don't put like the actual plastic inside I feel like that'd be a bad idea but I think I need to get a little more precise like with placement and squeeze through technique but I'm gonna do it of the V next time because I think it would be so good for cramps but I'm feeling a super great super relaxed and gonna go home and make another meal delivery kit which you'll be seeing all about that soon so okay guys thank you for watching this episode of and slating show see you next time goodbye a lot of you wanted me to put it in the B some of you wanted me to put it in the B and the rest you wanted me to put it in the BMV I probably will cut some of this out but", "SM12-6QEfLI": "what's up everybody we're here in the smash lab and today we're gonna be making some very very strong THC oil using 17 different rosin pucks [Music] the thing about these rosin pucks is they are still loaded with THC we haven't been pressing super high pressure lately we've been doing around 650 to 700 so there is a lot of rosin left over in these the great thing is we've got a new teach egg tester so we're gonna find out just how many milligrams is left inside this oil at the end the last video you saw when our boss drank that entire thing he was completely loaded we are gonna find out just how many milligrams that was and we anticipate this one's gonna be a lot stronger so stay tuned to see just what the measurement comes out to we'll start by getting a little bit of coconut oil 60 milliliters and our beaker over there and warm that up to about 140 degrees for 5 minutes alright so there's our 60 milliliters what we're gonna do is add it to this larger beaker because we're gonna be putting the pucks inside here we need a little bit more space [Music] all right so we're gonna let that heat up for a few minutes it's at about 170 degrees right now okay so our oil is now at around 125 degrees we're gonna go ahead and start adding our pucks like I said we have 17 bucks right here if you want to take a look at these you can see these things are cake this thing has got a nice yellow color still kind of sticky smells great wish you guys could smell this we're gonna start by adding 2 at a time try to save a little time here so I'll take these two right here take a look at these I want you to see what they look like before and after they're gonna be a lot more clear and that oil is gonna be bright yellow by the time I'm done with these two so let's go ahead and have these in there make sure they're fully submerged and boom as you can see we can easily add two at a time in here as we lose a little bit of oil we might have to drop down to one at a time so this all depends on how much oil you're using [Music] all right so it's been about five minutes we're gonna go ahead and take a look at these pugs make sure we got all the rosin outside of them it was about five minutes and we're doing two at a time it's important to know that you can even do seven to ten minutes depending on how your puffs look after we're gonna take a look right now you can see that the oil is already a completely different color than it was originally so these do look pretty clear we'll probably go ahead and let those sit for about two more minutes make sure we get everything out and then we'll completely remove them [Music] okay so it's been two more minutes let's go ahead and remove these our first one here as you can see that was a lot more clear take a look at our oil here it's got a nice yellow color it was originally clear so we're gonna do is go ahead and squeeze the rest of the oil out of these pucks here okay so our first two pucks got them right here as you can see those things are really clear we pulled a lot of rosin out of those here's a one we haven't done yet next one we have done as you can see there's a lot of rosin inside of these puck still what we're gonna do is bill the other 15 bucks in there on a time lapse to save you guys time and go ahead and see how this oil tests out at the end okay so that was the last puck we just did all 17 as you can see these are completely clear now we pulled all the rosin out of those as you can see the oil is way dark way darker than last time we assume is gonna be very potent we're gonna go ahead and test it out but first we've got Adi carbon so let's get that last puck out of there [Music] okay so we just removed that last puck and we turned the temperature up a little bit on our hot plate we're trying to get around that 220 to 240 degrees range we're gonna let that boil sit there for about 10 minutes so we can de carve this is gonna activate all the THC that's inside that oil this should take about 10 minutes but we're gonna pay attention to the bubbles that are forming as you see those bubbles that means it's d carving and once those disappear you're pretty much good to go [Music] okay so next we're going to do is take a nug Smasher 37 micron bag and strain the oil through it what that's going to do is get rid of any of that plant material was left over [Music] all right so what were left with is 20 milliliters of completely activated THC oil what we're gonna do is use our new teach egg test machine a lot of you have been recommending this to us you really want to know how many milligrams of THC was in a in the oil when we were done what this does is it uses light to analyze the oil and give us the total cannabinoid count we know that flour that we pressed was predominantly THC however if you were doing heme it would give you the CBD results as well the only thing is it only tests up to 15 milligrams of THC or total cannabinoids per milliliter so we're gonna have to dilute our rosin oil right here in a twenty to one ratio with coconut oil so we'll do that now all right so let's get our scale zeroed we're gonna add a point 400 grams of clean coconut oil right here alright next we're gonna add point O two of our rosin oil [Music] turn this on alright so we're testing isolate infusion we're doing coconut oil temperatures about 75 and the infusion has been deep carbs we're going to go ahead and begin the test first we got to ensure the tray slot is empty which it is okay let's just calibrate yeah and while that's calibrated we can go ahead and add our oil to the tray right here [Music] all right all right we got the results ten point six times twenty so two hundred the point six times two would be [Music] so two hundred and twelve per milliliter and how many do we have twenty Destin that's that's a lot for one person to drink that's pretty heavy all right so extremely potent oil right here we just got this tea check yesterday we've been playing with it for the past two days really cool device we were really interested to see how many milligrams this was 4240 that's a lot more than most people would do in one dose like we did

was around five years old. As Nate was getting into high school, the aggression levels just really started spiraling out of control. He randomly started running\ninto other classrooms, punching people for nothing. It took four adult men and\nhandcuffs to bring him down to the ground, cuff him and restrain him. At that time, he was taking\n18 pills every single day. And it wasn't even helping. I started researching the\nmedical marijuana states. We were able to come to California. I remembered seeing the\nbig neon cannabis leaf in the window, I'm like, \"Well\nthat's gotta be where we have to go.\" (laughs) (upbeat music) - [Interviewer] Why don't you\ntell me a little bit about your family, you have three kids. - Okay, my name is Jenni Mai. I have three sons on the autism spectrum. Each child is of course so\ndifferent, like any other child, and as far as them being on\nthe spectrum, Nathan is what is considered to be at\nthe very severe end. And rather than trying to\nfind the right medication, they just gave him more\nand more and more of it, and that was really the\nonly solution they had. I did not want him being\nchemically restrained in a bed, being (crying) taken care of by strangers. I'm sorry. I had come across this little video clip of a young boy who was just\nrepeatedly punching himself in the head. - [Reporter] 11 year old Alex\nEkels is severely autistic. His self-destructive\nbehavior brought on by-- - And it caught my attention because it was something that Nate had done. His parents were talking\nabout giving him some kind of an oil. I was confused, because it\nsounded like it was some kind of a marijuana derivative,\nand I was actually shocked and maybe even a little bit disgusted. - [Reporter] And after a\nfew months of treatment, the Ekels say they saw\na dramatic improvement. - Within just a few\nminutes of this boy taking the oil orally, he was\nsmiling, he was calm, and he wasn't hurting himself\nanymore, and I'm like, \"Wait, what just happened there?\" (laughs) I watched it a few more times, and I was completely\nshocked and desperate. - At that point, Jenni\nand her family just moved from Wisconsin to Missouri. Two states where getting pot\nlegally for really any reason is super difficult, but particularly medical\ncannabis to treat autism. Currently only 12 states include autism as a qualifying condition. Five other states and\nthe District of Colombia are considered autism friendly, meaning doctors can\nrecommend medical cannabis for debilitating conditions. So that leaves 33 states\nwhere you can't access medical cannabis to treat autism at all. - I was raised in the Nancy\nReagan \"Just say no\" era. - Say no to drugs, and say yes to life. - I would have never in\nmy life considered this to be a medicine, but I\nbasically told my husband, \"We have to try that.\" - Like most illicit drugs, the scientific and medical research of\nmarijuana has been challenging. But the tide appears to be turning. The first large scale\nclinical trials underway in Montefiore medical\ncenter in New York City. And it may be the key to\nunlocking access to treatment for children with autism, nationwide. Dr. Eric Hollander is leading that study. - I've been involved in research\ndeveloping new therapies and treatments, in\nautism spectrum disorders for about 30 years, and there's a big need to develop treatments for the\npoorer symptoms of autism. - This study focuses on a new\ncompound called Cannabidivarin or CBDV, it's an extract from\nthe cannabis plants similar to CBD, it doesn't include THC, the psychoactive drug that gets you high, and what Jenni uses to treat Nate, but it's the first step\nto studying cannabis to treat autism. - This particular\ncannabinoid has some effects on some of the underlying mechanisms that we think are essential to autism. The problem behaviors,\nthe destructive behaviors, and also in some of the\ncompulsive behaviors, or repetitive behaviors or\nperseverative behaviors, so it gets at a key mechanism\nthat we think is important. - There is reason to be optimistic. This new CBDV based drug is similar to one that's already been approved by the FDA to treat a severe form of\nepilepsy that shares some of the same symptoms that\nDr. Hollander is studying. This new research could\nhelp cement what has largely been anecdotal support of\nusing cannabis to treat autism. But while that research is\nongoing, parents like Jenni are moving to states that\nhave more lax marijuana laws. For Jenni and her family, that\nmeant packing up everything and moving all the way across the country. That decision may sound\nextreme, but for Jenni and Nate, it's been worth it. Their lives have been transformed since first visiting a dispensary. - We got home, and he\ntook a hit immediately. We got this one. - [Nate] Okay. - And within, not even five minutes, it was just like a light switch. He was happy, and just kind\nof looking around like, he had never seen the world\nin that way and he was smiling and looking at me, and\nI just knew right away, 'cause nothing acted that\nquickly or that positively ever. - Jenni has learned a lot since moving her family out to California. There she joined forces\nwith fellow mom, Ronda, to start the non-profit\nWhole Plant Access For Autism. Now it's a team of moms\ndedicating their lives to helping other families\nnavigate the challenges that come with getting cannabis\nfor their autistic kids. - I feel like a lot of people\nthat come to our booth, someone in their lives has\nbeen touched by autism, and they don't know that\nthis is an option for them. Other times we get people that you know, come to us after the event, they email us or they find us on social\nmedia and they want to learn. And that's kind of what we're\nabout, we're about educating. - We decided to take a\ndrive out to Joshua Tree. I had him vape and take an edible right before we left the house. He saw that I saw taking\npictures and most of the other pictures that I've\never taken of him in his life, it was kind of a vacant stare,\nhe wouldn't really look, he wouldn't really smile, and\nhe ran over in front of me and sat down. He sat there and he posed for a picture, like everybody else would\nin a situation like that. (sniffs) And I just, I'm like, \"That's it. That's basically his birth picture.\" You shouldn't have to go\nthrough the whole gamut of medications and side effects\nand long-term consequences of some of those side effects\nin order to get to it. Just look at cannabis as another tool in your tool belt to try. - Thanks for watching.

vertical video this time because it'd be easier to shoot how I'm doing the brownies today it's not very easy as she was on Tilly for that so I am starting to make a little late so I and I'm still finishing up watching my I think it's called a week with John I know I'm political revolution as I was watching earlier on my video I'm playing it mostly so that there's background noise for the neighbors because I don't want them day here with him recording about it so I'm just going to turn the camera and get started because I usually try to use different kinds of medication because I never had very much of each time this time I'm not going to use any Keith I was able to get a bottle of the medicated canola oil at my dispensary so I planned on using some of that as well as the RSO that I got I was recommended this by one of the dispensaries that I could put this in edibles and it would work a lot better with edibles so I decided to try that and I looked up on YouTube how to make edibles with our so and what he I believe it was I will link I will link the video I used in the description because I don't remember his name it was mudflap but I don't remember where his channel was so anyway I'm going to infuse the RSL with the oil and I'm just hoping it'll work well because in his video he shortening or coconut oil I'm going to pause the video and I'm hoping against hope that this doesn't give ruin because he actually used a double boiler when he melted the the coconut oil and put this in it I have it turned down as always like you turn it without it being heated up enough I'm hoping this will melt so I'm gonna put this on it and this is actually supposed to be one gram I believe and it's $40 here so it's gonna be allowed as I waste and again we were to waste it well you can see this here but we're thinking about trying this I'm used to having it looking down at the stove so this is different but it's infused trust me are so into the oil stuck to the phone anyway I'm guessing it's fine it just got stuck to the sorry guys there's just I think it cracked open somewhere cuz it's all wet anyway let me move on to the next day weird correct them yet not correct eggs and okay I'm gonna pause just for a minute so I can get all this stuff okay so I also had to add three tablespoons of water no it's all mixed up as much as I can mix it there's still some of the water that's kind of not wanting to mix in but pretty much done trying to keep in mind that you guys are watching here about three dollars so I got this whisk in a smaller spatula let's do it my gosh I still want to get a couple other things to keep my videos these are pretty thick I'm hoping I can spread them out far enough just cover the pan I don't have any other pan the small when I was using was borrowed so now I'm using this one just use a smaller pan it's easier I thought maybe I would be able to use this one so they would be thin right crispier babies you guys can here's our bathing room that's cuz my neighbor's moving out okay got it for the most part bread oh I try to get all of them okay it says for the biggest pan size 26 to 28 minutes so I'm gonna check it in 20 minutes just because it's so thin hopefully the camera stay so while I'm waiting for the bonus to get and I'm gonna take a quick break with my clear concentrates pear flavor and my CBD pen and their muscle watching coral reef first on Sunday from today while I book cloud there hope to blow juice my favorite kind of juice [Music] [Music] you smell pretty good it's no pretty strong probably and I will let you know how they turn out probably my snapchat my twitter peace up", "wSsRa4d34L4": "reaction has been Swift since yesterday's Supreme Court of Canada ruling expanding the definition of medical marijuana it now means pop brownies cannabis oil all legal for people with a prescription it was welcome news for some parents including Alex for Patsy whose daughter Gwen has epilepsy he's been giving her cannabis oil three times a day to help control her seizures she joins us in studio today thank you for coming in to talk about this so essentially you've been doing this but it's been illegal yeah we've been we've been doing it for eight months legally obtaining the dried cannabis with a prescription note from doctor etc etc it's been illegal to convert it to oil she doesn't smoke so it's the only choice and tell me about your daughter's life before you gave her a medicinal marijuana and after so if I rewind nine months to last October she couldn't really do much she could barely sit on her own she was still having seizures she had been on eight different medications anti epileptic drugs none of them controlled the seizures she was having massive subclinical activity so it's basically seizing constantly in the brain so subclinical activity meaning seizures are going on you may not see it you don't see it at all no but they're happening so it's basically turmoil and chaos all the time and throughout this your daughter's ability to grow on all levels you know emotionally physically is stunted yes her development basically halted we're continuing the therapy but she wasn't acquiring skills almost at all you were your wit's end we certainly were and then you decided to try this medical marijuana and at first what did the doctor say you know when you said you wanted to do this well I actually thought about it about eight months before that or a year before that and maybe 14 months and doctors initially were kind of like no there's not enough research I presented them with a lot of logical arguments academic sources of data anecdotal reports and one of our doctors was kind enough to take the time to comb through all of that and decided that although he can guide me on dosing he didn't feel it would hurt her in any way and nothing else was working so he gave us a prescription and how did how soon did you notice the difference well we started her on a low dose after I made the first batch of oil and got the lab test results back the second day she had a minor seizure this was November mid November and then after that she has not had a seizure since even a subclinical nothing we had a her seventeenth eg in January and it showed no seizure activity at all nothing yeah how does that make you feel that this is you know something that you've provided the quality of life for her however it's great I mean she's now she's crawling she's learning to walk she's playing with toys she's feeding herself she's bothering her brother her quality of life is a thousand percent increase you know probably fair to say as a parent you're gonna do whatever it takes of course do that legal or not legal but now that it's legal how does that help you out well I was willing to do it before and I did but now that there's no fear of prosecution it takes a weight off and hopefully opens the doors to two other people having better access and research yeah well it's great to hear the Quinns doing well thank you also coming in to share your story you're welcome", "ITxmvqDsFfs": "[Music] hi there welcome back to the canvas kitchen I thought today would be a great day to make some cannabis suppositories so there's a few things to know about making cannabis suppositories one is that if you insert them properly they actually won't get you high so you'll get all the medical benefits of using it without getting that high that some people don't really want when they're trying to medicate themselves another thing to know is that this recipe can also be made with CBD however if you're going to use CBD flour for this recipe you're going to need to double the amount of CBD flour that you use because the tendency is that this doesn't work as well rectally if you use CBD so you have to double your dose if you're gonna make it so if you have some cannabis kick around the house use that instead and save the CBD maybe for some vaping so what I've done is I've chosen a really high strain and I'm actually gonna use some shake for this recipe a friend of mine just finished her grow and brought me all her shake and so I thought it would be perfect for this recipe because the plant is actually a very strong strain it's called El Chapo and that one will give you some couch lock for sure so I wanted a really high strain because I want to get a maximum benefit out of this without having to get high so what we're going to start with I've actually made a little bit here but I'm going to show you how I made it so in this mason jar I have 5 grams of shake you can use flour but if you want to and I have 100 milliliters of cocoa butter so it's very important to use cocoa butter because coconut oil can melt at room temperature and especially at body temperature a month very quickly so I would imagine that wouldn't be very fun if you were inserting it rectally so this is basically a chunk of cocoa butter you can buy this deodorized or not deodorized if you buy it and it's not deodorized it actually has a really really nice chocolate smell to it but as you can tell I can handle it and it's not melting in my hands so that is definitely something that is going to kind of help you out while you're going through the process especially if you're just learning how to do this so all we do is what I did was I actually added a little bit of extra cocoa butter because I know I'm gonna get some loss so I added a little bit more so it's probably about a hundred and ten milliliters in here and so we're just gonna take it we've got our jar of shake here and we're just gonna add the two together there yeah we're gonna put the lid on our jar there and we're just gonna add this to a water bath so I've got this already heat it up I don't know if you can see the steam if the camera picks that up or not but all I've done is I put this in a jar put it in the water bath and we're gonna let that go for about four hours so I've got one here that I've already done this one's already been simmering away for four hours so the process is actually quite simple all we're gonna do is the same as if we were doing any other kind of infusion so we're just gonna take our jar and we're gonna pour the contents just through some cheesecloth just like that I want to make sure we get all of it here we go perfect all right so this is already cooled off a little bit too so it makes things a little bit easier later on when we want to try and squeeze this out so I'm just going to start by squishing it down and try and get as much of it as I can through the cheesecloth then I'm just gonna take my cheesecloth and I'm going to give it a really really good squeeze now actually I think I'm gonna put some gloves on for this and we want as much of it as we can get so why would anybody want to use a cannabis suppository is a good question I have had actually some requests to make this recipe and so some people already know the answer but what is nice about this recipe is if you have any kind of chronic pain or for women if you have get bad cramps and you want a really really quick quick fix that's not going to get you high this is the solution so the other nice thing too is that often people can't if they have an illness or they're going through maybe a cancer treatment and they can't keep any food down or keep any medications down a lot of times even doctors will give medications rectally and so a really really quick relief of nausea or again any pain is is to insert regularly so if you do this properly and you insert it properly you will not get high because when you insert these things they will actually bypass the liver and when you bypass the liver then it doesn't deliver anything up to your brain so I think we've given that a pretty good squeeze so we're just gonna put that aside and I'm just gonna pop off these gloves these aren't the best ones all right so what we're left with here is some really really nice oil made with cocoa butter so I don't know if you can see that it's got a really nice color to it so the next step is to insert these into a mold now you can actually purchase molds for this but what I've done instead is I went to the dollar store and I picked up a bag of bubble tea straws they're a little bit tighter than a regular straw and I think that's gonna help for our purposes so the other thing I did was I just found a piece of foam just an old piece of foam kicking around from buying something and so what I've done is I just took a little bit of hot glue put it around the edge of the straw and and pushed it a little bit into the styrofoam so that we can form a seal so also - I cut these straws in half just to make them a little bit easier to work with and we don't need to fill them all the way up so we might as well get some use out of these so the next thing I did was I got a syringe you can use any kind of like medication syringe or whatever works for you and so what we're going to do now is we're going to take this oil and put it into our molds so what I would like to aim for is about 10 milliliters per straw so let's try that first all right so now all we're gonna do is just squeeze those into the mold just like that if you can fit 10 that would be great I don't know if they'll fit or not okay so we have our little sticks here they have been put back to a solid state which means they've just sat for hours at room temperature you probably could put them in the fridge but definitely like I said do not put them in the freezer so they're very very simple to use this straw is not all the way full I'm not sure if you can see that it's filled to about here so all we need to do is just give it a squeeze and it's gonna pop out it's still a little bit soft so you've got this popped out it'll be probably if you leave it overnight it would be a little bit harder you can see it's still a little bit melting in my hand so just imagine what cocoa butter or sorry coconut oil would have done so they're super super easy to use super super easy to make and hopefully you have good luck with it as well so I just wanted to a little recap so the first thing you're going to do and I think I forgot to mention it earlier is you're going to decarboxylate five grams of cannabis the higher the strength are the higher the potency the better then you're going to measure out 100 milliliters of cocoa butter you can melt it first if that makes it easier to measure for you I will put links in the on the website under the recipe section for all of the stuff that you need then you're going to put the two together put them in a water bath in a jar for about four hours and just let that go and then you're going to take your straws your bubble tea straws I'm going to cut them in half and you can either just put them into a container that's going to hold them straight up or you could look into melting the bottoms also you could probably just take a lighter and just melt that bottom down so that when you pour the top in that they'll stay together or you can do what I did and just use a little bit of a hot glue gun around the bottom edge and then stick it on to something flat and that should hold a seal and hold everything in for you and then you're just going to let them sit so about four hours or overnight just long enough to get it back into a nice solid form kind of like the ones you see in the container and then you're ready to go so the one thing to remember about inserting these pieces is once you have it out of the mold make sure that when you put it into your bum that you allow your sphincter to grab it and pull it in so if you go too far it will actually make you high so the secret is is just get it in there enough that your sphincter can hold it in then it will do the work it's magic and it works pretty quickly I would say within about 20 minutes to a half an hour so you can relieve some nausea some cramps sciatica pain it's great for our thright is pain pretty much anything that's causing you trouble it can help now one other thing you can do is you can do a CBD THC mix so because CBD tends to have a lot of anti-inflammatory properties if you add some into your mix that will definitely help if you have some swelling that you're trying to get rid of our sore muscles or whatever so you can play around with the mix a little bit you can do a one to one ratio my preference is to do it the way I made them which is 5 grams of cannabis and 100 milliliters of cocoa butter but you can increase that dose you can decrease that dose and remember like I said in the beginning if you are using just see me a flower for this you're going to want to double it so you're going to use 10 grams of flour and 100 milliliters of oil or of your cocoa butter so again though you can play with the recipe like I said you can mix the two together whatever makes it work for you so it make your batches small in the beginning just so that you can test your strength in which you what you need to make you feel better and then once you have it down pat make sure you write it down write down the recipe the way you like to make it and then you'll always have it for future reference and you can make bigger IJ's and just keep them in the fridge the other thing for women is you can also use this vaginally and it'll really help with people I have like endometriosis or just you know nasty cramps or nausea or whatever it is that you suffer from that will help as well but feel free to try both and see which one works better for you so again decarboxylate your cannabis you're going to do it at 220 degrees for one hour 200 Toyota Gries Fahrenheit one hour in the oven take it out you can use it almost immediately it doesn't really tend to hold any heat and mix your batch up let it go for a couple hours and you are ready to make your mold now if you have a little bit left over don't worry about it pour it into a little container let it go to hurt again you can use up for any other recipe you can use it to make more of these or you can use it to use in some cooking whatever works for you don't ever throw away those little bits of extras that you have leftover you can always keep them in your fridge put a little date on them so you know that when you put them in the fridge and then you can use them up as you wish so I hope you enjoyed this recipe it was a little bit different than what we normally do so hopefully it helps someone out there I did have a few requests for this one I will also see if I can find a link to find the actual suppository molds for you if you feel a little bit more comfortable doing it that way it does have a little bit nicer of a shape for insertion if that helps you at all and so I will put all the links for everything into the recipe section at the Canadian weed forum calm and I hope you will come there and join us and add your input or ask your questions whatever you would like and also if you enjoyed this video please hit the like button and we absolutely love it if you subscribe to our channel we try to put out videos as often as we can and hopefully we can get them a little bit more off and we're trying to work on that schedule a little bit so again thank you very very much for watching I hope you enjoyed this video [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "ppKvv2668OI": "[Music] when I was doing a bite here and today we're going to make some high-quality MCT oil using some canvas so there is a couple of steps to this and we do need a couple of different things so everything that we are going to be I have right here in front of us so we're going to need a crock pot for using this method of the making our empty tio which is a batch to the have right here this is some very potent stuff I found this out last night you're supposed to start low and go slow I definitely suggest doing that so when you're going to need for this is some MCT oil that you could pick up if you're in Canada at GNC health has some pretty cheap or if you go to probably any local health food store they're probably gonna have this stuff you're going to need some cannabis depending on how much you want the rear there are calculators out there and I will put a link for a calculator to kind of give you a rough estimate of how potent your your things are going to be like let's if you want to make gummies or stuff like that so I'm gonna put the calculator below and it'll basically just help you decide what you're going to do now when I made this little here I used 38 grams of cannabis as well as I don't know probably like three four grams of Keef and just the mixture of other candidates that I had around so it was pretty potent stuff so if you're going to use okay so to start we need to talk about D carving your cannabis or decarboxylation it's basically turning your THC a into THC which is what you are really looking to do if you're going to ingest cannabis now if you don't decarboxylate it really won't do much for you so what we're going to do so I guess what I should say is you have a couple of different methods of being able to decrypt leave so you can use the crockpot method because on high they usually heat up to around 220 degrees you put it in a calendar and you just put it there thank you news [Music] okay so there are a couple of different ways that you can be box decarboxylate your cannabis so you could either put it into a canning jar you can put it onto a cookie sheet or something like that or something like this here silicone cookie sheet and you can put this in your oven for about an hour at 225 degrees and that will decarboxylate your canvas this is the method that I chose to do this because when you do it inside of a canning jar with the lid closed you were actually keeping in the terpenes now if you were to just decarboxylate on a cookie sheet throw down a silicone on top of that that put your cannabis right on it you are actually going to lose your turkeys you're going to strip them out of your oil and that's something that I did not want to do so the canning jar method for this instance is a pretty good way of doing that because if you're doing your infusion in the same jar that you decarboxylated it you're going to keep all of your terpenes inside your jar which is great so let's start the process so in the oven 220 degrees for an hour what you're going to do is want to take this out every 15 minutes set an alarm and you're gonna want to turn your jar just kind of shake it up make sure that it's kind of everywhere mixed up and every half hour you're gonna want to burp the jar so you're only gonna burp it once burp it in the first half hour period then you take your cannabis out of the oven you are pretty much good to go so I have some footage that I use the making this oil here and this here is a pretty potent oil I had some last night and I can honestly tell you that you should probably really start slow and go from there don't don't overdo it I made some gummies and just like licking the spoons and the bowls I think I got my fill so yeah make some pretty potent oil and that's we're planning on doing here today it's you know so let's get started and we'll go from here [Music] so the reason why I'm wishing it up like this is because I have 473 milliliters of MCT oil and I know that that won't be a full jar up to here so we're just gonna squish it down [Music] all right that one's mixed up you see this mixed up pretty good here let's get this in the MCT oil and we're gonna get into the slow cooker [Music] [Applause] [Music] so the reason one of the reasons why we did it into the canning jar meant that was so that we were able to keep the terpene profile over animus now if you were to just decarboxylate on a tray we wouldn't got the same abilities out of it so we would have lost all of our terpenes [Music] this here looks like it's just to say covering at all and we got maybe like a couple teaspoons left in the bottle [Music] so perfect [Music] [Music] all righty guys so we dropped her in there and now you just gotta let her do or think what we're gonna do is just I guess probably keep filling this crock pot back up with water as imagine it's gonna get pretty hot and we're gonna lose some of its kind of the steam out so we'll just have to keep an eye on so we'll come back and check them in this problem you tomorrow all right guys so it's been about 12 hours now we put it in a little midnight last night it's just a little bit past noon here and 66 degrees Celsius one hundred and forty nine point seven it's temperature that it's been going at on high and if we take a look at her oil when first put it in it was clear oil now we can see it's a nice dark green delicious looking oil let's see if we can maybe get under light here a little bit sassy we'll get you a better shot your moment with flashlights alright alright guys so I've got my measuring cup I've got the strainer that sits in it I've got my cheesecloth what I'm gonna do is take this out of here this is actually pretty freakin hot play with and we're just gonna let it cool off for a little bit and while that's cooling off let me get some cheese bot open [Music] get a couple little laters wrapped around here don't really wanna be able to see through it but I would like to filter out most of those kind of fine once particles so I've got me one of these Curie filters and that's really gonna get all the very fine fine fine stuff out of it so that's what I'm gonna use for the very fine stuff so for now we're just going to pour it here into the cheesecloth get out most of the large particulates and then we're going to do the finds with this year we should have some awesome future oil and then with this taintdroid we can do lots of things with make some gummies well I don't really know lots of things but other than just that using this nature but I really want to make some gummies and that's what I was thinking about doing so if you guys are interested in that let us know and we will make a video for you on how to make gummies you can probably start to see this I'm not sure if you can see some camera not butter there's a nice green oil nice green danger I think what I've done here is underestimated the amount yes I have underestimated the amount the cheesecloth I would need to strain this out [Music] [Music] oh yeah there's quite a bit in this cannabis though [Music] you've got a clip holding this and now we're going to just do we're fine strain into our jar that we're going to store it in a little bit better review here my messy cupboard cannabis all over it alright [Music] all right so I've got a lid wash to clean ready here what I'm going to do is I'm going to stick a notice I got some MCT oil it was made November 5th 2019 and we're just gonna stick that on here now I'm gonna grab a flashlight so we can kind of see this here so we can see here it is a greenish oil we put it in it was Coulier clear clear and now it's a nice green so what you're gonna want to do the store this oil is it want to put it in a nice cool dark place some people recommend putting it in the fridge and that's one of the benefits of the MTT oil if you put it into the fridge it will not solidify like it does if you were to use coconut oil and I believe that also preserves a little bit longer as well so there's definitely some benefits of using the MTT oil so here you have it guys I hope this video was easy enough for everyone this stuff here tastes really good this tastes a lot better than the textures that I was buying from the licensed producers and with 38 grams plus a couple of grams of Keef this [ __ ] it should be pretty good well so we're gonna try some out and yeah we'll go from there [Music]", "uBlyb3dh02U": "good afternoon we're going to make some THC infused gummies first step is to make sure you have everything that you need out so our items are a three ounce package of unflavored jello or flavored gelatin not sugar-free I'm using two packets of unflavored as per the recipe that I posted and 2/3 cup cold water I've also got my lecithin to the side to put a little bit in because that is a nice fat protein that the THC bonds to there's a little machine that keeps it to a perfect time without having to go back and forth to the stove also has a link posted since we're doing super Lemon Haze on blue so let's again box tile I like to make sure it's very loosely powdery because it'll stick together I said it is a plant fat protein mini whisk mix all of these powders together enter water so we want to make sure that all of the gelatin is wet and separated and there are no clumps of gelatin that are still powdered the gelatin is mixed and 15 minutes has elapsed the gelatin has soaked up the water so enter the trusty little heater you turn that on I'm going to go ahead and break up the gelatin a little bit here and I'm going to wait probably about 10 minutes to come back and stir it again back quick search it's starting to look clearer for the record I'm doing blue for super-lon haze because true clear has a blue label just like I did read for indica and I did yellow for hybrid alright we're gonna let it sit another five minutes so it's been a little bit I'm gonna go with that is as clear as it needs to work because there's lecithin and it doesn't get that crystal clear like if you're doing candy but it is quite smooth quite runny I'm going to inject the super Lemon Haze truth here into it that has been so deep and warming in a cup of warm worth yeah it's tough [Music] and what i'm doing here is optional ma'am I usually pull that off but I'm going to pull some of the jello up in give it a shake and squirt that back in we all want to make the most of all of our product so I'm going to stir that in and once again I'm going to let it sit for five minutes to infuse before we put it into the molds all right we're gonna give it one more stir then because this is gelatin and not egg I'm not gonna whisk it super fast assuming it's going to stay in there [Music] smells like THC so the gummy bear molds that I put the link to hold about a milliliter you don't need to measure but they came with little droppers I'm going to hand this off to my partner because he has a much better non-payment you if you drip anything cuz it's silicone it's gonna that's basically gonna be one dose all of the little dots that end up on top of the silicone yeah kind of scrap all those at the end put them together it's almost like having an extra Bayer we use the opposite color or a different color than the jello you he's gonna go ahead and fill the rest of those up and we'll be back in a moment on to another bold [Music] we're gonna go ahead and stipple some cornstarch onto the back I put these in the freezer they've set and I've let them come back to temperature to make sure there's not a lot of moisture so this is my makeup brush there's a link to this this is the stipple the flat top that's what we're gonna stipple with so I've got cornstarch I just used the cornstarch lid they've got a little folded up foil and a paper towel in case I feel like it's getting too thick so I just went to stipple along the back of these and if you feel there's a bit much you can always go back and kind of wipe something away the nice thing about the brushes you can twist it and if you feel there's too much corn starch somewhere then you can use the edges of it so I like to know that my backs are good prior to pop them out I'm gonna pop this one out like so now gonna turn it over and show you the quick way I just stick my nail into it and pop them out and then lay them out afterwards welcome back to the final step we're going to say it's been 24 hours these will stay out overnight these have been out for 24 hours they're slightly smaller because they've now reduced down a little bit in size once they have dehydrated a bit as such I stipple them on the top with the cornstarch and I'm able to have them not to be sticky any further questions please feel free to send me a private message or post on the video however you'd like thanks", "Re1VZwJavR8": "today really just I was about to do a distillation for meditation over the next couple weeks and thought I would try and do a better video than some that I have posted trying to go through the process a little bit at least with what I do you know this mayor cannot be right or wrong he's given the equipment that I have so one thing I wanted to talk about here was the difference in Chinese glass box or glass I guess that's one thing that was passed in one of my other videos and they mentioned that there was an article mentioning toxins in the glass now personally I've been smoking for probably 20 years or more this is something I've never heard of I've used bikes from the cheapest finished glass you know two bucks at the convenience store to the more expensive types of pipes like 80 90 bucks a head for just a basic plate you know I could see a difference a lot of it I've never heard of the toxins I've never read about we seen anybody to mention it in the article that I didn't read about it it was like somebody who you know I'd say they probably had an idea but it also didn't apply to laboratory glassware they were speaking specifically at players now I don't know about toxins but one thing what I do know about the Chinese glass for the office was causing problems but stuff like this work comes down to his tolerances and inconsistencies in the glass like you're gonna have you know the glass is not going to be you don't want thickness it may not be the best quality of borosilicate either it's they probably use something cheaper but if you use the types of soft glass mention in the article in this type of application the heat would absolutely destroy it so the other problem we've got with the Chinese type of glass are these ground joints here where they may not may not make a perfect steel you know you'll never really see it unless it's really really bad but if it can't make a perfect ceiling here you're gonna end up with say maybe this is just a little bit longer than it should be so the tolerances will be will be different they'll be way out a lot more than what you would see and say american-made glassware they're tall matches are gonna be really really close so that's one that's one of the issues were running to there and what happens when like this is too long or especially too short as this heats up you know it expands and then this joint will actually it'll fall in just slightly and as it cools down it'll grab that and it basically you know prevents that swipe from ever coming out again that's where you went into less of those problems with american-made glass also there's there's the the sealing ability here now you always need to use vacuum grease on these but with a really good quality Canadian or American made glass from a reputable company you would find that you could get a vacuum seal without using any grease or additional stuff in there but that would not be good because again you'd go back to welding your joints together and things like that so you always want to use a greasing so that being said this is just the quote-unquote cheap distillation unit you know it's not it's made by some offshore company so it does the trick but it could be better like I'm pretty sure I run into packing leaks and things like that there's no insulation around globe flasks and other such things like that where you see improvements like that on the American stuff also your electronics in here these are very cheap electronics so it doesn't have the accuracy in temperature it does about the same plate control that something better would happen where this just controls the temperature by a thermal probe and basically turning the heating on and on and off repeatedly you know to maintain a temperature a more professional unit will use wattage control where it'll actually just adjust [Music] the amount of current going into the heating element instead of turning on and off it's actually regulating regulating the current that's feeding it so that you have a more accurate more steady temperature so not all being said now I would like to get this [Music] I just like to every night at the back you pump right [Music] and I've reached over my shoulder down to zero so I [Music] another thing I wanted to talk about here is the back in Greece I started off using this Dow Corning's but the person I think it's garbage it's thick it's it's sold us back in Greece but it seems to leak through the joints no matter how little I use or doesn't create a perfect seal if I don't use just the perfect amount you don't need a lot anyway what I've started using here is krytox GPL 207 which it's a little thinner it's not marketed as back in Greece but it's a parent induct and a fighter temperature resistance so when you're using this stuff you really don't need a lot a little little dab on there just a little dab will be it's hard to do with one hand and then so on your joint you would just apply a little bit of that is down the edge there just like that even that looks like quite a bit there I don't like to come all the way down to the bottom on this piece just because this doesn't see a lot of the heat and I you know I don't like the trip to seep into the joiner end up running past now but how do you pull the vacuum this will thin out it'll really in the filament will pull into the rest of the joint you do have to make sure to actually put enough on there though otherwise you'll still end up with joints that are hard during just put a little bit on there like that and you stick that in the joint you just spin it back and forth until you get a nice clear joint seal showing that like it's easier to spend titles so here's how to properly grease the join now I've got a nice thin little coating on that side that side put it in there carefully just minutes with the devil corny grease it tends to make the joint nice and clear I've noticed with the cry box it doesn't clarify it as much they just spin it there and you shouldn't feel any any glass grinding together get you just feel smooth all the way around that's nice and snug and stay longer I'm actually gonna clean house and as is your joint don't forget to put a cat clip on it there should be plenty enough grease one thing to take note up here do not forget your [ __ ] stir bar because I do this just about every time and I have to take this out plop it in there and we grease that joint make sure you put your spare bar in there every time I'm about ready to get this started now I get my cold trap cold and for anybody wondering what the purpose of this bowl here is the goal trap will collect any of the vapors and they'll drip down into this blast now the extra cold will help also condensed extra [Music] boiling installing cycling so with everything hooked up greased up everything's cold vacuums been running for a while and gotta like glasses together so the first thing I'm gonna do is run it back to you and don't worry about that little dog this is the flash don't fly called a joke this I mean it will cause some certain problems as it will also try to boil and want to vaporize compounds that are still in it but that's already distillate so this should be pretty negligible and yes I should have taken the time to clean that better but the other two that will collect everything are clean much better and as this is just for personal use I'm okay with this yeah I'm not too concerned about that right there so the first thing we're gonna end up doing here is turn on a vacuum gauge also this PVC pipe isn't hooked up that was an experiment before I was going to run in public that PVC is just not the way to go it off gases and a week too and it just there's there's too many points of leakage so it's just not word that maybe some Dale gold stainless steel but right now that's just not you know it's it's not in the foreseeable future so I'm just using the government roses and then [ __ ] everything up or whatever I need at the time the vacuum regulator just hooked up because for other purposes if you did that great out of the way out of the back and pump through the table into the vacuum regulator - bull trout so whenever I need to use anything else I just I just unscrew that fitting there screwing whatever appropriate fitting I need so right now for for the distillation I'm just going to do turn it on and set it to pull back in because we don't need any regulation here it's probably isn't the greatest pump but I'll worry about these problems a little bit later down the road for us to change the oil I just changed out while the singular form works next another the dryers as well [Music] smells pretty clear to you this is just a reservoir [ __ ] chambers in here so question they tell you almost impossible through here [Music] missiles you gotta be careful in your film because we have company [Music] so just be wary about it got one of these pumps right now I'm just pulling you back c'mon I'm gonna let that pull down as low as it'll go before I even start heating it up as you can see is kind of slow with this welcome other part of this problem is my lines could be dirty so you know there's terpenes and stuff collected absorbed into the lines and they're gonna be vaporizing and off-gassing as well so that's another thing that'll affect your vacuum level another thing that I'm aware of and we'll try to address in the future see what I can do about that so I'm aware of some of the problems that I have here another one should be this should be robbers I guess in some tip while I'm not really sure what I should wrap it with I'm going out there how quickly you're done oh yeah but how does of great now like when this is running this is just acting as a condenser as well I'm going I did try packing the head with stainless steel steel wool I wasn't really sure how much of there's also the condensation that bill here which is an issue running degrees so that's another thing they're going to take care of possibly wrap that up so there's there's key things that I'm aware of that I need to fix that could improve the distillation overall we'll see how long this takes it's just about one o'clock in the afternoon I'm hoping to get started here by one o'clock and see how long it takes to get through this whole process thing so right now we're sitting at 1,200 with this particular batch I have done more filtering on this than dispatches okay I kept filtering it through stage one and full of a stop boat that I really freeze up to 24 hours again we filtered it through stage one and I kept doing that if there was nothing coming through in stage one there are nothing getting left behind the filters to stage one which I wasn't doing previously and I probably should have been actually I definitely should have been alive and I repeated that through stage two and stage three as well so what's in here is has been more filter than anything that I put in previously so I'm curious to see what kind of an effect last thing you have going with this with this current class of distillation and what's in there right now is just to put exactly 1,000 grams fully winterized and filtered plenty of oil they you know make thanks to a closed loop system actually made to a terminator style system so here we are at 9:20 so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna let that just sit for a while without backing pull-down we'll come back when that's that's not a star I've been holding steady at 860 for a while got a pretty good boil there I mean realistically I'd like to see it not boiling but someone's car cleaning it up now [Applause] I'm gonna heat up to 50 degrees you're running before I start turning on the starboard point of advice if you want your driving school last a little longer one thing that makes a good seal not let any moisture in there because it hit moisture freezes and then encouraged to do a block of dry ice to do is just stuff it all blankets or towels or whatever in this remove all the air space that you tend from the dry place and this will last the cooler I'll have this pool of dry ice in a couple of days and I constantly use it topping this thing off making sure it stays cold that's the process for now it's just going to be one once it hits 50 degrees start going up by 30 degrees so then I'll heat it up as soon as it is 50 I'll ramp it up to 80 and then from 80 I'll go to 110 and so on and so forth like that usually once I get to about 180 I've seen a bit of reaction from water and other call the files and stuff up here and ahead so I will hold it there at that temperature for a while we'll let that stuff collect into the ship blast so I haven't had a bit of an opportunity here and I see we have boiled up a little bit [Music] but it's not 60 degrees right now all should be 56 overshot that's already pointing system so at this point now since it's not Ronnie Emma on the skewer because we see over there 1,050 [Music] the pressures come up because the vapors in here well this is the first time ever you do this to me only goes so fast that we're gonna stop [Music] except this 286 the other thing too is this is a PID so it's gonna learn it know if I want to get to 50 I'm gonna end up going up to 80 anyway so I guess it's kind of learning that it came to order shoot the temperature a little bit stupid [ __ ] but this is where your this is the difference between your basic PID and something that actually controls the wattage right now I'm pretty sure that's just collecting water and ethanol but only mostly ethanol what was left after the evaporation process the reclamation so this unfortunately won't be reclaimed it will just be thrown out I just about at 180 now pretty vigorous reaction going on I'm honestly not sure if it's supposed to happen what this right now this isn't anything good this is just the about earlier least I think it is anyway so in this pointing I've been told these puffs of smoke are not good [Music] I can't remember the reason why and I'm not running entirely correctly with myself can leave your song [Music] so I will just hold this here for a little until this reaction stops basically distilled all out just got pure stuff here over the right now we're in 860 so it's been just about an hour come up to this temperature get here of course that our like it's gone up to a Nazi 1200 [Music] gen-i smoking stuck there too Nessa's tough innings of is out there the bus now if I had a secondary cold trap on there I'm sure so I know this server stuff didn't like - all this hold America last one during about ten minutes later you're taking the reaction up here stock for the most part I stopped collecting stuff as a pastor [Music] [Applause] start turning because this would take a while [Music] hormone when this to exchange so slope is still down at 790 microns now [Music] about 220 now and [Music] after twenty twelve hundred microns was lower I was starting to see a little bit reaction here so I've set the temperature up to 230 and I want to stop it when I start having a reaction here 46 degrees at the head I'm going to junk this is starting to get a little bit more yellow kind of a bit a little bit thicker oh I also set this up once this hit [Music] so probably by the time this event of 225 or 220 6w3 in addition to 25 right now with 154 point two degrees and temperature dropping at the head well 50 micron 2-minute 86\u00b0 I'm actually going to hold that right there that is now 240 in the afternoon when I started this about one o'clock from here I am our 40 minutes in see this is running by the Chinese stuff that's gonna overshoot the temperature not measuring correctly as to why to swing hysteresis I only seen a really big clean reflux rate in this setup once or twice I mean no one wants your twice but I mean just to replicate it every time I probably turn around run for a bit michalak [Music] so it's 3:45 started except one I had the temperature such as a little too either to 35 and it's kind of boiling over but it has gotten to the fraction looking for I think it looks pretty good the most part yeah some kind of something's showing up I'm not sure what it was but so far this looks pretty good here another got this stuff coming down before coming down it was little green colors like this because he [Music] I'm so willing to do now is I'll rotate this over and begin collecting this fraction and collected in this separate jar here yeah rotated cow turn the temperature down 230 actually keep this one 2:33 instead so collecting distraction I think I have noticed that I've got I mean you see it down there very well little bubbles right there in my class I'm sure how they came about or where they came from [Music] I believe this is the hearts hearts fraction I wanna say but I don't know also not really sure with those little bubbles I run I think it's just an air bubbles I want to save all this I hope it is it looks like it is [Music] I'm sure this looks like animals [Music] and there's old that's collected someone that will be I guess wildest one and then I put this stuff into it our container later right after all the same process I gotta collect all the garbage and let it sit this fraction that off [Music] [Applause] and so far so far just looking like the nicest distillate I've produced out of this which I attribute to the extra filtration that I'm wrong see how it looks on collects an alert so while 280 degrees when we got eleven fifty microns not ideal I was able to pull a lower vacuum on this and the temperature would be much lower than the same results right now it's five o'clock now so that's been going for about four hours a couple hours since I actually started to cover it it's another nine hundred and sixty microns now we're degrees up in the head to put it 32-bit 50:33 it seemed to be working pretty well so bit of oil over but in the most part I guess it's working okay this what's already here there was at some point there's a little white cloudy [ __ ] showing up I'm not really sure what it was but it's not there now it's not showing I'm done here this in a second distillation with help I'm not sure what that [ __ ] is it keeps showing up in here I have never shown like one of my other videos I'm not really sure how it started why it started it's not something that I've always seen and quite frankly and really saw in flesh and doing all the filtration so that's what confuses me the more but I don't see anything down here and now right from there we are a couple hundred grands who goes [Music] this is actually pretty clear the stuff that you see in there there's a lot of air bubbles it's hard to see on camera but you know what right there right there a little I feel swirl thing that's that murky [ __ ] that I was we play those bongos across there down from the top goes over there [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and that seems like a lot but I eat about five or six grams probably about 10 grand you're just eating this [Music] 20 up there 6 evening now and I'm pretty much just gonna wrap this up on you there's a bit left in there I'm sure there's a lot I could collect still I don't feel like letting it run all night it's director slow down and get a lot of character so [Music] Kangra doesn't really show it too well there's there's a lot of stuff on the outside of the glass that's showing up in here there's some air bubbles and what's dirtier than it really is but it's not it's not that very this however this does look a little bit cleaner still less air bubbles it's a higher heat yeah I did turn this up specifically so I would get a higher boiling right but even now I can see it's starting to slow down there somewhat so it's about at this point I'm just going to shut it off here and we got we're at 10:50 so I find pretty disappointing a lot of times that dullness I've been able to achieve a lot lower results in fact a couple of times by this point I've been down to probably 200 or less microns so I've definitely got some issues here and I'm welcome some of these got some suggestions or nonsensical help me out I call that some people suggestions and done what I hadn't but at this point I'm not sure just too much too much more I can this is certainly clogged up you got a goblin come down there you want some [ __ ] that's one thing that having problems with usually that starts happening at the beginning it causes trouble the whole way through but when that plugs up the boiling air stops I'm going to give it a little bit water - for sure color week too low 6:30 6:40 [Music] now you can see where it blocks where it becomes plugged and stops the boiling across it's still going there's not a click still a bit in there I'm just a little pressed for time this evening unfortunately so [Music] well I do when I shut this down I just turn the temperature way and just back down to zero and I'll let this cool down under packaging all still running because if I unplug this right now if I disconnect a vacuum right now this will fill up with smoke I don't really like doing that I don't like it and smoke in there it's all about you're in a while to cool down and then disconnect all files and applause playing out with the next and four blasts into the jars did you make a medicine so I just released a vacuum on that bye I loosened up this time I just kind of pulled it that'll do with support so I want to collect that stuff my trusty heatgun here [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] when you're cool enough heat gun to mine has a cool setting [Music] any rate when you pull off your heat gun you're always going to want to put it up like that will maintain the light to your heat gun and be less dangerous because unless the heat escape up inside that's just a this is a little FYI I'm gonna turn the pump in here there we go we'll call now today I said I'll just pull these once it's out here like so and before I have to you know wipe up the grease inside there and we have I'm not gonna lie I'm not gonna try and you know I'm not gonna be anything I'm sure I could have better results I just don't know how I would love to have better results perhaps I would be able to consume less of it on a daily basis but for the time being it is what it is this is pretty much what I did it looks pretty golden and nice when you look at it you know in a syringe or in a little on a little jar something like that piece of glass until the drunk did it take in there like I said I'll recycle that that plainly stuff in the bottom yeah I love your backs and that's kind of stuck but you know it can be recycled it's gonna be cracked and so I just don't like waste and if I can waste as little as possible I will should we got that up I'll set that to uh turn off for about you meter the condenser so I'll take that part this is some little and that's it for today that's just from that distillation thanks for watching everybody", "USp47BPZ5zQ": "hey guys this is Jimmy again I have talked about ahem extraction lines on the last episode I'm using the Prussian lines so we can make hemp biomass into coal oil in this episode I'm going to show you the biomass first and then showed you the step by step how to turn the crude oil into good and clear CBD oil so the biomass my current use from this is pretty good as we can see here they have done a good job on separating the biomass out of hemp fiber and hemp seeds all the material remaining in this pack are in high quality they contains a lot of a hemp flour and and leaf which has pretty high CBD contents especially don't want any hemp seeds in your bio mast the hemp seeds contain seed oil which has no CBD in it if you process a bag of biomass that has too much hemp seed in it then you and I was getting a CBD distillates that looks like clear and golden but has very low Sabri concentration in that case that punch that bottle of CBD oil will not be selling an very good price let's take a look at our distillation units so before talking about this relation line we have to talk about how to polish and how to get your CBD crew ready for this relations so right here we are using a rotary evaporator to decarbonize our C bleaker oil so in here we have about 10 litres in this round a flask that we got a foreign extraction line and in here as you can see the liquids beneath the crude oil are yellow so because we were using heat transfer fluids in it instead of a using water by using the heat transfer fluid we can heat up this units 235 degree Celsius which will remove a little bit of ethanol out of it and so decarbonize it nicely so here is our [Music] white film distillation units and our left is crystallizer so we can after we have disciplines we can transform the disciplines into CDP the isolates in in this units so this is not a usual reactor that you see we have a future on the bottom which is the white one yes you can see on the bottom so that one will be filtered out CPD isolates out of the matter liquids the matter its click liquids will be drink from the bottom and CBD isolates will be remain on the future as you can see here here's the drain so once your once you got your CBD isolates by lowing the chlorine temperature you can open a vow and drain the mother liquids out of it okay let's talk about how this were filmed this laser machine work so this machine will help us to transfer our crude oil into good and clear disciplines so we just finished the first runs of of coroico usually we run the crude oil through this machine to time so this is the feeding tank right here so this machine separates different components by using the boiling temperature differences for example your view your terpene and your CBD oil all have different type of boning temperatures also there is some sugar and there's some small particle in or crude oil as well and those things doesn't boil at all so those can be separated by using this machine as well so we just finished our first runs on the floor we have two buckets the buckets on the left is the polished crude oil the buckets on the right is the the terpenes and and also some crow fields so this machine's and everything they have a lot lower boiling temperature will we both will come out and falling into the right buckets all the things that have a higher temperature or four downs to the left pockets so in the first round we set the main body temperature the main distillation body temperature into a temperature that the terpenes and curfew will keep boiling well the CBD will not boil so we have we will also catch all some of the eighth notes in the system so in here we have two Co traps the left cold trap is negative thirty Seco trap the Reiko trap is negative 83 contract and as you can see that the negative eighty contra is we can filling the dry ice or liquid nitrogen in it to treat as well so here we have a vacuum gauge and we have a vacuum pump do stage where come from one floor the first one is turbo pump second one is the normal oil thing reckon pump so the color in the right pocket is look pretty greenish and the viscosity is very high which tells us that there is the terpene for sure and we're going to dump the left pocket back to the fitting tank and do a second runs so in the second runs the we're setting the temperature so that CBD will keep boiling well the others are not well others I mean the particles and the waste will not be boiling so we can collect CBD of the machines so right now we are running this machine further where we're running the crude oil for the second times so because you can see we are feeding the crude oil in its so the mercy is is keep running and we have the the waste coming out of from the left tube and which dripping into the buckets then this halfs and on the right we have dissidents so as we can see in temperature it's not I mean the color for the distillate is not so good because it we just start running the machine we haven't we haven't fine-tuned the machine yet so I'm going to do some fine-tuning to make sure that the color looks much much better after a few changes in temperature setting for this y film distillation units the CBD colors looks looks much much better than previously I just changed temperature setting on the the center coil for this units and also a little bit of vacuum as well make it look much better this units can output about 5 liters of distillate Spri hour and I can improve it a little bit more just changed heating heaters and Childress for this unit to upgrade it into a higher capacity so that this unit can run under be faster even he can even run about a liters per hour if you have the right heaters so that would be all the information now like a share today so we talked about distillation we talked about crystallization and my client is pretty happy about what he got today and here we have the CBD distillates that we have around today this civilities looks looks in a high viscosity but because it is hot after is cooled down to room temperature it should be close to solids so if you liked this video please give us a thumbs up and think about our subscription thank you very much have a good day bye bye", "7F-rOC4RUAA": "[Music] all right so we'll start with the ingredients main ingredient Betty Crocker milk chocolate brownie mix now this recipe calls for two eggs all right and then two ounces we're also gonna have someplace to put it all in makes it we're also gonna add fluent full spectrum cannabis oil concentrate now this dispensary it's one of my favorites see here this is THC 88.2 1:9 Wow and I see the name is battledore fluent they speak cannabis whenever I'm cooking this this normally is really hard to get out it's really concentrated so it always helps to put it in warm they could I normally just might crave a cup of hot water get it really nice and hot and just drop this bad boy in there for a good five minutes and come on up just like oil all right first things first you want to go ahead and preheat your oven to 350 degrees go ahead and spray your pan whoa whoa it's like that okay we have to read the hot water that's right hot in about five minutes and this time I decided to just put it in a little bowl put in the microwave for like about 10 seconds make sure you get time be careful getting that out of there it's very hot one way to tell that your product is ready is by looking at the little air bubbles you'll see that the air bowl will go up or down real fast all right so we have our concentrate and our vegetable oil we'll go ahead and dump this in there's 500 milligrams make some pretty potent brownies oh it smells it smells very good and you definitely want to let the oil cool down a little bit before you put it into the mix there's my eyes because you're putting eggs in there and you don't want to cook the eggs not yet one of the best things about coming with concentrate is it's essentially a oil and you can put it in anything anything can rise anything that use oil with you can mix it alright so now that we have our brownie mix inside the bowl we'll go ahead and get some eggs one that's two and asked for the recipe add three tablespoons of water now we have all this we'll go ahead and stir this or we'll give it one more mix ago we put it in there make sure it's all nicely evenly mixed because you don't want product that has a little bit here and a little bit there all right so he just makes us wrap around all right once you have everything makes well together should look like that nice and consistent you don't want to over beat it one of the advantages of using concentrate is that it already comes the carbonized so whenever you cook it it won't impact the THC in it whatsoever all right and we're about to go ahead and put this brownie mix into this pan and let the magic start all right now that we have everything here and in here all right we're all good to go all right so we'll just go ahead and get everything your ovens preheated to 350 we'll put it in here BAM all right now you should put it for 42 minutes if you're using a square pan like I am but just to be safe put it to 39 that's not a good time oh I think she's doing so it looks like it's sad 42 minutes right now see ain't it nice and cool now that we've allowed the brownies to cool now it's time to cut them up keep in mind that until we 500 milligrams of concentrate so what this means is that we'll divide it by how many pieces that we play [Music]", "JnE6kTqkX1Q": "hello iris Oh SOS air and today I'm gonna be showing you what I've been up to so you see the last video with the old stick worth now what to do with a stick work while a stick worth is getting stuck in the squeeze worth the squeeze worth is getting stuck in my mouth worth what I've done is I've put the RSO into precise measurements into me old squeezy petite RSI for days when you're feeling stressed anxiety just a little bit run down stick a bit of that underneath your tongue and it turn that frown up side down people are a so is the one I can't think of anything else I'd rather stick up my bum but seriously though people this is what it's about", "lZZobKohdN0": "hi guys extract craft here and today we're back for another educational video on how to do filtration of your alcohol-based tincture so first thing that we had done was we soaked our plant material for about five minutes in the freezer the idea what that was to eliminate as much of the chlorophyll and waxes and lipids of the plant material into our final extract so by doing that in a sub-zero temperature we're going to eliminate a very very large amount of that so what we're going to use today is a Buchner funnel or Buechner funnel these are available on extract craft comm and what this is going to do is we use paper filters that sit in the bottom of the ceramic funnel and we actually have a vacuum hose hooked up to the side of the flask now what this does is it will actually pull the tincture down through the paper filter and into the flask creating a much much cleaner and finer end product we actually will be using the vacuum port on the source turbo as our vacuum assist on our flask so first thing we need to do is we need to go ahead and wet down our paper filter this ensures that when you apply the vacuum the paper filter sucks to the bottom of the funnel in order to make sure nothing goes underneath the paper so as long as you get all the edges and everything else we just want to make sure we got all that then we can go ahead and apply our vacuum so we take our hose and we just kind of hold it over top of the vacuum port and then we can start our process and one thing you want to make sure you do is leave your vacuum valve just a little bit open to ensure that we're pulling vacuum through the whole time and the Machine doesn't stop so we can go ahead and start our process here and then we want to make sure that our filter paper sets down nicely to the bottom and then once we have that we can go ahead and begin to apply our tincture just like that the vacuum pulls the tincture right through and down into the flask now one thing I like to do is I like to make sure I do at least three passes through the filter paper just to ensure that we've caught as much of the fine particle waxes and lipids that we can and just like that it sucks it right down so we can go ahead and stop the process here and then what we're going to do is we're going to do a second and a third pass also okay so now what we are doing is we're going to go ahead and prepare our second pass through our filter paper so we go ahead and hook this up start the process and like like before we want to make sure the paper filter sucks down to the bottom before we start to apply the tincture [Music] okay and now we're done with this second pass so we'll do one more pass after this okay guys so now we're back to do the third pass through the Buechner funnel one thing I wanted you to keep in mind was with your paper filters they're typically going to come in a fast medium or slow feed what's important is to use the fast paper filter on the initial pass on your first pass and then after that once the alcohol has been cleaned up a little bit after that first pass then we can go ahead and use the slow feed and catch even more of that particle and those waxes and lipids so we go ahead and put our paper filter in and we are going to wet it down as always make sure that's good and wet before we get started and okay and now we're going to once again use the source as our vacuum assist at that we make sure that paper filter is sucked down nicely and then we begin pouring in the tank share [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so now we go ahead and stop the process and we can actually remove our funnel and everything but after three passes through the Buechner funnel you should have a nice beautiful golden colored extract tincture ready to evaporate down you can get all these things the Buechner funnels and the kits and everything on extract craft comm if you have any questions you can always reach out to us but don't forget to like this video subscribe to our page and leave your comments below and let us know what you thought thank you", "Knfl49kyAOQ": "hi it's Matt at Ruth's house studios and welcome to counter basics today we're gonna learn how to make cannabis infused a body lotion for moisturizing your skin and also for pain relief also very happy to announce that we have a new scripted comedy series coming up called higher beings please stick around to the end of the video and learn how you can support that project on IndieGoGo now let's get started here's what you need to make cannabis infused body lotion you need a quarter cup of cannabis infused cocoa butter 1/4 cup of shea butter 1/4 cup of coconut oil 1/4 cup of light oils such as light olive oil and you also need 10 to 20 drops of essential oils for flavoring such as lemon oil mint tea tree oil eucalyptus you can also use some infused coconut oil and place of the cocoa butter in this recipe and then you could also use oil that's been infused with the herbal infuser and you can save $30 on the air blown fuse with a code ruffhouse at herbal infuser calm now let's talk a little about how you can infuse the actual cocoa butter now we've done this recipe a couple of times recently so but I'm gonna go over it real briefly again but basically you grind your cannabis and in this case you don't actually have to decarbonize effects it's time for the other cannabinoids that are in the cannabis and you do not have to actually activate this and you can do some research to find which level of activation you might need to relieve the certain type of pain that you have too but for this case you don't actually have to decarboxylate or activate your cannabis and then you're going to infuse the oil for about one to two hours and when you're done the cocoa butter is going to be a lot darker and if you let it harden it'll harden back up and it melts very easily on your skin temperatures enough to melt it and you can see there it's it's very slick oil and it's I got a lot of moisturizing value for your skin so that's where we're going to be using for a basis for our oil so whether that's melted or not if you just made it and it still melted you you don't really need to melt it anymore but we're gonna go ahead and put that in a heat safe dish that you can put into a double boiler you could use like a canning jar there and we're not gonna actually boil the water we're just barely keeping it just under the it's gonna board just with a little bubble start to go and like I said you could also use cannabis infused coconut oil if you would rather use that instead of infusing the cocoa butter so it's up to you which one of those you infuse or you could infuse both if you want a really really strong but it being so this is not something edible it probably is a waste to try to make it too strong because you're not really going for the THC and you might also use a strong CBD strain or another kind of strain for this depending on your needs for this kind of lotion ok we're also going to take the shea butter and we're taking the other light oil that we're using in this case we're using olive oil a light olive oil and we're combining all of the other ingredients except for the essential oils into our double boiler or into our heat proof dish inside of a hot water bath until it's all melted and once it's all melted and combined you can take that and switch it into a mixing bowl it's gonna be large enough to use a hand and executed and then at that point you can also as the oil is cooling and cooled off a little bit you can add in your essential oils and in this case it's up to you if you add any oils because you could just leave it as it is and it'll have a slightly chocolaty smell because of the cocoa butter but this part is definitely up to your preferences and also for what you use you're using it for if you're using it as an everyday moisturizer you probably don't want to make it very strong smelling or it's gonna overpower your perfume or cologne or whatever or just be overpowering in general but if you're making it for medicinal purposes you might use a lot of mint or eucalyptus or the things that would give it that minty or that medicinal feel and now you're going to put it in the refrigerator for just a few minutes until the bowl gets cold or whatever and you start to see that it's just beginning to thicken a little bit so just when the the viscosity starts to thicken some and that's when you're gonna do this step here and that is to take your hand mixer on high and just keep mixing and mixing as you're whipping in air it's gonna turn lighter and lighter and you do that for three or four minutes until it quits turning lighter and by that time it'll be finished and then you put it back in the refrigerator to harden and then at that point you could also pour it into a containers because it'd be a lot easier while it's still a liquid and then after it hardens and sets in refrigerator you bring it out of the refrigerator at at room temperature it becomes a very soft subtle lotion that you can rub into your skin very easily it really has no real expiration date as long as you keep it sealed keep it out of the light and it's great for pain relief as well it helped me with my psoriasis on the bottom of my foot with a moisture so check that out also check out higher beings this is a new project I'm really excited about and if you're really interested you could help us support that by checking out Andy gogo I'll put links in the description and on the screen here so please check that out it's a new scripted comedy series that we're looking forward to trying out here at Roth house Studios but we need your help I

bee [Music] good okay so take the material the trimming flower and then ever clear and put it in the freezer to get both nice and cold place them in there overnight now i poured the liquor over top of the alcohol my dumb ass forgot to record it but i basically pressed all the flour and trimmed down uh about halfway in the jar and then i just just enough ever clear to pour over top of the liquid and i just constantly shook it for 20 minutes taking breaks every so often but that'll get you where you want to be then you want to strain it so i took a strainer funnel and a coffee filter and basically strain the liquid through now at this point this is kind of the tincture part the uh what green dragon or hot bath method where you cook it in a double boiler you see i got quite a bit from this one i think overall i got about 18 20 ounces or so and uh poured that into the pan yeah cook that for 30 minutes uh now here's my pot i feel this about 60 of the way full just let it get to a nice low boil [Music] now it's the double boiler part now i wanted to show you this this is what the tincture part looked like uh it's very liquidy now for the green dragon tincture you basically cook this down for about 30 minutes i went a little bit further trying to make the rick simpson oil the rso and uh cook this for about i'd say about two and a half hours or so just trying to show the uh progression of this a little bit on the inside you want it to bubble but you don't want to do out of control you want to keep the heat relatively easy okay that's my next addition of the tincture was still draining yeah that's the remaining bit of the tincture that strained out once i switched jars now here here i want to show you a little bit of bubbling you want it to bubble with you don't want it to get aggressive don't want to destroy the thc or the little terrapins that are left in there i guess that's the point of the double boiler now you see this is kind of thickening up a little bit but still very very liquidy this is probably about the 45 minute mark or so yeah this is about the time you're supposed to watch it they say about the last 10 minutes it's a real quick conversion from uh liquid to the actual oil okay you can still see it bubbling going away the whole [ __ ] kitchen smells like uh corn corn liquor uh from cooking this off with the everclear oh my goodness it stay for about a day or two so yeah i just wanted to kind of go in the little bubbles on the ridges this is a nice little boil going and then i turned my back and boom ashore holy [ __ ] get that [ __ ] up it turned on me it got real thick real quick that's my little capsule i wanted to scoot everything it's just a lip balm uh holder i think carmex maybe you excluded all that in there then yeah it kind of got messy once i got it trying to get all the remaining stuff just wanted to see the thickness and consistency of it now at this point they say put it in the oven for about uh 10 to 20 minutes at 200 degrees to kind of get the last little bit of moisture out but because i put in this plastic my dumb ass couldn't so i had to air dry it out for about two days and uh yeah now this is about 30 minutes after i put it in there you can see a lot of the bubbles rising to the top trying to get out of there thickening up so at this point it's ready to be dabbed ingested the oil is ready so like i like to put it on blunt right now smoke a little bit eat a little bit thanks for watching i'll let you go out to the smoking and the bubbles of the hash oil burning away enjoy fellow cannabis", "pG34NT3bw60": "what's up guys it's your girl a Paris here and as you can see by the title down below I'm gonna be telling you what cannabis oil has done to my dry brittle disgustingly cracky skin especially with Canadian weather we get like minus 13 degrees up in here it's super super cold and my dry skin is dry in the summer winter fall spring all season long but wintertime my skin is crazy crazy dry so I always look for new products that can help me add moisture back into my skin during these dry winter months so I've been using cannabis oil aka weed oil aka marijuana oil spread past two weeks now and I just want you guys I want to tell you guys all the dramatic changes that I've seen with my skin and before I even continue I am NOT sponsored by this brand I'm not getting paid to do this video this is all like I bought this product with my money nobody said this to me for free this is for real my dead ass feelings about cannabis oil and the benefits that it does for my super dry skin okay like anyone watching this if you think of dry skin you really don't you don't mean my dry skin is redonkulous okay my face be ashy for no reason and no warning no heads-up no nothing it's just dry it's dry and if your returning viewer of my beauty channel Slade parents this one right here you guys know that I rant and raved about how much I love this right here this is the Tony moly hundred hour cream and this stuff is amazing for my skin like I have no complaints about it but I feel like it works best when I'm going to bed because then when I wake up my skin still hasn't wish'd you're in it because it is a hundred hour cream so it's moisturizing my skin for a literally a hundred hours it feels like so I'm not knocking this whatsoever I just personally in my skin regimen I like to use this before I go to sleep and when I wake up sometimes if I forget to put it on before I go to bed now I love this stuff but it's a cream and I am NOT hugest is hugest a word I don't know I'm not a huge fan of face creams I tried this one out because well I bought it because it said maschino and it's like really cute packaging but I bought this one because I wanted it to like just sit on my vanity look cuter whatever and then one day I was like let me just try it and they loved it but normally I use face oils for everything because my skin is super dry and oil absorbs better into my skin rather than creams although like I said before this cream is amazing but I'm the type of girl that I like to try new things I get bored of products really easily I like to try new methods of things like if I have a cream I want to try the oil if I boil or try and miss like that's just who I am I like to mix things around until I find like something that I'm completely in love with and I want to repurchase for the rest of my life and I think I may have found it in this cannabis oil once again not sponsored I went to Sephora and I was looking through a bunch of cannabis oils that I thought would match my skin and this is the one that I just liked the most like the description of it was very appealing to my skin type because my skin type maybe even dry my skin type is action you know I mean and I said it adds moisture to your skin it has omega-3 fatty acids in it actually omega-3 six and nine fatty acids in it it's organic there's just a lot of beneficial ingredients in this product that made me feel like this is the one that I want to try rather than because there are a lot of other cannabis oils out there that do the same thing but this one just appeal to me a little bit more so I decided to pick this one up for around 48 to 60 dollars something like that and it is the before emerald cannabis sativa have deep moisture glow oil and as you guys can see I'm glowing it's not to believe that I have super dry skin I'm glowing hey so even though it's cannabis oil it's actually made from the hemp of cannabis which does not give you like a THC like you're not gonna get hot you ain't gonna put this on your face and be high as a kite you ain't gonna feel no type of psychedelic effect this is purely the beneficial ingredients for your skin from cannabis that is in this bottle here it's in a beautiful green color as you can see here have to do this because anyone who uses face oils often knows that this is important because if I do this and it's not moving as fast as this is and it's going a little bit slow and muggy that means that it's gonna take forever to absorb in your skin you know what I'm saying it's like a thick consistency you don't like it that's well me anyways firstly I don't like thick consistencies when it comes to well it has to move like water when it moves like water you just know that it's gonna absorb to your skin really quickly so it comes with this dropper applicator and let me just show you really quickly gonna do three drops I want to show you guys how quickly this absorbs into your skin first of all look at it drip look at that it's like water again my face oil lovers understand why I have to show that but if I rub it in for you guys you're gonna see how quickly it absorbs into my skin look at that quick and it's not sticky at all there's no type of stickiness whatsoever it's literally fast absorbing and leaves your skin looking like silk let's do a comparison of this dry ass hand and the ones that I just put the whale on oiled hand regular hand do you guys see that now you know camera trick guys realized look at that crazy and I know a lot of people are curious about the smell it doesn't smell like weed it smells very um fresh it's very smells like lavender almost like it's a very fresh floral scent and the instructions actually tells you to breathe heavily in to help you relax and I truly believe that when I put this oil on and I breathe in I feel like a very relaxing feeling throughout my body not like I'm high but like I'm at a spa and I'm breathing in incense or something it's just a very relaxing calming feeling it's really really nice it feels luxurious and for the money and the way it makes my skin look it's worth it's worth every penny so after using this oil for the past two weeks I have to say I will never go to another face oil ever for the rest of my life and I know I've only been using it for two weeks but within two weeks I can always tell if I like a product because normally if I try a skin product and I've never tried it before I will break out within the next 48 hours I haven't broken out my skin is gleaming it's an amazing base for your makeup before your primer I use this as my moisturizer before my primer it's amazing my skin complexion has been so much more clear and it's like every day that I use it as I wake up I see my skin getting so much more healthier and I haven't changed anything in my skin routine except for this so this is the answer this is the reason why my skin is gleaming the way it's gleaming glowing the way it's glowing look in the way it's looking you know I'm saying I just have to share it with you guys and let you guys know how amazing this product is again not sponsored so you can pick this up at Sephora or you can pick it up at the herbivore website as well I believe fun fact I wanted to bring this to New York with me but I was scared that I was gonna get in trouble cuz it said cannabis sativa on it but I don't think I would have back trouble but yeah the pros of this product is it is not sticky whatsoever it's quickly absorbed into your skin it definitely moisturizes your skin for hours on end it has a relaxing soothing scent to it that really like makes you just feel very calm it has evened out my skin tone you get a good amount of product for the amount of money that you pay and you literally look like you're glowing hello the cons about this product I honestly cannot find not even one corner whatsoever I was sitting here I was thinking I was trying to like figure out what could I possibly say because there has to be something wrong with the product nothing the scent is amazing the dropper is amazing the size is perfect like everything is great I have nothing bad to say about this product whatsoever so if you have super dry brittle skin I would definitely recommend you try out the herbivore emerald cannabis teeth I have deep moisture glow oil at your local Sephora you could always go to Sephora just in case you guys didn't know you could always go to Sephora and ask them for a sample of this they'll give it to you in a little container try it out for about three days you're gonna see a huge difference and

kind of skin type you have let me know if you've even heard of this product or even knew that you could put cannabis oil on your skin if you have dry skin everybody sure works for like combination skin as well I wouldn't recommend for oily although you do need oil for oily skin I feel like this has a little bit too much too many oils are in this they have omega fatty acids they have a whole bunch of different whales than they I feel like there's too much oil in this for someone with Whaley skin what combination you should be okay so definitely check out the spore website to see if this matches your skin type let me know in the comment section down below but make sure you find me on Saturn in Israel all that doesn't description box down below for your convenience thank you guys so much for watch this video I'll see you in the next one poodels", "5ndyQLqo3Y4": "what's happening party people we're here and I want to beep so odd as it sounds sounds weird coming out of my mouth usually it's I want to dad I want a bong hit one babe all of our faith cartridges are like dunzo check this out they're like it looks like there's something inside but there's nothing inside these I mean I could probably get like little baby hits but they're done I've been sucking on them dry bro like all of them we are out so the revival vape actually comes with empty hive cartridges you guys can see here and you just pop it open take this little thingy off and you can just pour your concentrates in there man simple as that so we're gonna take this syringe of beta my cream and we're gonna make a little vape syringe or vape cartridge with the syringe this is from nectar stick interesting people we see them at all the events they're always there pitching their stuff they sell these full grams in this container for $40 at the events it's probably gonna run you 50 or 60 out of dispensary but this one specifically normally they have like kind of ap flavors like strawberry cough and mango passion this and whatever I asked the guy what do you have for pain and it gave me this it's a ante what does it say pain relief sedative now actually that's upside down sorry guys now I actually hit these people up on Instagram because I was at the event you know I didn't necessarily get the proper explanation of the product you know it wasn't really the kind of place that you sit and you [ __ ] talk science and chemistry about cannabis and [ __ ] but I instagrammed them when I was like hey man I bought your Batum mersin I did I call it Mike Green earlier sorry mersin I bought your beta Mersin and I was curious I mean is this made with cannabis does this contain THC or CBD you know give me some give me some info about this all I have is the package and the package isn't too descriptive either zero PPM's solvent free ultra refined nothing doesn't tell you like percentages doesn't tell you anything so I'm curious like is this a pure I guess I should have explained it if you guys don't know with what beta mercian is I check it out on wiki because that's basically how I learned what it is it beta mercian is basically a component in cannabis it's like a terpenoid it's one of the things that are a part of the we'd like THC CBD CBN THC a all of those get you high and then there are actually compounds that give you flavor like limonene citrus scene or something lemons this is the citrus one hash machine there are a couple of different flavor compounds and these compounds are found in everything I could find citrus or limonene in limes I can find that in oranges I can extract it from those you know and it's also found in cannabis that's why some weed smells like oranges some weed smells like smoke it's are like smoke because you've spoken it some weed smells like like dirt and like earth you know like it literally has the same chemicals they're in those other things so this is one of those chemicals and if you smoke this chemical by itself or not smoke it but you know consume it it's supposed to make you feel relaxed sedative it's supposed to make you sleepy it's supposed to be a good anti and Kalama tori it's it's got a bunch of qualities you can read them all on the on the wiki so I got this and I was like man this should be excellent for medicating and then I had a realization where I was like isn't this the same [ __ ] that they have in mangoes that everybody says gets you higher if you smoke it or if you consume it so if I'm smoking like a really low grade weed or even if I just want to get higher supposedly if I eat a mango it's high in the Mersin and that is what gives me like a bigger high so I was like man this would be excellent for a cush Buster's or something where I'm like [ __ ] eating mangoes I'm literally gonna go to a scientist have him extract the Mersin give it to me straight up and I'll test it for you guys and I'll be like I'm gonna smoke a gram of this shitty weed and then take a hit of the mercy and and see if it helps then I'm gonna take a hit of the top shelf with the Mersin and see if that improves the hit as well and then do like control test like this is awesome so we're just gonna stick this in here like a mad scientist and just fill it up I want to I use it up I use half of this I want to leave some for dabbing but or just see if it even works let's just use less let's see if it even works you don't want to put all of your nugs in one basket you know what I'm saying I lost a little stopper there's like a little shirt oh there it is it's so tiny put the stopper in I guess I think I went the other way whoops got it all weedy so cool we do that and we're good to go let's try it out I've been smoking it I took it home you guys and I was like let's get [ __ ] up like we went to the event and it was like a marijuana edible sesh and if you guys watched the the podcast if you guys haven't seen it it's the podcast from the weekend of like May 14th May 15th like that and we talked about how we got trapped in the elevator we almost died going to like a weed event and if I get to the weed event and I don't even get to smoke that much or like get that high so I came home and I was like man I'm gonna take a huge hit and I literally smoked like a fifth of it at once and it was a immense hit it was super clean super flavorful particularly for the size usually you take a huge dab of something and it's really rough like it just it kills your lungs it's like it leaves you wheezing but it was super clean and a him Ian waves bro it was like at first like you kind of you feel a little bit after the initial hit but it doesn't like hit you and then like a couple minutes later you start you feel like almost like a wave hit you and like you feel like more buzzing more like higher and more relaxed and then like five minutes later boom like another wave a couple minutes later like another wave and eventually like after 15-20 minutes I was like oh gone I was just like laying in the couch like dunzo really nice I mean I smoked the point point to grammar but let's try it out I'll see how if it works cross your fingers for me I hate wasting weed drum roll please nothing I have to take the thingy out these thingies have the thingy the cartridges have the little stopper so I don't necessarily have to take the stopper out and it's hot I can feel it at the base it's just not it's not doing anything I'm glad I didn't put more one more time get in there get in there I think it's just so thick that it's having a hard time vaping it we're getting there we're getting there has a really good flavor to it it tastes it tastes very similar to the pickled monkey cartridges that we received I think they're using like a similar solvent free filler pretty sure now it's ripping brah brah it's ripping oh yeah it's pretty good it's pretty good I cannot tell you guys if it has THC or not in it I I can't offer the life let me tell you I would like to tell you that it doesn't and that I am smoking a pure beta Mersin and that this is simply the the effect of that because it almost feels a little different from a high when I take a big hit of this and I take a big hit of weed the high sit separately from each other if you know what I'm saying like one of them I like I know is like weed and on the other once it's like distantly in the back affectingly me very differently I don't know I wish they would get back to me on Instagram yo I hate when companies are like secretive about their process and like the products that they're giving you I'm literally [ __ ] smoking this and putting it in my lungs how about you [ __ ] tell me what's in this bro like people who make food have to literally list ingredients legally and that people who have these [ __ ] smokeable products don't even have to [ __ ] lab test it or anything it's crazy it was like a graphic the other day going around a mean and it was a I don't know the character name he's like a famous like character actor he has a curly hair he's like blonde and it's like um you have you notice you ever noticed how there's no more powdery mildew anymore ever since everybody to learn how to make concentrates and it was like like that [ __ ] like man you never know what you're putting into your lungs anymore you know like they could just take any weed they want run it and it just looks golden and good you know and unless it actually gets tested by a lab or something I'm not gonna know if it's safe or not to smoke so I hate when companies are like [ __ ] shady about [ __ ] like [ __ ] tell me bro like what the [ __ ] like I'm gonna go steal your process and whatever like as if there are like 10 other companies do right now how about you just be honest with your consumer base and let them know what they're literally smoking bro what strain is in this what am i even smoking is this even weed these are my questions I think they're fair I don't know but it's pretty far I ask these questions I semi complain but also smoke it also smoking I purposely did this one just so that I know I knew that I wouldn't necessarily waste the weed as much because I feel like big cartridges are more efficient than like dabbing like when you dab you just some of it burns away maybe it's too high temp of a dab like you're literally electronically controlling the temperature with the vaporizer so I feel like it's more efficient and what was my point with that right I wanted a lot of smoke because I'm actually doing a product shoot over there and I'm actually doing shots where like there's products all laid out and then I blow smoke and like smoke comes into the frame and like you know [ __ ] high production [ __ ] and it's actually been really hard to make like volumous smoke I literally that's why I have the illa Delft over here I was gonna pack a bomb hit for the shoot because I've tried vaping I've tried using is it here I tried using the dryer vape and I even tried taking a DAB and unless I took like a huge dab I couldn't get a significant volume of smoke so like look impressive enough on the screen so I have to pack some flowers bro into the old illy and start ripping I thought this would be it but it makes clouds but now I mean look at the size difference I mean if this made clouds this big I'd be scared like what is in this what witchcraft did they like make this with some make it do that but still pretty fire I'm gonna go get the weed pack up a bowl and I'll see you guys next time on the daily grind thank you guys for joining me and let me know what you guys are smoking on in the comments man you guys rocking a vape pen vape cartridge have you ever refilled one of these before do you make your own eliquid I think a couple of followers have mentioned in the past that they do their own like pg/vg mix or some [ __ ] like let me know in the comments I am really new to the whole vaping world so I am very curious to hear what people's personal preferences are particularly after they've had a consistent career token it up contouring on the vape level you know what I'm saying I'll see you guys next time stay regularly", "7fK_wumSrzY": "some of you may be wondering how to take your rso your rso comes a little syringe like this but how do you take it a really good way that i think is awesome is if you get some peanut butter crackers like these these are really awesome um anything with peanut butter is gonna be good in my opinion and then when you say a rice size amount it's gonna be something like hopefully it doesn't squirt out like crazy and yeah about like that put it on the top and then eat it all right so it's very good for a lot of things um if you have something that's chronic um you know chronic condition that marijuana helps with i would suggest rso it's a concentrated of all form cannabinoids and turps and and everything in the marijuana plant and yeah it's been known to help to cure cancers and uh it's good for a lot of things so rso also known as rick simpson oil you know rick simpson is the one who developed it and this has been an oklahoma cannabis educational minute see you later", "oSnazAg8FWs": "[Music] what's up hot pizza sugar pop mountain for 20 and I am bad for another episode even though you can't see me today pop peach just like any other week I'm always excited to come back and do another fun episode so my team has gotten together and we've come up with a new episode and guys this one is pretty creative this one is how to make weed moon rocks you heard me pop peeps we're making moon rocks you know you heard everybody in the rap game talking about moon rocks what is moon rocks believe it or not pie peeps pop mom I've never had moon rocks so I think this is probably the second episode if you hurt me last week or a couple weeks ago I mentioned there was something else that I hadn't done before a particular brand I hadn't had I'm not gonna tell you but you should have been watching now you've learned something else pop mom has not had any moon rocks so for all my pop peeps that are new to the show and maybe just you know my regular pop peeps you follow me you may not know what moon rocks are there are rumors that the dispensary Starbuzz 761st concocted them with legendary West Coast rapper corrupt he popularized it and made it popular and it became corrupt moon rocks a version of his trademark version of corrupt moon rocks they are saying that historically they use Girl Scout cookies and you dip it in hash oil with key so if you go to Leafly that calm they'll give you just a little bit of history to rumor history it'll give you some other stuff about how strong moon rocks is but it's pop on 4/20 pop fans I just want to make sure you had a little bit of history there's reasons why people take moon rocks they're very heavily it concentrates super buzz I know a lot of people in a medical community that I know love moon rocks because it takes that pain away once you smoke them use them however it really hits the the place you wanted to hit as far as concentrate on it it really gives you any got advice about a turn so let's get into how to make moonrocks Pat peeps y'all know I love everything simple so when we was doing this video I had to make it very simple for you guys and literally you only need three things and I'm serious my peeps just three things so today we're going to be using will be called in the industry is to concentrate it's a dissonant oil so this is a 0.5 this one in particular shout out to essence dispensary right here in Las Vegas Nevada on the strip they got this to me and just to let you see pop peeps this is the packaging this is the lucid distilled oil so you do need some type of the steel or hash oil for this recipe the next thing that you're going to need is some bud this one in particular I think I'm using biology to be honest with you this one I believe is tested at about 19 percent THC this is fire OG I had it in my mason jar I believe I was gonna cook with it or do something else but we're gonna make it so we had that the next item we have is basically this is nothing but another concentrate it's called kief all of you all have it if you ever grind wheat up in your grinders you have keeping that third chamber and final chamber it's all the trichomes that come off of the but when you're grinding it and all of that so those are simply the three things you need to make the moon rocks today we're gonna keep it simple because I wanted to do something that you all can perform at home and have fun with moon rocks are fun I'm gonna make this one and I'm gonna try to save it but I doubt it but it's nice to do moon rocks holidays birthdays if you're in a lot of pain so let's get started one of the thing pop peeps that you might need just simply some tongs whatever you got pick it up cuz you're gonna have to be able to roll some of this around so you'll see how we're going to use it pop peeps I love this syringe if you're dealing with any discipline oils I'm sure they come other ways with the syringe is a lot more easier because you can kind of like just dab it all over it's sort of like you know so basically we're just gonna take this and I'm gonna sit it down and I'm just gonna kind of run all of my dissolute oil or if you got hash or you know a lot of hash at makers out there and then then I'm just gonna drizzle and as you can see this is gonna be super sticky and we want that because this actual discipline is gonna have it's gonna have Terps in it so this is where I'm gonna come and use these little tongues so I can bring it up to the camera and I think these might be a little too big okay all right so I'm just gonna keep this oil going around as you can see it will glob up on you so just kind of try peeps try to do this the best way you can it's gonna get a little messy and that's okay that's what the tongues are fourth and as you can see I'm trying to do it and do my camera the tongues are like a little bit in the way but nonetheless we don't do this okay so got all that on it and what you want to do is make sure it's on there it's tacky which it is I see I got a little bit of oil here I'm trying to scoop it up and put it on it we want all of that on there and then can we see that I have to oil on there it's really sticky can we see all that stickiness on it so I'm gonna hurry up and get ready to roll it into Keith so that's what we're gonna do see the oil a hash or whatever you use it you're gonna be able to roll this around and a Keith oil that stuck with it and if you have any oil left you can just like totally put that on top sorry pop beeps this is real life stuff and see how that just covers that because of that dissonant wheel or your hash oil is gonna let it just stick to that and I just want to make sure it gets all that Keith and pop beeps if you have a another way that you made move rocks definitely make sure you hit me up we're gonna have a conversation about this young I'm doing this for the first time my team shout out to them coming up with new recipes with a summer to keep you pop peeps interested and keep liking and subscribing but we're trying new things around here trying to keep you guys entertained we know we all staying at home right now I think that looks great I can't believe I just made a moon rock with my papi this is really legendary seriously no but you guys can see my camera guy he's pretty sharp too let me bring that over so far how's that looking in the camera see that the nice thickness and you want to use pop keeps a nice bud that's sturdy you don't want something that's flimsy once again shout out to essence we're getting this oil in and Keith to me and this Lucid oil is perfect for this so if you have any discipline oil use it if you have any cash oil use it it'll work perfectly fine so five peeps as you can see I'm left with a messy needle and one moon rock my peeps this is how simply that was literally a three-step process I don't think I've done anything that's simple but now the next part to this is letting it dry so pop peeps this is gonna dry for a few days and because of editing and video I'm gonna come back at this dry and then I'm gonna show you how to smoke a moon rock all right pop peeps see you when it dries", "iSXoNoOfWHE": "Hey good morning happy cooking clubs so today I'm going to show you how to make the amazing spiritual Rick Simpson oil now this oil has helped me in many many ways for sleeping for pain I cannot tell you enough how amazing this oil is and you can make it at home I found that in the stores they're selling it like five hundred dollars for a little jar like this and really if you make it at home you plant your own it's your own energy is your own everything so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to use the cleanest possible cookware in the market to make this so it's clean it's gonna go on your body so you make sure that you use at least I'm using a rice cooker mp5 this is actually the multi-purpose five cooker from sell and master is it's got a timer in there and it's also the cleanest metal this is like 3/16 TI so non corrosive non reactive and that's why I like using it because whatever taste is in there the whole thing goes out so very simple to do how we're gonna do this Rick Simpson oil you're gonna need a fan okay I already set up my fan over there on that side that's going to blow that way you never want to do this inside your home why because we're gonna be using isopropyl alcohol and that is very flammable and very toxic especially if you're using you never want to use a gas stove because as the fumes are flying guess what happens then you know the eventually I probably will catch on fire so you do never ever ever do not ever use a gas stove and so I'm gonna use like I say a cellar master multipurpose v cooker and I'm gonna use also since this is also 3/16 II I another saw my master 3/4 I'm gonna first take the herb and it's best if you see the bottom down there okay I'm going to show you what to do so this is like a very very simple way of doing it and also the best part about it is that it's very healing you absolutely will love it so let's begin what to do with the herb now the older the herb the better it is to see if I can turn this around hopefully and vision is locked rotate okay so alright so let's see here if you can see this part a pan on the top here so the first thing you want to do is you want to take the herb okay so this it's really nice and the older it is the better it is because that means that you will have more THC a and more CBD and so I know that the world is crazy right now selling CBD but I challenge you for you to go look the ingredients and you will find that it's not and besides you want to get the whole plant that just part of the plant so this an example of how I collected the flowers okay and I barely even trim trim them I only took the big water leaves and then I dried it so once you dry it okay it's ready to use you've never want to use this oil you never want to make the oil with fresh any other fresh lead so what I'll do is I'm gonna most important thing is you need to take the big twigs like the big ones okay like big things like this the only reason why you want to do that is because otherwise you will end up with a lot of twigs in it and when you are sifting through it nut milk bag or a painter's bag what's gonna happen the little twigs are gonna rip the bag and so the idea is for you to crush this I'm gonna do a little bit just half of it so you can see it's already have the oil and I already have the parts so of course I'm tripling the amount of herbs that I'm using but for our purpose here today I want you to see is how powdery I can get it with just my hands so let's get back down here so you can see what I'm doing so you take the herb and just break it up completely okay big big twigs take them out you just strip the bud off of the off of the twig or the root I guess the branches okay there's many ways to communicate here okay so take absolutely everything make sure that you know if you have your your herb for a long time make sure that there's no mold if you'd sure if you dried it properly you shouldn't ever have any mold and you can learn here also how to have to grow it and how to and have to dry it as well properly okay you'll have a chance through this channel to learn all of that because I'm a big proponent that we gotta take care of our own health nobody will suggest us so we have to be our own medicine man and medicine woman you know to really take care of our own affairs otherwise we're always gonna be relying on someone else and wind up someone else no longer there what are you gonna do you're gonna fall down and do nothing do something you know pain is not the way to to live okay so now that this is all like powder almost okay so now the next step is to to bring some isopropyl alcohol I'm using 91% you can buy this at any of the of the you can get this at any of the of the pharmacies okay so the idea is for you to wash the herb as much as possible okay so we're we're stripping that taut the trichomes from the herb itself okay so clean it up hey how you doing I didn't want to incriminate you so don't go into my video hahaha so anyway so the idea is to take the trichomes and the trichome is where the you will find the medicine okay so anything that looks like a little crystal like a little star that is the that is the medicine so I'm going to show you briefly how to sifting through in that milk bag so the idea is to spend about five minutes just like washing the herb all over me so wash the herb and we're gonna use at least two of these or two-and-a-half but usually two of these is is perfect okay so the next thing is if you want to take it it's there and then I can call you later or you can just watch me do it you okay perfect okay so what I'm doing is I'm I'm removing some of this for now because I want to make sure that I'm taking the least possible to go in the bag and so first we're gonna strain it in a cloth to get rid of some of the organic matter so example over there in the kitchen a nut milk bag like a painter's bag kind of like this not like this but it's a little bit it's an it's in the sink if you can grate it that's great so you're gonna need two kinds okay number one you're gonna need a one that has a little bit more holes and then you're gonna need the other one that is like really hard to get through why I tell you why because I I've used it I've used two ways I used only the other one that is more like a net and that one will will sift through a lot of a lot of the plant matter still but you don't want that because if you if you if you put the plant matter it's gonna be really hard and you won't be able to get the oil out of that so get something like this first already made a batch that's why it's looking a little bit cleaner so get something like this this is kind of like a nut milk bag but you can get it you can get something like this at a like like a like a painter's bag also at any of the Home Depot or something like that okay turn it inside out why do you want to do that inside out because you don't want any of the herb to or any of the trichomes to end up so first wash let's move you back down here okay first batch first wash okay and then I squeeze it out and out this batch so now I'm going to return this back to this bowl with the with the other one that I pulled out into this I'm going to add a little bit more more of the alcohol so I can wash the rest this is good for a three to five washes Rick Simpson says and I've noticed that once it comes out not so green that's time to stop but so then I'll take this little cloth again I use it inside out okay and then I'm gonna take my multi-purpose our master five board cooker the best to make it in this is the cleanest and the easiest and then you're gonna take this you can even use a pillowcase an old one but I bought this thing this is actually a little bag that is for keeping parsley keeper but I turn it inside out and I make my medicine in there so now I'm gonna take this that I already pass through the other bag and I'm gonna shake it good because sometimes there's plum matter there and then just put it through there too now this will further take away any extra little leaves okay so if I see little leaves in there if I see any sediment of the trichomes I take it right out okay and so you wash it one more time if you notice they'll be sediment here and I know for those of you who like to get the chill of being high you know this is probably you know what would be good for you which I had to make something that will take away the inflammation and the pain and it still give you a little bit of a buzz but not so much and so okay so then we watch the next the next batch we wash it again and we do exactly the same production okay first of the nut milk bag okay to let in some of the trichomes just at least strip them out of the herbs okay so about five minutes I'm not gonna cook this one yet because I'm gonna show you the cooked product can you do me a favor and see if you can get a 5 quart from the bottom shelf in my kitchen over there they're right next to the fresh my pots and pans five four four four seven four doesn't matter anything you can find so I have somebody that's helping otherwise I'd be disappearing from you okay so if you notice I'm gonna do the same thing I'm gonna pull out most of the plant matter with my hand so that way I'm not putting it through the I'm not putting it through the nut milk bag so the least matter that I have there the less chances to grow it through okay and so now we're gonna use this one first okay then that build bag or the painters bag whatever you want to call it maybe new suppose you use for the same thing okay again do it on the do it on the inside out of the bag so that way we don't have too much my matter and by the way since I'm going through I'm going to strain this on you I don't want any little I want this to be clean through the bowl so put it through there you got green matter no seven foot okay and that's it now that we strain through here I'm done with this because I can see the water then we're going to use this little tree fort here and I'm going to strain through here a second time and you see the bag has little bits of a plant matter I don't want that so I have to I'm gonna have to do one more time so it's good to have two bags normally I have two bags but I can't find my other one two bags of these so and then I put clean gloves on the last okay trying to move this here so it's clean see how they had little bits of a plant and there you don't want that in the oil because it'll make your oil super bitter okay so take and put some really clean gloves this time and if possible now so this is I already gone through to two steps of sifting no plant matter on the inside make sure you don't need to wash it this is very very sticky in fact after you make the medicine what you want to make sure is you clean it up with coconut oil or alcohol and I will come out because a lot of the trichomes will be stuck in the stainless steel that's why it's so important to use the clean as clean as possible to do this clean its cookware possible okay so so now I come back and I take this bag one more time make sure that there's no little plant matter on the outside and this line if not wash it in alcohol and now you're gonna take this hope you can see okay being careful not to maybe it would be nice actually you know I pillowcase sometimes works better I did it with a pillowcase the other day open if I think you're beautiful nails thank you okay so this now we're going through this bill so I want to show you keep it definitely see the holding I want to show you look at how much blind matter even though it's already two times see that you do not want to see in the oil okay okay so now we just squeeze that's why use clean gloves too so I don't leave any traces of plants now if you don't have a solid mass or mp5 I used on the other one I use a induction stove because it'll go to 240 you want to make sure that you go to 240 because when you cook it at 248 be carboxylase and it actually brings out the THC the THC ancbds and you want all of those because together one will help the cells to communicate with each other so if you have pain or inflammation somewhere you know there is a connection between the there is a there is truth to it other words that we have two brains one on the gut and one in here so from here to here we need to be communicating and so if our brain is all messed up you know we're always in pain we have no time the cells are dying and we're not replenishing them so this is a good way to get rid of that information so the next thing that you want to do is take this take this pan which is the saw master multi-purpose by cooker and you just plug it in I'll show you in a second now I want to show you what I have here I have a fan right there facing over there to the outside and you won the fan to be facing your pan so that way the fumes are taking out from your oil and it evaporates and also there's no danger of burning your stove or burning it whatever you're doing never inside of the house please okay so now we're gonna go here temperature and then you go up hold your finger there angle 240 exactly that's where the carb happens ok decarboxylation and just plug it in and now let it do its magic you turn the the fan on you turn the fan on which I'll show you in a little bit and what I do is I put a timer for 25 minutes I want to show you one more time okay for the temperature to 40 now I'm going to the timer I'll hit timer and then I'm going to add hold my finger there on the timer sry timer hold the finger and give it 25 minutes actually let's do 20 minutes I want to check it at 20 minute mark because sometimes it could be a little okay and hit time again so it sets right away put it in turn your fan on one to the lowest setting possible and then just let it let it fan okay so Isis panning it's also getting rid of that can you put it up for a second for explanation so you see how it happens so well it's Fanning you're gonna get rid of of all that the the fumes from the alcohol and then you're gonna laugh you're gonna be left with just with the the medicine and this is what you're left with so let me show you you can buy these online so syringe if you don't know how to take the medicine the best thing is to be careful get yourself educated talk to your doctor that's the best thing to do me I'm my doctor on my medicine woman so I listen to my own body in my own self but what Rick Simpson oil taught me while I well I've seen his videos is that he purchased some of this little syringe and he was taking he said about like one little tiny like the size of a toothpick like maybe like one little one little mil a little but for people who are used to they can have a little bit more to me I also prefer to have it on one of these and so after this was all done if which it took 25 to 30 minutes this is what is left the oil it's in there see that's the beauty that's the Rick Simpson oil right there so you see house now I can just take it with a spoon can you open up to me please I should have done this a lot earlier when I when I was still warm because it was actually a little bit a little bit thinner so you just basically put the medicine in there so this I overcooked it a little bit so that's why I gave it I give it less time and I'll show you how much I have because I suffer from a lot of pain so I'll show you how much I have if I want to sleep actually can you give me another one this is perfect so it takes about an ounce to make one little jar like this but it's really heavenly it's so good if it takes the pain immediately God within 15 minutes you're like walking around like you're a teenager girl and her prime of youth without pain without worries just loving life to the fullest like to refill them too much because then it's it gets stuck on the top mm-hmm so I did on the first one about 3 ounces so it seemed so I never waste anything you know I'm from here I will have my own for my you know to meditate and sometimes I like to use a spatula like this because though there will be easy to pull it out with your nails so see now this was stuck in there now I show you what I can do with this I can take my little jar and just put it through there and this will be probably the one that I get some smeared it's the one that I'm going to use the quickest Rick Sampson says that you should take about like about a toothpick size I honestly toothpick size doesn't do anything for me I have to do more because the pain is too much so I'll show you I do the same toothpick it's just I load it up you know you have the loaded you know they're loaded and then unloaded I find that when when I cook it a little bit longer it actually is this cool soft it will solidify a little bit that's why I don't like to put it on the syringe and then can you go see if you can find a toothpick over there and your kitchen concert covers if not just bring me a little spoon okay so see I filled up three little jars and also I have some more in here that this is already in alcohol I also sometimes I put the flour and alcohol so if I have scratches or a bleeding or cut myself I actually put it on and in the heals pretty much within 15 minutes so it's really wonderful what this oil does I really hope that you know you take the time to check it out Rick Simpson oil cannabis oil you know what it does for you not the CBD that I mean you can buy that stuff I heard some wonderful testimonies about it but truly I'm one to make it at home and as holy as possible so see this is kind of like what he recommends that you should take and that's like a tiny little bit I have a high tolerance but also I have a lot of pain so I take a little bit more so I usually take about this much I'm gonna show you how I put it think about that much and I put it on the top of my tongue and I just leave it there on the roof of my mouth that helps release before I used to put it on my own my lower and there my time but the problem that I had is like it looked like a hillbilly I always had like teeth so this one I put on the roof of my mouth and I just leave it there and just just let it do its thing to release you know like little by little and then before I know it I feel calm I feel like relax chill and everything looks so good I feel mobile I can do yoga I can do anything I can garden I can do everything so pain goes away completely within 15-20 minutes faster if I eat something that has fat but right now I'm not eating fat that could actually put a little bit of coconut oil and their interaction be activated a lot of faster because this is fat soluble so now when you're left with something like this I usually let it ride and I scrape it look at I already have it in my nose but I scrape it up a little bit with this or what I could do this is incredible what you could do with this you can put coconut oil like about half a cup of coconut oil in here it will clean it up in fact I thought I brought the coconut oil so I leave it okay if you can bring it so the coconut oil what I do with it I let it I clean it up with it and then I cook it I put I put some raw sugar like raw coconut sugar and cacao and I make a delicious chocolate treat that it just enhances enhances the mood gently okay it's not euphoric type of thing okay so for this for the coconut oil I just take now this is the last of it I take a little bit left over this probably about a about quarter cup here I like to get a better boil but can you see them the covers over there there's like a big one rosco side on the top on the cover yeah so anyway I'll take the same spoon because I'm gonna use it for cleaning so I'll just show you how it cleans okay cuz sometimes I get stuck since is what it's fat-soluble see it comes tough if I have it on my fingers look at how fast it comes off that's why you know if you eat a little bit fat it'll intensify the the it'll intensified the feeling a little bit faster and a little bit longer you'll notice how the fact things up the spoon you know sometimes if I have like just a little bit extra just take it and put it on your skin you will absorb it so the skin is the one of the most tourists things in our in my body so we can absorb a lot through the skin okay I can start to smell that okay so no Glenn one yeah yeah so let's move this way okay and so I have a little stove right here you can fan it that way just position it a little bit yeah there you go I'm not getting up so meanwhile we are here while I'm Fanning that stuff over there so you notice how I was Fanning there's the fan so a little bit of a mess but I got a lot of stuff going on here ok so now so if you want to do something sweet with left over here so you don't waste the thing just put a coconut oil and this will clean up like right away look at how like it just takes it right off so you just what we do is we heat it up because we bring it to warm it up and I'm gonna leave it at 240 so naval uses be ready carve so you see how it now all that brown stuff is melting so now to this I add coconut sugar cacao and I'll make a delicious chocolate tree so I hope you learned something today this is your flexitarian friend J tan tea until then have a happy healthy and wealthy day enjoy your Rick Simpson oil good for the body good for the soul let's go on and", "8qwDVCPRZKw": "welcome to 710 tips and tricks on roughhouse studios now let's learn how to twacks with joints wants and bolts it's often thought that in order to smoke marijuana concentrates such as flags and chatters you need some sort of apparatus such as a wax pen like in the v1 wax pen that you see here or an oil rig with a nail or email attachment like this but that's not true you could very easily smoke wax shatters and oils mix ride in under marijuana flowers waxing is when you simply apply your wax directly to cannabis flowers inside of a bowl or blood or even a joint there are a few ways to twacks depending on what kind of concentrated cannabis you're using or how you're smoking it so let's take a look at a few of those methods of thwack Seng remember like all of our videos this is not to be a conclusive Bible about the relatively new subject of taxing but it's intended more of a conversation starter to help us all gather and spread knowledge about cannabis concentrate we welcome your ideas thoughts commentary and constructive criticisms in the comments of this video [Music] we will start with the simplest method of track seeing witches with a bowl with this method you can crumble your wax on top of a packed bowl and smoke it just as it is you can also make small little pellets of shatter or one big ball to drop on top of a bowl it can also be useful to heat the dabbing tool letting the wax melt falling with gravity on top of the packed bowl which could be a little less messy than trying to get the wax on top of the bowl with a tool or by using your fingers you can also make a little tube or snake shapes and wrap them around the small buds or nugs which can then be dropped hole into a bowl to smoke there are a lot of ways to be creative and have fun with track seeing on a bowl of cannabis flowers [Music] the wax blunt is probably one of the most common ways to twacks the combination of the tobacco leaf wrath cannabis flowers and oily concentrates is a visceral enjoyment that is really catching fire in the cannabis community the basic method for doing this with wax is to crumble the wax directly on top of the cannabis as evenly as possible just prior to the rolling process however if you're using a viscous oil concentrate like honey or hash oil or even if you're using shatter it's easier to strive to the blunt wrap itself just before adding in the ground cannabis now there are other methods for track seeing with a blunt and we will take a look at some of those at the end of the video now let's look at tracks on a joint a joint because of the thin paper is easy to ruin with the sticky wax when trying to roll up the delicate papers and also by causing runs in the joint once it's being smoked for this reason practicing with a joint is often done with a coil of shatter twisted around the end of a roll joint this method looks really cool but you will need to be careful not to let the wax drip away as you smoke it and like the blunt it's really easy to break up your crumble or sugar wax right onto the joint but it may be wise to put a little cannabis flower both on top and bottom of the crumble for a more even burn and for a fatter joy you might also have fun using Keef along with your wax and bowls joints and blunts for various creations and combinations that can make tracks and even more fun than it already is you can make caviar style buds the likes of which you may have heard called moon rocks or c-3po Keith can also be used to make it easier to roll up a wax joint by absorbing some of the stickiness prior to rolling it can also be pretty cool to use a stripe of wax on the outside of a blunt or joint and then dust it with Keef and enjoy smoking a tarantula leg the creative possibilities of twacks are virtually limitless [Music] I hope you enjoyed this pilot episode of 7 pin tips and tricks on roughhouse studios if you did please like comment and share this video with your friends also please

see how we feel oh so you didn't do it last night yeah i didn't know i i thought we were going to do like an effect the day of or something same same thing ready to go for today yeah let's do it this you know this is the first cannabis club collaboration uh between myself josh kincaid the talking hedge you can find us at thetalkinghedgepodcast.com or all the podcast platforms and then there's miggy420 with cannabis legalization news mickey where can they find you at uh utilization news on all the podcast outlets and on youtube we go live every wednesday and sunday we're gonna have ed rosenthal on tomorrow cool that's awesome michael schroeder the aging ant uh when your platform isn't getting uh deleting you where can they find you at so right now the best spot to hit me is at the aging and underscore on instagram um and in there in the bio there is a link to the youtube for the inebriation show which is the new project and that shit's going to be amazing that's that's like going to be the thing that everybody loves the inebriation show fitting that we picked rso or that i picked rso is the first product so the the chronic club was an idea that i had to collaborate with some other youtubers like yourselves like guys that are local here in washington state um to pick a product so you guys gave me 20 bucks i went out to a store which was kush 21 in berrien wanted to pick something that was local that you might not find in rent in maggie or centralia michael so i wanted to get something that was sort of uh a local product maybe something small so um michael can you show us the rso because yeah i can show you because i don't have a background [Laughter] so we got this one yep it comes in a syringe which isn't very sexy um and rso is who wants to take that topic real quick michael should rso is a whole hopefully full spectrum extract usually made with alcohol named rso for rick simpson oil um but rick simpson also advocated over time using things like antifreeze and stuff so the name stuck but his methodologies don't now it's all usually alcohol ethanol extracted especially in 502 in washington no pesticides it's about as close as you know organic as you can get kind of um so i picked this again and you guys magically had it appear at your house so we started with 20 each i picked a 15 product after tax we had a dollar 11 remaining and then of course shipping just burnt that to a crisp so we'll keep a tally of how much money we should have because in theory if we buy something inexpensive like a pre-roll we'll have more money down the road for something like a concentrate this time around we got a rso josh you're all stoned huh well so um i did half a gram right after i got it i had a really bad like a neck pain whatever so i took half a gram uh indica during the day not my thing so i got a good experience though i got a good report and then last night i took the last half a gram um and i slept really well all right well oh there we go the whole thing oh oh i'll do a camera take it oh oh what's it taste like i mean i already know but like you tell us very uh sprucy there was a lot of herbaceous um yeah there's a lot of like sprucy pine there's definitely a like oh that's not good in the very back there's sort of uh after i haven't washed down yet i haven't washed down yet since you asked me to explain it um it's kind of like uh there's a very real dirt element to me like like yeah yeah but but not like like rso is rough it's gross it's never good maggie what's your initial response oh i'm about to do it right now i had no coffee no weed i've been up for half an hour so let's do this oh you haven't eaten it yet you better have coffee in your hand bro like how are you going to wash that shit out of your mouth oh i'm at work bro i'll go get coffee here in a minute what's cool about ready okay so yeah no offense to these guys uh sweet nirvana brands um let's get this in front of me here rso is just nasty right yeah thanks mike yeah rso is nasty but this is full spectrum so basically what that really means when you get an rso product is it's the entire plant you know they take all of the phytochemicals all the stuff which is why there's that you know for me it always expresses like dirt not earthy like straight up like a like dried dirt but that's kind of a thing that rso tastes in my mouth um look at me slurping the last little bit out yeah it's like a lick the cat's asshole is what it tastes like i try to get the last little bit out too suck in the lab but it's nasty like the aftertaste like the first little bit is it could be considered like a starbucks burnt coffee whatever really earthy maybe chewing on up on a pine tree or something things you don't necessarily want to do you know like put einstein in your mouth this is really sprucy yeah this is really really sprucy like um express is pretty nice and that's actually kind of one of the better front forward tastes that i've had out of rso sometimes it does definitely taste like uh like old like triple run coffee grounds and you're just it's a good that's a good uh the coffee and the um it's like even my exhale it's like still lingering in my mouth like it's all on my tongue yeah and um when i exhale it's got that like that pine tree air freshener but not like the good fresh like the dollar store one you want to get it out you drink coffee and it's like you're scraping your tongue you know with the razor blade to get that that off but i don't know if there's a a way to do it better maybe put it in um and so last night i was i was munching on some um pumpkin muffins that i was making and so just slapping some on here i couldn't even taste it so when i eat my mushrooms i do it with the snickers bar so now when i do my rso i've got to have some kind of muffin or something i uh i like i like mushrooms with uh reese's peanut butter cups personally like that's that's the character okay it's a good one but you know uh with rso i had a i had a neighbor who uh actually had brain cancer and uh uh just a long back in the day during medical when people were willing to give you a tube of rso just say hey give this to your friend and some people gave me some tubes i asked the dude and the dude was like i can't do it because i'm a christian i'm like what the dude you got fucking cancer you got brain cancer you're going through surgeries and shit and opiates and uh he declines i was like all right i got tubes of rso and i tasted it and i you know for a lot of people they don't know medical people they start with a grain of rice size right like your fingertip you only you know we took a whole goddamn graham alex i did i did so yeah sweet i went back for it i wasn't going to save it [Music] but you know what i said like we've already talking like what is that probably 20 times more than what people start with medically so essentially this is 500 milligrams that we just took because it's about 50 percent uh thc so and it was a gram so we had half a gram 500 milligrams of thc so that is uh 50 times the standard edible dosage which is usually made with uh actually often made with bho and not alcohol i think alcohol extract hits you inside better and faster because i'm i'm feeling it already i think i've had no cannabis today this is my first cup of coffee too mickey we both have the same mindset and uh man just well it's josh's point too putting on on the food you know that's what uh people who are trying to get in the edibles and shit i recommend you know edibles just flavored food with weed in a lot of regulated markets so you're only going to have 100 milligrams so when i went to mexico my facebook memory is my engagement to my wife like a century ago but when we got married i spread one gram of rso onto um a peanut butter and jelly sandwich that i brought to mexico got it got it through customs and all that shit it was crazy wouldn't wouldn't probably do it again but um at the time i was in serious like like i needed that for just to get through the day to eat that little like rice size that you were talking about so what's the difference now where i can have a whole gram of rso or half grain whatever and still function whereas back in the day you can only do a rice sized grain and my tolerance has always been high so i was surprised i mean you did the math michael so obviously this 500 grams i was thinking it was 100 because that's most of the caps but what's the difference between rso now and rso circa 2015 that's a great question dude like obviously you know there's some videos about it but yeah yeah well michael what's that so you were saying one's alcohol alcohol extract the other one's not what's the other option of extraction for or so uh just hydrocarbons you know um butane propane bho and pho and i mean throughout it all lots of people use like you know the the dork dark door doesn't matter because it's gonna be eaten nobody cares what it looks like right but ideally they're making better these days right more cleaner concentrates but so i think personally i do think alcohol extracts like they get into the body faster what's happening with our edibles is it's going to go to our liver our liver is going to convert it into a more complex but more easily uptakeable um cannabinoid and our brain and body's receptors are going to like latch onto it as twice as fast after we've eaten it because our what our liver does and i think to me i think alcohol extracted cannabinoids and and you know rso does that process more easily it's just been my experience i have no science to back this up but i've asked a couple people about it and it's it's not myself only having this experience whereas like i could sit down with 500 milligrams worth of edibles and i've done that a lot from the 502 market and i had some tasty snacks yeah yeah you know that's about where i'm at and i know in 40 minutes i'm gonna be messed up right now my eyes are already starting to get a little uh like heavy and this isn't my cheeks won't stop so yeah well i think tolerance like joss said you know your tolerance hasn't changed but i i don't think it's so much tolerance to dude but maybe expectations right can you like do you remember the last time the first time i remember the first time i overdosed like took too much you know oh yeah and and that was just a panic attack like i went to my my uh traditional market place and the guy who was giving me my my uh my medicine was uh hey we were smoking and then uh i was hungry he had food and then he also had drinks all medicated and uh an hour later i was having the the craziest panic attack at home i ran into my bedroom i was like just reminding myself that no one's ever died for weed and if i am the first person to die from weed i'm going to be fucking more famous than ever you know so um yeah i know i just think it's also expectations man like you write it out like acid right like if you took a psychedelics and your first time everything's surprising second time you're like okay this cartoon land's not real but i like where i'm experiencing you know the 3429th time though you're just like ah i'm back yes yeah i don't even mess with edibles anymore in the regulated market um i strictly do medical i just re-engaged one of the gals that was at the tacoma market uh oh what else the package she's doing like 500 5000 whatever you need at relatively inexpensive prices so forty dollars or a thousand or two thousand milligrams is decent versus a hundred milligrams at a store here in washington regulated marketplace it's maybe ten dollars for a hundred milligrams seems to do nothing you spend twenty thirty doesn't matter for me maybe ten dollars for a hundred milligrams yeah you're getting a good deal and it's probably going to be like itty bitty little tiny treats that one bite and they're gone my experience is more like 20-ish dollars for 100 milligrams of edibles you know and then something good maybe more and maybe they cap out at only like the 50 milligram pack yeah well josh you sound like someone who takes edibles on a daily you know as a regular um and my thing about edibles it's just calories man it's just food you know and uh if i was to consume like on a medicated basis i'd probably just use rso and lace everything with it yeah i mean like a slab a slab of peanut butter on a ritz cracker and a gram of rso makes the rso a whole lot better in my opinion but you know um i normally don't go slamming grams of rso and then so so yeah i think i think that's that's true like what you get yourself accustomed to but meanwhile i can sit down and you know have five six seven 12 dabs in a row and still you know function right yeah like never touch dabs they get that first one and then they're like fuck we're done you know you're more you're more of a dab guy right and miggy are you more of a dab guy or a pre-roll guy i'm flower i'm flying so i'm mostly a blunt guy and then when i travel i use a vape pen but if i'm going to be traveling extensively i'm going to bring rso to a trade show or if i'm going internationally or whatever because you can conceal it and it lasts a really long time edibles just don't just don't do it for me um yeah what what's the scenario where you guys would pick up rso and use it it's very expensive uh so actually one of i mean my youtubes have been censored so hard damn it follow the inebriation show though if you will new show coming out uh it's gonna be awesome but my i'm you know three youtube's done um one of my most watched videos though is i picked up an eight dollar gram of rso and a three dollar glass dab straw and a four dollar eagle torch and sat down and said here's dabbing for 13 bucks let's do this and um that's what i did and i just you know it was my most watched video period people liked it and um i don't mind dabbing rso it's the whole plant you know i'm getting more out of it i don't dab it out of my regular everyday rig because it's grody it's 50 this is 50 and the other half of it's going to be phytocam uh chemicals which are plant chemicals that are not cannabinoids whereas my dabs that i'm dabbing are all cannabinoids so if it's cheap if it's cheap and it looks okay because sometimes it also doesn't you know there's murky stuff that you can see the solids in i don't want that um but that's my scenario and that's about it maybe if i'm going like on a really good long hike you know because like a half a gram rs so at the beginning of a hike and then a half a gram at the end of the hike that just makes everything really nice yeah i don't know you know i the last time i bought rosso was for somebody else uh to try for medical reasons you know that's my go-to and i think it's wild how i can buy a tube of rso here but yeah they're going to regulate fucking 10 milligrams per uh damn thing and that's my issue with edibles too because sometimes they're just so heavy you know you just you know i want to lace a salad maybe not a whole cupcake so so here's the ways to get around that with products that are in i-502 right now and they're in most shops okay so there's two products one is lotions and one is potions both spoiled with a z they're little uh mylar bags they got like uh i think rasta colors along the top and they are ampules of mct meant as a topical the lotions and they are like i think 800 milligrams in mct in an ampoule this big life's good i think it's 4200 actually so you can get 200 milligrams that way mct is fully digestible it's actually really great for you you know you hit the google machine how much uh i think those are like in the 15-ish dollar range maybe less at most stores yeah that's that's about their range so then and i know that the the other ones the ones called potions they actually sell saying hey look these are to drink these are inedible and um those are more pricey i think that they're like double the price and hey look if i was in this market space and i had people who knew that i was selling two things that were pretty much identical and one person preferred to pay more for it i would let them right i don't think that that's necessarily a bad thing yeah my only issue with the concentrates because i mean i do like concentrates um you know i've dabbed with you and i'll dab again uh and oh by the way you're looking good dude lost a lot of weight looking good uh but uh you know i'm just flower man like it just bothers me about concentrates the whole uh what's it green or gold or mold of gold yeah yeah but i still question like the the integrity of the actual you know back in the day you used to know uh you know in washington when it was medical you had a relationship with that company you know how many how many companies out there now that i can name um that are concentrate mammoth labs i think's one i can't yeah i came back to here mammoth labs their fucking fire their product is outstanding um yeah i was just saying how we used to have a relationship with the with the the concentrate people like they wouldn't even tell you they'd be like yeah we do mold the gold you know and then other ones are like nah we won't touch that and so uh and that's the same like in 502 who do you know you know there's not many name brands and it's all about processing there's a bunch of name brands brother i'm on the exact other side of that coin with you dude cody high heavenly buds um i trust fat panda a lot of people don't like them because they're the biggest brand in the market space i trust them for more reasons than behind the fact that they were you know supporters of my mission and what i've done right yeah i if i go into a store like 90 of what i've bought in the past year has been fat panda because i'm like i took a year off of reviewing basically right well yes and uh almost all of what i what i was buying was well i need something i know i can trust i'm not going and like you know seeing everything that's out there at this moment and panda was there you know the sticky frog brand they've got um they're also dabstracked um so and abstracts is one of the upper echelon of concentration in my mind yeah uh body high like i said they make the best concentrates in my opinion in the whole fucking marketplace and um i would throw in like denver as well up again they're like denver's got really good concentrates but uh i think donaire would slam against theirs too so that's definitely a brand to be looking out for then oleum and i just my whole point i think i'm trying to say is like it's like it's about processing like it doesn't it all comes back back to the flower no matter what like it's always come back to the it's what blobs my mind i just watched did you guys see the uk vice news uh thing that just came out last couple days ago um this no this one's horrendous it's so this guy is saying so uh just so you guys know the united kingdom does not have skunks okay we tom and i had some guys from england on the show uh they referred to we said something about skunk and they're like yeah that's gunk bud and then we said yeah they smells like a skunk and then they were like what's skunk and so they didn't know that the smell of skunk came from skunk bud but so the point being is this video and vice they're like hash is gone because skunk is here and i'm like you dumb motherfuckers hash is skunk it's cannabis so so hash so europeans especially in the uk they don't really get flower dude they do not get flower they never see anything that looks anything like this right which is some black rhino from a local friend of mine very nice stuff but they would never see that they would never see dabs in the uk what they would get is all right man you guys are from from here you're both from the pnw so you don't know i'm from chicago i used to deal with shitty mexican weed that was like literally like it was came through mexico bricked up garbage weed we'd spend half the time we hung out d stemming and seeding what we bought and that was like what we got consider the the cheapest hash you bought in washington and that would be the kind bud compared to the hash they're getting which is that like sticks and stems grown in a shitty place like literally grown in like algiers or some shit and then black marketed across the mediterranean and dumped in in france and then brought over to the uk and it's been stepped on all those times too yeah that's yeah that the uk has i feel so sad for those fuckers but it's just ignorance though too because hash comes from whole plant everything comes from the goddamn plant so yeah i just it just seems that we're still trying to sort out like to educate people constantly about what's what's out there or how things are done and here there's a lot of people don't consider concentrates like dabs to be hash but it's bho butane hash oil and ash is just you know the extract process i think yeah that's it brother these days that's it man i'm feeling i i feel pretty good uh i had a lot of uh i had a lot of stroller issues and shit i'm just old man like everything hurt you know i didn't step in anybody's bucket i just woke up but uh i'm i'm feeling better i uh i'm not feeling high like i'm not like i want to go sit down and play video games i'm more like maybe it's just because i got shit to do and i want a cup of coffee though so who wants to take the experience first you guys just did it today versus work i did mine i did a one gram or a half a gram uh earlier in the week due to some neck pain worked well but during the day an indica is not my thing so i was kind of tired but it did work and then last night took a second half a gram slept well um not a lot of deep sleep i initially i had some good deep sleep from my fitbit i could tell and some good rem which was nice because then i woke up really i mean with a beautiful day outside i'm like yeah let's do this great experience a little uh tired behind the eyes for the first three four hours a day you know and you gotta drink a bunch of coffee not sure that works maybe it gets the taste out of your mouth maybe make me dead i'll let yours was the most intense obviously well i just i mean i'm feeling uh like i'm not gonna put the cereal in the freezer high yeah but uh i i do every time i sit there like right now man i'm fighting the indica this is it's an indica i i um i will be taking a nap here you took that whole gram with nothing to wash it down for it it was like 25 30 minutes that was going on for they're just licking the dirt man it's like you're a little kid when you put dirt in your mouth yeah we had to cut so that miggy could get some coffee and rinse his mouth out and i don't blame him that aftertaste we were talking about earlier is is serious so effects so far michael what's uh what what are you feeling how's one gram of uh indica rso during the day yeah i definitely am with you on the behind the eyes thing i'm behind the eyes pretty pretty uh dopey back here really like i feel droopy my uh that part of the brain isn't firing as fast i can feel things back this way trying to get their way forward and just like putting at one point um i'm okay with that it is indica i figure i'm gonna be a little foggy i came i live on the third floor and i basically loaded up the stairs like i did not feel them at all and i got like my knees popping you know back things and all that stuff so i'm definitely feeling the nice smooth body painting yeah how about your leg you were mentioning some leg pain did you apply it directly man you know i was gonna but then maybe like took the whole damn dream well he looks like he was having a good time walking around slurping like we can we can cut to the right now where mighty was like dribble out and i was like well i can't i can't left behind so i'm actually going to go out later on today get a quarter like a gram of rso and i will use it as a topical and i'm going to totally document this gross ass wound on my leg and uh progresses over the next few days just i had a brutal workout yesterday at the gym um they're doing like limited um people in there everyone's wearing a mask whatever but i was in there doing a leg workout and it was brutal and uh this morning not nearly as sore although i am i'm pretty sore so i'm glad i had some rso last night otherwise i probably wouldn't be able to walk that much this morning nice that was kind of nice oh good oh just to say i've been complaining for the past like three four days tomorrow lady uh i was gonna go to the va sometime this week because my shoulder's been killing me like one of those weird pains that you know you didn't do nothing but maybe you left something wrong like a cup of coffee um but uh yeah it's been killing me and right now it's a little a low roar the pain is and uh um the sun's out man i'm really contemplating just lying down calling i mean hey you look like you're in a good spot for it dude i love gorgeous today oh in the sun so where's that paint at in your neck this is like like a shoulder neck thing uh it feels like a muscle thing like uh because i can push on it it doesn't hurt but when i'm sleeping staying still it fucking throbs like and i have a high pain tolerance like uh when i was a navy i had a sciatic nerve and the guy injected me with morphine and uh the proxima and i was still chasing with beers because that fucking being hurt but uh this is not a uh sciatic thing it's a it's something muscler i think just because when i push on something resistance wise that's when i can really tell oh shit something's not right hey man i think i might be the youngest one in the group here i am uh turning 40 this year um so weird though well thanks well you know i'm not like calling you guys old but hey look i'm i've got a bad back my knees wrecked i've been using cannabis as a pain medicine for like you know 10 years even when i was living in a black market area right um plus i had uh when i was like 27 i had a small stroke and i totally attribute cannabis use to part of my recovery because i got shit out of the medical industry right whereas living in tucson they just didn't give a fuck about humans there uh so um cannabis medicine is important but i think that at my age and forward cannabis as a physical pain medicine is important um you guys being a little bit old like you guys mickey i think you're about 10 years old let me give or take nine ten years somewhere in there after six oh six okay well you have better grades you know we sat down and chatted our life stories a couple times but it was years ago um so like at your ages do you guys have you used cannabis as a pain medicine for a long time has it been an inadvertent intentional and you can i mean like obviously it's something you're gonna do forever right like where's that at i'd say inadvertent for me josh yeah in high school i didn't really know about cannabis i thought it was all indica that you were just kind of lazy during the day didn't do anything i didn't really know anything i was into sports and that was about it then i broke my shoulder um was supposed to go and play on a scholarship in college and it kind of changed everything so as i was trying to rehab the doctors were pushing all of these hardcore drugs oxycontin oxycodone um muscle relaxers painkillers all this stuff and so i was actually using cannabis because i went to a very liberal college western washington university up by bellingham near the border up in canada has a lot of good cannabis from alaska and the bc bud and preferred using cannabis to kind of cure my neck and shoulder pain and use it for you know anxiety and other things too as i've gotten older but fairly broken from sports and just getting old and auto accidents and whatever else has happened throughout the years definitely is therapeutic but also i think i have more anxiety than i than i know there's especially covid there's so many projects that are derailed or delayed you know and to take the edge off i prefer cannabis over sugar or alcohol any day yeah and i think people find it it's a complicated plant because it treats both a mental and physical condition and like for me when i realized it was medicine it was not until probably the past like eight years for myself personally where i had a dry run i didn't have any weed for a little bit you know whether it be money or whatever and shit hurt more than usual i'm a smoker all day every day like i wake up i light a bowl um when i get off of work i light a ball uh if i have a vape pen on me i might do it during lunch but you know it's all day for me and then when i go without you notice things start popping more yeah yeah and also when you learn about the endocannabinoid system how everything's tied together it kind of it's frustrating how it's tied to your nervous system your bone structure uh it's amazing what this plant is connected to yeah so since i've learned really how medicinal it is probably like i'd say six seven years ago i really started being like oh wow you know this is cannabis medicine and it's not just i've been smoking weed since i was 12. and and now now it's like uh the things i know from the people i've interacted with in the cannabis industry and all the medical advocates that i've heard from and all the science that i've reviewed like it makes sense to me that starting at my age i see it as a supplement there's days where i don't want to smoke i don't want to wake up and smoke but i'm like you know what i am going to consume like smoke half a joint i need those that thc i need something i need the cannabinoids those extra phytocannabinoids or phytochemicals that come through too they're all super important and it's like a supplement um i think that's kind of my original point was like even at some at our young age eating cannabis is kind of like the best way to get it medicinally older folks too like who may not want to smoke may not be into that they can still get their thc by you know slamming a grandma rso of an afternoon yeah wait it's totally morning it's morning not afternoon jesus josh what have you done to us so so that was my fault so um when you guys got the care package last night uh the the um descriptions that were not very clear they were very discreet and in encryption uh we're supposed to tell you to open it up and enjoy and then we were going to talk about it today so for moving forward edible should always be uh you do an unboxing and uh and eat it and then we'll talk about it after your times your notes were covered up by this giant ass sticker brother oh yeah same here that's what happens so if you have a note future has to be in the um the package itself yeah so um are we ready to to judge this all right so we need to have kind of seven criteria so let's uh i guess spit that out right now i'm always gonna bitch about the plastic dude like that you know for a tube you already have the tube as the plastic which is the necessity but they could have packaged it and probably a cardboard type thing you know something uh that's biodegradable so it's a yeah it's a yes or no did they did they meet enough of your expectations for the presentation i'm going to give them a point i would say no one might say okay fair enough i'm with it i i've seen a lot of small businesses going through the packaging problems and here's what happens is if they go for some tube some sort of cardboard anything that's not see-through customers won't buy it because they can't see it people don't buy what they can't see so this is the best case solution i think they've got right now for something like this because it's they could have gone with shorter sure but then their t sticker and all this other crap this is their best case solution for this tiny syringe and i don't hate syringes no it's effective i know that a lot of people have bad feelings about them and i get it but there's just better options out there the twist spencer you can do with one hand if you have arthritis and it's small and you can keep it in your pocket or purse or whatever so check out the twist spencer um so michael was that you did give them a point yeah i'll give them a point it also looks nice i like their packaging it's simple it's straightforward it tells you everything you need you know just boom here's here's our product how much did this cost us this was 15 but then when you put in uh tax it's about uh uh 18 and 89 cents this is the shop that to real sorry sidereel uh coach21 did they label it at 15 or they label it at plus tax strange that's weird to me i like to see my prices in 502 to be tax inclusive and there's a there's a beerian tax on top of that and they differ what didn't okay we can maybe cut this for another time but i i gotta throw this tax info every time it comes up 37 excise tax 6.75 state tax the average municipal tax in washington is one percent but in seattle it's 1.25 i think and then um like you said durian tax that's they average out to one percent and some places have zero so consider that the majority have zero tax it was a little over a dollar for each one about four dollars in change for three items for that bureau tax yeah right all right moving on to creativity how do you guys feel about the creative product being this rso creativity in the product itself or that came out in my brain i say it's traditional i mean like the the product itself is just a like like uh mike was saying you know it has that rick simpson oil tradition but it's not um it looks and feels just like the oil i know for medical day so i give it okay yes yeah it's it's i mean it's not something new innovative or anything like that but they did deliver rso pretty well what do you think donna josh yeah i mean it's a slim package um [Music] they did what they can i'm kind of neutral on it um i didn't really get any creative mind like if i was gonna give half on the creative product and half on the creative um after you know effects yeah yeah um i'd probably go null on the product and null on the after effects so no points for me miggy any points for you yeah i was gonna give it a point just because i don't think there's much you can do as far as innovation with the rso uh you know it in the fact that it tastes and smells the same that i remembered from ten years ago uh they didn't fuck it up so i'll give him a point okay yeah i'm sticking with a point on it did i i mean there's definitely some things further down the road other products will be like wow look at this and really be on the creativity event but i mean it is rso they didn't they didn't they didn't fuck it up as meggy said that's that's that's fair enough give him a point and we did give him a lot of flack for the flavor but if you're going to compare all you know uh phoenix tears rso whatever you want to call it um then it's all pretty tough i would like to step that back i wasn't giving them a hard time on the flavor i i wasn't i front loaded that with wow this is really sprucy this is good you know the end after flavor didn't feel the dirt you know that flavor though can't be avoided sometimes even with like butter yeah right you take the flour is overpowering yeah exactly but overall flavor like the front of this i blocked the whole most of it at once and then i came back for a little nibble after my tongue was sprucy my my you know cheeks got all the flavor so i'm i wasn't it wasn't bad it was nice yeah so you're gonna give him a point oh definitely yeah on flavor and miggy yeah i'll give them a point just i mean the whole earthiness it's not a negative thing if you love the plant period i can't give one point because like the flavor like if you have to have like if we have to cut this podcast for you to go get coffee to rinse your mouth out and i had to do the same thing i can't give them a point but you i see you're saying because it was strong but how do you avoid when you do full extract uh i don't know i had hold on i've had rso that if i plunged half a gram on my tongue i was straight jerking you know and like i couldn't stop it it was physical physically yeah yeah yeah this stuff i was like yeah yeah okay cool and then on my way like to get the refill of coffee i was like licking bits out of the corner of my teeth and like okay that's still good it was pleasant the dirt i don't i don't hate the dirt flavor i mean it was just what it was but um yeah man i i think that this was really flavorful for rso because i've had some that was just i will admit the flavor wasn't bad it was just i couldn't get the aftertaste out of my mouth that was problematic you know do you think that that flavor uh the reason why it lingers so long too could be the whatever they're using for the carrier the uh you know the alcohol base or whatever could be the alcohol that sticks on your tongue and makes it last longer i don't know i mean that's way over my head the alcohol extract process residual solvents that are allowed for um alcohol are like 2500 parts per million i think it might be as high as 10 000 parts per million because that's top end in washington um but i don't really think that that's something you're gonna actually notice in the product at all the the it's just part of the process and the same way that you don't get like butane in bho extracts so um i mean yeah that could be part of the reason though i mean because it keeps a lot of the plant chemicals right it keeps all those waxes every single chemical that was in there why it's full spectrum says it on the label is that all the shit that was in that plant is now in this extract it's not filtered it's raw i mean and then moving on to texture right so since we've we've beaten flavor the texture of this for all that was very nice and smooth this looked good its texture came out like like it blurped in my like this syringe came out faster than i thought it would how about you guys did it like hit you real quick it went down like a jello shot for me yeah i thought the texture was good it wasn't soupy it wasn't so thick that you had to like hit it with a hammer uh i thought it was good um it kind of held its consistency so you could kind of put it on anything that you wanted um i thought they did a good job so i'm gonna give them a full point yeah yeah same there was not a lot of waste when i i think you're saying that some some of those rsos can be sticky i've seen it where it like it punches how does it get clogged at the plunger you know like what's going on but yeah this thing left over shot out oh i sucked it all out there was like a little bit in the rim i couldn't get any more out a lot of times the syringes with the dabs if you're if you're going to refill you you'll leave a lot in there versus this one i noticed that it's good efficiency on getting all of it out yeah all right so i already kind of explained my effects one of them was during the day and it did help with the neck pain that i had and then last night i took it and i slept really well and i'm not nearly as sore from the really strenuous uh leg workout i had yesterday definitely going to give them a point for the effects indica did its job i was super tired when i took it during the day um so uh full point for effects for me maybe i got the weed burps like i just burped it was like so i mean it's good it's in me i know i know it's there uh like i said earlier the sun was coming out and it was hard for me earlier i was fighting the indica naps now i'm feeling a little more better maybe it's the coffee kicking in uh the pain definitely the body high that mike was talking about you guys were talking about uh like i said i was gonna go to the hospital for my shoulder sooner than later but today today i'll probably just go home and play xbox oh man that's great yeah totally uh i'm giving him a point for the effects i'm also starting to feel kind of giggly like the past 10 minutes or so i've just been like you know i want to go do something silly yeah i'm all about this i haven't i also have not had a whole ground bar or so in quite a while more than six months and so [Music] healthiness how do you guys feel about the healthiness of uh you know phoenix tears 100 i think this would be a good way if i needed to like as a flower guy you know i do it in part because i love the plant and uh i still don't feel like i'm a connoisseur enough to be like these are notes of uh sativa so that's why i always go with the flower but if i was a patient and i needed to medicate high doses this this would be a great way to go about it 100 on that like this is the ideal efficacy route right here and you're cutting out the negative effects of smoking you're cutting out the negative effects of you know even vaporizing cannabis through a dab or something like that a lot of people won't be able to get past the taste that is a real thing um but you can hide that shit you can put it in a lot of different ways i think this is the healthiest way to consume small or large dose gas period points i would agree and especially with this like i was looking at something that wasn't you know no pesticides as close to organic as you can get it's um full spectrum and so that's the thing the full spectrum uh fico full extra cannabis oil is the thing that you kind of want to look for um and the price point um i guess we can get that into the overall quality i'm going to give them a full point for healthiness i think we're all in agreement with that i'm going to give them a point for overall quality because i think at the price point of 15 even with the ridiculous taxes i did i think they did a phenomenal job yeah i just was unfortunate that for 15 that syringe would last a real patient maybe two days like they're not gonna do the whole gram like i just did but they will take rice sized taste throughout the day for for titration um i've heard that you know basically it's like uh 10 doses or so at that rice sized grain per day if if you can which is a gram a day and then do that for 90 days like that's been the traditional since it is rick's sisters simpson oil rso is what they're calling it i think that was the traditional treatment so yeah like at this price point that that makes it something that somebody could effectively do and use as their you know daily medicine or titration as you said and get it to a point where the uh cannabis is actually impacting their whole system health yeah yeah i think overall quality gets a point for me this was really good rso actually i've had much worse like much worse all right so the tally is in all of the voting has been compiled and michael you got the top at 7 out of 7 for this uh for presentation creativity flavor texture effects healthiness and overall quality mighty you hit six out of seven you didn't give them the first one which was presentation but followed through in uh overall 86 percent and then um i gave them five out of seven leaves at a 71 percent i did not give them creativity or flavor and so totaling all of that that's an average of six out of seven leaves for a total of 86 percent well if we were qualifying each of these points with more points inside of them right maybe uh i wouldn't have given them like a full bore of all the points just to clarify but since we're kind of keeping these pretty direct and simple that's why they they earned all the points for me and i mean i will say this i've encountered maybe a dozen different rso products over the past like three years or so you know in that window this has been the nicest one no doubt like texture and flair and flavor and well i think it's a good point system too is the fact that you know i brought the fact that i don't like the presentation then you counterpoint with way some people have to put up with that type of uh you know like being the the newcomer in the market whatever but to your point and counterpoint they are there are cardboard tubes with cellophane that you can see through so but yeah it's all about price right like right if i bet you they bought the cheapest mass packaging they could so so they can assure quality in the product itself and for 15 bucks right like going back on the overall quality and i mean saying it's 15 bucks is rough for me because in my head that's an 18 product that's that's just what we paid for it was 18 bucks so even at 18 bucks sub 20 for rso is okay i was actually i've been talking to this company i forget their name offhand but they have 60 dollar rso 60 crystal clear looks like distillate rso and at that point is it rso they've taken all the phytochemicals out of it that give it all good meanwhile this obviously wasn't filtered this wasn't um you know so they didn't have most likely crappy product that they improved some way it was just good product good price point i'm okay for them going for the cheapest but okayest price uh packaging they could because this isn't the worst you guys remember 2015 when shit was in uh like straight up plastic bags like yeah like a little ziploc bag on the top yeah yeah that's how we would have been buying i fucking hated that i was buying dry ass joints people trying to sell buds that way this is okayist for right now [Music] all right well i think that wraps up the first edition of the chronic club collaboration between the talking hedge uh cannabis legalization news and the inebriation shows the initiation show yeah yeah it's the new product name but i'm the agent yeah of course all right well i'm josh kincaid i'm with the talking hedge you guys want to do a little exit and where they can find you find me at the campbell cannabis legalization news uh on spotify all your podcast outlets and the youtubes and for articles just google nikki 420 i've been around you yeah the aging and the aging and see it below we'll put it somewhere in a link somewhere but yeah you can catch me on instagram my facebook's full of a lot of more news stuff instagram's full of all sorts of good things i've got a live show that i've been doing called morning ramblings we're up to 11 episodes there i just pick

for a round two of chronic club collaboration hopefully you guys had a good time even though the instructions weren't quite clear hopefully you'll come back for round two hell yeah i'm looking forward to it this is a good time all right perfect i didn't die don't forget to smash that like button on your way out and check out these other videos that we've got [Music] you", "l7dP70VFo90": "site is going I can't even read my Twitter feed I [ __ ] these people I don't live if I don't put my glasses I don't know what the [ __ ] they're saying oh my people don't get depressing it actually I'm saying psychosis is a different thing okay okay I think we are discussing overall mental health yes I mean look I'm saying this because I really think that this is something that I've made a big turn over the last few years with myself that I don't quit bathroom break yes please go I don't think marijuana is as safe as I used to think it is I used to think it was benign I really used to think there was no big deal but I have a friend that I discussed the other day who was a really confident [ __ ] muscular a handsome man that never did anything and he took a marijuana edible to go to sleep and for two weeks this guy was like this is a different guy not that I was taught it's not Rafi no a different guy he took it and he experienced suicidal thoughts and and all these he had like severe consequences I think that the human beings we vary so much biologically that to just make this overall blanket statement of what's good for you is good for me is irresponsible and I've been irresponsible as saying that well one reason it's interesting what out reason I think that alcohol is so widely accepted despite all the problems it causes and again alcohol can certainly cause problems yeah is that alcohol affects most people pretty much the same way you know if and you sort of know if what somebody looks like when they have one drink when they have five drinks got some dress I've got some friends that get those gerbil eyes you ever see when they start talking crazy but you sort of know that and you sort of know how long it's gonna take to clear your body and you yes cannabis is so different it's a really complicated drug and it does affect different people in different yes and also the tolerance has changed yes so you know people say well two and a half milligrams of THC you vape it that's like one drink for somebody who you know who doesn't use but then if you if you're a tolerant user you can use 200 milligrams in a day that's 80 drinks it's a weird drug and then there's the issue of eating it yes when you eat it your body produces something called eleven hydrogen's on a tab alight it's a far more psycho action you were all along for the ride when that happens yes you are yes and it can take days for it to get out of your system I know many people have eaten marijuana edibles and then they call me up the next day like dude I'm still hot yeah yeah so so so I think I think the legalization community has sort of said for years like oh there's basically no downsides to this there's only upsides the cops will bus smokers they'll be tax revenue all these people have a way to get high that's clearly safer than alcohol and unfortunately that's just not true I think you're right and I think the the issue that people from what I've read are having with your book or people that are marijuana advocates that think that your position is unbalanced and that you've ignored the positive aspects of THC in terms of like what he was talking about cognitive benefits for people with psychotic episodes and that you were only focusing on the negative plead guilty today yeah because I think that for 20 years people have only heard the positive right eye I think that's I think that's also I'll plead guilty that myself because I think that I've only been discussing the positives and one of the things that I've tried very hard to do and one of the things I've learned how to do from doing this podcast and experiencing criticism and communicating with a bunch of different people with a lot of different viewpoints is examine my own positions and try to figure out am i coming at this from a truly balanced position or am i trying to support a conclusion that I started out with and I'm trying to you know somehow or another back up my own work or back up my own just my own statements and and and sort of prop them up instead of being really honest and objective right it's very difficult to do listen I wrote a book called tell your children that yeah about marijuana mental illness and violence you're I don't think you can you can think that that book is gonna be a compendium of the pros and cons above if you want to tell your children the truth though you really do want to tell them the pros and cons right and you did indicate Alex you said you know we should tell people the truth yeah in the book right so you know I think that when you're telling and you're saying that that you're telling the truth and Alex I'm agreeing with you that you're telling part of the truth right but part of the truth is you know a little bit deceiving and deceptive it in some ways right you want to tell the whole truth when you tell the whole truth then you give the whole story and then people can actually make you know a good informed decision based upon that like if people are going to just read one part of the story then of course they're going to make a decision just based upon that one part they're not going to make you know an informed decision based upon all of the price and because of that people are going to make you know some very poor choices I completely agree with that but to me the last 20 years have been an exercise in the other side in the legalization side doing a very very good job talking up its arguments and essentially there's there's almost nobody on the other side there's this one I bet what's got Jeff Sessions you had the [ __ ] goddamn attorney general that's telling people that good people don't smoke marijuana that's literally a quote yeah God that little morons not an office anymore but that's that's a terrible thing to say people don't smoke marijuana there's a lot of wonderful people who smoke - is not true and and and by the way I think this is a personal choice okay especially for adults yeah okay and and you can make bad personal choices you go look I play cards I'd love to play poker I'm said that on this trip to LA I didn't get to go to a poker room but you can go a new casino and you can see people of Los Angeles but you can go to a casino and see people who've lost their houses it doesn't mean that gambling should be illegal it also means that there's less and more dangerous forms that device in your hand where you can bet on what the next pitch is gonna be gonna be a ball or a strike yeah that's more dangerous than my having to drive to the commerce and play there and one hundred percent or 98 percent THC that an 18 year old vapes is a lot more dangerous than a 5 percent you know CBD 15 percent THC product the doctor heart might suggest his patient uses once a night to go to sleep but that that's the message that you know we should be putting out there right we shouldn't just be you know focusing on one side of the story like that part you know should also be you know and in the book and like you know your book you know in some ways has made me rethink the way that I write you know because my first book was co-authored with Jeremy cost and called friendly fire you know my second book that I'm writing now is called cannabis for PT G so it's how to transform post-traumatic stress into post-traumatic growth right because I feel that and you know we all know examples of people that have you encountered really difficult obstacles in their life and some people have you know succumb to that stress and they've gone down you know the wrong path kind of thing and then other people have used that stress to their advantage and they've actually become you know better because of it and you know CBD and THC can both help facilitate that process you know when you're looking at someone like like a veteran for example you know the hallmark of someone with PTSD is someone who doesn't leave their home and they can't sleep at night so like when I see a debt in my office a lot of the times they'll be leaving their home like five to ten days a month right so when you give them CBD and this is really important for people understand CBD has been shown to decrease learned fear that's incredible right so if you can get people outside of their home because I'm not talking about again you know someone who's you know too nervous to like go to a you know at the bar with like the friends or some like that I'm talking to people who like you know it's difficult for them to go to the grocery store just like pick up a few things so you know those are the type of people that I see in my practice with CBD is really excellent for that then when you look at you know the the nighttime component you know THC again is excellent for reducing nightmares that's been shown in studies and it was even shown with one pharmaceutical drug now blown again I don't really use now blown very much because it's only one cannabinoid and I do believe in the entourage effect and using all of the cannabinoids so I don't use that that much but that shows that she she can reduce nightmares and you know if you have you have you have PTSD I mean if you talk to someone who has PTSD and again this is this comes from a clinician support of you they will tell you I will try anything and that's the same way when you get with like you know the parents of kids who have see shoes all day nobody wants to see that yeah and like Alex you know if your kids you know ever started getting getting seizures which you know I hope I hope they don't because it's it's terrible you know what it can do to people but your when if that ever happened you know I would hope that you would consider you know CBD as a potential treatment I think she's not against that I think we have to be really clear as tension like CBD you know again CBD at all I don't know I don't think anybody is I think no one really is arguing except maybe the federal government in certain levels is arguing against CBD that's probably some pushback from the pharmaceutical industry the reality is CBD has proven to be at least as far as I've read very safe and very effective for a bunch of different disorders especially those that are about reducing and have it something do with inflammation or seizures yeah one of my good friends his son has developed seizures and CBD knocked it out just killed it this is very recently you know you're somebody who's you know who's a cannabis user you obviously know a lot of users why do you think it is that people you know in legal states where they can really express a preference they can go into a dispensary know exactly what they're buying why is it that they want such high potency THC product because they get used to it your tolerance develops it builds up you know every year we do this thing called sober October well we don't do any no drinking no no pot and then we do some sort of crazy challenge me and three of my buddies and when we do it what it's it's very interesting how your tolerance is radically reduced like I'll smoke pot at the end of that month and I'm like holy [ __ ] like I don't even know what I'm talking about in the mid-sentence and I'm just bullets creaked whereas you know now like I smoked a little weed last night did some stand-up had a great old time there's no issues with it at all but I'm used to it and if the weed that I smoked last I assume you don't smoke right I do not okay if you and me were together last night and I gave you a hit of my joint you'd be still there in the corner in the fetal position gone what and the [ __ ] is going on because the marijuana is ridiculously powerful but once you're accustomed to it once your body acclimates it's really not that big of a deal the problem is you you're dealing with a lot of habitual daily users and for those people like my friend Joey Diaz there's a video of him giving this other comedian how many milligrams of those stars of death Oh Tilly like when we give Owen what did he give oh I think just one he ruined his life and about 200 to 250 oh I made a video but the day changed Owens life like literally [ __ ] the guy's head up like he went outside he vanished he's gone yeah well I think I think there's a real argument to be made it's particularly with him well I was gonna make two points on that so you definitely can develop a tolerance yeah and I tell people all the time trying to take at least one three-week break but the evidence does show that if you stop for four weeks generally all your receptors return and it'll be like you've never used cannabis before yeah and that's even with people who are really really heavy users I can go back and get the study but I mean these people are you using I'm pretty sure it was like close like seven joints a day well really heavy users and noop dogs a good example of that you know my friend Tony Hinchcliffe his good buddies with Snoop Dogg and he said Snoop Dogg just smokes all day and he just like is always high and you know you're like well what do you do when you're not high he's like what I'm never not high so everything he does he is high as [ __ ] everything he does look for that guy it's not that big of a deal and for the way he lives his life like he's just a relaxed easygoing guy it's no problem you could be high all day and live his life and he's obviously wildly successful with this strategy yeah loudly second point I was gonna I was gonna make on that too though was there does not appear to be any tolerance at the cb2 receptor so she she attaches to the cb1 receptor and that's and that's where we know we can get tolerance you know some people you know they they have some pain they use some THC and sometimes they need a little bit more same sometimes asleep you know they use THC it'll work and then we'll stop working with CBD - we haven't seen that meaning like the people who you know get get seizure control generally they don't need to increase of dose like the girl I was talking about earlier you know I first subscriber I think when she was 20 and she was by him 20 she's 25 now she's never increased her dose and she's just used the same amount to CBD for the last think we should really stop talking about CBD I just wanted to make a note on the on the Italian someone I just want to make a note that CB to the doesn't appear to be tolerance it's all yeah it's just there's just such a significant impact when when it comes to especially edible THC it's a there's a significant impact on people's state of mind and it's not always good no that's just a fact we", "Br6ujspS_h0": "hey guys thanks for joining me today we are here with my newest video blog because this video blog is my RSO trip so this is my journey with art with the RSO I'll be doing 100 grams of RSO in less than the next hundred days so figured I would kind of show you my journey where we're going to start and where we're going to go we are working with Rick Simpson oil so RSO oil this is what we call new on the market it's called gorilla balm it is a 28 percent THC it is a hybrids of gorilla glue number four and THC bomb which are both hybrid indicas so it'll be really really good so we're gonna dab this RSO first so just to give you a look at what we're going to be dabbing this is the gorilla balm RSO so a little bit more about me my name is Nicola thanks for joining me today I have bladder cancer as well as interstitial cystitis and ulcerative colitis I am a terminal cancer patient so I decided to go on the journey of our SLE oils with this I will be marking my journey through this calendar as we start so here tomorrow on the 24th you'll see here is where we're going to be starting our our XO oil so tonight our your today are we're going to be doing setting this up putting in the refrigerator and then getting it ready to start for the morning and then you'll see notes on this if they appear every day so it'll be pretty cool so just as a little bit of an introduction this is the are so this is the gorilla balm just to give you a kind of good look at it this is what a one-pound amount of cannabis will turn into RSO so we're looking at about a hundred grams of RSO here that we have made into our cure so I'm going to put in come with me we are going to set this up for tomorrow's dose so the first thing I'm going to do is I like to have these little containers to where I can close them up but this has the silicone drums inside I pull them out so I have a duplicate because my skill likes to turn off and on on its own so this way we can keep the scale going then when I refrigerate it it all goes into the plastic container sealed up and we're good to go so let's go ahead and start measuring this so one of the things that I have learned is to make my spoon a little sticky to get the RSO off of the spoon otherwise it drips really really slowly and I just want to get one gram 1.0 on the skin kind of looks like fudge and that would be word skillful mouth so 20:51 was an underrated way it let it zero out oh yeah okay so this will be our first dose of the medication and now I'm going to pack it and seal it forever refrigeration overnight and we'll be back tomorrow to take the medication so remember you can also dab with your RSL oil but the cure is ingesting the RSO so if you're dabbing method or you're putting it into your pre-roll you are still consuming it but you're not consuming enough at one point in time to really work so if you're using this as a cancer treatment or as a debility debilitating condition treatment or pain management do make sure that you ingest it as well because that's the way you're going to need to do it guys remember this is for medical cannabis patients and adults hit the subscribe button this will be a hundred days of RSO as always fly free while I [ __ ] cancer", "XQMHIiu1JFs": "hello I'm venom 4:20 and today I'm gonna be showing you how to make caviar [Music] before we get started with anything else let's go ahead and take a quick dab so one of the big keys to how I'm showing you to do this for cheap is because I'm showing you how to do it with some reeds and you'll notice when you take a nice low temp dab you're gonna have a little bit of reuse I tend to keep mine in this little jar just like that got that out of the way so first off the things you're gonna need are some nugs something to do this over I'm using some parchment paper you're gonna need a little Bowl or a little dish to hold the key then you're gonna need the actual Keeffe itself just from the bottom of three-part grinder you're gonna need some type of oil to cover the nugs in so the idea is you're going to be covering the nugs and oil then rolling them and Keith this is all stuff I have already at home but it's even better to use like honey oil another good one you can use is distillate another good one is rosin and you're also gonna want some gloves too because this is going to be a sticky mess at some point so it's then good to sticky in here [Music] so now the goal is to wrap this whole bud in oil let's go ahead get this going and we'll just take a nice see there [Music] see that's just pretty gettin towed it already just coat it as much as you can [Music] now that's fully coded and then we're just going to take our little jar keep like that and we're just going to start pressing it down just like that [Music] [Music] and now it's probably starting to look a lot like something you've said you know we're expecting [Music] that is what I'm talking about right there that is a fully formed ball perfectly round Moonrock for you oh one down we're gonna go ahead and do this one more time I'm gonna go a little bit lighter on it than I did last time because this one's like a little bit like a play-doh ball you know it's it's too soft [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah that one's this one's mostly hash oil kind of the difference is a little bit this one feels a lot better just a little bit less oil I spread it out a little bit more even this one has a bunch better texture as this one's like a [ __ ] gooey mess I put on so much hash oil but it's just I mean look at that that's too much there's a little nugge pot in there but I mean not much so I'm actually I break that little tiny piece and make it its own little moon rock so that guy too he's an hour like it's so so and this one I can I'm just flying away that's just so like kief so oh yeah but way to get my channel on this one I am like I'm just pulling off the hash oil and rolling it in the key I think I'm creating my own new thing right now I'm calling these comments with AK a little venom comments and that's just pure hash oil and Keith rolled into a little low ball making new things the cat see Ziggy likes a chef I'm just glad he's sleeping on the chair next to me and not [ __ ] getting involved with this one cuz it's too messy those are cool they feel like a little like candies or something a little caramel balls but they're just pure oil drops rolled and Keith from the excess I had made off that moon rock just pulling it off now that I pulled off all that hash oil look how much smaller that is I was able to take all of that off of that by pulling out so I weigh over did the oil you don't want to do that because that actually sucked like this one and this one now are like perfect you got these perfect ones so now these ones have like a great consistency and these are kind of cool I like these little new inventions I came up with I'm sure it's been done I'm sure someone's had it if anyone knows about these put it in the comments below and tell me if anyone has a name form or anything like that because if not I'm coin in that [ __ ] they're little little comments but okay so got your moon rocks here and now these ones feel really good they're really solid and they're gonna break apart fine we got this little mini moon not here another way I like to do it is to take all that oil we got it and just start spreading it onto there we're gonna touch it for two seconds and really [Music] it's got all these little chunks honey there yeah Randy the same thing just go spread it over anything it sticks to alright so there you go that's another way to do it right there to is to take a paper cover it in oil cover it and keep and there you go I've heard these called caviar or moon rocks I think moon rocks is more of a thing that's been coined to a certain brand I think it's corrupt its corrupts moon rock that's it yep so I believe that technically moon rock is coined by that guy and that's like a brand that he grows and that's his thing so technically this is all caviar so let's let's clear that up I've been calling it moon rocks and a little insider knowledge on that as well as when caviar was first coming out I need someone who had you know the hens had just a dispensary they knew what was going on in there they worked there and he always told me not to get caviar and I'm like why and he's like well okay did the coming Aaron type thing is like the thing is is sometimes we get bud that's just really really shitty it looks like [ __ ] there's no crystals it just doesn't really do much for us so what they started doing is rolling it in oil rolling it in Keith and hiding it just like you know you could take something that's not very good and turn it really good you know what I mean you could take pretty much swag and make it besa got one more thing for you now the last one we're going to do is something called Sun rocks so what we're gonna do is actually instead rolling it in Keef we're going to roll it in all this and you'll see how there's all these shards they actually work a lot better if it wasn't so [ __ ] warm right now and every time you break it up you know there's a little tiny shards all over the place little flecks so we're actually going to be using that we have that all piled up put that to the side I'm gonna steal one last rap [Music] he's pretty much covered now we're gonna go ahead and take that and start rolling it [Music] [Music] [Music] and then you got one of those guys it's like a quantum Jim Rohn [Music] [Music] [Music] this is an OG Mike Montgomery double bubble bubbler Mike Montgomery is one of the original artists at the Chong glass company and this is a UV one it lights up really nice I'd like to eventually own a piece by like all the dudes who used to work there let's go ahead and load one of these [ __ ] up so I'm gonna go ahead and break that apart you can see it just [Music] crumbles and there you got the layers like to give a special thanks out to mr. Chuck I'm gonna put a link to his Instagram he helped me acquire this bad boy I love this thing so it's got the Homer smoking a blunt [ __ ] Satan Flanders to Satan Flannery's I should say and playboy Oh Marge oh yeah that's [ __ ] awesome awesome piece awesome moon rocks again gather so it was a little son rock here made ourselves some new little comments I don't know if that's a thing and also just I think the easiest way is to just roll it on paper and smoke it that way a lot of people put down the outside of the paper but that's kinda I feel like for show more which is fine sometimes because it's cool to can I don't look at it do its thing you know but it makes a mess I think when it's on the inside it only makes sense anyway so that's how I make my own caviar for next to nothing that's all from reuse I saved from my dabs and put my jar for later it's all from Keef that I collected on the bottom of the three-part grinder and it's from you know just any type of bud you want to use like I said I like making it myself because I know what ingredients this is the cheapest way to do it not the best you know what I mean you know all stuff that we've collected now if you get some really good distillate or some really good rosin or you know all these different ingredients you can make it yourself and excellent excellent quality this is just a really awesome link to experience if you even like it again super awesome thank you to everyone who helped make this happen thank you to everyone who watched go ahead and let me know how you like to make it I'm sure this is kind of an open thing this is you know what I'm doing isn't the way to do it it's just a cheap way to show you how to do it if you have other tips on that go ahead and leave it I think that's awesome anyway go ahead and check out some older videos be sure to LIKE share and [ __ ] subscribe from me and Ziggy take it easy keep it keep see you next time", "1tiMkgCVB_8": "we waited from the herb table put this here for me yeah you guys so what's here guys it's like Sunday night I was down at the UM the healing corner over a weekend on Saturday supposed you picked up a couple new things that I put on pre-order there and uh I'm pretty excited I'll bring you a medication that's just this is probably one of the like most special medications that have actually brought you throughout this whole entire Lake series or whatever that I want to call it um I do have two products in the bag that are new to the healing client you know more numbers Connecticut Connecticut we dispensary just a state of the earth that makes sense but I got some not a new crumble from from key relief the cherry Thunder [ __ ] that's a fire s strain if you've seen the flowers when we were through the flowers [ __ ] green they were great many guinea pigs so I got the Chinese Thunder [ __ ] crumble here but then I also got a one millimeter syringe of the Rick Simpson oil I've never really about the risks of spoilers it's supposed to be like um almost like a miracle cannabis product I mean for what it's worth and I don't know if it does or does not if it does it's an amazing product it's amazing thing it's supposed to have the ability to help remove more possibly like remover we're emitter eight or just kind of back off I guess I don't want to say the word cancer or certain other elements like a masters I guess apparently the medical qualities of this product is supposed to be amazing I can't vouch but I've never had it I've never tried it in if it works for patients ask me I don't want to say does or doesn't just that's a really fine line to walk on which I don't want to walk that line all I want to do is bring you the medication that they present and if it works for patients and it does amazing things that is so amazingly good and if it saves lives that's awesome I don't want to say it does or it doesn't because I can't say if it does or doesn't but if it helps you here it is it's the rigsum soil and now Richie Simpson well is not actually an exact strength it's a process of extracting all of the cannabinoids in all of the medical properties from the candidates plan into a super super decarbonized super super potent pipe you can basically I just make it out of any string man and you can make it those TV can make it out behind it it's the process of doing it that strips all the community blades off in all the super pumped th C's off it just makes you super pulling and that it cope you know a lot of products okay we're gonna try it out now I did a little homework on it was really debatable you could definitely eat it I think that's like the main process of Rick Simpson oil is that over time it's not an instantaneous thing like you're doing than all your animals click yes take it over time and increase your dosage over time I think basically what you do is you're supposed to work your way up to almost to the before you take off a gram of it actually predate throughout the day like a morning doze an afternoon dose and the night end goes and if you take it orderly a drop here you know and then you increase the three or four drops or 600 ups orally or and this is I guess debatable or not you can also vaporize it I don't know if you're supposed to if you actually vaporize it I don't know if you get the full medical benefits that you're supposed to I think it's actually for medicinal purposes better to eat it and just it orally and what'll happen is when you do in just orally it's gonna make you very tired or over a period of time you're gonna like that tiredness will wear off during the day but the main point of is to get rest they said the rest is what actually helps the medicine the body heal rejuvenating do its business and that's what it's supposed to it's just a great night time sleep relief which is awesome during they make you tired that'll pass when you doubt it I don't really know what's gonna happen with medical effects we're gonna find out I mean I guess it's nicely in a bowl you're instantly better I use me medical morning for a lot of who's mental symptoms and this isn't necessarily my necessarily more for physical animals but we'll see so with that being said let's check out somebody Simpson well you know if I do and I'm gonna dab this don't you know I talked about I asked lost a small group says well I guess I understand the more beneficial way to user exception or else to ingest it we might even track drop of it as well so let's find out but it's gonna be super super super potent that's that's that's really so this right here this is the UM this is the sapphire crumble this is the umm not the friction well obviously but this is the Sapphire crumble which is the UM trained under [ __ ] this the chase under [ __ ] Rumble we get stag review I'll bring you that in the next up day or two and then I this is what it is it's from sarah plant by the way I didn't mention that I apologize this is a third plant product and here's what it's called see the third plant 360 X they make it out of a hybrid strain now look at this now look at the numbers here if you can see the numbers on here the THC right there five hundred ninety seven milligrams see how high that is and our pollinators and then the CBD there's 12 milligrams but five hundred ninety seven milligrams of THC and 60 milligrams of the THC a and that's that's obviously pretty potent so let's see what's up with that no that's that's actually pretty awesome look at this alright so here's what happens when you get this money to show us when you get this I was gonna dump on the table what you get you get not only do you get this nice syringe here it is you get these no I do get the syringe here this is pretty interesting so this is going back to the oral aspect of it like to take a little medication table here not only do you get the syringe and this is it yeah this is the 360 when the little oil syringe but look this came in the package - it's all right here in the package look capsules here so you inject it put it in there and then make your own Akala you orally take so with that being said and look to see yo you can get a little bit more than a milliliter this is what you get you get this syringe strapping is puffing and just put on your dab or if you put it in your mouth this is what you get so you could see in this little bit of just this little bit of oil maybe that little tiny bit there's actually six hundred million wounds the THC says give you some super super potent stuff super potent stuff um like that's that's amazing and it's just just an awesome just basically an awesome thing that they have this product available to patients now I okay dear I uh I don't even know exactly how the process they make this is I really highly doubt they use an alcohol product but I could be wrong so what I'm doing is I'm not screwing cap here and now that smells smells very like actually smells kind of chocolatey oops they just uh come in my house okay this is very costly and very holding like marijuana let's see what happens I'm gonna squirt out a little bad here onto my god damnit here yeah there we go we got what I did here was I pulled out I'll try to show you guys this put this cap back on here sure pull the string me back a little bit take it around okay no here's what I got he's pulled off nothing huge just a little tiny dab like that now besides that miss I'm also gonna try to eat it I think before we leave so let's see what's up great hey let's see how it works as a dad Rick's Epsilon so this is supposed to have amazing healing properties up and down the board for basically a ton of symptoms it's if you read up on the brick zip similarly you can also look at it it's the websites Phoenix tears dossier with Phoenix tears d800e ni x te AR s dot CIA thinks there's that's his actual site he'll tell you how to make this writ exceptional if you want to make yourself because you can't just actually buy like the actual exceptional farm and you gotta like coming to yourself these guys always have a hair care plan for us cuz I was pretty accessible for us and there to get medical marijuana patients which is awesome okay so I'm not even sure how this is gonna taste I'm not sure what's gonna be like but it's more for the medicinal purposes over the wall so by all means big sips low you can absolutely dead that that doesn't taste bad at all not at all pretty heavy taste pretty heavy tastes air and uh that was a taxi really potent that's weird feeling I think that just feels like you really did just ingest a lot of TV in your body you know weird Whaley if you look alive your body don't and then feel really like them a head that really did go right to the body effect like way to my body effect um it kind of gave me like a heavy feeling it feels like there's just stuff going through me right now yes that's the best way to describe it um well it's that's definitely pretty potent we're gonna do another dab here and yeah it feels like I feels like it's almost like a freight train just hanging a body lime just overload you I think that's the actual whole purposes is really just supposed to overload body with TV and just so much of it at one time but it actually just rips everything out of you I think that's the whole purpose of this whole rig Snorlax trains cuz they you're supposed to get and will be reunited under the mothers out there that actually is definitely doing the trick so yes you can a down on it for sure just there if I didn't prove that and yes I do feel it a lot I could see if you did this on a daily basis continuously this what village up where you kind of mean um down just walking around tennis I'm you know well but it's just a strip your body clean basically everything that's nice it feels like because they connect smoke ball joint and if there's so much t18 and once we sleep all right the power factory over to joy like the way the medication is instantly super medicated that's kind of how this is especially in that Hydra feelings now they can make this an indica or sativa form as well like it said it's just made out of strains and you run it out of it's the process of making it's a whole plant extract sit sideways here the whole thing is extracted so Russia has bono it's good now with that being said you can definitely feel pretty medicated that will all turn into an oral ingestion of this right now and see how that is I guess I'll uh just make myself a little pill here I guess um what I'll do is I let's make until yeah let's see what's up just try to uh I guess ok I set this up every year could see me what I'm doing I guess nothing they see anything there's a great day so Portuguese you okay let's see you see don't you see hey let's try to make a pill here and we got a little work here it and we'll do a so grab when these things here in one of these things here and then uh just uh a little squirt in and [ __ ] and they'll see what happens okay so I didn't use as you can see I didn't use too much that one milliliter there's still a decent amount of it left so I think this goes on the inside so yeah what we'll do is we'll just grate this in here if you can see take this no just push there goes now I put like basically right there I just put totals probably does a good amount we put a quarter about a quarter of a leader into there as you can see so that's probably was the equivalent of like [ __ ] at least five good dabs ok so let me just cap this up for her Oakland and then I do so now I got that there and what we do is take this little chap right here this little piece right here and basically just squeeze it together boom okay Wow well we just made it was wrong personal Rick super simple so yeah be nice huh okay so that being said right yeah okay right so that's pretty cool um hey guys so this has been pretty fun uh yeah now we got oh man okay okay so the Rick ships it oil from our airplane it's at the healing corner right now go get some guys CT users but she'll hit me like a ton of bricks and a half hour worth piece", "CzMHusSAZs8": "we've uh removed most of the sticks that you've got in here um a couple more sticks to come out you don't need to grind this you don't want to grind this you want to basically break the flowers up that gives more access to the cannabinoids that are on the trichomes in those flowers it's going to basically break that up get rid of the stick okay so here we have our raw material that is prepared this will not be decarb uh when you're extracting with alcohol you do not need to decarb so this is now ready to go into the jar and into the freezer now we're going to put this jar and this everclear uh in the freezer to get it very very very cold we're looking to start this entire process with the biomass and the alcohol in this case ethanol somewhere between 20 and 30 below celsius some people want it to be much colder than that the colder it is the less green that it will pull the less chlorophyll that it will pull but the problem with making it super cold is it negatively affects the solubility of the cannabinoids as well and that means you generally have to have a little bit longer soak time but in any case that's subject to experimentation by you the objective of this of course is to pull as much cannabinoids while at the same time pulling the least amount of green from the chlorophyll here are the two bottles of 190 proof everclear and the raw material in a freezer we're going to get this really really cold i suspect that we'll be running down around -25 by the time that this is cooled off this will take overnight this particular type of freezer has a dial type gauge on it as opposed to a digital gauge this allows me to run the temperature down to far lower temperatures than i would get with a digital gauge we're now at minus 27.9 centigrade and our raw materials and our alcohol are now cold enough to begin the extraction portion of the process so now pour the cold ethanol into the biomass i'm using about 1500 milliliters of ethanol into that biomass and you can see it is essentially uh submerged in there and i'm going to shake that up just a little bit and put it back in the freezer for five minutes here we have our first wash now what we're going to do is put it back into the freezer get it really really cold again and then we're going to run it through a winterizing process in the essential in order to remove some of the fats and lipids here we have the winterization filtering going on you can see the flow and this is the uh moisturization jar it's almost empty now you've pulled most of the fluid through the little vacuum pump is good enough for doing this but if you want to accelerate it you would connect a third-party vacuum pump and make it much much faster you can see that the filter has got quite a bit of sediment or some kind of debris on it and this could be waxes lipids or bio-particles this is a 2 micron filter and it's quite dark now we can see the waxes and bio particles that are accumulated here we can see the waxes and lipids that are on there this is the clarity and the color of the first wash we can simply put the multi-purpose lid on and begin our concentration and after boiling off we now have uh this concentrate there is still a bit of ethanol in here but this will be left to evaporate and then we will have our final extract", "o3fYypXjEeM": "hi buds it's candy here today I'm going to be making THC infused strawberry lemonade that I made with distillate so I'm going to be a hundred percent honest with you I'm leaving a timestamp here so you guys can go straight to the recipe because I've made this way more complicated than I needed to be and basically this video you're gonna watch me turn a mistake into something magical I can start feeling the heaviness right now Dex first things first you're going to need a gram of distillate roughly it does all the grams and I'll be talking more about it later on two cups of sugar 1 cup of Everclear this recipe calls for a two-to-one ratio and we're using Everclear to dissolve the distillate that Everclear is something you could potentially skip next we need roughly two cups of half strawberries as well as one and a half cup of fresh squeezed lemons next you want to preheat the oven at 200 degrees and leave it at 200 degrees so that where we don't activate the THC and I honestly just so it you don't need to activate the TFC because it's already there so we just want to make sure we conserve as much as possible next get the 2 cups of sugar and put it into a pan then get the 1 cup of Everclear important to a bowl now we're going to be putting that one gram of distillate into the so that we can start mixing this distillate roughly houses around a thousand milligrams of THC in it the reason I wanted to put it and Everclear was so that it would dissolve evenly and that way I could put it evenly throughout the sugar my original plan was to make granulated sugar about what I did was I messed up and I closed the oven door and then it turned into a syrup so then I decided to work with what I had but yes I will be making an actual tutorial on how to do the guy kneeling sugar now we just mix the Everclear and the distillate together next you pour the mixture onto the sugar you could use a little bit of a wider pan than we did then we mixed it all together and make sure that everything is saturated evenly next just place to the 200 degree preheated oven and set your timer for 13 minutes and check for daily and this is where I messed up my original plan I did close the other door so it did cook down and it created an actual cistern so if you do want to make granular sugar you simply just leave the oven door open so that way it can all evaporated but then you get this golden to cool this is where the real recipe begins you simply boil two cups water and keep it on a very low simmer because you do not want to activate the THC and then I poured the syrup that I created into the water just to dilute it a little bit now here I'm going to be placing the actual instructions on how you can make it a lot easier and save the headaches basically ideally you would just put the two cups of water melt two cups of sugar into it and then add a distillate right on it I actually enjoyed several clearer taste to it it had a little bit of a move to the lemonade so I didn't mind it now it's time for the lemonade start cutting an equivalent of two cups of hats strawberries put them into a little bowl and then start mashing away you could certainly use a blender but according to my friend he doesn't believe in them use this now it's time to roll some lemons and get the juices flowing and start to squeeze the lemon juice in there I did get a roughly an equivalent of a cup and a half of lemon juice it could certainly be anything ever they want and then I add the mashed and pureed strawberry onto it I actually enjoyed the masher because it left Jack pretty pulpy give it a good stir and then we're ready to add the syrup we created put it in along with two cups of water and that's pretty much it after giving it a good little stir simply serve in chilled glasses and enjoy I really enjoyed making this granted it was a headache and a half just because of a failed experiment but you can always turn something negative into a positive and definitely this was a positive hope you guys enjoy it as we did and I'll see you guys later we're gonna feel it slowly I'm happy you", "T7QdIpttixs": "[Music] welcome to another episode of the cooking with cannabis series my name is chef Cody Lindsay and today we are making tincture cannabis tincture is the oldest form of dispensing cannabis as the medicine and it's super simple all it is is alcohol 80 proof or higher with cannabis added into it the THC will dissolve off the flour into the tincture and off you go today we're gonna be using shish kebob as well as CBD God bud so any kind of alcohol you want to use right now we're gonna make that two different kinds we're going to make a clear one and then we're gonna make a dark one and we're going to use it in two separate applications that they should show you that you're gonna use in your cooking so we're gonna start here with the dark rum one cup and then we're gonna go with gin I chose gin because it's a nice fruity kind of flavor it's not too overpowering it's the same thing a cup so we're gonna use the CBD in with the dark rum because the application that we're going to use in we're not going to want it too high in THC so we're just going to add that in there 3.5 grams of cannabis into the one cup of dark rum and then we are also going to add 3.5 grams of cannabis into this one cup of gin and that's as easy as it is all you do is put the lid back on give it a stir put the lid back on give it a stir strain after 24 hours and you're done we're gonna make some beautiful vanilla extract we have our dark rum here kind of in the same way that we made the tincture is the same way we're gonna make the vanilla extract all we're gonna do is cut our vanilla beans in half dump them in close the lid about a month later you'll have the best vanilla extract you've ever tasted in your whole life and the next one we're going to create cannabis infused sugar so we already have our gin tincture ready to go we're gonna take two tablespoons of our gin tincture add it into our two cups of sugar and that's going to give us cannabis infused sugar add that in and then just mix it all around you can see it's starting to come together starting to get a little wet so you simply take that sugar add it onto a pan this is what we're gonna do is we're gonna dry it out we're gonna evaporate some of the alcohol and then we're gonna come back and have it ready now it's ready to be put in a 220 degree oven for approximately half an hour oh yeah perfectly good see the alcohol is evaporated of course the sugars gonna stick together a little bit it's been wet it's been added to some heat to your sugar dish so there you go two tinctures two additional recipes to use of those tinctures and multiple multiple ways you can use them thank you very much for joining us today if you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up and subscribe and share and please visit the walnut soldier calm where you to find many recipes and our cooking with cannabis cookbook then again thanks very much [Music] you", "g7bApQhA1H8": "on today's video I'm going to teach you how to make cannabis infused butter or oil in the instant pot so we're gonna talk about why to use an instant pot how to do it I'm gonna give you a quick demonstration as well and then just so you know the instructions for this recipe are printed below so you don't have to write anything down hi my name is Andrea hard I'm a cannabis coach and educator and I post new videos here every Saturday morning I also offer private consultations over the phone in-person workshops around the London Ontario area and online classes from the comfort of your own home okay let's talk about why we use an instant pot well this is the number one advantage the instant pot internal temperature gets to 242 degrees Fahrenheit which is literally perfect for D carving and infusing and it's a nice constant steady temperature so you don't have to worry about fluctuations it also makes it so that it's really not all that smelly at all infusing in your instant pot in a mason jar is way less alerting to your neighbors then doing it say on the stovetop or in a crock pot and it is crazy quick this is why people love the instant pot or any kind of pressure cooker in general is because it makes things really fast the first step in the process is to deke our beer cannabis and that turns your THCA and cbda into THC and CBD which is what you want you don't have to grind it first you're just gonna put it into a mason jar close it up finger tight and put that into a bath in the instant pot where the bath water is about halfway up the jar so if your jars halfway full make sure that the water is halfway up the jar as well and you're gonna set it to 40 minutes on manual then let it release for 10 minutes natural pressure release and then release the rest of it pressure yourself and you have d carb cannabis in a flash you don't have to infuse this cannabis you could just use this d carb cannabis as a sprinkle on top of spaghetti or you could put it into capsules the point is you could use it right now as a ste carb you don't have to infuse but if you want to the instant pot is great for that as well so now you're gonna lightly grind the bud you're not trying to make it into powder you're just trying increase the surface area slightly add in your oil or butter make sure that it's melted first and make sure that there's at least of enough liquid to cover the cannabis that you have in there the more liquid you add the less potent your infusion will be then put that mason jar back in the instant pot and it's a little bath for 40 minutes on manual again ten minutes natural pressure release then open it up and strain it or not and you have cannabis infused oil or butter which is amazing super fast much much faster than any other way as for storage you can keep your your all of your abusers always in a dark and cool place butter should be kept in the fridge or freezer and coconut oil could be kept on the counter or also in the fridge the great thing about infusing cannabis into oil or butter is that it allows the cannabis to last for so much longer it doesn't degrade once it's infused into an infusion as for dosing there's no real precise way to find out exactly what's in your infusion unless you have it lab tested but for the home cook I have a little solution for you so this infusion calculator allows you to put in the information that you know about your cannabis and it will spit out how many milligrams of THC or CBD are in your infusion so I'm going to show that to you now this is at the wake-and-bake website and if you haven't been here before you should definitely check it out it's amazing so if you know the THC percentage of your plant material you can type it in because you have lab tested cannabis if you don't you can go to a site like Leafly and type in the strain name and get a general idea so you type in how many grams that you're gonna be using for my infusion that we're gonna do today I'm doing 14 grams into one cup of oil so I know that with my cannabis I'm gonna have 20 100 grams of THC and not very much of CBD and that in each teaspoon I have about 43 milligrams of THC so that's really helpful for me to have an idea of how potent my infusion is again this is not perfect there's lots and lots of variables to go on there but it's a great starting point and even if you have used the dosing calculator it is still really important that you start low and go slow and be your own guinea pig each infusion that you make might be slightly different and you don't want to have a really bad experience because you're going off of what you think will happen so I encourage you to keep a consumption journal and write down how does it make you feel how did you feel before you took it how long does it last keep all that in mind and that will help you really homey and Nona how potent your infusion is all right so let's get started I have here coconut oil you couldn't view this infuse this into butter or any kind of oil that you wanted but I'm going to use coconut oil this is sunflower lecithin we'll talk about this after this is bendy car and here I have my 14 grams of cannabis I'm gonna put this into its little water back in here again you want to make sure that the water in the pot is at least enough to cover what you have in the dark put the lid on and set the timer for 40 minutes and then walk away I'll see you in a bit as you can see my D carving is done it's already done about 10 minutes of natural pressure release and I'm gonna just let the rest of the pressure out open it up alright so I have some perfectly he D card to cannabis in here super hot careful when you're opening this so um D carbon cannabis will be a little bit browner than when you put it in your don't smell a little bit different once your cannabis is cooled off you're going to grind it up I have a coffee grinder here I have a separate coffee grinder for coffee or that would make for some very interesting morning the great thing about this method is that you can do it all in one meter so you're just gonna put this back in your mason jar then I have a cup of coconut oil that I've warmed up in the microwave first I'm also putting in a teaspoon of sunflower lecithin this helps to emulsify the mixture so that the cannabinoids don't separate from the oil it also helps the cannabinoids to enter your blood-brain barrier a little bit more quickly so it doesn't actually make it more potent but it does help to make it feel like it's working a little bit better however so I'm flower lecithin tastes like crap and you know I really hate it so I only had a teaspoon most people recommend a tablespoon to two tablespoons per cup but I recommend that you start low with that inserts and go slow and see how it goes for you then you just put it back in your jar and shake it up back in the instant pot before another bath of 40 minutes on manual and then we'll be done I've got my infused cannabis oil here you can now strain this using a cheesecloth make sure that you really squeeze the cheesecloth to get all the beautiful camera soil out you can then take that cheesecloth and dunk it in a tea and a pot of chai and then you can have some high chives there's still some medicinal benefit left in even the satchel of spent cannabis material but with this one I'm not even gonna strain it I started to add my unstrained cannabis oils and butters right into my baked goods and nobody seems to notice I'm gonna make this into cannabis infused protein bites and that would be next week's video all right if you have any questions I am super happy to answer them just leave them in the comment section down below and are you following me on Facebook and Instagram I really hope you do the links are below I post daily cannabis education there every day and if you head to my website reveal cannabis column you will be send some free stuff like an awesome recipe book and a video that teaches you how to get started with cannabis so why not head over there now until then I will see you next week", "3V4wLZjxwY8": "what's going on you too so I made a video last night and I had some technical difficulties so be sure to hang out you can see it you guys really didn't miss too much but all you really missed is me talking about my ingredients and watching me putting it in and all that stuff but other than that you guys are good and check it out additive you're gonna add to your base very very strong you don't want to kind of make do all this and have it just you know you have to eat 10 candies to do whatever you're trying to do you want to make it worth it spend the money put the effort in and I assure you it'll be well worth it in the end so it's been about four and a half five minutes now and we are just crossing 240 degrees so I like I said this doesn't happen super fast it but once we hit around 270 degrees it will start moving a little bit a little bit faster so when you're flavoring with this recipe you want to use one of these kind of bottles you can get them at a Seymour Michaels any arts of crest or you can get them at Walmart when I went to Walmart they only have peppermint cinnamon and that's not my thing but right here I have cherry and I have an orange oil that I like to add so usually if you're going to say if you're going for lollipops or like life savers or anything like that flavor to get that exact flavor like they come out like it comes out of their factory you want it for this recipe when you use a half of one of these bottles and a half of orange oil bottle and it'll taste just like you bought some lifesavers what the orange oil does adds a little citrus and it just gives a little brightness to it but you don't need that I did a batch with just watermelon and you know I loved them they tasted great it wasn't super watermelon flavored and to be quite honest with you I hate the flavor of water now so these these oils then they they taste great but I know you're probably wondering why you don't add it now so you have it all incorporated it's all said and done well this is a different kind of liquid than what we got going on here obviously so if you added this to a 320 degree sugar base and this will probably burn out see they want you to wait till 250 degrees to add your additives if your flavoring but I feel like that is just way too late of a weight I like to do at almost 275 degrees you're gonna deal a little more heat when you gives you a little bit more time because once you add this stuff this is going to cool down drastically and fast so and one thing you don't want to do with this is mix it around a bunch because if you think if you live in New Jersey you walk along the boardwalk what do they make in salt water taffy so you keep stretching the sugar adding air adding air what's it gonna turn into a taffy it's not going to be as much of a hard candy it's gonna keep out again it's gonna it could turn into a candy corn which is honestly not a bad texture in itself either but it just now we're done for right now well what I like about doing these little candies and gummies and stuff like that is these molds there's so many damn cool molds that you can pick up like a robot dude here it got lollipops dinosaurs and it's like pixelated dinosaurs are pretty cool I seen Super Mario Batman ones like Legos you can actually take the Lego ones and build with them so there's like really cool stuff you could be doing with candy and if you get really good at it you know pull your kids aside and you can do a day with the kids and show them how to make the favorite candies and kids blown away that you can actually make this yourself it'll definitely be way more impressed with this than a batch of cookies that Pillsbury makes just don't have any funny business to it so we're crossing about nine minutes now it's a nine 10 minutes and we are hitting 250 degrees so in about four minutes we only went about ten degrees so once we're all mixed up and our basis set we add our additives we add our flavoring the name of the game is speed and just I don't want to say steady hand because if if you know me I am the last guy to ever have a steady hand you can people will hand me a 2 ounce ladle got a 2 ounce souffle cup and say fill up some butters just the laughs at me because I shake but for some reason I can do this pretty well but you want to almost come down and just go in a line 1 1 1 1 1 if you're just all over the place you're going to lose quite a bit of what you're doing here and nobody wants that but I would say 1 to 2 ounces for this batch usually I do a 2 cup of sugar 1 cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water and so I'll do it it's basically a double batch of this that I would do 2 to 4 ounces but this I think 1 1 2 2 maybe 2.5 ounces will be good all right it's been about 4 4 minutes later and we are just hitting 290 degrees so I'll check back up at the end a couple of minutes all right it's about 3 minutes later and now we just hit hard crack we're at 300 degrees so most people will want to go to 310 but we're going to 320 so I'll check back when we get there well it's about 30 seconds later we're at 310 so we're almost there so get ready all right so we hit 320 degrees so now what we're gonna do is so now this is a so now this is a hard Canyon and it's going to be very hard it's not going to be questionably hard and it's not going to be and it's not gonna lose its hardness from what we had so now we wait until about 270 degrees and we're gonna add about one to two ounces of whatever additive you're gonna add and your flavor so we'll check back in about five minutes when we get there so what I like to use to make my my tinctures or if whatever I'm going to make the most is I'd like to use either a leave o or a magical butter machine the the two of them it's it's perfect the you can perfectly adjust the temperatures and you could really make it long and really strong or you can make it really fast and get you get it done fast so if you're looking for a way to do it without having to you know use mason jars and stuff like that look into buying a leave out or a magical butter machine those two things makes the process so much easier and not just easier but it makes it stronger and enough of talking we're there so now that we're at 270 degrees we got to move fast so speed and accuracy is the name of the game now do not let any sugar touch you so first get all your stuff ready because you're gonna add at one shot so I'm gonna add my flavoring to my additive half I want of the cherry I'm gonna do and I'm gonna do half of the orange oil now people like to do food coloring and all that you don't have to I don't like it because I just don't like the I like the natural color that you get so this part you don't mix too much the more air you're gonna add the worse off it's gonna look so you got to be fast go okay so we're all mixed up don't know what to do let's go and then we pour accuracy now look guys I have super shaky hands and I'm go it's all about accuracy if you tried to reheat this it would still work but it's not gonna be as clear its goal is is clarity and just like I said if you reheat it you're gonna be mixing it again so you're going to add more air the more air you add the different the texture is gonna get try some of these but a nice steady pour and you could if and when we look you're going to tell that we didn't even have that much waste so this a little bit I got here and the rest I got here I can reheat and I can make other candies so what we'll do now is we're gonna is we'll wait and I'll give it about it don't take long about three minutes five minutes and these things will be rock-hard and check them out so check back in a minute all right everybody we're all done so let's take a look at what we got just like that all you gotta do is pop them out and move and look these things they're rock-hard they don't stick together nothing and you're really that worried you can get some powdered sugar and you're good look at that perfect so I got these little robot guys so many cool things you could do and I got these little dinosaurs so what I like to do is I like to have little ones and I like to have full-size ones because a lot of ones honestly where you're gonna find yourself like in these little small ones the best at least the parquet knees but like I said guys super easy super fast and anybody can do this you've got to get yourself two simple ingredients throw it all together and you're home free you can take these out in the lake with you and your fish and boom you're good but if you guys like what you saw today leaving a like subscribe don't forget to check me on instagram at the edge a chef and a lot of big things happening this week with medical edibles calm which I will be announcing later in the week so definitely be on the lookout for that because there's some big things happening I appreciate you guys watching and as always smoke on", "YDVZV7NDI2I": "what's up everybody welcome to the channel today we're going to be making cannabis kool-aid so let's get into it [Music] the ingredients to make your cannabis kool-aid would be two to three packs of kool-aid next you're gonna need your sugar we're gonna be using two cups total i'm gonna be using one and a half cup of white sugar and a half a cup of brown sugar i'm gonna be using a one gallon pitcher to make my kool-aid and the last ingredients to make our cannabis kool-aid would be your cannabis simple syrup if you don't know how to make the cannabis simple syrup no worry i'm going to leave the link below so the first thing i'm going to do is measure out my sugar [Music] i just measured out one cup of sugar so now what i want to do is take a bow and put my one cup of sugar in that bowl now set the bowl to the side now i'm going to measure out one cup of sugar but this time we're going to measure out a half a cup of white sugar and a half a cup of brown [Music] sugar [Music] all right guys so once you measure out your one cup of sugar put this to the side and what we're going to do is get our pitcher [Music] and add your sugar to it [Music] now add your kool-aid [Music] now mix your ingredients all right guys so now what we're going to do is move this to the side turn your stove on high now i'm going to measure out two cups of water [Music] put your pot on the stove and add the water once your water start boiling add your sugar let the water boil until your sugar is completely dissolved all right guys my simple syrup is now done so while your simple syrup is still hot add it to the kool-aid now mix everything together [Music] so now what we're going to do is add some more water to our pitcher so if you want to you can use water out of the sink but i'm going to be using spring water [Music] once you add your water to your pitcher just mix everything together [Music] now i'm going to put this in the fridge for a few hours [Music] all right guys so i've been about five hours my kool-aid is now cool so now what i'm going to do is infuse our kool-aid using the cannabis simple syrup all right so now what i'm going to do is measure out one cup of cannabis simple syrup so now i'm going to add the simple syrup to my koolaid [Music] now i miss it together [Music] all right guys my cannabis kool-aid is now done thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace", "YXpfchNKqm0": "hi I was doing some plant extractions so I thought I would share my process here you can see the ground up plant in question normally a chemist will do setup like this this is footage stolen from nurdrage if you don't know him go check him out anyway the key feature here is the soxhlet extractor it is a device that you can load up with stuff and it will automatically cycle the fresh solvents through it it is basically automatic self siphoning device if you like me don't have such logic structure or any glassware basically you can use method that I am using here so this is just basic filter paper that I modified to allow vapor to pass through it of course it has to be compatible with your solvent on top of that you can place random container that you will fill with cold water ideally this should be glass container but in the past I have used even polypropylene plastic cups also here is some kindergarten science in case you wonder how you can make effectively holes in this filter paper you can see that I intentionally offset the first hole from the bottom this offset basically depends on how much material you have now let's put in just a little bit of a solvent I'm using 50 milliliters of ethanol put your stuff that you want to extract into this filter paper do this outside your extraction container because you can contaminate liquid then a few your cooling container with water and be sure to keep outside dry now you can turn on your heat source and just wait actually you should periodically check the temperature of your cooling water one little problem this setup have is that the filter paper likes to suck in the solvent and carry stuff with it this is not a big deal unless you work with extremely small quantities in which case you shouldn't use this setup anyway you should continue with extraction until you see that the solvent that comes out of the filter paper is basically clear I guess depending what solvent and what you are extracting here you can see plant material after extraction and you can see that is quite off-colored and at this point I tested the extracted plant material and I can confirm that the chemical was not there and here's the extract it should be pale yellow oily resin material but you can see that it has quite greenish tint to it this is due to presence of chlorophyll in this part I will try to extract the chlorophyll from the extract itself unfortunately only way I can destroy chlorophyll presence is by UV fluorescence which would not be so terrible but unfortunately my only resource is this PCB exposure unit I built sometime ago this is about 120 watt light source and the radiation from this Fink is overwhelming when you turn this thing gone basically whole world looks like it's dead and I will have to make some adjustments to the scene so you can see what I can see and now we are cooking there may be much better solutions to separate chlorophyll but I know only about one solvents that can do this and that is propane or butane or mixture of two now this will be a little bit crazy but actually propane mixed with ethanol is not quite that volatile but it's still pretty much flammable so be aware of that at least I mean it should be unless you are five years old anyway so you can see that there is quite clear separation of two fractions since that chlorophyll content is not that different though also in the visible light this is really nice but the question is how do we separate this seriously what did you think if you have one you can use separatory funnel just never never plug it up even though it should handle this pressure there wouldn't be much much higher than one atmosphere of pressure I mean do you see any problem here I repeated this extraction about six or eight times now on the left side you can see the butane fraction and on the right side you can see the ethanol fraction the ethanol one is quite muddy it seems like it has some water content in it to be fair I also fill tributon fraction through some filter paper so but still it wasn't muddy it seemed to be contaminated by some solid pieces now both fractions are right and you can see quite clearly the color difference now let's look at this under UV light [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so you can see this reddish fluorescence that is quite specific to chlorophyll this is the beauty infraction even though you can see some orange a green fluorescent blobs there on the other hand in the ethanol fraction you can see that the whole material is this orange green fluorescent pink although even here you can see some quite a reddish spots that could indicate some presence of chlorophyll so the separation is quite good but not 100%", "i3oUc6F0rUw": "[Music] hey guys this is Leon and you have reached the vibe tribe today we are gonna be making a Tincher with cannabis infused alcohol we have it right here this is called Everclear it is 190 proof and just to say how strong it is vodka is usually 80 proof and this is a hundred and ninety so it's very strong it is illegal in most places I believe in Canada the only place you can get it is Alberta but I will put a link in the description of where you can order from I've heard of people having success getting it that way so the first thing we have to do to make Tincher is we have to deke our VAR marijuana which I have done in a different video I will put it also in the description ok so after you have D carved your marijuana you're going to measure out 7 grams you just need to get a little scale like this you can get them from a 420 shop on the scale here it's 7.0 which I have already done for all of my jars so I have 3 separate jars here there is a lot of people that say different things on about how long you should have it sitting with the alcohol and the marijuana so I'm going to do a little experiment and we are gonna try out three different ones to see which ones are stronger they all are the same lead so let's begin so the first thing you're going to need to do after you like I said after you D carve your marijuana the first thing you're gonna do is break it up and put it in one of these jars you're just gonna break it up and smell their little pieces like this breaking up the weed before the tin sure helps release the trichomes faster which are the resin glands of the pot plant so that's where the THC and the CBD and all the other active cannabinoids are so you have to break it up to fine it's not going to be oxygen exposed for very long interesting fact tin sure actually dates back thousands of years and is in the Guinness Book of World Records ever clears and the the Book of World Records for being the strongest alcoholic drink in the world so that's pretty interesting [Music] so I'm not breaking this up very much just a little bit just to expose all the trichomes that are inside okay so this is a very effective way to extract the cannabinoids out of marijuana alcohol does really well with that so you're just an open up your every clear from the reading I've been doing supposedly you can't smell anything but I can smell things so I'm not going closer I'm not a big fan of alcohol myself but I do like the gummies made from this alcohol so you're gonna do it at 240 mils we're just gonna get close everything doesn't have to be perfect we're just gonna get it as close as we can that's good enough and you're just gonna pour that right in there [Music] I've already broken up all this weed that are in these bottles everybody is different with with alcohol and with with marijuana everybody reacts differently with it I personally get really sick when I drink alcohol but for some reason I can handle eating the gummy bears that I'm gonna make from this no problem so you're just gonna seal those and also if you can't get the Everclear you're not able to find you can always use Bacardi 151 proof which you should be able to find in your local almost or LCBO or wherever you go you're just gonna shake it so there has been people who think a couple hours is long enough to be able to get an effect from this Tincher and there's other people who think longer the better or longer the stronger so whatever and you want to do we're gonna do a little bit of our own experiment to try it out and we will see what happens there I really think my opinion longer the better because with even cooking oils if you let them sit for a little while not too long because they do go bad I find what the cooking oils but if you leave it in there for three months it is better than when you just make it so I guess we will see after this is all done so for now we will let you guys go and we'll be back in two weeks one eternity lay down alright guys we are back it has been two weeks and we have let our Tincher sit in a cool dark place I shook it three to four times a day as you can tell it looks very green it did get greener the longer it sat in there I noticed after a couple days it was not really too green but then it changed a lot darker as we got closer to the two weeks so you just gotta take off the lid and you can get one of these little strainers probably from likening the entire there's anywhere that sells kitchen stuff and some people use coffee you know coffee filters but i i've always used this for everything so i'm fine with this so you just put this little guy in here like this and you just pour it in so the reason why it turns green it's actually the chlorophyll which gives the plant to the green color it helps the plant out in a whole bunch of different ways but that was why the teacher turns green and chlorophyll is actually very good for you it has a lot of health benefits including like helps you with aging and increases red blood cells and it is a very good antioxidant so you just want to try to get out as much as you can [Music] okay and then I just want to take one of these little guys and just push it out so for me the alcohol smell is still very strong but I'm very sensitive to the smell of alcohol so that's probably why and if you do have any issues with alcohol if you've had an addiction with alcohol in the past I'd probably make gummy bears with coconut oil instead because you don't want to have a relapse and I will do another video about how to make it with coconut oil as well so just let that drip much you want even leave it sitting on there for a little bit make sure you get all of the teacher out of there and then all you have to do is put the lid on it and store it in a cool dark place until you want to use it and that's how simple making teacher is so I'm gonna make something out of this and I'm gonna come back to you guys and let you know how at two weeks it turned out and then I'm gonna come back with another one or four weeks let you guys know if there's a difference between the two and four weeks and then I'm gonna do another video on the six weeks to let you guys know if it does matter the longer you leave it so we will see okay we'll be back tomorrow I'll let you guys know how it went see you guys later eventually alright well I went ahead and I tried might intro and I have to say at two weeks it turned out really great I'm very happy with it so I'm really excited to see what the four and six weeks turn out like because if it's stronger I probably won't want to eat a whole gummy bear I found one gummy bear was fantastic which I will make a video about how to make gummy bears the best way to use Tincher is actually putting two to three drops underneath your tongue and just leave it under there for about 30 seconds and then swallow and then it goes directly into your bloodstream so it is the best way but you can actually put this in you know a couple drops in a cup of warm water you can put it on your food you can put it in gummy bears anything you really want you can use your drops for so I hope that helps you guys with any pain conditions or just if you want to relax but I'm very happy with it so I hope you guys enjoy the video and I hope that you have no problems making it if you do let me know and I will be more than happy to help you out so comment like and subscribe to the vibe tribe see you guys later peace", "fbcpgZRn7zA": "we've got some oil to make and this is gonna be part of the selection there we've got some really good strange brother Perry bone tangerine dream super Silver Haze any of this stuff is going to be amazing [Music] lovely thank you injury on all of the grinding up and as you can see we have lots and lots and lots of lovely ground of weed and it smells delicious so what we need to do now not this Bastille need to add the solvent in this cases isopropyl alcohol which is 99.999% pure alcohol a little bit of water and with the right purging there's no reason to to worry this is perfectly safe so here we have I think it's 500 grams of cannabis smokers you probably want to look away right now and what we'll do all you're doing now is we're just going to recover and of course this is completely this is very very very dangerous if you're smoke please don't smoke around when you're doing this the vapor from alcohol is highly volatile and should you be daft enough to smoke around it whilst it's all the vapors in the air you'll very likely to cause an explosion and do yourself a lot of damage if not worse kill yourself so we are getting now I know it's not quite a lot and it is quite a lot of alcohol but we're trying to create enough liquid in there to extract as much of the cannabinoids as we can this is as you know this is a lot of different types of bugs in this one so we're hoping for a very very very good oil now again it's volatile so please don't use your bare hands with this and make sure that your gloves are suitable for using with alcohol we're going to give this a good thing I think it's probably about another half a liter to be sure so you probably put in for navarre liters and that's plenty we don't want us to suffocate the cannabis so we're going to just keep stirring this for a few more minutes and then we're gonna leave it for 15 minutes right all soaked so times up it's now ready to start filtering out Toby hundred 20 micron bag stop pouring this in now now I'll do the first pot quickly and then get it going then I'll carry on afterwards so you can actually see what we're doing trying to get out of less of the plant matter as possible as you can see they didn't wanna look now all of this is pure all the alcohol now with extracted order the THC the CBD all the other cannabinoids that you expect so we'll just leave that just for moment we'll come back to that and I'll carry on doing this now with this as you can see it's all well cleaned and filtered out what we're going to do now is we're going to hide it probably want to put in there anyway so that's perfect now we'll make sure that this us out with the wait a minute but big blue Peter here we can do it in a minute right so it's all clipped it on make sure that the fans running to try and blow the vapor away because alcohol vapor is quite heavy it goes on and we're on and that literally is the start perfect slowly reducing ugly I'm still got my lots going there but well we'll get back to it and show you at the end about the podium you can see now is now ready another couple more minutes and then this will go straight into the video and you'll be able to see how it looks so as you can see now the oil has completely reduced down and what's left is this let you concealed up properly but this is fika well it's getting there it's a little bit more purging to go but that's how it is and it won't take long now so this will very gently after everything a little piece I'll sit in here and to a bowl of water I'll do I'll stop to gently heat the water up and slowly this will reduce more and you can kind of gauge where the line is now I'll see you in a minute Wayne nicely those little bubbles are caused by the alcohol leaving the liquid hopefully in a few more hours these bubbles would have reduced down and we'll carry on well as you can see now I mean there's virtually nothing left so what we're gonna do now is as there's still more alcohol in there I'm gonna add three mils of water and what this is going to do is that to try and draw up the last and again you carry on until there are no bubbles left right guys so we've purged as you can see now no bubbles it's now very very thick so what we're going to do now starts region I'm using a two three male 1 here buttburn enough it's a two mil 1 and 10 mils I'm just gonna show you this one dunk fast so you understand how quickly how easy it is to do so this is how it goes doodles it's that simple well guys as you can see we are finally finished of all of that we've many that's just over half a kilo of canvas I think it's about 540 grams into in that batch that has given us eighty seven grams of theta so I hope this video has hoped I know it's been quite not when it's been over a couple of days so thank you for your patience as you can see it's not something that you can do very very quickly it takes a lot of time and effort and I hope that you'll manage to do the same", "MBpeyemARNs": "what's up everybody welcome to the channel today we're going to be making cannabis simple syrup so let's get into it [Music] to make my simple syrup i'm going to be using an eighth of cannabis all right guys so once you measure out your cannabis the next step would be to decarb your cannabis so now we're going to put this in the oven for about 40 minutes and the temperature that i'm going to be using is 240. [Music] all right guys my cannabis is now the card remember guys once you decarbon your cannabis your cannabis should be brown if it's not brown you may want to decarb it for a little bit longer [Music] alright guys so now we're going to start working on this simple syrup so let's get into it so the first thing we're going to do is add our water [Music] once the water starts boiling add your sugar i'm going to be using a half cup of brown sugar and a half a cup of white [Music] sugar [Music] all right guys my sugar is now completely dissolved so now i'm going to reduce the temperature and add the vegetable glycerin [Music] all right guys so now i'm going to add our cannabis [Music] now that your cannabis simmer for about an hour on low all right guys so it's been over one hour so now we're going to string the simple syrup [Music] [Music] all right guys my simple syrup is now done i'm going to pour it in this little container right here so you guys can see how it looks my simple syrup is now done thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe peace [Music]", "bwbZTN4fMGM": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'll be showing you how to infuse starbursts so delicious and surprisingly was one of the easiest edibles i've ever made and i feel like i'm going to make these many times in the future they turned out so well [Music] to make these starbursts here's what you're going to need some starburst candy i wish i could have had the all pink kind but we don't sell them in canada so i just got the original infuse coconut oil and optionally you can also use a concentrate or extract to make them extra strong and some lecithin to help with absorption first i have the top part of my double boiler and then i'm going to peel the wrapper off of some starbursts and place them in the bowl i use 30 pieces here but the amount you use doesn't matter too much the recipe is very forgiving then you're gonna heat up a pot to a light boil and place your double boiler container thing on top and then using the spatula you're going to use to mix everything together add a scoop of some lecithin and then mix that in they do take quite a while to melt so just keep an eye on them and for the first five minutes or so they probably won't melt that much so you can pretty much just leave them be but then after five minutes when they start to melt like this um just keep stirring them and watching them until they melt all the way down then once everything is pretty much melted like this we can add our coconut oil so i'm going to be adding one tablespoon of coconut oil but you can add for this amount of starburst up to three tablespoons of coconut oil and to make it stronger i'm also going to be adding some concentrate now we just have to mix everything together so i'm having some trouble getting the starburst and the oil to emulsify together you can see um the oil kind of just doesn't really blend into it at all so i'm going to grab a whisk and see if that'll help us emulsify a little bit better so using the whisk aggressively actually turned out very well everything mixed together and it worked better than i expected honestly now i'm just going to put my starburst mixture onto a baking pan that is covered in waxed paper and then i'm just going to place another sheet of wax paper on top and kind of roll it and shape it out to the thickness i want in the end i feel like i wish i would have made it a little bit thicker so it would have been the exact same thickness of actual starburst but next time i'll do that i guess and then i just use this sharp utensil to kind of just shape it so i could have nice corner edges and then i placed it in the fridge now while i'm waiting for it to cool in the fridge i'm going to heat up my double boiler again because um i don't want to waste any of the starburst and the coconut oil mixture that's left in the pot so i'm going to make a little drink out of it so i have a whole video on how to do this and to be honest that video is going to give you a much tastier result than this one because this is just like a little makeshift one i did and i'll post the link of how to make that drink below pretty much you're just going to add some water and heat it up so you can get all the mixture combined and then you're going to add a drink mix to it and then cool it and serve it over ice but check out the video i have on how to make an infused starburst drink because it's like literally one of the most delicious drinks i've ever had and you can put quite a bit of coconut oil in there and you can't taste it which is very surprising considering how much i put in it okay so now that our drink is made and our starburst has cooled down a bit i actually left mine in the fridge a little bit too long it was about a half an hour and i felt like it was a little bit too hard for me to cut easily so i just took it out of the fridge for five ten minutes until it was ready to be cut so i'm just going to start by cutting these little edges on the side which i'll probably just snap on while i'm cutting and then i'm going to cut all of these into squares after i cut them i realized that i feel like the size was not accurate to the size of a starburst so when i make these next time i'm going to actually place a starburst on there and measure it out now they're all done so i'm just going to throw them into their little container and that's it they are ready to eat [Music] these turned out so well i'm so so happy with them this is probably going to be my go-to instead of gummies now they just just everything is amazing thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thanks so much guys have a wonderful day [Music] you", "lSWq35pDZNw": "welcome to shades of migraine a podcast series created by the Association of migraine disorders we hope you'll enjoy listening to a wide variety of voices including the perspectives of people living with migraine and those that are trying to help each will share their unique shade of migraine tara is committed to the goal of transforming the lives of those suffering from migraine by creating solutions to reinvent the migraine paradigm by placing people at the center of everything they do you can visit www.imtcva.org Institute gives us scientific and practical information about the use of cannabis or marijuana for treating migraine originally geared towards physicians this 20-minute presentation is chock-full of information helpful for anyone using or contemplating using cannabinoids to treat their migraine disease or chronic pain Thank You Ric for inviting me here it's been a pleasure to be part of this organization it's my second time participating and you know today I'm gonna talk about a topic that's fun but yet it's also a little controversial I grew up in the 80s so it's thinking about you know giving the title hope with dope but then I thought about stigma and decided to keep it to keep it to just cannabinoids so today I'm going to talk about criminology I'm going to talk about pharmacology I'm gonna talk about fetish pathogenesis I'm going to talk about some clinical research and as well in particular Rick asked me to talk about physician or clinician expectations and also patient expectations and they're going to briefly mention some cutting-edge research that we're doing at dent which has a large - large practice to begin with but we also are involved in medical marijuana or cannabis so basic terminology marijuana is frequently you know thought of to be a synonym for cannabis but it's not the terms are different cannabis is the botanical term for the hemp plant that contains cannabis sativa cannabis sativa is different from cannabis indica so cannabis sativa is a tall lastly branched with long and narrow leaves there's a picture of it there on the bottom right corner this provides more of the high feeling the energetic buzz feeling it's up till uplifting feeling the ratio of THC to CBD is it has more of a THC component versus CBD I'm going to explain those molecules in a second and recreational users users typically seek this train to get more of the high feeling cannabis indica comes from India it was found there in the Hindu Kush mountain range as well these are short conical dense branches with broad leaves provides more of a stoned feeling and people also use it for sedation pain relief and anxiety benefits as well there's a slightly different THC to CBD ratio and typically medical users prefer this strained over the other one in terms of history it's been around for thousands of years it's actually even mentioned in the Ebers papyrus with some use for pain related disorders but one of the earliest known use has been found in China and plant stems were used for ropes and linen flower seeds especially the resin can be sort of extracted to give psychoactive chemical properties termed cannabinoids so the different types of cannabinoids endocannabinoids are endogenous these are lipid based neurotransmitters one of the first discovered was an and amide and I'm gonna mention that a little bit later and when we talk about pathogenesis phyto cannabinoids these are the ones listed here these are come from more of a natural base and then synthetic cannabinoids either FDA approves these two in particular are FDA approved for the treatment of nausea and and severe nausea shows associated with cancer related pains these synthetic cannabinoids that are FDA approved have more of a regulation in terms of the actual compound itself versus the synthetic that are out on the street these are manufactured by chemists chemists and their chemical structure has changed there have been some warnings associated with that which I'm going to touch on a little bit later on so there are synthetic cannabinoids that are approved by FDA and then there are other ones that people buy online and their structures actually modified they are not coming from natural plants so just to know some of that terminology in terms of the pharmacology tetrahydrocannabinol was first identified in 1964 by Mechelen and by smoking in one cigarette or joint you can contain about 0.5 to 1 gram of cannabis only about 20% is absorbed in the lungs it's rapidly metabolized in the liver you can also have because of its solubility you can have accumulation and fat taking place that's why you can even detect it in the urine two weeks down the line as well oral consumption can produce prolonged but poor absorption so some people who may try something orally and don't feel the effect will keep eating and then later on they just are completely wiped out because the delayed effect more on pharmacology so there's several primary cannabinoids from cannabis so there's cannabidiol cbn caneta i'm sorry a cannabinol cannabidiol which is CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol so THC has more of the psychoactive property CBN is about one tenth of the psychoactive property as THC and CBD has no real psychoactive property adverse effects of marijuana so on the left you can see some of the short-term effects which include memory impairment motor coordination altered judgment motor vehicle accidents sometimes even psychosis and paranoia on the right side it's somewhat controversial it's debatable so I'm not going to really delve in too much into that that area is still controversial in terms of long-term effects of heavy use who uses marijuana there are patients people who use it for recreational they also use it for medical reasons and some use it for both as well now what's in marijuana marijuana contains hundreds in and maybe more different cannabinoids so here's a breakdown of several different cannabinoids CBD focusing on that in particular has several different properties antibacterial inhibits cancer cell growth nor protective benefits both promotes bone growth reduces sugar levels all these other ones that are listed here that you can see where are the cb1 receptors there are several different parts of the brain so it's a medulla which is involved which has a chemoreceptor trigger zone the cerebellum the basal ganglia cerebral cortex the hypothalamus and the hippocampus as well as a spinal cord now I like this article is published in the green journal it's not that green journal it's a different green journal and I like this because it really talks about pathogenesis and right now we we know a lot about migraine pathogenesis and we know because of the newest you know information on neuro inflammation so it's really interesting is if you look at the research that's already existing out there wood cannabinoids and where it potentially affects the receptors there's a parallel between my grandpa thought physiology as well too for example systemic effects there are variants in the CNR one gene which encodes for a cannabinoid one receptor which results in decreased expression of cb1 associated with migraines and the trigeminal vascular activation we know that the trigeminal vascular system and the trigeminal cervical complex all play a big role in migraine pathogenesis we have peripheral and central activation of those too there's been some research on people who have deficiency endocannabinoids and particularly an and amide and possibly there's a relationship between that and the pathogenesis of migraines - that's still an area that needs further research as well if you take a look at the cortex you have sebum antagonists that suppress glutamate neurotransmission by inhibiting NMDA MDA receptors you also have cb1 receptors that suppress cortical spreading depression which is a precursor for migraines in the vasculature you can see that there's some effect on blood vessels and effect on blood vessel dilation induced by cg RP as well as capsaicin midnight ro coxide in addition you have Ananda mite that is an agonist or activates trip v1 which is involved in also trigeminal vascular activation trip v1 is another area of future study it's actually being currently study in a potential target for future migraine treatments so it's exciting to see that the cannabinoid research actually parallel some of this as well there's some effect on platelets as well and when in relation to platelets there is some research with 5-hydroxytryptamine or v HT receptor ends and migraines in the brain stem so we know that there's a peripheral activation there's also a central activation of migraines which involves a sending pathways that go through the pair Iraq or dr. gray the thalamus to cortex and there's descending pathways that go down as well too and persistent activation of these pathways lead to something called allodynia which was I think mentioned earlier in some of the rat models so what's been shown as a cb1 receptor actually is involved in it with activation of the periaqueductal gray area and also the rostral event remit uh medial medulla as well so here's a quick chart that looks at all this sort of combined together this concept of endocannabinoid deficiency which some people may have a genetic predisposition to or have genetically may have that results in increased glutamate signaling which may lead to cortical spreading depression as a potential oral migraine trigger and basically what I just said is summarized in this diagram here now why is it difficult to do research because it's still listed as a schedule 1 drug including some of those other agents I know dr. goshawk back there is doing some research and he might be able to provide some insight just one on with LSD I believe so he might be able to elaborate how difficult it is to do something like that so it's not an easy process so that's one of the challenges to doing research on cannabis or cannabinoids is because of the the scheduled nature of it other research includes the current research includes in most of the trials in the USSR retrospective studies so these are you know there are no prospective trials where we actually give patients medications and follow them through but there are some European ones which I'm gonna highlight just one quick abstract on the most of the ones that are existing right now are very short not enough patience and a lot of confounding factors in those studies which include tobacco use and comorbid illness as well so I practice in New York State so right now the approved uses for medical cannabis is cancer and all these other ones that are listed the newest one that was just added not too long ago is PTSD so I actually looked up word Island and Rhode Island has a very similar approve approval for these disorders as well recently Rhode Island had a Department of Health Center advisory and this was through other states as well and this had in particular due to the synthetic cannabinoid these are produced these are you can buy these online and what some of these people that manufacture them were changing the chemical structure so they actually added something that was making it cause increase bruising it was affecting vitamin K so just to be aware of issues with synthetic cannabinoids that you can buy online there are also legal issues in these vary by states that would encourage you to look up things in your own state you can't travel out of your state for the most part you can't drive with it there's risk of DUI laws allow federal employees to fire for positive drug tests whereas there may be some protection with state employees as well and it cannot be used in certain institutions such as group homes nursing homes or hospitals so what I mentioned before some of the limitations of retrospective clinical trials is that you know there's limited data from that that we can we can use so I found something you know a recent a meeting that took place in the Amsterdam and it was some German researcher which has a little bit more liberal rules in terms of research I was a prospective study at small study where they took some migraine patients and cluster patients and initially gave them THC one group and another group had cannot CBD only they found that adequate higher doses and result in about 50 55 percent improvement in overall frequency and severity the second phase they gave the migraine patients amitriptyline and also THC CBD combination and they found an improvement as well what's interesting about this is that in the cluster headache patients the only patients that improved were the ones that had some background history of migraines as a child as well so this is a very limited study and I only have this in abstract form it's just to highlight that a prospective trial is more you know it gives us more data than a retrospective trial so just to comment about what's going on at dent the cannabis clinic these are the number of patients that we've seen so far in a in a year or a year and a half period majority the patients are being treated for chronic pain 69% approximately about 30 to 40 percent of those about 30 percent of those are chronic migraine patients this data is from doctormick vague who's one of the leading researchers on concussion and she actually has one of the largest population of concussion patients about 800 in one particular study that she's undergoing right now so in a subset of one of her studies she's actually studying in about 149 individuals with chronic pain who were certified for medical cannabis and they were given concussion related diagnosis of post concussive syndrome she was using five sort of pillar pillars as a treatment modality so these were mood sleep headache dizziness and concentration issues and what she found was that there were three of these had had more significant improvement over a period of time with medical cannabis use versus not and these were there was an 80% improvement in mood and 78% would sleep and 76% with headache so the and that's one of the findings the second important finding in this particular study so this study is published in the abstract form and it's submitted for a publication as in a journal and further analysis of this of the study are being done right now as well - so 80% of the patients experience significant improvement activity limitations symptoms emotions and quality of life this is not showing as clearly but it's showing you that there was an improvement in quality of life pre medical cannabis use was 27% post medical cannabis use it was 43% so there's an improvement it was successfully significant there's further analyses being done with this particular study so stay tuned in fact she's actually presenting this at the American Academy neurology concussion meeting that's taking place later on another finding from this study was the optimal dosing was a byproduct a combination of THC to CBD a one-to-one ratio with a combination of a tincture those three times per day and the inhalation component was a 20 to 1 ratio as a vapor pen and this is more used as an immediate relief which which is not used all the time but just more of a breakthrough pain the cost was 269 per month which is a little bit high but cost of this varies from state to state as well - and hopefully this will decrease over time the the last finding of this particular study was 14% of patients reported side effects all were minimal and all were and 70% were related to administration route whether it was dry mouth or cough so this was fairly tolerated so how do you go about doing this I mean not too many places have a cannabis clinic first you have to contact your physician they have to be certified they have to certify you and then you get registered you apply for a card you get a registration then you go to a dispensary to purchase your product so what are some provider expectations so maintenance of CBD products takes about two weeks to of regular use before patients can start to notice any relief of symptoms the change in cannabis ratios should be done in two to three month and month intervals increments cannabis is dose dependent cost-prohibitive so it does cost more the more you use so you know patients are you know they they want to minimize use and at least and get the most bang for their buck as well too so they might adjust some of their dosing on their own taste of tinctures may restrict use as well to the vaporization is contraindicated for COPD and asthma some drug interactions to be concerned about so opioids you may need to decrease the opioid dose as well - one thing to know is that some of these patients that are coming in with you the you may not feel comfortable giving the medical cabinets if there aren't a high dose of opioids so you have to coordinate with pain management to help them titrate down their dose now if you feel comfortable doing that you can do that but I think most clinicians feel more comfortable with who I was originally prescribing them to lower their dose there's a lot of active research going on now with the use of medical cannabis and getting people off of opioids so that's another area of study and is a big need for that as well - so stay tuned for that research to come out as well you may need to decrease the anxiety dose as well too tricyclic antidepressants they have sedative effects monitor increased side-effects of SSRIs anti retrovirals they may be enzyme inhibition or inducing effects related to that and seizure meds as well may need to be adjusted due to the pharmaco dynamic related changes now establishment expectations so this Dement this depends on the amount of prophylactic products the patients are going to use and their ability to afford their products a lot of the patients that we're seeing are not able to afford some of the products at the dispensaries at the rate right now so that's one of the limitations so what some of them wind up doing is they get approved they wind up using their or smoking marijuana so that's something to be aware of as well - patients may have some reduction in migraine associated symptoms but this may take time CBD maintenance so it does reduce muscle pain anxiety improve sleep the increase in tincture dose must be done slowly to prevent any adverse effects such as dizziness and drowsiness it can take about two weeks to develop any kind of consistent use of CBD to notice any positive effects once again THC provides more immediate pain relief in this is more done in the form of a vape form as well too so this is going to be important they can't take this to work they can't drive within six hours after use it will create a high and it may worsen anxiety or paranoia just a few more slides I don't know how we are on time wait okay so alright so there there's improvement that takes over time you need to set these realistic expectations for these patients this I got from the the Rhode Island Department of Health just to show you what people are doing in Rhode Island so this is the data from two thousand sixteen to seventeen there's about 4500 patients that have been being treated for chronic pain and those are some of the other indications and who's writing this in Rhode Island majority are internal medicine family medicine and not so much neurology further

oil made in cold methods furthermore I will explain briefly how I came to this method cannabis oil can be used for many projects such as cancer skin problems patents on digestive problems rejuvenation of bones and even your brain cells to name a few for skin conditions like eczema or skin inflammations or skin cancer the use of cannabis can be very effective and very soothing to for people with cancer the use of cannabis oil is very beneficial and ensures that our body can relax and it gets the ability to heal itself in addition it is a pain killer in his entire inflammatory it strengthens your immune system and has an anti-tumor effect it reduces the damage the femur therapy can cause to the nerves and brings the body in a more balanced state in the case of colon cancer laboratory studies show that it really works with lung cancer the sputum production will decrease and it prevents choking cold oil is highly recommended for Parkinson projects the raw oil has many active ingredients that are very beneficial to Parkinson when taken regularly this effect is also noticeable when ingesting Cokely obtained juice from the leaves of the cannabis plant how to use cannabis oil the application of cannabis oil can be done in a number of ways for two are the most efficient the one is on the skin and the second one is under the tongue the oil can be rubbed in daily on the affected area like a kind of ointment it's best to dilute the wheat paste with castor oil instead of other oils in the preparation process because castor oil is a bit thicker and easier to apply and it helps the wheat oil to pet deeper into the skin in the case of any other conditions the cannabis oil is taken orally you can do this in front of a mirror so you can see easily how many drops you take then drop the oil under the tongue and leave it there for a couple of minutes before swallowing it this is done because under the tongue the oil is absorbed by the body much quicker the dosage it's advisable to take the oil every day and to continue the treatment for as long as possible for paint projects it's convenient to take the oil every few hours to keep the analgesic effect constant when it comes to treating a tumor or preventing a cancer from coming back it's enough to take the oil once a day because every oil has a different strength it's very useful to test your daily dose with every new obtained bottle of oil you can do it very easily by taking for example three drops and the next day take four drops build it up slowly every day with one drop until you get slightly high if you're slightly high you know you have to take one or two drops less to set your dose if you become very stoned during this process it's best to relax and enjoy it the effect will decrease sometime the advantage of cannabis oil made on occult meth is compared to the heat of method cannabis contains at least 200 different potentially active medical ingredients other than THC and CBD because there's little research done about these ingredients there's also little known but what we do know is when heating it a lot of it will be lost this inspired me to do a little research on cannabis oil made in a cold method the most common cannabis oil is made with the use of heat this process is called decarboxylation and ensures that the THC acids are converted THC the THC and CBD strongly stimulate the cannabinoid receptors that are naturally present in our body these receptors activate human system and heal the body an additional effect is that the intoxicating effect of the oil is strengthened and therefore more suitable as an anesthetic painkiller in cannabis oil that is made without heating air the assets from the THC are preserved as well as all the other ingredients that are present in the plant the THC acids have a similar effect as the family let alone Aveda the pe\u00f1a from our body which is a balanced riparian molecule this molecule provides an analgesic and and diplomat ory effect it has a positive effect on the immune modulation of our body and takes very effective role in protecting the nerves in chemotherapy the pe\u00f1a itself is also stimulated by the use of unheated cannabis oil my personal experience in the use of unheated cannabis oil my personal experience with the use of cold oil is that it works very well it keeps and makes the body healthy if you want a stronger effect you can even use to both oils at the same time because they work in a completely different way I hope this video has given you more clarity about the use of cannabis oil if you have more questions you can use the comments or go to my website feel Ofcom thank you for watching you [Music]", "5MT5ossUhHM": "[Music] it's matted Rafal studios and welcome to canapes accepted a we're going to learn a super-simple catalyst infused fudge recipe [Music] this episode of cata basics is brought to you by the seedsman for 20 30 days of 4/20 special please visit seedsman calm to learn about their free seeds and new peyote strains now here's what you're going to need to make super simple cannabis fudge you need 1 12 ounce bag of milk chocolate chips 3 tablespoons of cannabis infused butter or oil 1/2 a cup of chopped nuts which is optional and one tub of chocolate frosting it's a 16 ounce can if you use the nuts in this recipe I recommend go ahead and toasting those so while you're toasting your nuts you can go ahead and proceed with the next step if not using nuts just start with a step put your chocolate chips into a microwave-safe dish that's also going to be big enough to mix and then we're going to add in our three tablespoons of cannabis infused butter or oil you could use either one I'm actually using a mixture of both then we're going to put this in a microwave on medium to low heat for just two to maybe three minutes just barely enough to melt the butter and get it started to melt the chips [Music] okay you see that I just barely melted the butter and the chips still hold her shape but she can see the bottom ones are starting to melt and then I'm putting the toasted nuts on top there they also kind of take advantage of their heat if you're not using nuts you still just go ahead and mix together the butter and the chips until it's like a glassy consistency you just barely what a melt it don't get too hot on the chips and then you're gonna add in the whole tub of frosting and we're just using plain Oh generic frosting you can pretty much use any kind of brand nothing fancy nothing whipped or anything like that just regular frosting if you want it to be different flavors you could mix up the chips or you can mix up the frosting to different flavors but then you're basically just gonna fold the frosting into those melt two chips and butter just keep folding until you get it completely mixed you don't want to use a anything to whip air into it or anything you to dry it out just do it by hand with a spatula and just whip it I mean just mix it until it's completely mixed together and at that point you're gonna put it into a 9 by 9 or 8 by 8 square cake pan lined with a wax paper don't use parchment you just really need wax paper here something that will fold down into the corners and then spread the fudge mixture out into the pan as evenly as possible I also like to give it a couple of pounds on the table just to get out any air bubbles and settle it down into the bottom of the pan then we're going to take that put it in the refrigerator or freezer [Music] [Applause] after about an hour in the freezer or two to three hours in the refrigerator you're gonna be ready to take it out and then you can go ahead and slice it and serve it it's ready to go with that I like to keep this in the freezer or refrigerator it's really good right out of the freezer it doesn't get as hard as you might imagine you can heat it right out of the freezer it'll stay for a couple of weeks and the

", "fYMCA_Tg_vk": "Welcome to Endoca's beautiful organic\ncannabis fields. Come I'll show you Well, in order to make a good cannabis extract\nyou need good starting plant material. In my hand I have a cannabis plant it\nsmells fantastic. In order to make a nice extract you need to obviously dry the\nplant material first. Come let's go to the lab I'll show you how to make an\nextract. Welcome to Endoca. My name is Henry Vincente and today I will show you\nhow to cannabis extraction using ethanol We will use cannabis material which is\nthe leaves and the flowers all in one Very important to use organic so that you\nknow there is nothing inside that can harm you. There are over 4,000 different\nvarieties of cannabis now the one I chose has a lot of CBD inside. You could\napply the same method or what kind of cannabinoid eschews so called ethanol\ntake a ball put the plant material inside so the process has to be very\nfast. You don't want the ethanol to touch the plant material to a long time. If it\ndoes you get a lot of other stuff inside which you don't want. You just use enough\nethanol to cover so that we can separate the plant material from the cannabinoids. You need to be fast in this process because we can only stir for three\nminutes so I use a plastic spoon. You don't use mechanical devices because you\ndon't want to create a spark. If I create a spark now everything will burn. You mix\nwell then we have to separate the ethanol from the plant material. I do\nsimply by taking a sieve and put it in another Bowl. It can drip a little bit\nyou know there's still some alcohol left This was the first filtration now we're\ngoing to do the second filtration in order to remove the plant material you\nhave left, and we do that by using a simple coffee machine\nIt can heat your material and it can filtrate and we start with the\nfiltration part coffee filter, take your spoon you take now the material on the liquid\nand you pour it into the filter paper and you see the process starts. In order\nto accelerate the process we change the paper, every time a single filtration has\noccurred if you have more material you just continue until you don't have any\nmore, and like this and it's dripping beautifully. Now it's time to cook so\nwhen you cook at home you can use many different things I have here an example\nof a rice cooker which works fine a pot and a heating device works also fine and\na water distiller. Now my favorite is the water distiller because if you cook with\nany of these methods we need a cleanroom box like this for those of you who\ndoesn't have a box like this you can cook outside but to make it all easier\nlet's use the water distiller. Now this is the process where we separate the\nethanol from the cannabinoids. The time it will take for the full separation\ndepends of course of how much material you put inside I use a bowl to collect\nthe pure ethanol that's going to come out here because you can you reuse it\nagain and again we give it some juice and we wait so now the question is when\nto stop I can see I have 80% of my original ethanol volume so that's\nindication that it's time to see what's going on inside you open the lid slowly\nand look inside and you can see that is very little material in my case this is\nthe time to stop just to be sure not to breathe it here we go and be careful\nwhen you pour because there's very little material you don't want to lose\nit and now I'm going to show you the final step using the coffee machine what\nwe have to do is remove the remaining ethanol from our extract put it on the\nheating device turn it on and we wait best is to wait for 24 hours so that\nyou're sure that no ethanol is left I already did this and as you can see from\nall the work with it we have very little material the final test is a quality\ntest we do it by using a paperclip dipping it into the material and you use\na lighter you light it fast and see what happens if there is a spark you know there is \nstill ethanol left so you can see comparison see it's burning then you\nneed to put it back on the heater but in our case it was well done. To make a\ncannabis extract at home you need a lighter\nfilter coffee machine some small bowls, two bowls\nsieve plastic spoon coffee filters alcohol cannabis. Put the cannabis into\nthe bowl cover with cold alcohol steer three minutes with plastic spoon filter\nthe alcohol through the sieve filter again through the coffee filter it still\nuntil 80 percent of the initial alcohol volume is gone pour into a small ball\nhit the small ball with the coffee machine for 24 hours to remove the\nremaining alcohol. To check if there is any remaining alcohol use a small spoon\nand the lighter if there is any remaining alcohol the product will\nproduce sparks when burning with a lighter keep heating until you don't get\nany sparks anymore Enjoy your cannabis extract Stay tuned\nnext time I'm going to show you how to purify the extract and turn it into pure\ncannabinoids in my hand is 99% CBD beautiful crystals See you next time", "evtSWzJ-Uec": "so you want to make a cannabis alcohol tincture using the cold method you're in the right place welcome to truebuds tv it's simple but take some time grab a very high proof liquor like everclear 120 the higher the proof the better i have a half ounce of some outdoor cali an ounce of trim and shake or cheesecloth and strainer we're also going to do a coffee filter strain as well our jars to put it in and then something to pour or a portion later we're going to use some funnels too or i'll show you a hack there as well we have our baking sheet with our crinkled up parchment this is for decarboxylating our blood to activate that thca i crinkle it up just so it gets a little better surface area and doesn't burn we have this half here we're putting on you don't got to grind it up all the way you could use your hands or whatever and then we're just going to dump the ounce of trim and shake on there and then next let's decarboxylate cover it with foil for one hour at 225 degrees fahrenheit this is crucial now let's go ahead and put that in the jar it's as simple as that we're going to put that half of the outdoor decarb tally in there then we're going to put about a pint of liquor in it a little bit i'm going to break this trim and shake down a little more after being decarb just to experiment my first time doing it so we'll see what happens we're just going to go and add the everclear like i said you could use whatever bacardi 151 you could use a whiskey you know a moonshine just make sure it's a high proof we're going to proceed to go ahead here and put that 16 ounces of this 120 proof everclear in with that half ounce this is going to be a less potent batch my goal with this one is to make a can of sugar experiment with recipes with that i'm also going to take that can of sugar and do a simple syrup with it for our cocktail series so if you haven't caught any of those other simple syrup recipes i recommend checking them out next this is going to be the more potent one here we're going to do about 12 ounces total i think but let's put a cup in the start and see how that's looking so this is that full hat or part of me this is the full ounce of the trim and shake there's a cup in there eight ounces not enough let's add four more so we're doing 12 ounces total to that one ounce of the trim and shake hopefully get something nice and potent here shake it up put it in the freezer you're gonna want to repeat this daily shaking it at least two to three four times however many you want a day i left it in the freezer for two weeks the beauty here is kind of the longer the better can stay in there for however long you like let's strain it through this fine cheesecloth here i recommend wearing gloves to squeeze it out at the end just to keep that alcohol off your hands i do this really no matter what no matter what infusion i'm doing so let's go ahead strain that out and we're about ready for the next step the coffee filter and here's that little hack i was saying you could use a funnel or you can make your own by just cutting a water bottle soda bottle whatever let's put the coffee filter in here to strain it through and i'll show you at the end here why we do this to collect any extra sediment you know that kind of made it through the cheesecloth even though we used a really fine cheesecloth so i got the other water bottle gonna do the same thing to do two runs on each and here's what it's looking like trim and shake very crucial you could see how much was there flower not so much but it was still nice to get out the second run through for both really wasn't necessary to be completely honest so you could save your time do one that does take a little time too so now we're going to go ahead and do the t-check 2 potency testing device let's check the first one here and see what's going on testing the infusion okay 2.4 milligrams per milliliter pretty weak actually so we'll turn that into the sugar like i was saying it'll be interesting to experiment with i'm really wondering what the other one's going to be now so 11.7 let's see what the tablespoon is 35 not bad you know kind of weak so let's do the more potent this is what i'm really curious about because i would even do more next time make it more potent maybe do an ounce of flour instead of the trim and shake to really get it up a notch testing the infusion testing the infusion let's get it let's see what it's coming in at and i'm always ready for this always curious let's see 8.9 milligrams per milliliter that's solid that's a nice amount that's like a good tincture right there let's see i like just doing another one so you guys can see 44 basically per teaspoon tablespoon 131.5 that's gonna hit that's gonna hit good yeah so i'm gonna go ahead put three in here wait about an hour and a half or so to when it should have peaked or be peaking and let you know if i think the uh t check is accurate and my overall thoughts on my first cold methane tincture it's an acquired taste you know just like alcohol but you just gotta let it sit there enjoy the burn i took three milliliters which is approximately 27 milligrams of thc according to the t check 2 and it's about an hour and a half later and i would agree with that reading seems about right that 25 to 30 milligram sweet spot for me you know gets me feeling really good this one has me really calm just hanging but not too much so i would say it's about right and if you think this thing's dope if you think the t-check's cool i'll put a link with a discount below you know i get a little something on the back end but seems pretty accurate for everything i've done so far i need to experience more with the flower for it but this was solid i even used the little syringe they have because it's way more accurate than the dropper so i could be exact with you and now for my favorite part like what can we learn from this experience what can i do better next time i would say next time just make it stronger and maybe even let it sit longer have a couple working at all points because that three milliliters is a lot for me it's not that much but like maybe that at the same time that it's good for you if you have a lower tolerance but i want to make it stronger but at the same time too that is a good way to use your trim and shake that you have just laying around just put in some strong liquor let it sit use it at a later date so more videos coming about this experimenting with it seeing what we can do with it but that's kind of my thoughts what else can we do better sit longer more potent so when i say more potent i'm thinking use more flour that's more potent maybe even do a concentrate you know just keep experimenting because i see the value in this that it can offer especially once you get it down so it's just like oh you know half of this if it was 0.5 milliliters that's smacking that's good but either way the potency was there it was i'm happy with it i'm happy with this recipe and i'm happy to fulfill because people have been asking like dude when can you make this i'm like i'm gonna make it i'm gonna make it but i have been putting it on the back burner i'm not gonna lie because i know it just takes time i'm like but i just should have done it a while ago you just let it sit there and like i said just go shake it up it's about it it's fun always having something infusing it's like inspired me to do other types of infusions too that whatever i'm kind of want to rant right now what else to talk about i guess that's it i guess that sums up video so thank you for hanging out i hope you like this drop a comment below like i said because i will make what you want if i get enough people saying it giving it a thumbs up or whatever so see you later [Music] you", "h_nEypnwdLs": "what's up you guys I'm about to show you the easiest way to make a cannabis tincture yourself at home if you have cannabis distillate at your disposal it's as easy as three three three all you need is three ingredients takes three steps and it should be about three minutes so the three ingredients are going to be is a high proof grain or ethyl alcohol this is a 151 proof so it's seventy five point five percent alcohol by volume I have a gram of some candyland distillate it's a nice sativa sounds delicious from vaping extracts Phoenix Arizona and I have a tincture bottle these are the only three things that you need okay I have an extra one which is a shot glass this is going to help me mix it I'm gonna make sure that it's mixed clearly you don't need it okay now now I've got my grain alcohol I'm going to add it in here I'm just gonna eyeball it for right now hopefully that's not too much because I have a thirty milliliters dropper I'm gonna actually use the tip of this dropper as a stirring stick alright so this is completely dissolved in here you can see the alcohol has turned a little bit yellowish when you do a picture with flower it's gonna be a lot more green so I'm going to transfer this by the dropper so that I don't waste anything alright this was so easy that I overthought the hell out of it and I kind of messed didn't go as smoothly as I hoped but we have a cannabis distillate tincture right here is fully infused it's ready to go was wonderful about the alcohol tincture is that you can add it to just about anything to put it on your skin you can have this thing right here you can put it in a spray bottle I actually got this idea from another youtuber something Canada labs or something like that you can put this in a spray bottle spray it into your mouth okay this takes getting medicated to the very next level and tinctures used to be the main form of ingesting cannabis before prohibition so it's a lot safer it's a lot cleaner this is freaking awesome here's about 15 milligrams it's all approximate I could have been a lot better myself that stuff is strong all right so it's best to actually probably put this in like a little bit of water to dilute it and you look at the effects but I think that the alcohol also helps your body absorb it faster this is overall really just a great thing to do here so next step with this for me is I'm gonna make the most delicious homemade from scratch you're gonna see a medicated soda you can make 450 milligrams worth of soda for like 20 bucks if you have the certain things it's gonna be great stay tuned like this", "LSfMDUKfylo": "my goal for him is to hear his voice to hear him talk we just want

information of this video replace medical advice this video's purpose is to shed light on cbd and how it could be used to treat anxiety amongst many other remedies and medications out there is school stressing you out your job giving you anxiety or can you just not fall asleep at night well this just may be the video for you the use of cbd could be an effective and safe way to alleviate anxiety stress and improve your sleep but what exactly is cbd cbd is short for cannabidiol which is one of two compounds found in cannabis the other one being tetrahydrocannabine or thc for short what you may notice is that the chemical formulas of cbd and thc are almost chemically identical but they both elicit different reactions within the body the chemical structure of thc that is found in marijuana is what gives you the feeling of being high while the chemical structure of cbd which is also found in marijuana doesn't give you the feeling of being high but affects the body in different less noticeable ways cbd is known to elicit relaxing and soothing effects without the feeling of intoxication that is usually associated with marijuana marijuana and hemp are two types of cannabis plants marijuana contains a high concentration of thc with some cbd this contrasts kemp as hemp is bred to remove the majority of its thc content leaving the plant as only a good source of cbd this means you cannot get high off hemp derived cbd oils but how do we know that cbd is effective in treating anxiety one study outlined an experiment done on 65 men and women that were classified to be obese majority of the participants were in their 20s to 40s in this double-blind experiment some participants were given hemp-derived cbd oil or an olive oil placebo daily for six weeks alongside their normal diet throughout the six weeks the participants were asked about their feelings of stress as well as other factors including their overall well-being anxiety levels and sleep quality participants were also asked to complete physical activity on a regular basis the study found that overall participants who were given hemp-derived cbd were coping better with stress experiencing improved sleep quality and quantity and showed improved pleasure in life amongst many other benefits so how have people been using cbd cbd oils and creams are currently being used topically to reduce pain and inflammation teas coffee blends and even cbd infused beer help with anxiety relieve stress and help with sleep cbd has also been used to help with withdrawal symptoms panic attacks insomnia depression as well as ptsd although there is little to no side effects of cbd use as well as no proven tendencies for abuse or dependence potential cbd is still relatively new on the market cbd studies are still in the preliminary stages as long-term effects are still unknown so please before trying anything new we recommend you speak to your family doctor and inquire about cbd and find what

milligrams thc and 513 cbd so you get a little extra great who doesn't love that uh and then uh as i said this is their unflavored i think they also have like lemon and ginger other things uh and on the side we've got our dosing uh sort of guidelines um they recommend that each full dropper is 10 milligrams which is a single serving and they say this whole uh tincture bottle has 60 droppers in total which makes sense for 600 milligrams of thc um so we've reviewed a lot of tinctures here i really like tinctures uh they usually work pretty well for me and i absolutely love the form factor uh we'll be doing this one sublingually like we do with most of our tinctures under the tongue which means it actually comes on quite a bit quicker than if you were just taking it like any other edible uh the effects can start to hit as soon as about 15 minutes and really get going at about 45. um so uh let's go ahead and get this open i was looking okay so this is uh an mct oil based um tincture i was wondering what their base was and it is mct oil which is basically just coconut oil so it is coconut oil but just a specific uh chain of molecules i guess um okay so let's open her up our one-to-one drops now i'm not particularly a big cbd guy uh it's not something that is especially um helpful or useful for me i i don't really um uh get a lot of benefit from cbd uh more power to everybody who does i'm i'm glad you really enjoy it uh i don't dislike cbd it's just it doesn't seem to have much of an effect on me but i will definitely keep an eye out uh because this one is almost equal parts cbd in here as well we'll see if that makes me feel any different than the normal thc review uh so like all of our weed reviews we're gonna do uh or excuse me tincture reviews we do uh 100 milligrams not the whole thing and not just a single dropper i like to do that as our baseline for pretty much every tincture so that would mean 10 full droppers of this is going to be our dose we'll see how that goes uh i'll probably do three or four two or three four on camera with you and then the uh remainder that i will be doing the next you know six seven i will probably do on a live stream i've been doing a lot of live streaming thank you to everybody joining in um and i'll probably do uh a little bit more there so i hope to see some of you guys join in for our live streams anyways i'm going to shut up now and i'm going to go and open this up and get this process started smells like nothing at all not a thing okay i'm expecting this to taste uh very neutral uh as mct oil tinctures normally are uh not able to get the full milligram it's only about the 75. got to keep that in mind i have to do uh maybe closer to 13 drops in total uh hung ahaha [Music] um [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] okay that's all i'm gonna do um i i there are uh various opinions about how long you should leave it i usually go for about a minute or two and that seems to do the trick pretty well uh and as i i suspected largely tasteless just that vaguely kind of coconutty oil aftertaste um but it's so un you know it's just it's it's really uh it's not a big deal at all i took three droppers full and don't even feel like i uh need to rinse my mouth out or anything um so in terms of the uh unflavoredness of this tincture it is really unflavored um so we've done our first three or two and a half worth droppers there i've got another you know we'll say 10 to do because i wasn't able to get the full one dropper uh and as i said i'm gonna hope to do some of that with you guys on a live stream uh before i wrap this review up oh i think i forgot to mention uh like all of our wheat's reviews after i do my 10th dropper or so uh about two hours or so after that i'll come back here and let you guys know if this select one to one cbd thc tincture is as good as i am hoping until then stay high stay healthy hi guys i am back about three and a half hours after our first journey with the select one to one drops 600 milligrams of thc in the very specific 513 milligrams of cbd that's not how much i did i did about between 100 and 150 milligrams would be my guess which is probably between 80 and 120 milligrams of cbd and a lot of you got to hang out with me while i was reviewing this we did a little bit of a live stream and i appreciate everyone who tuned in uh and to all those who were there you probably remember that i liked this quite a bit this is very good um an affordable tincture i see it for about 50 bucks normally which is already a good deal for 600 milligrams of thc then you get the added bonus of that one to one cbd double-year cannabinoid goodness um so normally the cbd stuff doesn't really do a lot for me i'm not a big big big huge user of cbd or even sort of i don't really get the uh too much of the positive effects uh i respect it as a product it's just not super effective on me but i did notice it here um the the the high i'm experiencing is way more relaxed even than normal um sort of very very pleasant kind of experience less cerebral than normal for me not really neurons really aren't firing quite as much but i feel very at peace so i'm going to attribute that to the almost equal amounts of cbd in here so this select one-to-one unflavored drops it gets a really really big thumbs up for me i like it quite a bit my dog's thinking about barking but she's not going to she's not going to she really wanted to um so yeah huge thumbs up for me and before i bounce here guys i want to share with you a little cherry on top a little something that you can enjoy that i can share with you that isn't necessarily about wheat in this one you may not want any weed before you check this out because it might be a little too much i'm going to recommend a couple of books from a japanese uh illustrator it's manga i'm sorry i'm a nerd i guess it's only the second one i've ever read so don't judge me too harshly um the artist and writer is a guy by the name i apologize if i'm mispronouncing it junjie ito um and the two books i want to recommend from him that are utterly grotesque i mean truly some of the most shocking images i've ever seen somebody uh put pen to paper but i mean that in the best kind of way uh they are depraved in the most uh wonderful kind of cosmic hori sense of depraved uh and those are guillot geo again probably mispronouncing it which means fish in [ __ ] japan um and uh the other one is uzumaki which means spirals and it's all about spirals and i think adult swim is gonna do some kind of adaptation i've talked a lot about genji ito don't mix the two that's my advice definitely try this and definitely give junjie e2 a shot if you're a fan of gross stuff but keep them apart all right guys well that's going to do it for this review here on wheats really like the select give a huge recommendation my boy genji whatever however i'm sorry i'm still very high so thank you so much for watching guys stay high stay healthy and we'll see you for the next review i'm hoping my dogs aren't going to trip they might we did it [Music] you", "xKHP-1wefq8": "- Hi, Andrea Meharg here\nfrom revealcannabis.com, where I teach you how you can use cannabis to live a healthier, happier life. And today's video is all about how to make cannabis infused beverages. This is really exciting for us Canadians who don't have cannabis infused\nbeverages on the market yet. They will be coming in October of 2019, but for right now, I'm gonna teach you how to make your own. Basically, what I'm\ngonna show you how to do is to make a simple cannabis tincture that you then add to the\nbeverage of your choice. I'm gonna walk you really quick how to make an alcohol tincture because I already have a longer\nmore detailed video on that that I'll link below. And at the end of this video I will provide you with a recipe book that can hopefully stir\nup your creative juices for what you could make with your cannabis infused tinctures. So let's get started. I'm gonna show you what you'll need to make the tincture first. Okay, first thing that you have to do is decarboxylate your cannabis. So, basically this is\nheating your cannabis up so that you are getting THC or CBD instead of what's naturally\nfound in the plant, which is THCA or CBDA. The easy way to do this at home is to put your cannabis into a mason jar and put it into a preheated oven at 240 degrees Fahrenheit for one hour. The reason you put it in the mason jar is it helps to keep down the smell. However, if you have one of\nthese beautiful little machines, you just put your cannabis in and press the button and away you go, when it's done it shows a different color. Again the advantage of this is that you get more of the\nTHC or CBD from the flower. After you're done, you are\ngoing to grind your cannabis just slightly to increase\nthe surface area, you're not trying to turn it into powder. So you just zap it a couple of\ntimes in your coffee grinder. If you don't have a coffee\ngrinder for cannabis, that's okay use scissors or\nyour regular cannabis grinder. So I'll show you that it looks like that, right now the nugs and I'm gonna go zap it off camera so you don't have to listen to it. So, put your ground up\ncannabis into a mason jar, same mason jar you used to decarb it, if you used the oven which is fantastic. I'm all about less dishes. So it looks like that when it\nis just a little bit ground. And then you're gonna\nadd in 1/2 cup of Alcool, or Everclear or whatever you're using. So I'm using seven grams of cannabis and one 1/2 cup of Alcool. You can increase the\npotency of your tincture or decrease it by using\nless flower or more flower, less alcohol or more alcohol. So I'm gonna shake this up, and then all you do is you\nput this into a crock pot that has water that covers\nthe amount of your tincture, and you're gonna put this\nin your crock pot on low for about eight hours\nand then you'll be done. So, thanks to the magic of television. I already have a cannabis\ntincture ready to go. So when you're done, you simply dump it into a\ncheesecloth lined strainer. The other thing I've seen people do is use a reusable nut milk bag, so those are bags that people use to make almond milk or cashew\nmilk and they're reusable. So you put it into your little satchel, your cheesecloth satchel and then actually like get right in there and really squeeze this. You do not wanna lose any of your beautiful\ntincture to the garbage. I know people do lots of stuff with the satchel of cannabis leftover when it's infused into butter or oil. You can make it into high chai or you can just dump that\nright into some baked goods. But when it's done with\nalcohol, it tastes terrible and I haven't seen any\ngood uses for it yet. So if you see a good\nuse for this at the end, please let me know in the comments. Otherwise, just squeeze\nuntil you feel like you've got it all out. You're gonna store this\nbeautiful mixture in one of these to keep it away from the sun, and then I'm gonna show you how to make some infused\nbeverages, let's go. Before we go any further, I wanted to point out three things. First, make sure that\nyou open your mason jar that's sitting in the warm water about every 1/2 hour to an hour while it is infusing in there to let go of some of the pressure, that's called burping your mason jar. Second, if you are trying\nto get a CBD tincture, then just make sure that you\nstart out with cannabis flower that's really high in CBD. This is a great recipe to have on hand because you can really\ncustomize the ingredients and get the exact type of\ntincture that you'd like. In fact, some people even\ninfuse other herbs and flowers into these tinctures. Let's think about some\nof the delicious drinks that you can make now that you know how to make a cannabis tincture. So this is really where your\nimagination gets to run wild. Basically any drink that you drink can now be infused with cannabis. You just take a couple\nof drops of your tincture or a dropper full of your\ntincture, and away you go. So lots of people love to make lemonade or just put some into their coffee or tea. People infuse or have cannabis\ninfused Pop, Coke or Pepsi, whatever it is, you can really\ndo whatever you want with it. The only thing to point out is to avoid mixing cannabis with alcohol. Let's talk about dosing. How do we know how much we're getting in a dropper full of\nthat cannabis tincture? There is a way to get a\nreally good approximation, it's not gonna be totally perfect, but this is a good way to\nget a good approximation. First thing is that you're gonna find out how much THC or CBD is in your flower. If you're buying lab tested cannabis, then you can just look at the label and it will tell you how much\nof those components are in it. If you don't have it with a label, and you do know the strain name, you can head over to\nleafly.com and type it in and they'll give you an approximation of how much you THC it might have in it. And if you don't have any idea what it is then you can take a guesstimate. Average THC concentrations\nright now seem to be around 15 to 20%, so take a guesstimate. And once you know how much\nTHC or CBD is in your flower, then you can go to this\nhandy-dandy dosing calculator. So it's at the wakeandbake.co website which I highly recommend if\nyou haven't checked it out, and all you do is fill out\nthis happy little chart here. So the Tangerine Dream that I infused had 15% THC and 1% CBD, and I use seven grams of it and I infused it into 1/2 cup of alcohol. So I know that in my whole infusion, there's 1,050 milligrams of THC, and in each teaspoon,\nthere's about 43 grams. So let's go back here and\nsee what we can do with that. I just wanna say though, even though you're using\na dosage calculator, that does not absolve you of the responsibility of\nstarting low and going slow because every time you make\na new cannabis infusion, it can be slightly different, so don't depend on the dosage calculator to give you the exact precise dose, make sure that you try it first and see how this particular\nbatch fits with you. So, most recommendations are to start with five milligrams of\nTHC or less per dose. So let's talk about my\ntincture that I just made. We know that it has 43\nmilligrams of THC per teaspoon, and each teaspoon has five milliliters. In tincture bottles, the droppers are standardized to one milliliter. So there's five droppers\nin one teaspoon of THC or in one teaspoon of tincture. So 43 divided by five is about 8.5 milligrams per each dropper. So in my tincture for each dropper fall, it's about 8.5 milligrams of THC. If I was trying to get\na five milligram dose, I would have slightly\nover half of the dropper and that would be my dose. It's really easy to adjust\nthe potency of your tinctures. If you wanted a more potent tincture, you would add more cannabis\nto the same amount of alcohol. So maybe you'd add 14 grams\nof cannabis instead of seven. If you wanted to less potent tincture, you would just add less cannabis to the same amount of\nalcohol and away you go, you can really customize it. I'm gonna give you a recipe for a delicious strawberry-mint spritzer, that you just put a couple of drops of cannabis tincture into\nand then it's infused and you can have a great afternoon. So what you do is you\ntake a cup of strawberries and a 1/2 cup of fresh mint and a couple of tablespoons of sweetener, whatever you're gonna use\nand mix it up in a saucepan so that it really begins to\nbreak down and come together and the mint releases its oil, it's gonna smell super beautiful. So do that, it takes about 10 minutes and then let it cool down and put it into a\nblender or food processor and pulse it until it's smooth. Grab a glass and fill it\nup with some spritzers or soda water and then put\nin a couple of tablespoons of your beautiful\nstrawberry mint concoction that you just made and however much of your\ncannabis tincture that you want and stir it up and you\nhave a beautiful infused, delicious cocktail.

[Music] all right guys my cannabis is now the carb so now we're going to add the vegetable glycerin to the mason jar so i'm just going to measure out the vegetable glycerin before i add it to the mason jar [Music] so i'm going to be using roughly 3 4 cups of vegetable glycerin so now i'm going to add this to the mason jar [Music] now we're going to add one teaspoon of sunflower that's a thin [Music] all right guys so now what i'm going to do is add some mct coconut oil to my mason jar now this is optional you don't have to do this [Music] now put your top on now what we're going to do is get a pot and add some water to it [Music] now put your pot on the stove turn your stove over medium to low heat now add your mason jar to the pot so now we're just going to let our mason jar simmer for a minimum of two hours i'm gonna let mine simmer for four hours all right guys so i've been over four hours my cannabis vegetable glycerin is now done so now we're gonna do is filter out the cannabis so grab a cheesecloth [Music] [Music] all right guys my cannabis vegetable glycerin is now done so now what i'm going to do is put this in a mason jar but before i do that i just wanted to let you know remember when i first started i started with 3 4 cups of vegetable glycerin currently i only have a little bit over one half but a little bit less than three four cups of vegetable glycerin so you may lose some of your vegetable glycerin during the infusing process and also during the filtering of your cannabis so in my mason jar there is a little bit of vegetable glycerin left but i was able to get out as much as i can so no worries but i just wanted to let you guys know that but let's put this in our mason jar [Music] all right guys my cannabis vegetable glycerin is now done thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe peace [Music]", "wB9vpJulP_4": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] mainly good quality bugs box elated you're gonna want to pre-heat your oven to 290 degrees and you're gonna want to decarboxylate you know all your bud used you know shape or trim I mean you can add Keith into the mixture doesn't matter Ruth is looking on as much trichomes as possible you know good quality trichomes so you want to pre-heat the oven up to 90 and we're gonna put this in for one hour and if you do it on lower heat if you do that like 282 75 you can cook it on lower heat you're gonna have to add more time so I can so I can do that for like an hour and a half but I've always done on 290 and the person has showed me how to do it and I've always had really good medicine come out of it so this is de LOI and if I keep doing it but you can mess with your times and all that stuff if you want but I'm just showing you the way I do it so I'm gonna put this in for an hour and I will be back alright after you've let your uh we the decarboxylase and turn your oven and stuff off look you're charged with alcohol I recommend doing this with a Everclear if you can get it it's about 20 bucks for a good sized bottle like around like 23 I know some place it's not a legal so you can use ISO isopropyl alcohol rubbing alcohol but make sure you use ninety one percent or higher and if you use less than ninety one percent like if you get like the 74 percent or whatever the other one like this day sell like a couple of was a fifty percent you're gonna have to put it in the freezer and then though you know to get those water to separate from it to get the outcomes they're just bested by the ninety one percent or really the bug like the food grade alcohol it's available in your area and after I put the alcohol in here when I close them up I like to shake the [ __ ] out of them is it just to get the stuff mix it on I'm gonna put this in the freezer for 24 hours and you know every few hours or so I'll pull the jars up shake them up put them back in there and when this stuff comes out alcohol it should be like like really really dark brown almost like a black looking color when we're done before we cook it off and that'll be the next stage so that's right now oh yeah by the way make sure that you change out your jars or let these jars cool down you know think you don't want to be throwing hot glass in the freezer shattered see you guys filter your extraction I use the coffee filters the natural brown don't use the white ones because they have a bleach on and you don't want to introduce any of these chemicals into your medicine so you just let it kind of sit in there for all the jars we had when the cloth that we have the actual plant material tied up down below squeeze it up that big bowl over there and 1/4 than everyone utilized as you don't utilize every drop of it that you can to get the most yield and most out of your medicine as possible so I'll come back after we get this process done when we get to the final stage of actually cooking off the alcohol and show it's plain aptio and we'll get into that that's an example of how the extracted alcohol should look a dark really dark brown after it's all filtered and stuff it should be a really dark brown color the darker it is the more yield you're gonna get out of that extraction so that's what you're looking for we're looking for that dark color like that [Applause] [Music] [Applause] first off the seams are gonna be probably sick and second of all you know wants to use building up because then it's a huge explosion hazard so be very very careful [Applause] honestly if I had my own counsel and I probably in my backyard clicking this off upside back way that's honestly the best would be and the rear an apartment it's about a second best thing I'll be back when we get down near the bubbles little tiny bubbles that's the last process early you just wait to see that no more of its boiling off and stop seeing the bubbles and although that's don't be like a nice smooth clear surface which I'll show you when it's finally said look how low that temperatures see I'm saying and by the time it's done he'll be just like barely on from that low part you just keep lowering of temperature man as you go I'm looking for the bubbles all right to keep coming to boil it off but you're slowing it down keep the lower temperature when it's done and tastes it all you're gonna taste rate hash a straight love the straight hash matters all you're gonna taste you taste the alcohol it means you boil it off how much to go directly [Music] this right here I knew with this row all this makes me t oh that's how they all make the hatchling here remember all that oil we have left in that pot right there today you know later I went ahead and took some of this uh like yeah Maharajah chai boba boba dong and Samurai sorry mate long tea or some stuff we've got a team on some fancy expensive tea but it's booked involved this [ __ ] [ __ ] smells so [ __ ] me like straight up like I'm like cinnamon and [ __ ] masa and spices awesome let me put some a couple of cinnamon sticks in there this is the first pass you could get the most oil in it but this is all cannabis oil infused medicated teeth and there's the second pass which is can tell by the colors and Cortis down being strong but this would be good for relax and have some good this one you know get cuff of that one there we'll definitely set you up medicate you just like if you took a glob of the actual oil say that's what I do do I don't waste any of the concentrated oil I make I made tea boil it awful done you know the last amount that's left in the pan utilized everything you

medicine for her is mental me when she lived in Kansas she had to literally go drive around in\nthe streets to try to bite from drug dealers hmm and then she decided to move to\nCalifornia where it's legalized medicinal purposes and she's able to get\nit in a legal safe environment but what yeah look Jacob course I agree with you\non on the medicinal value a bit on how we should allow her to smoke it if it is\nhelping her with her condition overall I mean I feel like they're be\nthe downside up marijuana is so small compared to the\ndownside the war on drugs so I would much rather does legalize it\nfor recreational purposes as Colorado and Washington have done %uh then took play this stupid game\nwe're pretending as if we care about other people who want to help them with\ntheir marijuana addiction no official I don't believe it for a\nsecond that there's a single politician right now in office who thinks that the war on drugs is\nactually hoping people who have marijuana addiction Spurs the\nwall yes you can kind of get addicted to marijuana not chemically right but if you smoke everyday your\nbody does get used to it right but it's not the kind of addiction that\ncripples your life it's not like you're addicted to crack cocaine or heroin or\nsomething like that yeah it's like with me with neighbors\nroom yeah there's a downside to it mean there isn't any you know I maybe\nI'm not chemically addicted but they are delicious and rated and I believe that which was live\nin a free country exactly where we lead our citizens the\nside what's right for them and of course the biggest irony is always the right wing that rails against big\ngovernment want to get in there and tell this lady\nknow all don't know you can take that kinda\nmedicine or smoke that will put that in your body because I love big government and as big\ngovernment tell you the you can't do that with your own body\nget out of our lives get out or privacy our medical\nconditions get out get out get out and their and by\nthe way why you do it admitted finally the you actually love\nbig government", "B8VBMurJI4w": "i'm ashley brennan founder of sabine holistic health sabina holistic health is a non-profit organization that helps medical cannabis patients with medicine costs cost is the biggest problem medical cannabis patients have with medical marijuana treatment we believe that all patients who need medical cannabis should have affordable access to it today i'm discussing using medical cannabis suppositories medical cannabis suppositories are cannabis infused oil in a suppository form that is inserted into the rectum while this may not sound like a very attractive way to use medical cannabis it can be absolutely necessary for some patients who can't inhale or ingest cannabis orally or those with extreme nausea and vomiting medical cannabis suppositories can be made very easily at home if they are not available at your dispensary so let's talk all about medical cannabis suppositories medical cannabis suppositories are small cone or bullet shaped substances that can be inserted either rectally or vaginally for women medical cannabis suppositories offer the best absorption rate of all methods of using medical cannabis no cannabinoids or terpenes are lost with suppositories cannabinoids and terpenes may be lost through heating cannabis in inhaled methods or through digestion in ingested methods suppositories are felt quickly usually within 15 minutes after being inserted the effects of a suppository feel the same as when cannabis was smoked or vaporized however the effects last much longer than inhaling cannabis using suppositories the effects will last between four to eight hours when inhaling cannabis they can only last about two hours because of how the medical cannabis suppository is inserted into the rectum or vagina these are often considered an exotic form of using cannabis although this form of marijuana may be considered exotic for some it is necessary for others medical cannabis suppositories are excellent choices for delivering medical marijuana to patients who can't take medication orally due to extreme nausea or vomiting or due to a throat injury that prevents them from taking oral medications medical cannabis suppositories can also be very effective in treating rectal conditions such as hemorrhoids rectal or pelvic diseases or inflammatory bowel diseases medical cannabis suppositories are also good for elderly patients who can't take or swallow pills or those on restricted diets who can't use other methods while medical cannabis suppositories may not be a preferred choice by many they offer superior absorption of cannabis and are essential for patients who can't use cannabis in any other form or those who suffer from certain medical conditions medical cannabis suppositories may not be available at all dispensaries especially those new to medical marijuana if they are available they range from about five dollars to thirty dollars medical cannabis suppositories are available in some states with more developed medical marijuana programs such as dispensaries in california but definitely not available in all areas at this time medical cannabis suppositories can be easily made at home in a short amount of time if they are not available to you use the link in the description for a guide to making your own suppositories all you need to make suppositories are cannabis infused oil and suppository molds if you have the oil prepared suppositories can be made in only five minutes if you need to make the cannabis infused oil it will take several hours but it is fairly quick considering you can make a good quantity at a time upwards of 50 or more medical cannabis suppositories are also good for one year if you make them using the recipe linked in the description they should be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator so check out that link if medical cannabis suppositories aren't available to you and you would like to make your own the downside to medical cannabis suppositories is they may feel uncomfortable during insertion and they can leak during a bowel movement or with flatulence it is recommended that you use medical cannabis suppositories at a time when you are not experiencing gas or expecting to have a bowel movement medical cannabis suppositories should be firm and cool when they are inserted they should be kept in the refrigerator if the suppository is not firm when ready to be used it can be placed in the freezer until it becomes firm usually after a few minutes medical cannabis suppositories should be inserted with clean hands or medical gloves they should be inserted around 1 to 1.5 inches into the rectum the effects of a medical cannabis suppository will depend on the strain used to make the suppository there are some considerations if you are buying medical cannabis suppositories or choosing a strain to make your own suppositories the first thing to consider is the thc and cbd in a strain medical cannabis suppositories and their effects will feel very similar to inhaled cannabis so if you're familiar with a strain that you use in inhaled forms it would provide the same effects in a suppository high thc suppositories or strains will produce euric effects high cbd suppositories or strains will be non-intoxicating one-to-one thc to cbd suppositories or strains may produce mild euphuria or none at all depending on the person a 10 to 1 ratio or higher of cbd to thc will completely eliminate any intoxicating effects one-to-one ratios are good for patients who need higher levels of thc but don't prefer the high of thc you can also consider other cannabinoids and terpenes in a strain and their medical applications to help you better treat your symptoms find a complete downloadable chart of all the cannabinoids and terpenes and their medical uses using the link in the description this can help you in choosing a medical strain to treat your condition no matter what method you are using after determining the thc and cbd ratios and other cannabinoids or terpenes based on the euphoric effects and the levels needed to treat your condition you can look at strain types indica sativa or hybrid indica strains are relaxing and sedative and best for nighttime use sativa strains are energizing and best for daytime use hybrid strains are popular choices for balanced effects of energizing and relaxing depending on the strain these are things to consider when using suppositories or any other method and just generally good recommendations for choosing a medical strain medical cannabis suppositories can be used by all patients but are especially beneficial for those who can't or don't want to use oral methods for elderly or young patients and in treating gastrointestinal or rectal conditions suppositories work quickly and last long offering the best absorption of all methods of using medical marijuana use the links in the description for resources to make your own suppositories and for free downloads and resources for finding your best medical strain you can find a wealth

top 7 tips for using cannabis to help you with sleep hi my name is Andrea McHargue I'm a cannabis coach and educator and I'm really passionate about teaching people how they can use cannabis to live happier healthier lives I offer one-on-one coaching and consulting I also have some key classes that are coming up and some workshops so you can stay tuned for all of that at my website insomnia can be characterized by three main things first you are not happy with how you're sleeping second you're having troubles falling asleep or staying asleep and third this really affects your daily quality of life so all these three things have to be in place for you two can be considered to have insomnia and it has effects that are way more than just needing an extra coffee in the morning so it can lead to obesity and type 2 diabetes heart disease depression injuries and even death and I'm just gonna say also that having insomnia or a low quality of sleep leads to a really crappy way to live your life if you're exhausted all the time you're not enjoying your life to the fullest and you're you're doing your health some damage as well so what can be done my first tip for you is to try THC first people have been using cannabis to help them fall asleep and stay asleep for literally thousands of years and the reason that we've been doing that is because it really works for most people a small dose of about 5 to 10 milligrams sends them off into dreamland but for some people they require a much larger dose if your dispensary or where you buy your cannabis still still classifies things as far as indica or sativa you want to stay on the indica side of the counter and a good way to remember the distinction between indica and sativa is that indica should leave you in couch kind of couch left and feeling sleepy and tired and not wanting to get up sativa strains tend to make you feel more uplifted and bright and lively and you don't want that right before you fall asleep and with THC it's very important that you start with a very low dose and go slow some people take too much THC at the beginning and then they feel anxious and paranoid and have some negative side effects that they don't want for lots of people a very low dose of THC is all they need to help them with insomnia and sleep issues so make sure that you start with a low dose and work your way up from there tip number two is to try CBD second THC helps most people fall asleep and stay asleep but for some people CBD seems to be the magic bullet so if you try to teach C before and you didn't like how that made you feel or it didn't seem to work don't give up yet remember that CBD is not intoxicating at all and it won't make you feel high or stoned when shopping for CBD products make sure that they are designed for sleep so look for products that say that they're gonna help to put you to sleep or help put you in a relaxing mood they might have special terpenes in them that also are sleep promoting so look for products that are specifically designed to put you off into dreamland and to complicate things a little bit further for some people it's not straight THC or straight CBD that seems to help it's a blend of both so again we have to work with this planned in this plant medicine for a while to see what works with every individual person but if you're willing to give it the time then again maybe you can have some really good night's sleep tip number three is to look for cannabis or cannabis products that have cbn in it so most people have heard of the CBD and THC but cannabis is filled with hundreds of different molecules and one of them that's kind of like the big exciting one in the sleep world right now is called CBN it's known to be very sleep promoting the interesting thing about cbn is that it's about a quarter of psychoactive as THC so people can take larger doses of it without encountering some of the negative side effects that are associated with THC and again products that have a CBN or flower that has CBN and it also usually has THC and/or CBD in it in it so again it's a balancing act to try to something that works exactly well for you number four is to use fat based edibles or oils to help get you to sleep and keep you asleep the reason being is that although they take a while to kick in they take about an hour or two hours to kick in they can last the effects of keeping you asleep can last for six eight or even more hours and when you wake up the next morning you're not groggy or hungover like you would be after a sleeping bill it's super important when you're talking about edibles and oils to start low and go slow a small dose like two point five milligrams of THC helps lots of people get to sleep and stay asleep but the inclination sometimes is to take some cannabis oil or take a small piece of an edible and then half an hour later you're still not asleep so you think it didn't work so you take more but because it takes so long to kick in you may be you may be taking way too much cannabis than you need and that can lead to side effects and having a bad night's sleep instead so take a small amount if it doesn't work tonight take another dose tomorrow night make sure that you're starting low and going really slow with this I have tutorials for how to make your own cannabis oil and a couple of well one recipe for it's called fake fudge that's really excellent for sleeping and I'll link to both of those in the description below so edibles and oils work great for a long-term sleep support but what about those nights when you can't wait for an hour or two for it to kick in or you're up at 3 o'clock in the morning and you need sleep support right now vaporizers are really excellent for instant sleepless support you can fill them with a sleepy strain of flour or high-quality concentrate oil and then if you need that instant sleep support you can just take a couple of puffs from your vaporizer and hopefully that helps you put you back into dreamland and maybe it's a combination that's going to work for you maybe you're gonna need to take some edibles and you're going to need to vaporize cannabis to really get you the quality sleep that you need do it works for you cannabis comes in different varieties usually called strange this is kind of like how apples come in different varieties and there's a couple of different varieties of cannabis strains that are known to really help with sleep so granddaddy purple is my husband's absolute favorite strain it helps him feel relaxed and at peace and it helps them drift off into sleep in fact any cannabis strain that you find that has the main purple in it usually means that it's gonna help you put you in that relaxed mood some other streams to look out for our Northern Lights Death Bubba and most of the Kush streams again it's always best to talk to an experienced budtender or your friends to find out what helps put them to sleep and I want to remind you that cannabis affects everybody differently so my husband loves granddaddy purple and it puts him right out but it doesn't do the same for me so if what your best friend says should work for you doesn't work for you that doesn't mean that cannabis isn't working it just means that maybe you haven't found the right strain yet so we know that some strains help put us to sleep better than others but why is that besides compounds like CBD and THC and CBN all cannabis plants have other compounds called terpenes and if you know anything about essential oils you're already familiar with terpenes terpenes are what gives plants their smell and terpenes also have therapeutic effects so one of the terpenes that you can look for is called lynn Ahlul and that's the chirping that's in lavender and that's why lavender is so calming is because it's filled with lentils so if you can find cannabis that has a high percentage of little that will likely help put you in a relaxed state and the second one to look out for is called Mir seen the thing with Mir seen is that it's the most prevalent chirping and cannabis so you'll find it in almost every strain so it's not like something with me Erskine is definitely gonna help put you to sleep but if you can find something that has a much higher percentage of Mir seen than than the other terpenes in there that is a good indication that that will help we do with sleep issues all right so let's go through our seven tips first try THC it's the compound in cannabis that helps most people fall asleep and stay asleep but for some people THC isn't their jam and CBD might be thing that helps helps you with your sleep issues third look for CBN this is kind of the new it molecule fat-based edibles and oils help you fall asleep and help you stay asleep but sometimes you might need vaporization for instant sleep support remember to seek out strains that are specifically known to help people stay asleep and check out for the terpenes Lin Alou and miR scene so now what so now you know how to look for cannabis that might help you fall asleep and stay asleep but what if you're new to the cannabis scene or you're just not sure how to get started with cannabis period don't worry I totally have you covered I have a free video on my website that teaches you how to get started with cannabis you just go to WWF cannabis calm and enter your

much for watching", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what you solo today don't

showcase just for you guys so first off before we get into this make sure to smash that like button if you like and support mcdent be sure to share this video if you found it useful and as always hit that subscribe button so you can stay updated with more stuff that we got coming out all right so today here I have with me is Genesis farms RS oh now this is a pulp plant extract okay I'm gonna pop this open and kind of bring this out here this is the RSL by Genesis farms and this is a quite again a full plant extract okay now RSO is Rick Simpson oil that's what it stands for that's who created it and this is a lot of things you hear about like ah oh it's helping cancer or oh it's helping with seizures and epilepsy and all kinds of stuff this is the kind of this is it okay this is one of the things that they're using to help with cancer to help fight cancer help you know fight various other you know ailments and diseases and stuff like that this is this is the medicine right here okay this is the cannabis medicine and anyway so what you do very simple now you can take it orally or you can take it all rectally okay now if you're going to take it rectally that's something i recommend it you're in late stages of cancer do you have a serious condition that's something I would recommend and take it retro late but I take it orally as do many other people and so what you do here with the artist oh okay very simple now I might explain dosages to to you because a lot of people don't understand their dosages so what top their top here now what I like to do some people just put it on their tongue you know and just do the damn thing what I like to do is I get a snack so here I got some peanut butter crackers and yeah gonna open these mobile pop-ups so we got our cracker here and so what I like to do is I like to just put it on the food and just it's so don't such is why so when you're starting out if you don't have very high tolerance if you don't use RSO at all on you're gonna want to start out with like a ballpoint pen you know mount just the tip of a ballpoint pen amount so it's like a little B you know and then you work your way you gradually work your way up to like the size of a grain of rice and you know the size of the piece and then you know eventually you will work your way up to almost like half Rams programs depending on you know if you need it or not so anyway so I got this I'm gonna put it right here gonna put a little bit push so I want everybody to see it come out - now I have a high tolerance and I do take our ISO so I'm gonna be taking a little more than I you know recommend everybody that's a little bit it's a little bit bigger than a grain of rice but that's that's what I take and I'm telling you guys this this helps out with a lot I mean my father uses it he's using it for his blood pressure and and whatnot and it's working great you know I know people have used it for diabetes all kinds of stuff so do some more research you know Google RSO do some more research if you're interested I'm not an expert on it so I can't sit here and tell you everything about it but I can tell you that it does work and it does work wonders okay so here we go oh my god hands up it does not taste good okay [Music] nope occupation now I can taste it oh there's a reason I mix it with food and just don't do it right on the tongue whoo it's got its own unique taste to it it really does wash it on down with a good spray and yeah and we're ready to go you know you got to give it 30 45 minutes or so to activate but once it does you'll feel a nice relaxed mellow feeling and it will last you almost all day if not until I know some people that experience on until the next day so yeah it's a great it's a great product and I really enjoy it and I really enjoyed my Genesis forums they make like some of the best not or they make some of the best if not the best RSO here in the state of Oregon okay and again it's this 45 minute activation time so like I said you got to get it you know some time to kind of sink in this is one gram cannabis concentrate and let's see let's look at the container here see if it's got any other ol concentrations are produced with pure alcohol okay so this is made of pure alcohol store in a cool dry place keep tightly capped when not in use so yeah because obviously you don't want to be pushing down this plunger and getting it everywhere and making a mess and all that kind of stuff so be careful with that always make sure you put the cap back on when you're done so anyway that is the artist so that is a great product this Genesis farms RSO is available in a lot of different disciplines cerise throughout Oregon so go ahead and Leafly it search it you know so you can find the closest dispensary to you so you can pick it on up and yeah I mean this is the RSO and something I take daily it's something that you know my family take daily and it's something that I highly recommend all right they do come in the high THC that's what this one is it's the high THC and they do have a high CBD one I believe so either/or but this is a full plant extract that means it's got the full plant in it all the cannabinoids all that stuff it's all in here so check out some ourselves check it out by Genesis farms and as always much love and I hope everybody's having a great night Mick take interchange this tank

"all right well it is God it's almost four o'clock in the morning I was really really busy today I felt good all day long I couldn't have done those four weeks ago there's there's no way I can get out of the bed I couldn't barely leave the house but as you know I left the I left the house this afternoon on his seven or eight hours ago it's actually evening but I didn't been a nothing up for about 15 hours now didn't need a nap today that's something to note because that's the first time I think in a while that I haven't gotten a sleepy period during the day so I must be really acclimating we're getting used to taking this order so well plus I think I'm I'm obviously getting better so anyway it's night time time for bed today I did a lot walk driving packed some stuff that I had to get shipped out stuff that we sold on the website so some seaweed we sold some cigars I sold some stuff money bag I'm gonna start by taking my Delta eight nine before I go to bed I just took a promise to full-line there you go you can see that again nausea but pressure that's up with my appetite I might need a little stuff before I go to bed here I usually try to eat right before I take more so it didn't eat about an hour ago and I think that's pretty important with as much as I'm taking because it will drop your blood pressure you know much a blood pressure bottomed out on you so always good to eat you don't want to when that happens you can also get sick wait so and it's nice and so make sure you eat if you're gonna take part or if you don't want to do it on an empty stomach alright so here we go here's our air so it comes full usually to the one-line mark this one came a little bit short I noticed that when I got it actually and it hasn't really happened to me before actually with the RSO this one is the hybrid I was using that throughout the day so you can see I did take it throughout the day and this point since I've been awake I've probably ingested over well over 500 milligrams of THC I'm gonna go ahead and take my order so now I like to put it on my finger I don't know why you do it your wake but right in your mouth if you want but I'm taking a good bit now I'm just going to show you when I'm taking here okay I took about three lawns let's go ahead and get a little bit more so we've a pretty generous here I'm just gonna put in my mouth this is softer than the distillate it comes out real easy I actually like the taste it's strong tastes like cannabis scent it's like you would expect the plant material to taste but it's easy to swallow you know just kind of let it around in my mouth and kind of just elutes itself and eventually goes down so it's not offensive or anything like that like I said I actually kind of like the taste and if I'm up a little bit longer I may even take a teeny bit more so that's about what I've been doing at night and now I've gotten used to taking some broom the day too so I really do think that you get used to taking this stuff of course like I said I'm also feeling a whole lot better so a lot of it could be done to now I'm still got a bandaid on Mara so I've been told I can leave this on for up to four days and another or so we'll still be actively working so what I am gonna do those go ahead and put on my topical cream now that I do I don't have really any discomfort around my neck today and it's again you know something that I have been having and it's just over the last week or so it was like it week three it seemed like everything just became really apparent that it was working it was like exponential all of a sudden I noticed things like my vision had improved and not just a little bit but significantly and I'm gonna go get my eyes checked tomorrow so that I can compare those numbers to a basic exam that I had at a live scan a few months or a couple months ago when they found my nodules and my thyroid so and that system or a tumor in my abdomen or wherever it is they still haven't found it I don't think they're gonna find it because I think the orso's or got rid of it be honest with you all right so I've done my or so I've put my cream on my neck now I'm gonna go and I've done my distillate and now I'm going to take some tincture and I'm gonna put it in the back of my neck or in back of my throat rather and this bottle I have another bottle there I'm gonna have to be up on my aura so soon so I hope true leaf has it readily available this bottles getting low so I'm gonna finish it off put it right in the back of my throat just because that's a crime trying to get it close to my affected area so I'm also putting it right in my mouth and then it says in the directions to let it kind of aerate it for about ten seconds so that bottles done all right well that pretty much tests out I'm gonna go out on my back porch and I'm gonna bait a little bit of non pound hammer before I go to bed and I'll see you tomorrow living with RSI was actually not all that difficult I really thought I was gonna be in the bed for 60 days it's doing this but somewhere around the 20-day point right around three weeks now I was about two weeks I was actually starting to get my energy back but in three weeks wow what a difference I'm not about day 25 now I have to go back and count I think I started on January 7th so anyway doing really really good I'm like a whole different person than I was a month ago see you guys tomorrow good night", "wmAOe_klMKY": "[Music] hello looks like Alistair is making a transaction here of some kind I don't know what you think you're gonna get out of there hey sweetie are you cold hey Connor all right yeah it's no one all right okay so we're up in Lake Tahoe area is that for cove on the Nevada side so we came up here originally to my sister Eden because we're not certain on all the Utah laws regarding CBD oil now it doesn't mean that you can't take it in Utah they do sell it I think some people say like hey you need a card from a doctor it really just depends because we were uncertain about the laws we decided to come out to Nevada so anyway yeah because we were uncertain we just came out to Nevada my sister lives out here in Reno so we came up the mountain to Tahoe she's gonna meet up with us here and give you guys a little bit more information I also want to stay in fatica Lee we are not legal counsel you are responsible you do your own research find out what it is you need to know and your local laws hi my name is Ian Wakefield and I am a full-time cannabis consultant and I also run a cannabis coaching business on the side yeah and why are you here what are you doing well I'm Robbie's oldest sister and I'm here to help with Ian's issues that he faces with his autism with some CBD oil okay and what kind of this can you pull it back to your face love it yes this is the harmonious brand CBD it's a full spectrum that's different from a distillate in that this contains all of the compounds of the hemp plant versus distillate which would only contain the CBD itself so this is better than what I just said find over the shelf at like my local mall or like that absolutely also because you may find full spectrums here and there in that way but you won't always have somebody who has put their lab testing next to the product online there is always going to be current lab tests for every batch with the bottle okay and in full disclosure we are using this for free thanks to the generosity of Ian sprint Eden's friend at harmonious I'm Eden Eden Ian we screw it up sometimes so there they're gonna offer this this to us for free so we could try it out yeah so that's nice yeah very nice of them yeah anything else you want to say about it or huh you know I stand by a hundred percent i I tell everybody about it that I can and especially people who are afraid to try THC or you know any of the heavier products this is a really really great alternative well and that's another thing too so THD THC versus CBD why don't you tell us maybe just very briefly the legality involved but also you know how THC is a neurological inhibitor or that kind of thing yeah THC has many medicinal benefits that are we're still exploring in science and the legalities kind of put a damper on that because federally it's not legal to actually perform lab testing on actual cannabis in the United States this is from the hemp plant cannabis is cousin and it has all the other medicinal medicinal compounds that you're going to want but yeah as far as something that has higher THC in it that's going to be where you're going to need to be in a legal state and and deal with it on your own make your own decisions accordingly mileage may vary no this is fine this is this is over-the-counter type stuff yeah yeah you can order this this is this is legally able to be shipped throughout the United States without problem including Utah including Utah yeah so we just found out about this recently and sorry if my voice is a little bit muffled behind the mic but we just found out the laws change so rapidly that Utah has legalized CBD oil over the counter I think it's okay to give it to minors in Utah we were unsure so we came out here to Nevada because I knew my sister would know better than most in accordance with local laws and customs and things like that yeah this is completely legal to give your kids the FDA is trying to step in and stop CBD from being able to be given to pets and kids and things like that and we're working on fighting that because CBD isn't regulated though that's why I prefer to go to this brand because he does things through state regulations so even though it can be shipped Internet you know anywhere you wanted to go it's still above board for a product that you know is going to be regulated you know that this is going to be factual okay awesome yeah was anything else you wanted to say I'm just really grateful to Brandon and Anthony and the guys over at Harmonia CBD for being so generous is to offer us this opportunity to see how we can help Ian with CBD oil okay how long I'm gonna do another Tong three drops one two three that's it hmm three jobs three jobs to start yep sweet drops looks perfect oh good it's better than a half one because a half one makes my likes crazy I just like your spirit on does how was it taste I taste a low flame a little fight yeah what would you say to people who just say you're judging your kid you're just making them passive and zombie like that would you have to say about that well at first I'd say that's not true that's not what happens I mean Ian's as talkative and has as much of his personality as ever he's he's a bit calmer and I'd argue that this medicine isn't really for us the parents it's honestly more for the kid they're less anxious they're able to sleep better they're able to concentrate better on the tasks they have at school and the tours they have at home and whatever choose for their mind - I think it's highly beneficial yeah and that's been for a spiritum so we think so far of the oil well I'd say the biggest difference I've noticed between risperidone and the CBD oil is that risperidone immediately makes in sleepy and he is actually more tired and more lethargic on her Sparrow dome than he is on CBD oil although the CBD oil has a more calming effect yarr that may not be true for so much my understandings of you in facts so I'm trying to get through this it affects people differently based on their um their body chemistry and their neurological I'm not sure why that is so it's really nice to see and reacting well to it it's still too early to tell if this will be a permanent replacement does it risperidone but again whether it's perd\u00f3n it's just there's too many side effects that long-term we think what could be detrimental especially how it makes him a little bit sleepy to begin with and then that is kind of like pacifying him not that we want him to behave that way it's just how he responded to it and so as many people have mentioned online with medications there's a kind of a cocktail that people go through where they try risperidone and that doesn't work so they try a belif and vilify abilify and they just kind of go down the list of different medications until that wears off then they go on to the next thing and we want to try something that's made available more natural a little bit more long-term the Ian can take and not have any major side effects so far the only side effect we can see that I guess you could say was major was that he woke us up at 4:00 a.m. and he goes daddy I'm hungry so he he had the munchies for a lack of a better term so one of the things we did want to mention is we're starting out small and we're working our way up so we started a very small dosage and we monitor Ian's heart rate and things like that so I put my hand on his wrist I did a stopwatch and he was about 75 beats per minute so he did well in the middle of the night I checked his pupils made sure that they weren't dilated or anything like that and they reacted just fine another thing that is nice is the cost it's about half as much as risperidone how did you feel I feel I feel good I feel good what was the word you said fantastic you felt fantastic a little bit fantastic well that's good yeah do you still feel fantastic yeah cuz I've done a lot of I was playing with my freak imaginary friends they're right they're directors it's crowded there are there's a lot of them there's a lot of your imaginary friends yeah they're all come to a party with me and us nice dear hey everybody we're back in Utah right out here walking with Ian you can probably hear him say hey hey guys yes you are so I just want to do a quick little recap here kind of a summary of the week in Nevada where basically ending Ian's dosage on the CBD oil I'd love to continue it actually I had some pretty good results it doesn't last as long as his or spare at all but I like that it doesn't have as many side effects especially the drowsiness that comes with her spear at all hopefully it doesn't get too loud we're heading into a construction area I would have done it inside the house but the kids have been super noisy so I come out here and there's construction everywhere what do you do so anyway um basically the the Utah laws are such that we can't continue the CBD oil to the best of my understanding you guys can correct me in the comments section if you want let me know more but as I checked the last bill that was passed in 2018 was like 200 pages long I don't have time to read it most people don't and it basically covered things like epilepsy in terms of getting a medical card and autism wasn't even on that list so yeah you basically need permission from a doctor or a medical card saying that you know your child needs CBD oil I forgot to mention too if any of you are new to the channel it's been well documented that ian has autism you can see his paperwork there just because we get that question a lot because he is more or less high-functioning now and you can talk a lot of people are like is even autistic should you be giving him medication yes he is but anyway aside from all that we would have loved to continue using CBD oil and you know many people do no matter what the laws are I don't think anyone's going to come after those people we want to be careful because we're putting on YouTube and inevitably you get one or two zealous parents who are like that's it I'm gonna call Child Protective Services on you you're torturing your kid you're a terrible parent blah blah blah long story short you know they're they're calling people and just making your life miserable because they've got nothing better to do we're trying to do the best we can for our son that's the honest to goodness truth we really want Ian to be happy and healthy and when it comes to more severe autism and he's not very severe but the further you go down the spectrum the more difficult life becomes just doing basic things just feeling like you can go outside without being overwhelmed and he has a difficult time with that kind of stuff he gets overwhelmed so it helps him yes it helps us to that's an added benefit but the the first priority is to help him out so he can go to school you can go to church you can go to public places and not be overwhelmed and just make it through the day without tons of problems so we appreciate my sister and her friends for letting us have the oil for free I'm very nice of them it doesn't reflect anything on our review we just tell the truth you know how it is it's not a magic bullet it's it's been great though so far I would recommend it to those who want to try it of course your mileage may vary just depends on the person everybody's chemistry is different so yeah I hope that was helpful and if you guys of course have any comments questions let us know appreciate all of our supporters and we will see you next time", "KdvTDn-z24U": "just like you're not done their age okay okay\nI'm here with my mom's July 7th this is her first week taking the oil I've been\nasking her questions and she knows

does it work find out on this episode of we neezy by the growth of dipping your toes into the cannabis waters can seem daunting especially if you've had a bad experience in the past with overindulgence having too much cannabis or greening out can be overwhelming cause anxiety and generally just scare people off trying cannabis again that's where micro dosing can help this practice has been used by medical cannabis patients for years and is a great way to consume cannabis for anyone partaking but what is micro dosing micro dosing is used to help you determine what strain works best for you and at what quantity or dose since there is currently no standardized dosing guide for medical users this method has been used to help them find the best treatment plan for their cannabis medication but it works just as well for those who are enjoying cannabis for recreational reasons the standard mantra for micro dosing is start low and go slow starting low when consuming cannabis it's recommended that you start at a low dose first depending on the format you are using to consume dosing may be different with dried flower you may want to start with just a few draws on a joint vape or bomb if you're using oil capsules you may want to start with a 2.5 milligram dose versus a 10 milligram dose this also helps when trying different strains or CBD to THC ratios as every strain is different and your body will react to it differently by starting with a low dose you can monitor how each strain makes you feel and the way your body reacts to it going low on the dose will ensure you don't over indulge and give you insight into the strains and methods that work best for you going slow the second half of the mantra is all about taking your time don't rush the process as it may cause you to overindulge and have a bad experience part of micro dosing is about understanding how much you need to achieve the high you want that means testing testing and testing it's also important to understand how different consumption methods metabolize in the body for instance smoking cannabis typically metabolizes quickly and you can start to feel results in as little as 10 to 15 minutes while edibles can take anywhere from 45 minutes to several hours before you feel air effects edibles are a great example of the importance of the go-slow methodology often when people are first trying edibles they rush the process they become disappointed when they don't feel anything right away and either have more of the edible or consume cannabis another way because they don't think the edible

asking a very important question can you and should you Deb RS oh that's right folks today we're gonna be dabbing RS o which stands for Rick Simpson oil now you hear a lot about it being used in cooking or people sometimes use it to make bombs but you you're never really here to our sublingually you know like under the tongue but you never really hear too much about people dabbing it and you know depending on who you ask the the answer could vary like yeah yeah you don't but so in theory we should be able to dab it and it should work but the question is should we so you know what I went ahead I got myself some mag landrace that's from Murano now or brown anorexia gold leaf whoever whatever they're calling themselves this day is mag mile as you know mag landrace is one of my favorite strains and I can't wait to taste it I hope there's gonna be good so wish me luck [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] all right folks went ahead had my damp and a lot to break down here now as far as being effective you know working it is working very fast you know but that's mag Landry's guys I mean it's it's probably it is my favorite strain but a lot of people's as well because it works but the taste I got to tell you was awful I really kind of regret doing that not only did it taste bad it burned up so fast and it left a really Brown really nasty residue from where it was and you know I don't know if it's from you know that from the ethanol that you know whatever but yeah I got it all dirty and you know now I got to go either hit it with a torch or you got to start scrubbing it it can be a pain in the ass trying to clean that thing but oh god the taste at first it's like whoo and then it's like oh yeah this is this is I shouldn't be doing this so yeah guys if you were ever one if you're ever wondering if they if you could day of RSO is yes you can is it effective yes it is does it is that do you think it's worth it I do not I don't think it's worth it if you like to keep your stuff clean and if you enjoy the taste of your extract please go with something anything else to this and I guarantee it'll be just as good or better of an experience so if you like this video please give it a thumbs up if you haven't by now please subscribe I'd like to thank all my subscribers friends family everybody that's you know making this journey you know doable and last but not least thanks for the view", "vu1RKWQtN-M": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today I have a very exciting video that's been highly requested and I'm sorry it was taking so long I'm going to be showing you guys how I make my extra strong green dragon picture this photo has one cup of liquid and 10 grams of wheat and then I reduced it to 1/3 of a cup meaning that now there is 5 tablespoons in 1/3 of a cup so every tablespoon is 2 grams of wheat you're gonna need the carbs wheat for this recipe and I'll post a link of how to do that below here's what you're gonna need alcohol that is 95% alcohol or higher some coffee filters or cheesecloth a funnel some mason jars and 10 grams of the carb to read the first step is to freeze your Dakkar bleed for at least 24 hours I have already done that and now that it's been over 24 hours I'm going to pour in 2/3 of a cup of vodka that has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours the instructions for this can still be followed even if you're not using the same amount of wheat that I am which is 10 grams all you have to do is pour enough vodka to fill just to the top of the weed now you're going to shake it aggressively for 5 minutes then you'll put it in the freezer for at least 2 hours I ended up leaving mine in the freezer for about 20 hours there's no need to leave it for long within 2 hours I did that simply because I ran at a time now I'm placing a funnel into my mason jar and I'm going to poke some holes into my coffee filter so that it flows through a little bit quicker if you don't have any coffee filters you can also use cheesecloth then place that into the funnel now you can take your weed and vodka mixture out of the freezer and shake it aggressively for another 5 minutes pour your mixture into the filter and try to avoid spilling it over the edge like I do here then wait for it to filter through this can take a while sometimes even up to a half an hour you can see how slowly it comes out of the bottom and then once almost all of the liquid has gone through I'll move the weed around to try and facilitate more of the liquid to be filtered through I put some gloves on because if your fingers are touching the weed and vodka it can absorb some of the THC and we obviously don't want that because that would be a waste now that all the vodka has gone through the filter I'm going to scoop back the weed into the jar you can see how much weed is left in the funnel because I spilled it when I poured it in so again try to avoid doing that if you can [Music] now I'm going to pour in 1/3 of a cup of vodka that again has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours and then I'm going to pour it into my jar weed that I had already filtered once now again if you're using different proportions just use enough to just cover the weed you can just pour it straight into the jar I'm just using the funnel so I can try and get some of that weed that's stuck to it the first time now once again I'm going to shake that jar aggressively for five minutes now using that same jar and same filter that I'd use the first time I am going to pour in the mixture that we had just shaken into the jar that we first used [Music] now this step is optional but I'm going to pour in a little bit of that very cold flash-frozen vodka to get the remnants out of my jar again you don't have to do this but I don't want to waste anything so every little scrap I can get I'm gonna take now once again we're going to let that filter through and it is going to take a long time just like the first round did [Music] once that's all dripped through we're going to place a clean funnel into a clean measuring cup or mason jar as well as a new clean coffee filter and we are not going to poke any holes now we're going to pour it in and we're going to wait for this to drip through this step is not necessary but I like mine very clear so I like to filter out any imperfections if you like you can do this step twice but it does take a long time so I only do it once and I find that the one time is sufficient to get it very pure and clean I'm also going to take the filter with the weed that has been filtered already and press it out as much as I can of course make sure you're wearing a rubber glove so that your skin is not absorbing at all yeah and just try and squish oh as much as you can and then that little bit of leftover that is on the parchment paper there I mean if you're just using this for yourself you could just lick it up I don't know if you don't want to waste it anything works yeah so just squeeze out as much as you possibly can it's been about a half an hour and almost everything has filtered through and we have a total of about a little bit under a cup of liquid because some of that vodka is lost in the extraction process [Music] now we need to reduce our tincture to a smaller amount and we're going to use that by using a double boiler thing which I don't have so I'm making my own version and I'm just using my instant pot so that I can do it in the living room where I have better lighting so I am wrapping some tinfoil around it so I can contain the heat as much as possible and I'm just going to put my measuring cup on to the side of it and then wrap the tinfoil kind of around it that way not too much water and heat is evaporating all you want to make sure is that your bottom of your mason jar or your measuring cup like I'm using is not touching the water so same concept as a double boiler so I both to put it in there but I just have to show off how beautiful it looks it's so clear so golden absolutely beautiful I hope you guys appreciate how wonderful it looks because a lot of my friends and family don't really feel the same way as I do so I just love being able to share this stuff with you guys online please make sure you do this any well-ventilated area so I have all windows and doors in my house opened as well as if your dreams on the stove have your hood fan on there is no smell at all so unfortunately my instant pot broke part way through I don't know what happened so I moved it to the kitchen and I made this sort of contraption thing because I could not put the measuring cup on the edge of the pot because I don't have anything deep enough where the bottom of the measuring cup wouldn't touch the water so I just put a metal strainer on top and then created some insulation with the tin foil kind of like how I did it the instant pot so while you're watching it when it's bubbling a lot like this that's a little bit too much so turn your heat down a little bit you do want a little bit of movement but not that aggressively now I reduced it down to one third of a cup and that took me about an hour and a half I believe you can reduce it more or reduce it less it just depends on how strong you want it to be now it's ready to pour into a jar to save you can use this with a dropper or you can put into your gummies or into your drinks there's so many different ways to use it hopefully you guys will check out some of my gummy videos and try it out in one of those recipes and here's the finished product which is absolutely beautiful thank you so much for watching with the measuring cup I didn't want to waste any possible tincture so I heard some iced coffee into there and now I'm drinking that so that's a good way to make sure you're not wasting anything if you guys enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe and please let me know if there's any videos you would like to see me record because I would be happy to do that thank you guys so much for watching have a great day [Music]", "AVOk7obYja4": "thank you for tuning in to a moment is in presented by Gibbs n I'm Kyle here today to talk about the high THC capsule the high THC capsules manufactured using full-spectrum cannabis oil it's also known as fille co RSO or Rick Simpson oil so for those people looking for Rick Simpson oil if the high THC is that capsule if the relaxed n is my two glasses of wine the high THC is like three shots the 25 milligrams of THC is a therapeutic dose for treating chronic pain management autoimmune disorders and we've had a lot of success with HIV and cancer patients as well this capsule definitely comes with the buzz and the munchies and that being said is our number one adult use of recreational capsule but it also has a lot of therapeutic medicinal value as well Rick Simpson was a pioneer in the industry and his work teaching people how to extract cannabis oil from the marijuana plant was instrumental and you know it can't be understated how valuable he has been contributing to the legalization of marijuana that being said he was using some pretty gnarly solvents and I'd like to thank him for lighting the torch but I think we can take it from here kids n uses ethanol as a solvent for extracting the cannabis oil from the plant we find that ethanol pulls the most complete cannabinoid profile and terpene profile from the plant co2 and butane do a great job of capturing THC CBD and terpenes but there's a lot more to the plant than just those two compounds most of our oil is 65% THC and the other 35% is really where the magic happens THC and CBD are where most of the dosing is based on in this industry but all the other compounds play an important role to the true magic and power of the cannabis plant based medicine you can also get more information at Gibbs NC a calm thanks for tuning in [Music]", "fFI-Eqp5qck": "hey guys nurse colleen here i'm gonna make some suppositories you guys ready for this they are so medicinal so potent they're actually ten times more potent than uh taking something orally and not psychoactive so you get all that medicine without the psychoactive effects and they're very hard to find they can't find them in any dispensers so i'm making my own so we got some cocoa butter and you want to use cocoa butter instead of coconut oil because coconut oil melts at a lower temperature coconut butter will stay solid at a higher temperature cocoa butter so we're melting the cocoa butter and we have some butter and i just got it on amazon and then we have the um rso pico pool can't extract full extract cannabis oil and i'm gonna let the cocoa butter melt a little bit and then when it's almost done i'm going to put the rso in [Music] i'm using a double boiler method here so the pan has water in it and the water is boiling and heating up the cocoa butter in here there's no coco there's no water in the cocoa butter it's all cocoa butter melted so now i'm going to add the rso whole extract cannabis oil i actually have endometriosis so i'm going to use these pod stories for me to get major cramps so i'm going to use this depository like a tampon and use it for that you can use them for menstrual cramps back pain different cancers if someone has nausea vomiting can't take anything orally this is a good way to get the medicine in all right now i'm going to install the uh little molds i have some little molds here they actually have suppository molds that you can purchase but this is from magical butter for edibles but i'm going to use it for repositories it's a nice little shape but you could use a straw if you don't have mold and just use like some medical tape or you can melt the end of it and then fill it and then just cut it about an inch all right so we're gonna fill this and then i'm gonna use the extra as like a top of the lotion [Music] little bars down here make nice little um like topical bars so i'm gonna let them cool and then i'm going to put them in the freezer and they can stay in the freezer for up to six months [Music] okay we're ready the suppositories are done you're ready uh total it was about 730 milligrams of rso and we used about two thirds of the mixture so these have about 486 milligrams 90 there so total is about five to six milligrams each us start low go slow you could easily melt these again and add more rso if it's not enough um i'm gonna use them for endometriosis and menstrual cramps you can use it uh rectally as well [Music] it's best to store it in the fridge or freezer and it can be stored up to six months but you could it's starting to kind of melt a little bit um you could make them in a thinner straw and cut the straw into little sections if you prefer they also have suppository molds that's how you make suppositories and for more information follow ask nurse colleen", "uz4hfUiGDY8": "[Music] hey it's mad at roughout studios now welcome to cannabase ecstatic oak shatter tabs and wax today we're going to look at several ways to smoke shatter wax and rosin along with the pros and cons of dab rigs and nails dab pins vaporizers emails and nectar collectors you can find all these products and more at the wizard puff com online head shop and you can save money with the code roughhouse I'd like to thank wizard puffs for sponsoring this video perhaps the og of ways to do dabs is the trusty dab or oil rig fitted with the titanium nail or quartz banger and is truly one of the most effective ways to do a dab you'll get a huge hit instantly and usually get the most out of your wax - as it's fully vaporized in seconds dab rigs might be one of the most effective ways of doing dabs but there are drawbacks such as needing a torch and gas to heat the nails and also a recovery time to reheat it now for the next tab also when you introduce open flame and exposed high heat into the process you also sacrifice safety to some degree dad pens on the other hand are probably one of the safest ways to do dabs these types of pens usually use quartz ceramic or metal coils to heat the wax enclosed inside of a sealed glass or metal cap these types of pens can be effective and give big hits but usually will take several puffs to smoke the same amount of wax as doing a single dab off of a nail another common drawbacks to wax pans is that the unvailed wax builds up and they require constant cleaning to keep functioning properly some vaporizers that are made for dry herb can also be used to vaporize wax to these devices usually provide a cup or pod that inserts into the dry herb heating chamber to vaporize the wax these types of devices can be very convenient but the cons are that they often do a mediocre job of vaporizing wax as they lack the heat that's required and the small pods can be cumbersome and leaky so it can be hard to keep the heating chamber clean for dry herb nectar collectors or vacuum systems could be considered the Dark Horse of DAB methods these types of devices use a heated tip on the end of a handheld device that you dip directly into the wax there are both electric collectors as well as those requiring external heat sources such as a torch one big advantage of the collector type rig is that you can get huge hits when you're dipping the tip directly into the wax but they can have a bit of a learning curve and a little bit awkward to use perhaps the biggest favourite among divers is the email emails are very similar to the standard titanium nail on an oil rig with one key difference the emails have an electronic control center to set a precise temperature and a heating element that will keep the nail continuously heated and ready for a dab the pros of emails are that it's ready for a DAB any time that it's on and you can set to precise temperatures and you also you can do back-to-back dabs without having to reheat the nail they may also arguably be safer than using open flames and are clearly more convenient than needing a secondary heating torch cons are that they usually require a power source to operate so it may not be as portable as the other methods and it's also very convenient to use so you might find yourself smoking through your wax very quickly and passing out on the couch very early whichever method you choose dabbing wax or rosin so long as it's free of impurities is actually healthier than smoking cannabis flowers by not smoking or vaporizing the plant materials you are clearly putting less unnecessary chemicals into your body and by taking concentrated doses you're required to smoke less frequently not to mention that the time it takes to do it to have is far quicker than the time it takes to smoke a joint bulb or especially a blunt but if you're an everyday diver like myself a nice email setup likely be the way to go but if you only occasionally dabber prefer to vaporize then a three-in-one vape pen that does wax too might be satisfactory or any or an inexpensive wax pen might be even better or perfect for the beginner just looking to dabble in wax shatters and rosin concentrates again I'd like to thank the guys at wizard puff for sponsoring this video you can save money on a lots of the products that you saw in this video with a code roughhouse and wizard puff comm I hope you enjoyed this video on how to smoke shatter

you how to make homemade wheat chocolates that's right folks it's time that we bring leads to the forefront people I mean it's legal basically everywhere except for I love and I recently came into possession of a large quantity of marijuana so when that happens my favorite thing to do is make cannabutter 500 milligrams of THC right here folks making chocolate at home doesn't appear to be that difficult it's basically just a cacao or cocoa powder a sweetener butter and whatever else you feel like adding in this case we're gonna use some hemp arts you can make it in between like plastic bags so that's like a bark or even better you have ice cube trays or like these silicone molds silicone molds that was weird so I'm gonna put some in here and then I also have these awesome weed ice cube tray molds my boyfriend actually got them from his office as a Christmas party because they all think that he's like this huge pothead meanwhile the kid hardly ever smokes weed he just looks stoned half the time so if any of you are watching this I'm calling you out and you do not smoke pot you are not some pothead that everyone thinks you are and the only person that is using these is me I'm concerned slightly that they're brave when they pop out so we'll see what happens I'm gonna do a few in here and a few in here I'm also going to use this maple syrup which is from New Hampshire keeping it local I'm gonna use some vanilla extract with Jam and I just got a Mexico if you haven't seen those vlogs to check them out so this is local to Mexico and I'm gonna use this wheat butter that I made and the weed my frame grew and its local to Western man so sourcing maybe we are sourcing local we're sourcing regional or keeping them heavy in this kitchen the first thing we're gonna do 1/2 cup of coconut oil which is okay and next we're gonna add in 1/2 cup of cacao now with this recipe I'm gonna try to make 10 chocolates with it so I did have to do a bit of crazy calculations but each serving is gonna be about 50 milligrams of THC so this is not for beginners of edibles but I'm no beginner you know the reason I'm mixing everything in this mason jar making a [ __ ] mess already it's because I'm gonna use this immersion blender so we don't have lumps I thought mason jar be the easiest way of course they always thank you underestimated what a slob I am and now I'm annoyed [ __ ] [ __ ] my hair now [ __ ] is this how do people make like measuring stuff looks so easy I always make a mess they just pour out the powder into the half cup and just [ __ ] pours right now but when I do it the whole house needs to be cleaned we are coconut labor cacao now we need our half teaspoon of vanilla I'm really excited to use this stuff it's supposed to be very high quality I had to check my bag to bring him home and everything smells mmm smells like sunblock and vacation 1/2 teaspoon oh we're gonna need three tablespoons of maple syrup it's so good I guess that's it so now we blend much easier than whisking that's for damn sure they're never gonna get all this [ __ ] off the sides because I'm on every last drop hmm how I shouldn't be doing this probably gonna get pretty high by the way I cancelled my dentist appointment this morning I'm not like a counselor of things but we got snow last night it was for two fillings but like they're very small cavities and that's totally not an emergency and I really didn't like spending $200 so you know what I cancelled I felt guilty about it but then as soon as I did it I was like that was the best decision I made hopefully don't charge me okay so now comes the interesting part we want to weigh these out evilly because I want each chocolate to be the same amount of THC so I'm gonna use this 1/2 tablespoon and I'm gonna try to make 10 of these okay we're gonna do a few in the weed chocolate mole because I just think that will look really cool but it might prove to be too difficult and you might have to give it up let's see how it goes in here oh yeah much better - you're gonna add a little bit to each once they're all the same size so now I just want to get you know my place this is gonna be to hide right here well use my hands like I'm getting aggressive right now I'm definitely going after this one mmm just gotta get in there verified me I'm gonna get stoned first thing morning so I also have these hemp parts which you know hemp is also derived from the cannabis plant how'd you get these from Canada because as you know it's still illegal here no plant that like basically does everything let's make it illegal so I'm gonna sprinkle some of these into some of my chocolate just to add like a fun crunch a little bit not every single one but and it just uses chopstick to cut us the world I have into the chocolate a little bit yeah if these come out well the next ones I make I'll probably add like walnuts or something all right so all that's left is putting these in the fridge or the freezer and they're supposed to harden within an hour the next time you see them though it'll be like when I'm going to eat them for the night so I'm gonna keep them in there all during the day I have to do work now let's start my day so we'll see you guys later when it's time to test these bad boys out okay guys it is hours later the day has passed I have popped the chocolates out of the molds as predicted Lee we the mold it was mostly for aesthetic purposes because it really didn't pop out that well my definitely won't do it like that again but it froze them and this is what this one looks like it's very cute you know this is like very gimmicky but in reality in terms of like consistency and uniformity the silicone circular molds were the move anyway I just ate one of these scouts honor scared what is this scout the scouts honor I just ate one of these it's the Shocker oh I just any one of these Dan can attest to it I'm not gonna eat another one because that will be a hundred milligrams of THC and that's something that we're gonna save for another day by another day I mean tomorrow I'm gonna store these in the freezer I think they'll heat for like at least a month they won't be around that long but I love it I'm so proud of myself what an easy way to make weed chocolates at home and a lot more affordable than buying them at the stores now you can buy them in the stores here anyway you have to be on your deathbed one of these days anyway thank you for watching this episode of add anything show and I will see you next time goodbye Nana you don't want these okay if you had like pointing up but I can't see anything [ __ ] meatball go [ __ ] yourself okay guys", "oXgmtyoYP0k": "tell us about your experience so far and what products you were using so my name's Jeremy Loski and I was recently at the cure dispensary in Lancaster Pennsylvania I recently purchased the Rick Simpson oil which is a one-to-one uh oil which in the syringe I bought from my daughter Cora who has autism spectrum disorder she was diagnosed several years ago and we were looking forward for something to help with her behavior maybe something that could help with her ability to just help to help just maintain her daily life so after three days we've seen dramatic results Cora only averages one meltdown a day which is down from 12 to 15 she hurt her she stims a lot less for stimming is down for about 80 to 90 percent during the day we also have seen her answer yes or no questions on on a consistent basis which is a huge step in her progress I consider myself really lucky to have the opportunity to have this product here in Pennsylvania I know it's we're one of the first if not the first parents of kids with autism who are trying this out and looking to see what we can accomplish through through the use of medical marijuana I'd like to extend my gratitude to the people that cure to governor wolf everybody involved that the experience was great it could have not went well the staff was courteous the pharmacist on-site were very knowledgeable they were they're very understanding of my situation and how delicate is with the young child and I am grateful thank you you",

home so we've got the what ifs moon rocks moon rocks on and I get some we've usually hand-selected covered in oil and if Keef so here I have a beautiful example of moving off and you'll see those in the pictures as well and I'll show you the inside of it so when we cut into it we could see the inside is our bud covered in a layer of oil and then dusted whisky mmm this smells wonderful this also had some terpenes added to it to make it smell like green apples so you can do that as well to your oil so of course where do we get all the Keef well if you have a large bust edge such as this you could get Keef collected in the bottom of it quite a bit of team that comes off of it as you can see on the tray and this key is the same teeth that you could use to dust you our butts with as well so before we go to the kitchen to show you the process we will show you the hand selection of nuts that we want to eat so guys that our next step is nugget selection so we have different kinds here on our tray some moonbeams some of the rest by Cove some be hazed and some Keats so here you definitely do not want to use anything long like this even though it's a nice snug you know we don't want to use it for our moon rock application what you're looking for is dance heart none something like this would could work if we take out the bottom so if we sniff that piece off this top piece could be a perfect little moon or nothing same with this this is a perfect example of what we want to use again something big like this not recommended unless you're going to take off the bottom and just use the top piece and of course in your bags you're gonna have lots of best stuff and this is perfect to use for your oil and anything you don't want to use if you have if you have no other way of producing our oil you don't have your homegrown your best bet is to research some methods of making oil or find somebody who knows how to do it because not we're not going to come we're not going to recommend you using highly flammable substances to make it concentrates of this woman but if you're if you have oil and you have found your terpenes that you'd like to use the next step is in the kitchen so come on by and see what we got brewing [Music] [Music] [Music] is a double boiler with some oil and our brush that we're gonna use and when they weaken the code these guys with it so these guys are prepared little nuggets that we hand chosen and then we use toothpicks in order to hold them up once once we coated them to keep them dry so let's see how we do that [Music] [Music] so we have tried many different brushes before this one and none of them successfully worked or was really hard to clean so this so far we found to be the perfect brush for doing the job and getting clean afterwards of course you don't want to mix your if you're using different terpene flavors to make them you don't want to mix your brushes because the flavors will get right into your product and will mix and with undesired results so here we have perfectly coated nut ready to be dried and then we're gonna show you the next step [Music] would give my all to get to you if there's a chance what can I that's what can I do you can make it you can make it happen would give my all to get to you if there's a chance [Music] [Music] [Music] would give my all to get to you if there's a chance what can I do you can make it you can make it up would give my all to get to you if there's a chance [Music]", "KQUSoIJkaWg": "thank you thank you very much and well I'm gonna use my 15 minutes wisely I'm gonna skip the CV part and I'm gonna go straight to the data I am gonna present the most recent research we have done in the lab on the anti-tumor effects of cannabinoids and we have been doing this for 20 years already and it's pretty clear to us not only for the research that we have done in our lab but from the research that other groups all over the world have been doing during this time that Cannavino it haven't eaten more properties and they can produce this effect by targeting different stages of the disease they can sorry they can kill cancer cells as it was mentioned before they can also block the feeding of the new to Merle masses a process that we call angiogenesis and they can also block the generation of metastases but the truth is that the vast majority of these studies have been conducted with pure cannabinoids not because we think this is the best therapeutic approach but because we wanted to understand what was going on inside the cancer cells to understand how can have you know it's work so it is pretty obvious also and I don't think I have to give you an extra explanation today that the cannabis plant is a very complex and sophisticated Factory and it produces not only THC and CBD but a lot of other cannabinoids and a lot of other chemical compounds that have a very interesting therapeutic potential for example among the cannabinoids there are more than 140 different entities and some of them have very interesting potential therapeutic applications some have sorry some have anti poor effective actions in cancer cells groans groaning cultures and the key issue here is that most of them have not been studied yeah and the same thing happens with terpenes we know that some of them have interesting therapeutic applications and I highly recommend you to read the work that Ethan Russo has published in these regards and again most of these compounds and we are talking about more than 100 compounds weighing more than 100 compounds have not been studied and studied yet and as did he mention before when we talk about cannabis and about other plants but can I was in particular we have to keep in mind what we call in pharmacology the synergistic effect or what we call in this auditorium the entourage effect which means that one plus one is way more than two so with all these things in mind the question we try to address in this specific project was if it was a better therapeutic approach to use pure cannabinoids THC CBD or whole plant preparations and to answer this question we established a collaboration with this company here self therapeutics based in Australia and we aimed at comparing the anti-tumor effect of pure THC provided by THC farm with that of a THC rich extract provided by Unseld and non-profit mutual benefit corporation based in California so we have the analysis of a number of cannabinoids not all of them but a number of cannabinoids in the preparation a number of turbines in the preparation and because we wanted to be sure that we were comparing the same amount of THC in here and in here we did not one lab test but three in different facilities one in in the United States and two in Spain and to corroborate this information this data so we did this experiments in different models of breast cancer and my group is working on breast cancer now and regarding this pathology we use the same term breast cancer to define pathologies that have nothing to do we one to each other in terms of molecular markers markers treatments prognosis etc so when doctors have to choose a specific treatment for a breast cancer patient they check for specific markers and depending on these markers they sub classify breast cancer in three subtypes the first one is it's called hormone sensitive because these cancer cells Express estrogen receptors or progesterone receptors and since the stroke genic signaling is exacerbated the aim of these therapies is to shut down this signaling and we can do that by different approaches we can remove the endogenous source of estrogens by removing the ovaries or we can use drugs to interfere with this signaling and one of them for example is I'm sure you have heard about it is tamoxifen the second type of breast tumors is called her2 positive because these cancer cells express abnormally high levels of this protein called Hertz what do the doctors recommend to these patients well drugs that specifically target this protein this head to receptor trastuzumab petaluma the names are irrelevant at this point and there is a third entity which is called triple negative and the name is self-explanatory it's called triple negative because these cancer cells do not express estrogen receptors or progesterone receptors or head to receptors and unfortunately this is the most aggressive phenotype and unfortunately since there are no specific markers there are no specific drugs that we can use for these patients and they have to receive a standard chemotherapy that you will know that is extremely aggressive well we tried to answer the question I mentioned before in the different subtypes of breast cancer and we started with the hormone sensitive and what we did was to grow these cancer cells a cell line that is called t47 d in in this petri dishes that did I showed you and we challenged these cells with increasing concentrations of THC THC that came either from THC farm in other words pure THC or from the botanical drug extract from the whole plant extract and as you can see and here what we represent is cell viability is the percentage of cells that remain alive in the cell cultures and as you can see as we increase the HC concentration these dots go down in other words we are killing the cancer cells and as you can also see very easily in this graph the tea the pure THC produces this antitumoral action but the extract is more potent than the pure cannabinoid in order to see if this was an effect that was exclusive exclusive exclusively produced in this cell line or it was more general and a hormone sensitive breast cancer cells in general we performed the second in the same experiment in a second hormone sensitive breast cancer cell line mcf7 and the effect was exactly the same both pooty-poo THC and the extract decreased the viability of these cancer cells and again the extract was more potent than the pure compound we then moved to the second subtype of breast cancer her2 positive and perform exactly the same experiments and the response was exactly the same both THC and the extract decreased the viability of these cancer cells in culture and again the extract the purple line was more potent in doing that than the pure cannabinoid and finally we did these experiments in the triple negative breast cancer cells and I want to remind you that this is a very aggressive subtype of breast cancer with no targeted therapies yet and we observed that these cancer cells are also sensitive to cannabinoid treatment both the buccal in green and the extract in purple decreased the viability of the two cell lines of this subtype that we studied and again the botanical drug extract was more potent than the pure compound so from this part that take-home message is that all breast cancer subtypes are sensitive to cannabinoid antiproliferative action and that the extract is more potent than the pure compound so we next tried to do something similar to what it is doing we try to combine pure THC with the most prominent most abundant terpenes in the extract just to see if we could recreate the effect of the whole plant extract whole plant preparation by combining THC which a bunch of other compounds and we did that in the three subtypes of breast cancer and I'm gonna guide you through the graphs we represent here against cell viability in percentage so this is the amount of cells that we mean alive again in the in the dishes and we want this Bart bars to go as down as possible and in the white bars you have the control cells that says that the cells that do not receive any kind of treatment and in this line bar what you see is the effect that the terpenes only the five tapings produce on cell viability which is none just using the five connector pins you do not decrease the viability you do not kill the cancer cells what happens if we combine THC with it with this terpene cocktail well the effect is this one and if you compare this bar with this one which is the effect that the THC alone produces it's very easy to see that combining THC with a called trapping cocktail does not increase the anti-cancer effect of a pure compound we obtain exactly the same effects in the other two subtypes this is the effect of the terpenes alone in these social lines this is the effect of THC in the her2 positive this is the effect of the THC in the triple negative and when we add the terpenes to the THC we cannot improve the anti-tumor effect of the ATS so combination of THC with these five specific terpenes do not does not recreate the effect of the potency of THC so what about in vivo effect because a lot of things work in vitro and we can draw some conclusions for from in vitro studies but we if we really want to sell an anti-tumor tool we have to prove that it works in more physiological settings so what happens if we reproduce these effects in animal models of cancer and what happens if we combine this Cannavino it with the standard therapies that these patients receive well to answer this question we conducted a series of experiments in animal models of the three different subtypes of cancer and we studied with a hormone sensitive ones and first of all we started with in vitro studies to see to analyze the combination of tamoxifen this is the drug we used for this studies so we studied what happened when combining tamoxifen and cannabinoids in vitro and as you can see here this is the effect that the moxa fen alone produces this is the effect that THC alone produces this is a very low concentration of THC and when we combine THC and tamoxifen we see a synergistic response and exactly the same thing happens when we use not pure THC but the botanical drug preparation what happens if we move to the in vivo we will observe the same thing well in this case what we represent is tumor volume the size of the tumors versus time and this white dots represent how these tumors grow when the animals receive no treatment so the tumor masses grow grow with no control this is the Green Line is the effect that THC alone produces and the purple line again is the effect that the botanical drug preparation produces and I think it's pretty obvious to see that is more potent than the pure compound and not only that but if we compare the effect of the botanical preparation with that of tamoxifen which is the current treatment that patients with this type of tumors receive you can see that the potency is exactly the same one we also combine a tamoxifen with the botanical drug preparation and we didn't see a big increase in the antitumoral properties of c of the preparation we perform similar experiments in her to positive models of breast cancer and in this case we selected lapatinib one of the drugs that target specifically target this receptor and we obtained very very similar results in vitro when combined in lapatinib this drug with pure THC we observed sign artistic responses something very similar with the botanical drug preparation and exactly the same as we observed before in the in vivo setting the white line again is the control animals if we treat the animals with pure THC we get modest antitumoral response but if we use the whole pram plant preparation the anti-tumor effect is much much higher much bigger and if we compare the antitumoral potency of the whole plant extract with that of lapatinib again we see that we have a tool that is as potent as the current medicine that these patients received and what about the triple negative and I remind you again the most aggressive type of breast cancer that a woman can have well we observed exactly the same thing when we combined in this case we used chemotherapy agent cisplatin and this is the effect that cisplatin produce alone this is the effect that THC produces and when we move to the in vivo again this is THC this is the botanical drug preparation and as you can see it's more potent than in the pure compound remain asleep the rest of the lines because I don't have time and the take-home message from this part is that the THC rich extract is more potent than pure THC both in vitro and in vivo the THC rich extract is as potent as the standard therapies that we tested that are the standard treatments that these patients are receiving and unfortunately the combination of cannabinoids with the tested and the cancer treatments didn't improve the potency of either one of them I don't have time to discuss discuss why we think this is going on but that's what we observed and as a conclusion we have more than enough evidence that cannabinoids are effective 22 more tools in preclinical models of cancer all breast cancer subtypes respond to cannabinoids whole plant preparations are more potent than pure cannabinoids and whole plant extracts are as potent as current therapies I don't want you to go home with a conclusion that the extract we used in this paper is the extract you have to give to your patients the only point we wanted to make is that it's better to use whole plant preparations than pure compounds and I want to finish by thanking the people that did the work I'm just here presenting it but these are the guys that did it and here there is my small team and I want to thank of course the team of Unseld s that was absolutely necessary for the performance of these experiments thank you very much you have time for one question if you like what one minute left Christina very nice there were small amounts of Canaveral and tetrahydrocannabinol a gas 'add have you had the chance to test those to see if they were the ones that made the difference yeah that's an excellent question yeah I didn't point it to in in this light but the extract had a little bit of juicy VG and a little bit of another cannabinoid THC a and we did check if CBG combining THC and CBD we could reproduce the effects and we were not able to we haven't done the experiments with THC a but that's something we want to do a first very good question thing", "75kavv_ka4o": "hey everyone and welcome to hemp in a pan today we'll be showing you how to make a simple CBD oil infused butter using an easy to do stovetop slow cook method there are multiple ways to make CBD oil but today we'll be going with one of the easiest methods which is simmering butter inhale over low heat which extracts the trichomes cannabinoids and CBD from the hemp it combines it with the butter making a rich CBD oil infused butter to make CBD oil infuse butter you'll only need three ingredients butter decarboxylated hemp and water or how to decarboxylate how to first convert the CVP a into CBD check out our decarboxylation guide first now you'll wanna use 1/4 of an ounce of hemp buds and trimmings for each stick of butter which is also half a cup of butter and of course the higher quality of trimming the buds you use the more CVP there will be in the butter now before adding the ingredients you'll want to first add some water to the pot the whole purpose of the water is to buffer the butter and health so that it doesn't touch the bottom of the stove and burn since the butter is less dense than water and will flow and no matter how much water you add it's pretty easy to separate from the butter after you're done I use two cups of water for this to give it a good buffer and if you're using a larger pot you can go up to 3 to 4 cups of water I'm now melting the butter in the pot of water throwing in the decarboxylated hemp and then once everything came to a boil I kept the heat on low so that it's barely simmering now you can leave this and check back on it periodically to make sure nothing has changed and if the water is burning off too fast you can always just add more water to the pot you'll want this to simmer for at least an hour and ideally up to five hours to make sure that all the cannabinoids have infused into the butter and for this I went with five hours and added another cup of water halfway through the process [Music] now you want to strain the entire pot through a strainer or a cheesecloth or in my case I didn't have either on hand so I used a new clean t-shirt if you're going with the t-shirt I have to warn you that doing this will ruin the shirt and make sure the shirts clean without any lint or detergent that could get into your infuse butter I waited until a mixture cooled slightly and then poured everything through it was still pretty hot so it took me a while to get every last drop but it was well worth it you can see here that after 10 minutes the CBD oil infused butter is already completely separated from the water if you want to use it right away you can use a baster to remove the water from the bottom otherwise just cover it up throw in the fridge overnight and the next day when the butter has hardened you can easily drain out the water how'd it dry and then store for future use to make all types of edibles or you can even put it into little capsules to make CPP pills [Music] and that's it", "6u5dvg6EbzU": "[ __ ] working all right yo what's up guys uh today we're gonna make some [ __ ] rso and if you don't know what rso is it's uh rick simpson oil and uh yeah that's the [ __ ] they used to uh supposed to cure cancer and [ __ ] that's what the rick simpson the guy that originated it and what it's named after claims and a lot of other people claim to and uh basically what it is is extracting the [ __ ] out of the plant and by playing i mean marijuana and uh i don't know what makes it like some [ __ ] it looks like resin really if you've seen rso it looks like resin but yeah like it's supposed to cure cancer and that's really that's really all there is to [ __ ] say here's supposed to cure and uh my grandma's been having some issues and [ __ ] so uh she wanted to try it so i told her i'd make her some and i made her some yesterday that it turned out pretty good but i figured i'd make some more today and just really hook her up you know so she doesn't have to be going like dispensaries and [ __ ] and buying that [ __ ] yeah they come from a time where uh weed was basically like heroin or that's what they were told so it's pretty crazy that she's even willing to try it so i was like [ __ ] it yeah i'll make some and i figured why the [ __ ] not just make a video in case anyone else wants to make some but uh what you're going to want to be doing i'm using bud straight up bud because like i'm trying to make [ __ ] cancer killer you know what i'm saying and this was some but it was just it was subpar i didn't like it but uh you're going to want to grind your [ __ ] up as much as you [ __ ] can like some i've seen people they use the ninja choppers and [ __ ] this is all i'm doing right now just squeezing these [ __ ] buds i'm gonna fill this whole jar now you can use trim you can use whatever you want really as long as it's got thc and [ __ ] like this is some this is some [ __ ] you can see it's looking like ass well i think this is some [ __ ] from last year honestly i just found it i got a bag of trim here i think it's from last year too just a little bit i'll probably run this [ __ ] too like i said yeah i did a run yesterday of this bud and if you watch my outdoor grow this is that uh that extra northern lights plant [ __ ] seed random seed just fell from the year before i just let it grow i grew with no newts or nothing so that's why it's ass but i just might want to see what happened you know never growing a plant just [ __ ] soil in the ground and seeing how it turned out it was a pretty big plant but yeah you need nudes but uh honestly you guys probably want to sit and watch me uh crunch weed up so uh i'll get back to you guys with the next part all right guys i got some jars filled with uh some products and uh now the next step you need to get something that's kind of hard to [ __ ] find in these days and ages isopropyl alcohol now this is 99.9 good luck finding this but uh i ordered online and you can use everclear [ __ ] like that you just need some [ __ ] some strong alcohol you know what i mean and uh yeah if you can't find 99.9 just find the strongest [ __ ] you can strongest [ __ ] you can but a lot of people say everclear is better you know because it's already ready for human consumption but we're gonna be cooking the [ __ ] off anyway damn i should bring you guys down here probably to see the poor sorry i'm blocking damn what's the best way to [ __ ] film this all right hold up let me uh let me make a change here all right all right all right that's better i had front facing camera [ __ ] it wasn't gonna work but uh all right i'm gonna show you guys how much you want with this alcohol so pay close attention or slow see the liquid building up at the bottom call it good now and maybe a little more right about when it gets to the top of your bud is when i'd stop maybe just a little over but you don't want to be wasting this [ __ ] and uh i think that should be good we're gonna seal her up and uh make sure she's sealed because you don't wanna be getting this [ __ ] everywhere shake it as good as you can i didn't leave much room left in this one you really don't got to shake it if you don't want to the alcohol is going to strip it regardless but i'd let that sit [ __ ] man must not have been sealed very good it's got [ __ ] all over me son of a [ __ ] but uh anyway you try and leave that part out but uh you let this [ __ ] sit let's say about an hour and uh yeah then we get to the next step which i'll have for you in about an hour so yeah i'll be back all right guys i'm back and i got a shitty camera angle here but what the [ __ ] you want me to do it's all i could do but uh anyway got a pyrex bull here and we've been letting that [ __ ] sit for an hour i went up to the store and [ __ ] and and i do a bunch of [ __ ] and anyway i'm getting started later than i wanted so i might kind of you know try to go fast through this [ __ ] as best i can but anyway you're gonna need glass pyrex bowl here all right and ideally you're going to want some cheese cloth for this to put over the bowl to uh filter your [ __ ] throughs you're not getting buttons [ __ ] in but uh i've got no cheesecloth so i used some redneck ingenuity and i got a [ __ ] pillow case and i secured it on there with a headband and uh i doubled it up i doubled up the pillowcase and uh i used it yesterday and i didn't see any [ __ ] butt or nothing in the [ __ ] so if you don't got cheesecloth use pillowcase like me rag whatever just make sure it fits on your bowl try and double it up and uh hold up real quick i'm about to pour like i said this is like the best cam ring like come up with fast give that one last shake and uh yeah there ain't nothing special man you just you let this [ __ ] sit in the alcohol you just pour it see some seeds pour it on in there let it [ __ ] sift through pillowcase actually works pretty good man ain't gonna lie oh [ __ ] but i wouldn't uh i wouldn't use pillowcase off your bed i would definitely use a spare one but i'll show you guys this oh covering up the camera sorry i gotta switch uh see that [ __ ] slowly draining through you see all the [ __ ] left behind see seed there really not that many seeds though seed there and yeah see we still got a bunch of [ __ ] in here but ain't gonna go to waste just wanna let all this good liquid get in there all right i think that soaked in about as good as can you get i don't know if i should i'm just gonna do the same i did yesterday put all this [ __ ] right the [ __ ] in there get all your [ __ ] off the jar best you can and uh you want to take whatever you secured i would recommend securing this to the bowl i guess you don't have to but considering you secured it to the bowl you're going to take that off [ __ ] try your best not to get this [ __ ] spilled you don't want weed flakes in your rso i should have another glove on but i don't know what i did with it but you're gonna last [ __ ] it you basically just want to squeeze this get all you can out of there oh dropping weed in there i can see it already i've fallen off this glove but yeah this is basically what you do until it stops flowing yeah this could take you you'll probably depends really how long you want to wait but probably like 10-15 minutes you could probably let it sit if you really just wanted to let it drip but uh yeah so i think you guys pretty much got the idea so i'm gonna come back to you you know it's time for the next step but i'm gonna let this drip and i got a few other jars i'm gonna run real quick and uh yeah i'll be back all right guys here we are man we got the next spark here and uh yeah for this you're gonna need a hot plate well ventilated area see i got this [ __ ] here got a little bit of weed hanging actually but uh what you're gonna want to do uh get your hot plate i got a little setting right now and i'm pouring some water in the [ __ ] so yeah you're gonna need some water and i'm just gonna put this whole picture in there and uh now what you're gonna do is you take your uh concoction you see i got it here and put it in there and i'm gonna put this aside cuz i got this jar and i've actually never done this in a jar and i really hope it doesn't break so if it does then i look like a dumbass but yes we get a little live experiment here actually today and yeah so honestly you'd like to have a little more water probably for the one in the jar i don't know how well it's gonna work but you know sometimes [ __ ] it but uh yeah i'm gonna go run grab that other jar and see if it fits but yeah basically for right now that's all you got to do you just want to make sure it's ventilated and got my mixer here you can see on the mixer that's what you want to end up with right there or something like that that's from yesterday but uh basically yeah we're rocking and rolling and it's about three o'clock and i kind of wish i would have got this started like this part of it started earlier but uh took a little longer than i wanted to in town and hopefully it's not [ __ ] too dark you know a lot of times the donald trump still show you guys out here because it's probably gonna be dark but uh yeah basically that's all you do for right now so i'll be back in a while probably take about two three about maybe four hours who knows but i'll be here and i'll show you yo what up guys it's been like [ __ ] probably a little under an hour and uh yeah give you a little see fumes cooking off and man it reeks like [ __ ] alcohol so yeah you can see the smoke flying out i'm sure but uh yeah that's why you want to use a ventilated area it's cold as [ __ ] too so that probably adds to it but you can kind of see well this bowl was a little dirty head tomorrow so in it but you can kind of see the line where it pointing out for you started about right here it's cooked off that far the jars is kind of hard to tell i don't know i don't know if the jars are cooking off is good because the water level is not you know yeah but uh [ __ ] it we'll figure it out but uh yeah it is working so we'll give it some more time and check back later yo guys what's up so it's been about three hours since you started cooking this [ __ ] and the [ __ ] that was in this pyrex i believe is finished [ __ ] in the jars you can see there's still quite a bit of [ __ ] liquid in there so well i'm guessing it was too deep in there and the [ __ ] in the pirates have more surface area you know so yeah i kind of want to let this [ __ ] pool up here is what i'm trying to do but you can see it's thicker it's not runny like it used to be and yeah it's just it's freezing [ __ ] cold this is probably the easiest way to get it out is when it's all pooled up so i'm just gonna let that run but yeah that's basically that's how you make rso man that's the cure for cancer right there uh yeah hope you enjoyed the video hope uh helped you out uh yeah that's about all i got uh be careful with this [ __ ] though man it'll [ __ ] you up so take a little bit see what's up if you've never taken it but yeah other than that later all right guys there we go it's our rso i know i said i was dumb but i just want to show you guys basically you can scrape it out of here and uh put it in this dish give it to my grandma it's ready to eat put on topically you know uh yeah basically whatever i might eat a little bit too just to uh test the waters but uh yeah other than that yeah i think this is gonna be the real end so later you", "P3oeWmKZ16s": "my name is ELISA Francia I'm the owner of copycat showroom downtown Palm Springs and my husband and I owned the property here and my husband was afflicted with Parkinson's about five years ago he found out that he had it and he was in denial for good two years and medicated himself with alcohol and would laugh about that you know alcohol is the only thing that makes him feel good but after a while you can't drink like that so anyway we had found out about medical marijuana in California we lived in Las Vegas at that time and when I realized that it was legal in the state of California I gave him some unbeknownst to himself and within 45 minutes after eating a pancake with marijuana on it he stopped shaking and I walked over to his ottoman and sat down in front of him and I said how do you feel and he just put his hands out and said look look I'm not shaking and he had a smile on his face he felt great he did not move from that chair for six hours so that was my lightbulb moment I knew that then I was on to something that was going to relieve his pain and suffering because it's horrible to have Parkinson's disease and not have any relief and I feel that this is something that helped so many people in so many ways with pain and suffering and to take some of the medication the expensive pharmaceutical drugs are destroying people's lives not really helping them either they can't afford the pharmaceutical drugs or it's damaging their kidneys or damaging their bodies in some way so I'm behind this cause a hundred percent 110 percent and anything that I can do I will do and I urge anybody that is interested in learning more about the true effects of medical marijuana not what the government wants you to know is to join in on this you can't put people in jail for just trying to find some relief with what ails them so there you haven't land this could have seemed I did see you weren't good have you seen a lot of lately yeah that's cool I mean I like it when you look back in 2012 how would you characterize your year well I mean personally it was a terrific year it was it was kind of like yeah I embarked on some journeys and I and I and I I was optimistic enough to like take on some things that I might not have been used previous getting back on screen yeah that's I mean that's the thing about it about being optimistic enough to to take on some new things and I just I just did the last few years I've done some episodes a good wife and I did then Curb Your Enthusiasm and I'm just seeing a new play I'm gonna have to found a way to make drugs work for me a little bit better and and I just didn't buy but those experiences and I just thought why am I not doing what I do why am I not doing the thing that is giving me the most success in the most pleasure outside of my family was the moment you go on screen in this character and playing a guy with Parkinson's like that's that's a statement in out of itself that's a different reality for for television it's bigger than just a guy and a TV show well yeah but it was cool about that it was cool about the the the the the reaction that people have to that with me whether it's on the show is this character is just essentially a disabled character or handicap carrier having to put it somewhat differently situated yeah that's that's that's that's cool and that's new but for me that that that's the part of the character I don't have to think about I mean that's that's I don't have to I don't have to play that so so it's easy for me you have a real sense of humor about you know Parkinson's in the way you presented publicly the Curb Your Enthusiasm stuff was unbelievable you know oh thanks what the hell did you shake that up on purpose Parkinson's when Larry called me up and I don't know Larry that well I met him a few times what do you called me up and asked me if I'd do it and pitch the concept to me and I said this great because the way they work on that show is they there's an idea there's a there's a series of points you want to get to in the scene but how you get there is up to you yeah it's all ad-lib was all improv and and it was just great for me because I don't get chance to do that much and and and it just worked that great well he did it in the humorous way in the way that Rush Limbaugh really attacked you yeah about that again I don't control how people respond to it so so I just let that go however people react is how they react is how they zone their own thing it's a bad time it's their if they react like if people go how are you you okay that's their fear right you don't have to protect me you don't have to step in for me in and say don't you know what this guy's dealing with you know what just everybody chill yeah and with rush it's different though no rebel rush I mean remember that he's dealing with a really small base he's not dealing this big and that was the part that was mistake the Republicans made was they thought this guy representative their constituency and he doesn't he's a he's a fanatic yeah and he's a showman and he's just he didn't care about me or he didn't care about stem cells he didn't care about Parkinson's he cared about how would he flame up his base and what what he's saying so there think about fighting him is you can't fight him because who you trying to win over and anybody reasonable and responsible gets that you're right yeah so they go in a public arena and fight them if they trying to win over people that already are on your side so you just kind of go oh well yeah let him make noise in his own echo chamber I'll read you a quote this is from you at the Senate appropriation subcommittee hearing this is in DC and 99 if you said in my 40s I can expect challenges most people wouldn't face until their 70s and 80s if ever but with your help if we all do everything we can to eradicate this disease when I'm in my 50s I'll be dancing at my children's weddings yeah I mean I feel that way in the sense that um that I feel that a lot of the things that we're doing the foundation air pay off and I feel like there's there's there's there's stuff that's happening outside of us that's also interesting stuff with with we're feeling away State to live longer to look better my symptoms is moving around as I am right now I mean this is nothing this is I found ways to control of what really gave me a hard time three or four years ago dyskinesia is that were really that rocking if you look at some interviews I did they were really in the political ads I did it would I had a much different situation that I have now which one of the reasons I feel good about going back to work I can sit in a chair and I can have a conversation I couldn't do that five years ago if you think about how much when you were first not when you're first diagnosed but when you first started to take on this this concept of foundation how much how much was Parkinson's in the public space how much was it a part of fun right it wasn't in the public space very much at all because it was it was it was considered a situation that that affected the elderly and didn't affect younger people so when I kind of brought it out there that affected younger people not that that made it any more worthy it just made it it just changed it in people's minds and and so that was a big thing and and when I when I went public with that I had some real misgivings I didn't know whether that something I really wanted to do and then once I did the genie was out of the bottle and and and I had this feeling of kind of desperation like oh my god what did I do and and it was in the post and all the papers and all the the cable news networks and I was there running me in slow motion like it was tragic figure and you know you're in slow motion either dead or under indictment and and and and I really worried about it but I went out of line and I went to some purposes chat rooms and I saw the reaction of people and I first time I realized I was part of a community and I kind of went wow this is it was there was a lady who talked about going to a store and the guy always looked at her funny when she went in the store and then finally this one day she was she was kind of shaking and fumbling with her wallet he said what's the matter with you and she said I had Parkinson's nice no like michael fox' yeah and I went oh wow that's really that's really heavy that's really like a thing you just don't feel alone anymore you don't feel alone anymore and for me I felt a real sense I felt a sense of opportunity you know people want to hear I say what are you doing the foundation there anything close and they want to hear yet we found this pine nut that if you squeeze the oil out is cure well it doesn't work that way so we and we're trying to find that we're very close to a defining a biomarker we've got a big research project going on which is a way to find an indicator a common indicator in all Parkinson's patients that it will tip us off before symptoms are evident because by the time symptoms are evident by the time my pinkie twitched 80% of the dopamine producing cells in my brain were already dead right so if we can find a way early on that we can find a marker then we can then we can identify along the way the progression of the disease and we can treat it earlier and we can get in there earlier and if we can find a drug that halts progression and eliminate symptoms that may not be in it in the pure sense of cure but but it's as good as it cures did you have to change the way you approached being optimistic over the years yeah I mean I'll always just basically optimistic person when I was a kid but I mean it's it's really it's a richer thing now and it's and it's informed by by by the difficult times it's not important by a kind of a sense of a wide open future in front of me and I can't wait to get into it yeah it's more of a pass behind me that it's difficult challenging but has because of that true it has made me optimistic how'd you get there um I just had some more I had some struggles I mean III I was diagnosed and and ramdom I was diagnosed I mean my son was born my father died within a year and so I just when I kind of got wow how badly what my dad was yeah he in relation to the fact that I was about to raise a son I lost him and so that was really the true me off and then I was diagnosed very shortly after and and then I realized that my diagnosis that one of the ways I was self treating it by drinking warm and so I realize I had to not do that anymore and that was a challenge and and all that stuff and I mean that put pressure on my marriage and all that stuff was just to come through that and to compute that with it stronger marriage than ever in a sobriety that was really lasting and an understanding of how much I love my dad and how important he was to me in his absence which is unfortunate but but real strong appreciation for him and in a new respect for him and again my marriage it strengthened my merits because I realized she wasn't going anywhere when was diagnosed and that's your first fear yeah for sure am I gonna become a burden on my family and am I get and the fact that you want to have more children and now I have I have three more kids after that after my diagnosis and and they're great and I wouldn't I can't imagine one for that family you know as we go through the the new year 2013 now what do you what are you looking forward to is there a moment that you're hanging on well there's a couple things I mean like I said my my daughters are gonna start thinking a finished job high school next it's June and then going to going to college and that's an amazing thing that's I mean there's a like I said we were babies it went when I when I started out on this journey and and um and I'm gonna start the show and and and do this new show and that's gonna be big you know this every year is it is cool it's an opportunity it's amazing before we wrap up a rapid-fire anthropology questions your way what is one food that's your favorite gross food why Roberts gross but I like circus peanuts this was was kind of fake corn no base the marshmallow we like five of them in they become a rock that you think you'll never pass you hope you never pass what's the weirdest thing if I never said to you Michael Keaton I love you yeah hoody is somebody that you have to make peace with I don't have to make peace with I have to make peace with with I think with I have to understand people that have fear and ignorance I mean just generally not I'm not a person but but just people that that that whose first instinct is to is to is to find fault them to enter in to cast blame and and I just have to realize that that's fear and in and wherever I come across it at first the temptation to say to write them off but but instead to kind of say how can i how can I just work around that and hopefully bring them along so great to see it's great to see you man your Twitter if you want to join Team Fox and I recommend you do we've got it on our website go to strombel comm for all the details there stick around we'll be right back hello my name is Mike Paulus and the purpose of this video is to make viewers aware of Taylor French's condition with Parkinson's disease and what can happen when this condition changes dramatically with the intake of a nutritional extract in the first portion of this video his caretaker Janet assists him into the car this process can take as long as five minutes he has limited use of his legs and arms therefore making him totally dependent on Janet to get in and out of the car go to the bathroom go to bed eat and so on under normal circumstances it is also very difficult for him to speak when Taylor was living with me 18 months ago he was able to drive he was able to walk around take care of himself so you can see that the Parkinson's has certainly deteriorated its body in his system something else is is that you can see in a response to a question that I give him it takes a while for him to really sort of gather his senses and it may take up to two minutes to respond [Music] yes seeing is believing this is the same tailor that we've all seen in the wheelchair every day every week the difference is for the last 10 days Taylor has been taking a therapeutic dose of a vegetable extract and after 15 minutes since his last dose Taylor is standing walking moving on his own on this particular occasion it is for 45 minutes but if he is on this for an extended period of time he will regain his abilities through the miraculous nature of its neurogenic properties we've created this video to show how important this treatment is for a Parkinson's patient to actually give them back a normal life as you can see in this case it certainly is making a big change never say never speak with your mouth full obviously the extract has also increased his sense of humor and/or I see restored his sense of humor is never lost for most of us raising our arms is no big deal for Taylor it requires a lot of help on this day he effort Lee brings him up twittering his fingers in the air could you imagine how much difference this could make if he has his capability for 24 hours every day not just for once in nine months for 45 minutes so after Janet asked Taylor hey Taylor do you want to go for a walk he turns around heads towards the front of the house and this part is a miracle as he confidently ambles towards the gate usually he can run in a forward falling position but not walk he also needs someone to catch him at his destination not this time [Music] hereafter eyeballing his Buick and being determined a bit of a ham when a camera is going Taylor now decides he's man enough to drive the car especially after being fed by Janet can he do this remember he's not walked on his own or driven in months confidence is now getting the best of him and he will try sure enough under zone power he makes all the moves that are easy for the rest of us but impossible for him [Music] as you can see when we say under your own power that means a lot for someone to make all the moves of getting into a car themselves starting it up positioning the steering wheel closing the door rolling up the window all these requires a lot of concentration and effort for someone who normally needs to be helped into a car incredible miracle [Music] pulling it out we're hoping at the paying attention here and not crashing into anything but you can see totally in control [Music] unbelievable there he goes and we suspect he'll return you", "lDg7IADodb8": "true leaves oral syringe

members lately asking questions about our Phoenix tears and what's out there for Phoenix teachers there's a lot of confusion so what we have here this is one of our Phoenix tears this is the THC now here's a couple important things to remember first of all this is a complete no leader unfortunately there's companies out there that ask an absorbent amount of money but when you read the package it's only got 0.5 of a milliliter in it so basically what they're doing is they're playing games with the pricing in the packaging also when you look at the contents now our Phoenix tears are full milliliter of course now also you need to look at the percentages of Medicine in the product unfortunately again there's companies out there that try to baffle you with BS and they put theirs you know they put those milliliters but nobody really puts the percentages in it and it's very very confusing I was at a dispensary yesterday and pointed this out to someone and they were actually quite shocked when they seen the facts of it so what we have here this is our Phoenix tears made by Mary's of course the finest finest THC in the world and just give you a little hint oh what's this oh the first place tokers Bowl trophy Wow must be good stuff so anyways back to the Phoenix here so what it is with this so now what we do is this is 68 percent THC there's always you know 0.5% variants you know due to weather humidity everything else but we try to keep around 68 percent THC also what we use in ours is we use hemp seed oil as our carrier oil because when you co2 extract this stuff it just comes out as goo so you need something to liquefied a bit so we use is we use hemp seed oil the very very best carrier oil that you can use with it now dosing on these I get a lot of questions on dosing how much do you take you know what's it good for and again that's the problem out there there's people and competitors I'm sorry we don't have any competition there's people out there in companies again what they'll do is they'll give you 500 milliliters and say it's got you know three milliliters of GAC in it well I'm not the smartest person in the world and trying to do the math on that is very very confusing so again look at the percentages in the product this is 68% look for a full milliliter don't get confused don't get fooled and look at the facts now dosing on the product a couple of ways to dose the product the one way that we find the best and the size is right here so you see here there's my finger very very small think of a grain size of rice again because it's very very potent again there's 68% in here so a very very small amount now a couple of things you can do you can put it onto your finger and put it under your tongue what our members find work the best because it is messy you know it is messy is to take this a little bit and you'll put it on a cracker or a biscuit and they'll eat the biscuit now what happens with this as you know and please do your research when it goes into your body this is Delta 9 THC once it's converted through the liver it becomes Delta 11 so it's very very powerful remember that when you're taking the product and this product is nighttime relief this is not something you would use during the day it's too strong and what our members use it for of course we have many cancer patients that believe that by large amounts of doses of THC produces the cancer and of course go online and do that we can't we can't make any claims on that and also what we use this for is excruciating pain shingles people use it if you have excruciating pain this is going to help but remember the THC is going to throw you into the coach this product is available at much general store under concentrates Phoenix tears THC and through select dispensaries through button herbs distribution throughout Canada use our product responsible hydrate you can hydrate enough with any of these products drink lots of water stay away from coffee and everything else and please use our products responsible never share our product and again don't drive and don't use this product for work this is again is a night time relief if you have any questions on this or any of our products you can visit but general store calm and contact us and our agents be more than happy to share members information with you thank you and have a wonderful day okay", "eDn3wTnbsE8": "how's everybody doing this is John with C&C connoisseurs and we've got a much requested one for you today so do you have a cartridge and you're having a hard time refilling it well this also applies if you happen to purchase one of these questionable cartridges and it fails how do you remove the mouthpiece to extract the oil I'm going to show you how to remove the mouthpiece from these cartridges in a way that they can then be reused or the oil can be recovered from them now the tools that I'm going to be utilizing are simply a common pair of vise grips and these are going to be csail 1 mil or 1 gram disposable one-time use ceramic coil cartridges that being said let's take this to the deck ok well here we are once again these are one-time use non removable sea cells as you can see right here this is a sea sail brand that is a batch code on the bottom alright this is another one this one here does not state sea sell across the bottom but on the base it does say sea sell m07 9 this is also a Jupiter distributed cartridge so the first things first we're going to take a pair of vice grips common write scripts and we're going to adjust them so when we apply them we apply them just at the base of that metal see how it's just barely barely at the base of that metal right there and we want to close it so it closed it just a little bit it pinches down just ever so slightly nothing cracks it barely bows and then you rock it back and forth rather firmly now there you have it you will get some flyer marks on the mouthpiece but if you look this collar right here which is what you want to preserve is undamaged completely undamaged okay now well there's the silicone ring right there that will seal around this shaft so you don't worry about that now in this outer sheath you can see that it is also undamaged that one was a little bit difficult I'll apply it to this just to stand it up and they'll have a go at one of these other ones all right I will show you again on this one here I said this is a C cell you take the pliers right at the base of the metal hinge it lock it back and forth pulling the cartridge off of the mouthpiece just like that [Applause] very simple easy there you have it alright now I'm gonna apply this cartridge to this battery just for a stable base and I'm going to open up this gelato right here and warm it up to dispense it into this cartridge okay now here is the cartridge we are going to refill all right here is the mouthpiece for the cartridge perfectly fine a couple of scratches on but that shouldn't affect it in the least here's the distillate we will be applying to it I have warmed this up substantially just to ensure that it does flow rather well into the system you simply place the applicator tip on the syringe twisting it to ensure that it has a good seal you put the syringe tip down into the cartridge and then just begin to apply the fluid all right there you have it as you can see the original line of the older oil right there at the bottom of the new oil coming down to meet it okay take that off the bottom there and see it's sinking down there very nice we didn't get a protective silicon cap for these threads right here apply it to the threads take the mouthpiece that came off of the cartridge put it over the top and it will it will not go on all the way that's a good thing that means that the seal still works it will not go on at this point you want to take a precision device and apply pressure now as you do that you will see this seal disappears and there you have it let's take this back up top and see how she does all right and here we are back on top with the csail refill that we have here now as you can see the oil has got down to the coil has mixed with that heather oil bubbles are rising to the top let's take this protective cover off the bottom of this hook it up to a battery let's see what we got shall we well there you have it that's working like a champ looking that of oil through there I can get that a little bit of gelato flavor from that distillate that I put in there it's very nice well there you have it that is how you can remove and refill one of these cartridges to extract the oil from it what you're going to want is a slightly longer blunt syringe tip and I have a few of those a slightly longer blunt syringe tip such as this one right here as you can see how long that is that would definitely get all the way down to the base of that and you would be able to extract any additional oil that happens to be in a cartridge where this this cell has failed this one no it's not failing all it's working great well thank you so much for tuning in this has been John with TMZ connoisseurs you be sure to remember to subscribe

is little tree thought I'd do a quick educational video on how I make my medicated honey I take cannabis oil or RSO for a thyroid disorder that I have that has caused a little bit of stroke damage so take it daily to maintain my health some people have asked me how I medicate daily and if I do edibles and I do do edibles because I make a medicated tea so this is how I make my medicated tea out of my Medicaid honey made from my cannabis oil or our so first you're gonna want to get your your nice little comfy tea set I got this at a ther store for like a dollar I'm using sleepytime sinus through their teak so I really like the flavor I've been soaking my cannabis oil which my caregiver - it gives it to me in syringe form so there's 10 grams in here so it will last me a little over a month and then I went out and bought some local honey actually it turns out Brazilian it's it's man it's packaged lovely but I thought that looks really good so I've been soaking both of them for about 10 minutes and some really really really warm water like actually it's very hot water basically if you turn your hot water heater all the way up that's how hot the water needs to be right before it starts to make little bubbles so now that they've been soaking for a little bit if you set when you set the oil it makes it so it just comes out of the syringe a little easier take them out of here so all I'm doing is I'm opening the honey which I made sure to take the foil off before using the chopsticks to like move it around and since it's been in the hot water it should be really warm consistency if it doesn't feel like it's a warm consistency to you put it back in and I mean this isn't like that see how it's just runny that's how it needs to be in order for the IRS so the cannabis oil to soak into it so I just take the top off line be careful do it over the honey because sometimes it kind of squirts out and I just squirt it right in there and since it was hot I didn't have very much left on the edges see how clear that was and I'm just gonna set this on my tea to kind of do out then I'm gonna mix it and mix it and mix it and if you watch you'll see that my honey will start turning same color as the Ursa it takes a minute especially at this honey this is extremely raw unfiltered honey I also find what works really well is like the wildflower honey or the clover honey I really like those because I can't eat sugars a lot of sugars I'm allergic to it so honey is my best option so I'm gonna mix this up for a little bit I tried so I've been stirring this for a quite a few minutes now the consistency is getting quite green it's beautiful I'm gonna end up taking this off like this trying to make a little mess as possible but I am just gonna put it in with my tea so they won't be too big of a deal now I'm gonna put the lid on and I'm a super [ __ ] it's a nice tight you don't want some honey everywhere if you feel that your money's cooled off a bit you might want to turn it a few times see if you look at the bottom it still needs to get in there I usually turn it a few times and then I'll soak it in the water hot water again for a little bit to break up the what's cooled down a little bit cuz you did put two different kinds of substance together and we've been messing with it and putting air bubbles in it so shake it up get it all nice and mixed and when you're done and it's nice and mixed to your consistency that you like you just put a teaspoon in your key and you're good to go so I'm gonna stop all right so we're at the very end game then let me the honey cannabis mixture soaked in some hot water for about 10 minutes Cobb enough is still steaming a little bit I actually took the time to prepare my tea we got most of the stuff off so we're almost there guys so let's check out and see I'm sure there's not pressure build up with all the heat there we go be careful when you're opening it oh yeah that's exactly how it's supposed to be look at this it's beautiful exactly how it's supposed to be nice and green nice and easy to work with when it cools off it'll be a little bit like not so runny a little bit more stable I'm excited so since I this is my first batch of this type I'm only gonna use a teaspoon so you get a little bit deeper down and there make sure I still have mixed up don't want to waste any time my teaspoon of tea went ahead and took my teabag out I'm excited about my tea now let that sit for a second it looks super yummy huh you don't have to just do the tea guys you can do it in anything that you want to use honey in remember keep the lid on make sure that you keep your medicine where medicine should be you know to the hands of people who aren't supposed to be in it consume responsibly have a good one",

speech like that i'm gonna say hey hell yeah put on your and go easy because i took i'm a pretty skinny fella and i took like a little bit more than a grain of a rice a size of a grain rice like i was suggested to nice i feel nice i mean probably as you go on you're probably gonna have build up a tolerance you'd probably have to take more and whatever but first time trying it recommendation grain of a rice i did a little bit more with my poke i'm gonna say hair to hair yeah i felt like someone just came up to me and went ah you know what i'm saying i like it i like it uh definitely different from smoking i've been smoking a lot lately uh because i've been such a it's been so much pain lately uh i figured i'd take a different approach today so there you go first time trying rso um you know i pretty much i feel like i pretty much reached max or peak ready hope you guys like it like the video that's all i got so first time all right so shout out noah botanicals for the gorilla glue number four gang [ __ ]", "jhVjl5SdlTc": "the billion dollar CBD and RSO oil blunder this is Brian boy reporting for Internet Deputy in this investigative report we are going to expose a multibillion-dollar cannabis and hemp blunder Forbes magazine claims the cannabis and hemp industry is heading towards a 100 billion dollar business if we told you the CBD and canvas oil infrastructure is about to become obsolete would you believe it if this is true you can bet this report is going to get some serious resistance we're talking about companies worldwide who have invested millions into manufacturing equipment for the business of making cannabis and hemp extracts literally 100% of the medical cannabis and hemp industry is creating some form of an extract so what's the blender most viewers watching this video are not aware of the following information that we are going to reveal in this report there are hundreds of CBD and THC oil companies seeking to help people however 100% of these companies who make teachers extracts isolates and concentrates are greatly destroying the healing properties of this amazing natural herb before we proceed with this report we would like to clearly acknowledge that CBD and THC oils have powerful healing properties and the extracted oils have helped thousands of people so if this is true why can this be a blunder it's helping people right but sadly there are seven major blunders that we are going to reveal in this report probably one of the greatest misconceptions about CBD and THC oil is potency the misconception about potency is the number one reason why CBD or THC oils are even made sellers of CBD and THC oils are pushing potency as some kind of medicinal advantage this claim is 100% false stronger or more concentrated oils do not have any benefit compared to a less potent oil so what does high-potency really mean it means it's more concentrated and it takes up less space take a look at this non extracted natural made products called hemp paste this product was made using the whole plant method again this is not an extracted or chemically processed product this one Graham scoop equals 30 milligrams of CBD and this CBD oil here also contains 30 milligrams same potency yet the hemp pace was not chemically processed this extracted oil here actually has less medicinal benefits versus the hep paste which we will explain later in this report for example here are two 500 milligram tablets of vitamin C and here is one 1000 milligram gelcap also of vitamin C both equal one thousand milligrams everybody knows that there is no difference other than having to take two tablets instead of one should you the consumer care if it's 30 percent or 99 percent potency of course not in the CBD THC oil world you will find companies bragging about having 99.9% pure CBD isolates the misconception when we hear the word pure we think it's a good thing but take note the pure means it contains nothing else but CBD no terpenes or other cannabinoids such as CB g cbn or THC are present there's no full spectrum when it's pure CBD to this day there is no evidence that extracts have any medicinal benefits over the non extracted flower or the whole plant in layman's terms there is no reason or medicinal benefit to extract the oil from the hemp and cannabis plant somehow people assume or ignorantly follow the notion that the natural state of the cannabis or hemp flower is useless unless it was extracted into an oil what confirms this misconception is the majority of cannabis strains contain over 27% THC and if you take one gram a bud and cook it properly you will have about 270 milligrams of active THC this is 27 times the amount that the state of Colorado recomm for a safe dosage anyone who says that you should extract cannabis or hemp is smoking way too much of their own brother there are also strains of hemp that contain over 21% CBD ignorantly people are sold on the idea that the stronger the oil the better it works make note the more you concentrate the plan the more you damage the medicine there are seven major blunders that we are going to cover in this investigative report here's blender number one the cannabis extraction process was popularized in 2004 by canadian rick simpson between the phrase RSO or Rick Simpson oil mr. Simpson was the one that came up with the explosive idea of extracting oil from the cannabis plant by using 190 proof alcohol bricks Ibsen's extraction method is to take a pound of marijuana bud and soak it in 190 proof alcohol in a bucket for an hour then straining out the plant bud and throwing the leftover plant matter into the trash leaving what looks like a brownish green tea Rick would then put the alcohol mixture into a pan on a stove on high heat and evaporate all the alcohol out until it looks like this a black thick oil known as RSO this process is extremely flammable and dangerous to make and has caused many fires across the world what's ironic about the alcohol extraction method is that the RSO was meant to save lives and yet the explosions have killed people here's blender number two the entire multi-billion dollar oil industry has since followed the RSO idea of extraction many of the major companies have switched from 190-proof alcohol to butane or co2 extraction are these new extraction methods the future are they safe to eat Troy Shermer a hemp and cannabis researcher contacted 14 different hemp and cannabis lab testing facilities such as analytical 360 in Washington and SC labs in California the main question that Troy asked was how much of the terpenes are lost during butane and co2 extraction the majority of lab testing facilities said that they would not give out that information s/he labs in California mentioned on a phone interview that if they shared such information it would damage their relationship with their clients only two companies answered all the questions and both lab testing companies stated that 99% of the terpenes are destroyed through butane and co2 extractions look at steep hill laboratories email response by the way steep hill laboratories was the most transparent and answering the questions the lab techs said the maximum terpenes destroyed up to 100% but most of the terpenes are lost through butane and co2 extraction co2 extraction is worse than butane construction in this way he claimed he also made a statement about removing butane from the oil as butane leaves a chemical residue and many experts claim that it is toxic and has carcinogens which means that it's cancerous if this were true why would L companies sell a product that has carcinogens to people who are fighting cancer blender number three did you know that the majority of CBD and THC oil companies are adding terpenes from fruits and trees to replace the terpenes that were destroyed by extraction these added terpenes are not natural turbines from the hemp or cannabis plant take this orange and the CBD oil by drop some oil onto this orange am I getting terpenes yes I am they're not the real terpenes from hemp or cannabis what happened to natural did the CBD oil industry follow the footsteps of the pharmaceutical industry it's one hundred percent clear that they did and adding fake terpenes to a natural medicine is deceptive the oil industry will say it's for flavor so why are they really adding terpenes it is clear that the industry has started to recognize how critical the entourage effect is and they're trying to cover the damage done to their products by adding fake turkeys what is the entourage effect we'll cover that in the next segment but first our fake terpene safe even though they come from fruits and trees the internet deputy has found the following news articles study finds that adding terpenes might make extracts toxic our terpenes enriched cannabis concentrates bad for your health adding terpenes to dads might be toxic blunder number four on taraj effect the CBD oil industry has been producing isolated CBD it's a white powder and it currently is a hot selling product if you look at the CBD isolate here it's 99% pure CBD what this means is that there is nothing left but CBD there is no full spectrum no terpenes no CBD aid nothing left but CBD how does this affect the entourage effect what is the entourage effect back in 2001 the British Journal of pharmacology refers to the entourage effect and synergistic relationship of terpenes in the article taming the THC since then there have been hundreds of articles about the entourage effect scientists and researchers have concluded long ago that the entourage effect or synergistic effects of all the terpenes and cannabinoids together is superior over isolating CBD just one cannabinoid type such as CBD will not have an entourage effect entourage or synergistic means things work together or enhance one another or even better yet they create a completely different set of medicinal benefits since pure CBD has no terpenes or other cannabinoids it is impossible to create an entourage effect it is important to understand the entourage effect and how many added medicinal values it does create when you google search cannabis entourage effect you will find some powerful articles on how important the entourage effect is when it comes to the healing properties in hemp and cannabis as you can see there are many articles on the entourage effect in short you will find evidence that the terpenes and all the cannabinoids work together and have a superior medicinal value so the question is why would the CBD oil industry isolate CBD when it prevents entourage effects and why would they destroy 99% of the terpenes blunder number 5 what does decarboxylated the hemp and cannabis plant mean heating the hemp and cannabis will remove the a or carbolic acid from CBD a or THC a this is called decarboxylated or activating the cannabinoids both CBD a and CBD are very medicinal in different ways one is raw and one is cooked the main difference is CBD will pass through the blood-brain barrier and will attach to cb1 receptors in your brain but the CBD a will not CBD a is recently gaining popularity in the news regarding its anti proliferative properties known for preventing bad cell growth as found in cancer it's also anti-inflammatory which greatly reduces seizures and pain in short the uncooked or raw state of the plant has major medicinal benefits the CBD and THC oil company's method is to completely cook or decarboxylate the plant as much as possible so that more milligrams of CBD or THC can be sold this destroys even more terpenes thus damaging the medicine let's look at a famous lab testing company called analytical 360 which does thousands of lab tests on CBD oil products click concentrates then sort them by high CBD and select one look at how dark that is the cbda is under 1% which means this product has been completely cooked to death to where it is basically zero CBD a it has been completely decarboxylated and has been processed several times remember CBD a is anti proliferative and anti inflammatory and because it's uncooked it contains over 18 times more terpenes wonder number 6 there are 118 different kinds of cannabinoids such as CBD and THC and the science is evolving the question is how do the remaining 116 cannabinoids work together what are they and what do they do what happens when we remove or isolate them the race is on to discover what these trace cannabinoids can do for our health let's look at cannabinoid number 17 otherwise known as 17 CA - 5 it is a trace cannabinoid which is difficult to detect under normal lab testing equipment yet researchers are finding that this trace cannabinoid is a precursor for CBD just like how CBD affects THC they work together as you know THC is very beneficial medically but unfortunately it is also hallucinogenic CBD decreases the hallucinogenic effect of THC and this allows you to take a slightly higher percentage of THC without getting high thus creating a superior blend of medicine or full-spectrum medicine when co2 or butane extraction is used cannabinoid number-17 will evaporate and be lost again this is another reason why extraction destroys the entourage effect blunder number 7 caused to produce inferior CBD oil this process you are seeing is the standard method used when making CBD oil this appears high-tech and impressive but it's actually destroying the terpenes and many of the delicate 118 different types of cannabinoids it can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for this processing equipment did you know it is impossible to extract all of the cannabinoid terpenes without damaging the medicine look at the CBD oil the flower was processed one time and the reason it's so nice and clear is because it was processed just once but a lot of the cannabinoids were still left in the plant which was thrown in the trash can CBD oil companies are literally throwing away the leftover plant matter that still contains up to 40% of the cannabinoids these numbers vary depending on the method and how many times you run the plant through the machine now let's look at what's being sold in today's market let's go back to analytical 360 scroll down and click on concentrates and choose any test see how black that is it has been repeatedly processed over and over trying to extract all the cannabinoids out of the plant less than 1% of the terpenes survived through this process and delicate trace cannabinoids are damaged so I buy all of this equipment only to destroy 99% of the terpenes and leave butane residue in the product it triples the cost to the consumer and greatly decreases the medicinal value of the product so what is the solution the solution is don't concentrate the plant Internet deputy found that the hemp pace and cannabis paste methods were the only methods in the world where 100% of the plant was consumed there is ZERO waste as nothing is thrown away the flower and leaves are ground up and cooked with a coconut type oil called MCT oil that hemp paste method preserves the terpenes and the costs produced the jefes is literally three hundred and thirty five times cheaper then the chemically processed oil this will make this amazing natural medicine affordable to the whole world and people who could not afford it before now can but the billion dollar question is will the world learn these seven blunders will you the consumer still buy CBD and THC oils or will you revert back to what is natural thank you and I hope that you enjoyed this investigative report this is Brian Boyd reporting for Internet demeaning",

Andrew Friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of food infusions today we're gonna make one of my favorite ingredients again a super versatile ingredient in the kitchen what better than hot sauce something you can put on absolutely everything now when you make a hot sauce it's really easy peppers garlic some acid these are the things that pull it all together and when we think about hot sauce it can really be any combination so when you look at my recipe you can totally manipulate and mold it put any special ingredient in that you like but what I have today is a pack of peppers we have habaneros we have Serrano's we have jalapenos I have half of an onion I have a nice little bunch of cilantro because I love cilantro but if you're not a fan of cilantro you don't have to put it in if you'd like to put carrots in go crazy put some carrots in make sure you sautee them I'm a garlic fiend I got six cloves of garlic most recipes call for three but I'm not Italian but I like what they say double it and vinegar very important the vinegar is what we're gonna put in the pan so I'm gonna saute my peppers onions and garlic all together in a pan I'm gonna put a bit of infused olive oil on the pan we're gonna get the oils juicing out of everything and then we're gonna end up putting it in the blender with a little bit more infused olive oil put a nice pan on medium heat get that going you could put your olive oil in whenever we definitely don't want to smoke this oil but we want to use it to help release the other essential oils from the ingredients so we put the oil into the pan it really helps get all the essential oils popping out of the delicious onion garlic and peppers that we've chosen it's also infused so this is the start of our infusion all right so we've been steaming our peppers onions and garlic for about five minutes now three to five minutes everything's getting a little bit softer you can see it sweating releasing its essential oils and what we're gonna do is just add about two hundred mils of vinegar white vinegar and we're gonna leave it to simmer for about 15 minutes and really release everything that's going on in there the Scotch bonnets the jalapenos the Serrano's all that delicious stuff [Music] a little bit of secret sauce it's been about 15 minutes on the simmer with all of our delicious ingredients we add a little bit of salt pepper a little bit of our secret sauce everything's looking fantastic nice and mixed together and the next step is just to introduce it to the blender and turn it into our sauce whoo that's a spicy Oh cover we've got all our ingredients in the blender that we've just simmered now there's a few things that I like to add fresh and just to pump up the infusion a little bit more so first thing is just a little bit more infused olive oil if you haven't watched that video make sure to click the card now I'm just gonna put a few more milligrams in there perfect as I mentioned I like cilantro and I like it fresh let's put some fresh cilantro in nice large pinch is what I'm gonna add today and then I have a few limes left over from making margaritas so I think I'm just gonna add three or four fresh lime wedges in here so now the easiest and most exciting part of making our sauce making the sauce really it's as simple as creating our ingredients like that and putting them in a blender we'll see how thick it is and see if we need to add more vinegar after a little blend wonderful smells delicious in here so we've got our sauce I have my container and we will just put it in there and let it cool now I'm really excited I have a really cool follow-up video to this one and I'm going to teach you how to take this infused hot sauce and we're gonna turn it into an infused salt you'll be able to use that salt anywhere popcorn just at on steak it's gonna be really really cool okay so our hot sauce goes in funnel always makes this much easier and isn't that beautiful that's homemade hot sauce nice thick delicious goodness no preservatives no additives I guess we're preserving with salt and vinegar that's all we really need at the end of the day there we go that was 500 mils of hot sauce I never actually get the amount right in the bottle so I'm even more impressed with myself not to gloat seal it up throw it in the fridge and because the amount of vinegar and salt in here it'll last easily three to six months my dosage there's about 150 milligrams of THC in this hot sauce you'll be able to dose it out everybody can use it on tacos and whatever you'd enjoy it with thanks so much for watching this episode I hope I hope you enjoyed learning how to make infused hot sauce please make sure to LIKE comment share and subscribe and until next time Cheers what's my name what's my

some cannabis infuse coconut oil to see exactly how I made this check out one of my recent videos I'll post a link in the description but the cool part about today is Russell at cannabis candy molds shoutout him sent me these chocolate bars along with my favorite part these cool ass molds and look professional they look like molds or chocolates you would get at a dispensary also came with some foils some bags to wrap them up in who wouldn't love that as a present and a cool stamp so you could put that on anything to keep it out of reach and keep things safe what you need here is a double boiler or you can do what I'm doing iced have a pot here I'm gonna use a pyrex dish I was gonna buy a Dutch oven but I'm like I don't have one so I want to show you you can make it work with what you got I'm going to turn this on to a low medium low heat set that baby in there and let's start out with the semi-sweet chocolate I'll pop the camera in so you can see a little better you don't want it too hot you want to make sure you do this at a slow low temp as you can see it's starting to melt it's probably about two tablespoons there that's a lot that's probably over a half cup that supplies half cup three quarters so I just added half of the other chocolate bar to give it a little more texture because it's looking a little liquidy give it a little stir now we're gonna go ahead and just dump it in the mold so there we have it we have the foam molds about 1/2 cup of the coconut oil with a bar and a half of the chocolate we're gonna let it set in a refrigerator for about 30 minutes to an hour all right so it's about an hour later and they are hardened let's go ahead a little put beautiful beautiful might have been able to wait an extra few minutes but hey I wanted to try one no let's try one tastes good nice coconut oil flavor chocolate animus taste isn't overwhelming thank you again Russell at cannabis candy molds for the amazing molds chocolate the goody bags foil and the molds worked perfectly [Music]", "z5kSOLH-4oc": "[Music] okay grow hams what the heck is going on it's rando i'm gonna make today some rick simpson oil i'll show you the ingredients you need first you need some weed some gnarly [ __ ] and you need about probably about one or two ounces i might go an ounce and a half just to have a good look at this stuff this is this is um skull [ __ ] a combination of blue dream and ak-48 and we gotta crush all those up plus you need um some 99 alcohol costs about 22 bucks a gallon and you're gonna need a hot plate and it has to be electric because you don't want no flames this [ __ ] is so freaking uh explosive it's not funny and of course you have to be outside home ramble fresh air gotta have some music on look at this day it is one o'clock and 68 degrees unbelievable i'll ramble the jamaican blue mountain crossed with the lamb's breath is still ripening up out there and the oranges are looking good ramble ramble still has a few um uh of these uh nuts to finish off those are walnuts i grew myself up in my front yard chow down rambo he likes to um chew on the carpet it's really painful to step on them okay what else do you need you need because you need a bowl we'll crush them up and and you need a bigger bowl and you need a strainer you know of course you need some good weed to smoke too while you're working on it something good to drink and over and out i'll be right back [Music] okay once you got your um your buds ground down to a good consistency and got rid of most your stems and everything you're ready for some isopropyl alcohol 99 holy [ __ ] best used by 110 20 21 that means we're already out of date [Applause] now you got to make sure you put in enough to completely cover the canvas and you need a good spoon for um mixing it all up now you could probably do this for 10 minutes five ten minutes i would i would say ten minutes and what i heard is this um pure alcohol actually depletes the the thc out of the buds and brings it into the alcohol just sucks it out like us like a slushy machine [Music] foreign [Music] um [Music] it's barely warm it might be too cold outside i might have to crank this heat up a little i'll go to one and a half let's see how that works [Music] okay finally we got some action happening starting to boil got on a slow boil let me see what time is it now it's about three o'clock and uh it might take another two hours hopefully be done by five o'clock so stay tuned it's a little breezy out here nice temperature probably 67 68 degrees hold on [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Music] well finally the rick simpson oil is done what time is it what's about four o'clock i think i spent about three hours making it and look how much i got it's a [ __ ] ton out of about two ounces about five dollars worth of um alcohol and uh a dollar's worth of electricity and oh this is some potent ass [ __ ] you got to be careful though because it is potent and it tastes nasty oh my god it tastes bad so you gotta put it on the back of your tongue just a tiny bit and wash it down with some juice now down here i'm gonna scrape this off with the razor blade and get a little bit more and that's the coco and here's the rambo look at all those mess he's making with the the hole that's and what's crazy is he eats the shells too you don't see too many shells left over

[Music] bubble hash is one of the oldest and purest methods of making concentrated cannabis and uses only ice and water as a solvent it's easy to do but requires time patience and some elbow grease so let's get started here's what you need to make bubble hash when it comes to making bubble hash you are going to need some bubble bags and these are usually vinyl bags that are designed to fit inside of one gallon or five gallon buckets and they have a silk or micron screen bottoms and those that vary in different sizes 25 to 220 microns and you're going to need three to five different sizes of those you can find links to those kinds of bags on amazon in the description you're also going to need a wooden dowel to agitate the cannabis you're going to need some ice about 10 15 pounds of ice you're also going to need some cannabis you can use any grain of cannabis that you want for here we're going to use about three or four ounces of outdoor grown cannabis if you're using outdoor grown cannabis or any kind of cannabis you're going to go ahead and manicure it down to its buds so go ahead and pull off the major portion of the leaves until you get down to the pods unless you're actually using shake and trim which you can also make bubble hash out of shake and trim but we're using the buds and we're going to go ahead and manicure that down the next thing you're going to do is to layer your bags inside of the bucket we're using a five gallon bucket you may use a one gallon bucket also depending on the bags that you have but the thing that you want to do is you want to layer your screens inside of the bucket starting with the smaller screen first so in this case we've put our 25 micron screen in then we put our 73 micron screen in now we're putting our 160 micron screen in and then lastly we'll be putting our 220 micron screen back in and micron screens and that a micron is the measurement of microns with 220 microns means that 220 microns will fit through each hole in that screen and then so the smaller the number the smaller the size of the holes so and now that we've added our screens and layered them up and now we've added our cannabis into our 220 micron screen we've added about three or four ounces of cannabis and then now we're adding in ice now the ice is being used in this case to lower the temperature so that it freezes the trichomes and so that the stems of the trichomes are brittle and the trichome heads break off into the water so you want to use as much ice as possible so we're putting as much ice in we're covering up our cannabis and we're coming about six inches from the bottom of our pocket and now we're also going to add water and you want to add water so that it covers up into barely covers the cannabis which is in the the bottom of our top bag so you can tilt the screens or tilt the bucket to find out if see if you estimate if you have enough cannabis enough water to cover your cannabis but that's the idea is that you want to have enough water to cover your cannabis as well as up into the eyes and what we're doing is we're freezing the the trichomes so that the stems become brittle and the trichomes heads fall off and the idea is that to break and agitate the cannabis so now we're agitating turning and using our wooden dowels to actually literally just agitate and mix the cannabis being sure not to poke holes into our micron screens we're going to keep agitating as much as possible you can do this for several minutes 15-20 minutes or so and then after you do that you're going to let it settle and we've uh what we've done is we've broken frozen those trichrome heads and we've letting them uh fall into the water and then they've fallen through those micron screens and this larger micron screen we're now taking that out it's been several minutes after it's been agitated and it's been sitting for about 45 minutes and now we're taking out the the top screen the 220 micron and setting it aside and now we're going to pull up our first green which will have trapped some of the uh larger pieces of cannabis and our thc and trichomes and also some plant material so this first layer of screens that we're pulling out is going to be our least pure it's going to have our most plant material it's our biggest micron screen and most of the thc has actually fallen through this screen so but you can see there we've pulled out a little bit of bubble hash there and it's a darker color hash and then now we're pulling out our second screen and in order to uh save the cannabis that was left on the screen that we didn't wash off we're inverting it carefully and then dipping it back into the next green down into the water that's in that screen and that is to wash the trichomes off into that next screen so now we're removing the second screen out i believe this would be our uh 73 micron screen and we're we're letting the water fall out of that we're not going to squeeze it we're gonna let it fall out and then you can see now that the trichomes that are left there a little lighter color than the first set and there's also more of them and there's a lot less plant material here as you can see compared to the previous hash that came out it's a lot lighter color but again we're rinsing the remaining hashtag we didn't scrape off into the next batch or into the last screen so we make sure our screen is nice and clean and then we've come to our last screen and this is our 25 micron screen and we'll see this is the finest screen and this is going to make sure that pretty much anything left on here that's any thc is going to get trapped in this screen here and as we scrape that up you can see it's pretty easy to collect the cannabis or the thc that's collected there or the hash and it's a nice uh lighter a little more blonde color than the previous two a little bit more pure and you can see that's why those screens are used so that you can get different grades of hash and the next step now a lot of people would use a micro on screen here we didn't have a micron screen we're just using some cheese cloth or a muslin cotton muslin bag here and we're squeezing out the water it's just being pressed out gently with some palm pressure there to press out the water and what's going to be remaining is bubble hash and what we've got here is three different grades of bubble hash depending on the three different screens that we used and and in the end we're actually going to combine all of our hash altogether so i'm just showing you the different screens there for demonstration purposes but if you're only going to use one grade of hash in the end uh there's really no need to have multiple screens you might just use one or two screens in that case but for demonstration purposes we're using multiple screens to show how you'd get different grades of hash and now that we've uh we've gone one run of our canvas you can do this two or three different times or even up to five or more times with each batch of cannabis so this is the second run with the same batch of cannabis just with another run of the water and ice this one actually sat overnight this second run we got a pretty good yield off of it even better than the first and then we even decided to go ahead and run a third run off of the same batch of cannabis and so even after collecting two pretty good batches of bubble hash with it we went ahead and decided to go the third one and even after the third running we're still getting some more hash out of it you can see after the third time the cannabis is getting it looks like a lot like seaweed it's very foamy it get agitates a lot easier and it also gets foams up a lot easier as the last two or three batches were gone but once they pressed out the the phone goes away and you can see that there are three different batches of bubble hash there at different stages of drying out and you can see that the uh the newer batch is much muddier looking uh the batch in the center there is the first batch we did is dried out from overnight this episode of cannabis is brought to you by the roughhouse studios smoke shop selling raw

"MewQRwSYdiM": "[Music] hi there buds and welcome back to my kitchen I've been looking over the comment section of the edible videos that I've done recently and I've noticed that the most requested thing that people want are how to make weed gummies so I thought it would make weed gummy bears with you guys let me show you guys what you guys will need to make some weed gummies so the first thing that you're going to need are some type of gummy molds I chose little gummy bears and it came with a dropper which this is really convenient for transporting the gummy mixture into each of these little molds I'll have a link in the description of this video with all of the materials that I use next you will need an ounce of gelatin which is all four envelopes in the box you'll also need a pack of your favorite flavored jello I chose strawberry and you also need 1/4 of a cup of cannabis coconut oil if you don't know how to make cannabis coconut oil click up here and I'll show you how and then lastly you'll need a large saucepan and a whisk let's get to making some gummies in a saucepan on high heat you want to add your 1/4 cup of cannabis coconut oil and 1 in 1/2 cups of water to your saucepan and you want to whisk that together and let that boil and incorporate together all right I've had this boiling for about five minutes and it seems to be pretty well incorporated the next step to do is to start to add your gelatin one packet at a time and whisk it thoroughly in before adding the next packet [Music] when you first add the gelatin it starts to clump off but then as you mix it in you will see that it will fully incorporate that's when you should add the next packet of gelatin [Music] once you've added and incorporated all four packets of gelatin you can go ahead and add your packet of jell-o mix [Applause] now you're going to want to let this cook for about five to eight minutes until it fits to a rolling boil so that is what a rolling boil looks like and as you guys can see it is super stringy and it has changed consistency it is like really really goopy really sticky really thick turn your heat down to low and then we'll get ready to put this into a mold next you can go ahead and fill each of the individual bear molds be sure to continue mixing your mixture to ensure that it doesn't get clumped up it's also good to check on your mixture every few minutes because it can burn and you don't want your mixture to burn [Music] [Music] once you get it completely filled go ahead and use a paper towel to clean up the edges as much as you can as you guys can see I was a little messy but this should be fine I'm gonna go ahead and pop this in the refrigerator you want to keep it in there for about 30 minutes they should become firm after that and we'll go ahead and try these out all right I just got these out of the refrigerator now let's go ahead and plot these out and then we were taste [Music] or actually guys so here are my gummy beggars they actually turned out really cute I don't know if you guys can see that but it is a little bear Cheers I can't taste wheat in it at all it kind of just tastes like jello but they're like really firm you're definitely the right consistency they're coming I would describe it as like a gummy candy it's very sweet [Music] not weedy at all these are really really good if you liked this video give it a thumbs up leave a comment down below on what else I should make as far as cannabis edibles go because honestly taste wise I would go cannabutter cookies and then this cannabis coconut oil gummies as far as taste because these are actually like really good don't taste me at all but yeah this is cannabis gummy bears hope you guys make these because these are good and subscribe to my channel because I normally do green and we do videos every single week I'll see you guys around for whatever Shoni activity or video I come up with for next time boom you have some fun eating these companies for a while see ya [Music] [Music]", "vqU2v-FzAjE": "hello my name is Steve Green I'm a medical marijuana patient in the state of Michigan I wanted to tell you a little bit about my story and how cannabis saved my life in 2006 I was diagnosed with epilepsy I began having seizures that were uncontrollable and went on a regimen of pharmaceutical medications with doctor and neurology care between eight and twelve different anti epileptic pharmaceuticals none that would control the seizures during that time with the seizures came Falls and other injuries those other injuries resulted in other medications before I knew it it felt like a pyramid effect with one medication after another one medication to offset the side effects of another one medication to cover up the effects of another to boost the effects of another at one point I was on thirty prescription pills a day and things were not getting better for me they were getting worse and I was still having seizures uncontrollably that's when I went to my doctor my doctor recommended that I try the medical marijuana at that point I went out I got to medical marijuana and I had a seizure I smoked some medical marijuana it helped with those muscle spasms it helped with the cramps the pain it helped with I think relaxing my brain and and helping recover from the effects of having a grandma'll tonic-clonic seizure so I was excited about that I continued to try it but smoking marijuana did not stop my seizures what I did end up finding is through time I continued trying tinctures edibles and other products different combinations different strains and eventually I found the combination that worked for me and since 2011 late November I have not had a seizure at all I'm on no pharmaceutical pills I take no other prescriptions other than medical marijuana they use cannabis therapeutically these are my medical records from 2006 to current as you can see I had many ER visits from seizures countless tests I'll read a few things here from my medical record mr. green does not like taking pills he would prefer a more natural way to deal with pain he uses tumeric group to help control his seizures another one here he has been relying heavily on medical marijuana for his care he is using compounds and juicing the buds and drinking it on a regular basis he reports that this has been able to control his seizures and a portion of his pain using this technique the form of medicine that I use as I said is not a smokeable marijuana the form of medicine I use is this an AM dose and a PM dose this dose here contains 600 milligrams of CBD this dose here contains approximately 600 milligrams of THC this is an a.m. dose this is a PM dose I often get asked how does it get to there at a health food store you can buy empty capsules the empty capsules simply pull apart you would use your cannabis oil Rick Simpson oil you would insert your dosage close and secure the pill again this is made from the marijuana medical marijuana it's not smoked it's eaten an inaudible form and it prevents my seizures I do not suffer from seizures today because of medical marijuana and an oral form I hope this helps some patients to understand what I've went through and how I got to where I'm at today thank you for your time and please share this with anyone that has epilepsy", "lD74d-S2dH0": "[Music] thank you for having us in your home today sandy complete pleasure thrilled you're here I just want to start off with the story about your mother and where you are today yeah it's my mom's 91 I can tell you she's the mom of three grandma to five she has been on her own for a really long time it's also important to note that she's never had an operation never a bit of medication until 89 90 then we started to see a change so now fast forward she's big diagnosed with dementia [Music] so now she's taking medicine for anxiety and things like that that the medical community looks at to not end dementia because we're told that they can't end it but simply to control it I can honestly say that any of the meds I haven't noticed like a physical improvement or that much even of a an emotional or mental improvement so sandy can you explain to us a little bit more about dementia for families out there that don't understand what dementia is and how bad it really got first was the memory loss then it was the grouchiness then it was the confusion then she was suicidal and that was the worst ringing up and saying I don't belong on the planet I really want to go she decided to go missing one afternoon for two and a half hours oh my gosh and the last thing she said before she slammed the phone down was I'm gonna go walk in front of a bus or a car so luckily chatting with you you said I want your mom to try this do you remember yeah I do I grabbed the bottle of CBD had her over the next day spent the day here at home with me just because I wanted to monitor within 45 minutes she came to me and said what's going on and I thought oh then I thought something might be going a bit astray so she noticed a difference within 45 minutes she did I said what's going on mum and it was like strain melted from her face she put her hands up on her temples and she's walking around saying I can think I can think that's so and I still got shivers even just telling you we all looked around and said what can you think what are you thinking shows I can think clearly I'm here I'm here for lunch you have to realize when she was in the hospital she barely knew her name I've got to say that the side effect that we've seen is our happiness and massive relief at how normal mum is again how she can think how she can complete a sentence she can knit again she can sew again that's where the CBD clawed her back but it was almost instantaneously it was like talking to a 65 year old energetic person but that's why our gratitude to you is off the charts thank you very very much for devoting your life to doing this for helping so many and on a very personal level to me for giving me my mom back well thank you so much [Music]", "S0Ky5jO16oQ": "hello rso srsa and today today 17 and 63 now this

though at least we got that going for us I am so on today's review we've got a two-part review on edibles being able to eat marijuana you know okay so I've got a high tolerance when it comes to smoking grass I don't know if it's a gift or a curse or somewhere in between take it for what it's worth you know what I mean but um the main thing on this that I was going to get to this is a two-parter crunch all this into one video I'm going to have like four videos coming out today um so I did a I made brownies I made brownies that were made from I think eleven and a half grams of wheat I'm gonna put their clips of these videos in with this they're not going to have the typical backdrop in all the you know theatrics I think I'm in my top hat in a t-shirt so it's you got to bear with me on that but needless to say yeah try brownies I made him with like eleven and a half grams of flour and maybe like three grams of concentrate and wow those brownies were intense they weren't intense they just knocked me out they pretty much just did me in yeah that's pretty cool so um what had happen was to further explain what's going to take place in this video um so I made these brownies and I ate a brownie and I waited about 45 minutes as I was like edibles you know most things that you eat in you know edible form take about 40 minutes to kick in give or take 30 minutes 40 minutes 50 minutes so somewhere in that ballpark I had decided that the brownies were not going to work they won't do in the job so I went and I ate browning it wasn't a big mistake but it had the equivalency knock-back of eating close to 1/8 weed and no yeah that actually did me pretty good and uh you know later on in the video here's you could see me plastered to the couch I tried to record several videos more serious but I just kept laughing at myself so on the review for blood brownies I would say they definitely work eating marijuana works considerably oh that being stated the other half of this review I got some RSO some Rick Simpson oil professional-grade rumor has it this is the [ __ ] that cures cancer that comes in a syringe future bounty projects will be made with this and I will tell you why so okay I eat a lot of weed in the course of a week and it didn't bother me per se but like I I felt like I always had to taste the weed on me like in a different sense like I could always smell like the bacon brownies of weed brownies in my clothes you know what I mean because I hear baking them in my kitchen so that I don't know I mean there's some if I had a choice yeah and I'm not against the taste of weed but it was a very overpowering weed taste so I'm definitely gonna try to do it with RSO and um yeah you know we'll do some sugar cookies or something for the Yule celebration or whatever y'all celebrate I know Hanukkah started sometime I didn't get the memo um sorry about that respect but um I'll try to catch these holidays as I find out about them I know in Christmas is though it's uh I think I'll be doing a winter solstice special maybe on 12-21-12 around 12 21 18 sorry yes we'll do a winter solstice special and um yeah maybe eat some cookies or something so yeah the my personal review on the the baking edibles is that it's it's 100% I give to the point I've been eating this REI so almost regularly it's not something I thought I'd be doing but I do kind of like the body bows unfortunately I've been working out here lately and when I get done working out I'm not sure if it's it's like after I'm done working out and I go to that like sitting mellow out stage I feel achy as [ __ ] like trying to get up and I feel like completely blasted and worn and I don't know if it's the working out or if it's the combination of the the stuff I'll be eating yeah but I yeah that's my honest opinion if y'all get a chance I would definitely try making edibles if you don't do that sort of thing yeah decarboxylated my weed I think it was it like 200 degrees for an hour and 15 minutes maybe something like that um I did try to put it in a turkey bag I saw some things on there the turkey bag did work but it didn't really I don't know like it held us the head off with this I think it's going to smell no matter how you do it but I was trying to contain the flavors in the essence in in the material you know what I mean I didn't want all the good [ __ ] to bake away and maybe like 15 10 15 minutes after putting weed in aluminum and then in that in a turkey bag the turkey bag inflated very much and as soon as I grabbed it and flipped it it went flat so all my smell and all my flavor went out of it you know what I mean um so next time I do this I will definitely try maybe making a butter or something because like I say I don't mind the taste of it but it's eating 1/8 away today or close to it you know what I mean it's a lot of uh a lot of weed to eat and I'm not I don't know that I like that personally yeah yeah so whatever your folks get into this fine Friday I hope it's good I hope it's entertaining and from the bottom of my heart I hope you all do it safe because though times are tough out there it's Christmas people be struggling to get deals or just get around you know what I mean but that you all enjoy it's been an absolute pleasure from one stoner to the next Steve Stevenson over and out thank you folks couldn't do it without you peace hey Digital collective this is Steve Stevenson with Maryland marijuana review what's happening folks I know this is a bit of an impromptu video from a location that actually I'm waiting for my pets to come and attack me yeah my cat staring at me right now wondering what is going on so I'm gonna make this video quick about five or six minutes ago I finished making brownies I made brownies from 11 grams of marijuana ranging in the 23 percent THC range to knows a 3 or 2 or 3 grams of of premium concentrate yes all things considered these brownies should be fairly bonus we'll see how they go I wanted to start this video as a tutorial or maybe I'll put it somewhere in the middle of a video but um yeah this is the first time I've ever made brownies like this I've eaten brownies like this but they didn't do anything gotta be honest so yeah if this works I'll try to get a full tutorial or at least give my honest opinion on how well this project worked how well it came together again you folks enjoy it's been a pleasure Steve Stevenson over and out enjoy folks peace hey what's going on yes recap on what was going down it worked for sure ISM [ __ ] plastered to the couch I can be honest with you spiderwebs ain't got [ __ ] on this man spider-man [ __ ] with me", "g3cz5uWsSOg": "in English first of all I have to say thank you for whatever No that you are or by third I'm a daughter of war better and what admires with you particularly is the pure super system that you can parity that you don't stop that there is nothing to stop you I read a lot about the fewer picture but the only about curing diabetes - or both fact I would like to find out from you what are going well have we've had a magnificent results treating diabetics many people who came to me with terminal cancers were also diabetic and quite often the reason they were dyed eggs was cause it was caused from some of the pharmaceutical medications that their doctors had given them but what we see with diabetics you see this it's not just about lowering your insulin intake in many cases people get on the oil they no longer need the insulin in a very short time their need for insulin is completely gone but there are some cases of both type 1 and type 2 that we've had reports where all that you do was lower their insulin intake now you know this still when you look at what the oil does for the human body for a diabetic this is the most beneficial substance that you could take because it undoes the damage from this disease the nerve damage it helps with your circulation and diabetes so longer had to get their feet and their legs cut off from diabetic infections because it's our the wood healed very effectively and very quickly that's something that medical system says they can't do but the UL Han so I recommend strongly anybody with diabetes try to go and I don't think you will regret it", "erH14bNZP74": "okay now the audio should be coming through all right hey everybody so this is an attempt for me to start to try to connect with you guys uh a lot more than i than i have been and i hope this live stream is actually working i normally have a totally different hardware setup um for how i would do anything for youtube but it looks like my mic's coming through i'm just gonna hope and pray that it is working um so hey everybody i just wanted to get on here and just do a couple of um updates about what we're doing at curious about cannabis and yeah just share a little bit about kind of where things are headed and to let you know that in general i'm going to try to start doing live streams um beyond you may have seen previous live streams that i've done where i just play old uh podcast videos and so i'd gotten some requests to um you know sort of set up a 24-hour stream of of podcast episodes and i've done that a couple of times but um i don't have dedicated hardware to run that all the time but beyond that i'm going to try to start doing live streams where i'm just connecting with you talking to you directly as i'm able to so we'll see how it goes so first of all i want to say that um you know those of you that follow us on youtube if you don't already follow us on instagram i really recommend you connect with us on there because i do make um live streams and posts on stories and stuff a little more frequently there and i honestly share most of my news on instagram because that's where a lot of the kind of cannabis industry is is hanging out but i'm going to try to change that um to let you know a little bit of what's been going on and why there haven't been some posts in a while um i've been teaching quite a lot so our um our curious about cannabis workshop series launched just a couple of weeks ago for this year and i used to teach these workshops locally in person here in oregon for years since at least since 2015 and then of course 2020 hit and had to kind of reevaluate everything in life as so many people have and so we made a really big pivot towards virtual education events and i was very very skeptical and cynical at first but it seems like it's going well so now i'm really really excited about it because it's enabled me to connect with people all over the united states and in canada mexico all sorts of other places and to really have the chance to dive into all sorts of details that i can't get into in podcast episodes or you know kind of casual conversation and um yeah so our first cohort um is underway with that workshop series and we just had a really great um guest lecture from dr anna schwabe it did her phd uh dissertation work looking at genetic chemical and organoleptic variation among uh cannabis flower super super super interesting stuff and she was gracious enough to stay a little extra and talk with my students and myself and answer questions just really really great experience next week we've got kyle boyer coming in to talk about lab testing murphy murray is going to be coming in to give us lab tours and talk about extraction we've also got dr arno hazakamp who's um you know basically one of the first researchers to present this idea of chemovar or chemical variety he's just published tons of research on cannabis since he started studying it professionally in 2001 i believe a major name in cannabis science research but he's going to be guest lecturing in a few weeks and then we also have dr linda clumpers who's a clinical pharmacologist that'll also be coming in towards the end of the workshop and guest teaching so just tons of great guests that have been really really gracious and giving me their time and energy to help make the workshop awesome so that's all been going great if you are interested and you didn't get in on this first cohort i will be opening up the next session uh the next session's registration window is going to open next week so if you go to cacpodcast.com learn you can find information about those workshops and some of our other educational events that we have going on i think they're extremely unique compared to other stuff that's out there and i've had students tell me that you know ones that have taken a lot of the available cannabis education stuff that's currently out there they tell me that there's nothing like what i'm doing out there and that the content that we're going into goes far more in depth and one student told me today it just gets in the nitty-gritty of all of the science of all this sort of stuff and kind of shatters some maybe some preconceived notions you may have even learned in other um cannabis education uh courses and stuff like that a student told me today that he's just got uh more and more questions and i was like well that's a great sign that you're learning um so yeah those workshops have been really really fun and so they are intensive they're six weeks long each um but if you're looking for like the really intense cannabis science you know course um uh check it out curious about cannabis workshop series there's two parts it's 12 weeks series total and each workshop is six weeks we also have a beginner's workshop that is launching in april um the session first session starts on april 9th and if you or someone you know is totally new to cannabis i mean starting out at ground zero basically this workshop is made for them it runs a month long and it covers all the general basics that you could expect you know uh addressing you know just what is cannabis what are all these cannabis products what are these terms that are being used and dispensaries and stuff and how do we think about those terms how does it connect to science or doesn't connect to science in a lot of cases um and how does cannabis and other sorts of cannabis products in general how do they affect the body and are they safe those are some of the basic questions that we go through um it's only a hundred bucks like i said it runs a month um in general the way i see it is if it can save somebody from buying products that aren't actually in line with what they're looking for then they will probably save quite a bit of money that would pay for the the beginner's workshop many times over um so yeah if you know anybody or if you run a dispensary or anything like that um check this workshop out and and please send people there i'm hoping to get the cohort um built out um by the first week of april and we'll be off to the races um some other things i wanted to talk about that we have going on that i am excited about um so if you're into the crypto world then you've probably heard of nfts if you're not in the crypto world you've probably heard of nfts because people are starting to write articles about them quite a bit um nfts non-funchable tokens you know are basically digital assets um the best example to describe them would be like in a video game if you're buying uh um some sort of item in a video game uh that's essentially an nft um although up until now they haven't really been on blockchain and if you're not familiar with what blockchain is it's essentially just a really nice ledger that keeps track of the flow of information and digital goods so cryptocurrency got really really popular and operates on blockchain but uh blockchain is a lot more than cryptocurrency and nfts are really highlighting that and so some common examples of nfts there are like virtual trading cards like mlb and nba have both started producing digital trading cards um as nfts um additionally there are kind of these virtual worlds that you can join where you can buy land in these virtual worlds and develop uh virtual structures and things like people build digital art galleries for instance to showcase their art people build um uh arcades even casinos all sorts of stuff uh decentraland is the most um probably most popular example of of these kind of like metaverse systems but they utilize nfts in all sorts of ways like i mentioned they have art galleries and people post their their digital art as nfts in those systems but also nfts can be applied to things like contracts and intellectual property and i'll be really excited when people start to understand the value in that because nfts are huge for content creators and artists but they're also going to be really huge for all business i mean the the audit trail aspect of blockchain is unparalleled i mean it's just something that if you read enough about it it'll click why blockchain is not going away and how more and more we're going to see more things get on the blockchain and likely we'll see a future of the internet where you have the on-chain internet and you have an off-chain internet and the off-chain internet is sort of uh this more murky side of the internet that's doesn't have this kind of level of audit trail and everything uh more what we're used to right now and then you'll have the on-chain internet where everything is tracked and there's no way to really uh fudge things which might freak people out um regarding like anonymity but the great thing about blockchain and cryptocurrency and everything is that uh even though these audit trails exist um there's still plenty of ways to stay anonymous in using things on blockchain so when people see transaction histories they don't see your name they see this long string of random characters that represent your wallet um and the other wallets you know that things have been moved to so it can be used for anonymous you know internet uh transactions and that sort of thing um or not and so anyway if you're seeing all this hype about nfts that's kind of what it's about is it's you know showing that blockchain is way more than cryptocurrency and digital assets in general are are starting this move over uh to nfts and it's huge for content creators like myself because it gives us a little more power uh to do very interesting things with our art and um also provide a way for our fans to potentially make money um off of supporting the things they like so with all of that rambling out of the way curious about cannabis has launched our curious about cannabis canna card nfts we have well over 100 of them right now waiting to be released and as far as i'm aware we are the very first um you know company that's producing educational cannabis content in the form of nfts and we're one of the first groups that's making cannabis content all at all as nfts at least in some like systematic formalized way there are people that have made spinoff you know little nfts out of photographs and stuff here and there but you know we're putting together a pretty uh substantial system on how to use our cards and these these can of card nfts they basically look like um pokemon or magic the gathering uh trading cards in a way that's kind of how they're modeled um but they're digital some feature photographs or artwork some feature videos um so some of these cards it's almost like uh you know like in harry potter uh the trading cards that they have um you know the the wizards start talking to them and stuff well these some of these cards you know are kind of video format and kind of have that that feel to them uh where i might be explaining some concept about cannabis or whatever and then the cards themselves have educational information about whatever topic's being represented by the card on there and so these cards are you know they're collectibles uh some of these cards are only minted once so they're literally one of a kind others are minted in groups of like 25 or 50 so that's how you get your commons and your uncommons and your rares but beyond the fact that they're fun little cards that have educational information and they're collectible they're going to have very direct tangible value because we'll also be using these nfts as discounts for merchandise discounts for events and tickets to exclusive events so up until now we've had our patreon and we have a nice little community on there people that have been supporting the podcast and all of the work that we do um and we always you know give out discount codes and stuff to patrons to give them free stuff for discount stuff for instance all of our patrons got into the first uh cohort of the curious about cannabis workshop for free not everybody actually took advantage of the opportunity to take it for free only a couple people did but they had the the opportunity to do that which was an 850 value some of these can of cards uh will have values that um range anywhere from a couple of bucks to two thousand dollars or more um so if you like what curious about cannabis does what we've been doing and how we've grown and you can kind of see how we're evolving then these cards could potentially bring quite a bit of value to you if you're wanting to take a lot of our workshops we also have a ton of self-paced courses that are going to be launching next month that are you know in general is trying to give people as many ways to learn about cannabis as possible but if you're interested in gauging and engaging all of those things um then you may want to consider trying to get one of these nfts um especially some of the rare ones and you won't necessarily have to buy them um we will have opportunities like uh giveaways um plus there's a kind of a whole game associated with these can of cards that i'm i'm not going to go into completely yet because we're still rolling it all out and everything in due time but essentially there will be um challenges that you can complete some are free some not the challenges that you can complete that will give you the rights to claim uh certain nfts with higher values you know so for instance if you're wanting to take a workshop you don't have 850 bucks to spend on getting into the you know the month and a half workshop well another approach you could take is trying to complete one of these challenges that may give you access to one of the rare can of cards that you can use to get into a workshop for free that kind of thing and so you know you may spend however much uh to get through the challenge like for instance one of the challenges will be you know taking a self-paced course on the learning platform which in general would be like 15 bucks or something you know you go do that but you also get access to one of these nfts which then gives you access to other stuff so in general it's not going to be for everyone but for those that are kind of into crypto and do like what curious about cannabis is doing and you want to see more of what we're capable of next we're kind of taking things in baby steps as we kind of organically grow here but if you're you know really really interested in in these workshops and everything um keep an eye out for announcements about the nfts and and what we're going to be doing with those if you want to learn more and kind of see some of these nfts you can go to openc.io so that's o p e n s e a dot io and that's the marketplace uh that where we'll initially be launching these and if you search for can of cards are curious about cannabis can of cards because there's a couple people have tried to do some spin-off kind of can of card stuff but as far as i'm aware we're the first and we certainly have the most uh nfts that are called can of cards but you may come across one or two others that use that name but if you search for curious about cannabis you'll find us and you can see uh some of the uh cards that we've put together um and and kind of get a feel for those you should see the one with the video embedded in it there's also a couple of signed cards um i have my signature on them um all sorts of stuff on there and we're going to be collaborating with artists and photographers and stuff in the canvas space to highlight um other people's work and in general um you know going through this process we've learned a lot so we're also gonna be helping cannabis companies get their own nfts made so if that's something you're interested in if you're an artist in the space or if you are if this is all interesting to you and you want to dabble in it um you know that's something that uh you can reach out to us about and um you know depending on the situation i might be able to to give you a little assistance there or we can collaborate and get your art on a can of card and the goal with that is that we'd be uh splitting any revenue that that comes from the cards so it's not like you'll be giving me my giving me your art and then just being thrown to the wayside uh anyone that we collaborate with on these projects um you know we plan on trying to split things pretty much right down the middle uh in most cases um so if you're not wanting to take on the infrastructure of nfts and you've got cannabis related art and that sort of thing that that might be useful reach out and we'll see you know what makes sense to do um yeah with that um another thing i wanted to announce is that it you know like i said at the beginning in general i'm gonna try to do more live streams um they'll be very casual kind of like this you know i don't even have my green screen uh my chroma key stuff running so you just see my green screen behind me you know these live streams will probably take place usually right after i'm done teaching and so i usually have a lot on my mind then but um yeah so be on the lookout for these live streams one thing i would like to talk about right now is delta eight thc a big subject um that is really really getting hyped especially after i think a new york times article came out not too long ago about it but i was recently interviewed on a podcast called brave new weed and um on that episode i think it's their most recent episode you can go look it up and listen if you like um but uh and we talked all about how delta 8 thc is generally made um how i'm getting a little thing here telling me my mic's too loud sorry if i've been yelling at you didn't mean to um you know basically how delta h thc is made how what we see in labs when we're testing these products um what sort of safety issues might be involved and what consumers need to know before they consume them and some of the main takeaways so once again go look up brave new weed and listen to the whole conversation i was also stoked that um apparently raphael machula heard the episode um and and sent an email out um you know um saying that he liked it and everything i was super super excited about that um one thing i need to do in one of these live streams is i um i had a back and forth with dr mushullum last year and just asked him some questions through email and stuff i would like to interview him on the podcast at some point but he's not always in great health and so it's that can be challenging but at some point i need to read his responses on my questions i think that might be fun but in that episode some of the takeaways and i'll just take a couple of minutes here and then i'm going to jump off but delta 8 thc molecularly exactly the same as delta nine thc except that a double bond is located in a slightly different place within one of the rings of the molecule and that is exactly the same same chemical formula um same 2d structure just like i said there's a double bond in a different place and for the chemists out there if you're familiar with the carbon numbering of the thc molecule i don't even have to explain this to you but the double bond in delta 9 thc is at the nine location uh the double bond and delta eight thcs in the eight location um and this is stuff you can see very clearly in the curious about cannabis book um i don't market myself enough so those of you that may not know uh there is a curious about cannabis book yeah you can find it on amazon barnes noble cacpodcast.combook but we actually talk about in that book how uh you know how chemicals are numbered where the delta nine comes from how delta nine compares to delta eight etcetera etcetera um but delta eight is basically the same as delta nine with the exception of that location of a double bond in the molecule but that small change results in fairly big differences in how the chemicals affect the body delta 8 seems to have similar receptor targets as delta 9 with weaker affinity which um kind of fits what people commonly talk about with delta eight that it's uh not as potent as delta nine in terms of intoxication potential and that sort of thing um and there's been a fair amount of research on how delta 8 could be used um therapeutically because it was looked at for a while as being this possible alternative to delta 9 um that wouldn't get people as high but you know they could still get a lot of the potential therapeutic benefit like anti-nausea effects um possibly even anxiety relieving effects a lot of the same stuff that has been known about thc so that sounds great right you've got a molecule where you're getting a lot of the benefit of delta 9 thc you know if you're not getting as high and it's available in the hemp market so um what's not to love well the problem there are multiple problems one there's a legal issue and we'll get to that in a second um but there's also a safety issue a lot of people assume that delta eight thc is extracted from cannabis for the most part no that's that's not the case now that's not to say that people are not extracting delta athc they certainly are but let's put this into context most of the delta 8 thc products that are on the market are in the hemp market generally you know i've tested i don't know how many samples of cannabis i've tested in the lab thousands upon thousands um delta thc even in thc rich cannabis cultivars shows up in extremely trace concentrations fractions of weight percents when you start talking about cbd dominant cannabis it's orders of magnitude lower um and delta 8 thc in general is kind of an artifact of delta 9 thc because it's it's not enzymatically produced by the plant it's uh the plant produces thca that decarboxylates to thc and then um over time that double bond moves around in the molecule and you've got a little bit of delta 8 thc in there so in general if you wanted to extract if you wanted to make a delta 8 thc product just from extraction and refinement you're talking about having to process absurd amounts of biomass of hip biomass that would just cost probably millions of dollars in between the the extraction process and the refinement process and everything to get um to where you've got some nice bulk delta 8 thc and clearly based on the pricing of delta 8 thc products people are not spending that much money to make it excuse me so what's going on well the way that most delta athc is produced is uh primarily from cbd cbd is isolated out of out of hemp that cbd is put into acidic conditions um usually with acetic acid or sulfuric acid and it's kind of left in a sort of broth like that for a while and cbd will change into delta nine thc and then eventually the delta nine thc will change into delta eight thc and you know you generally um through testing and other things you you know kind of follow that trajectory and um pull the you know stop the process once you've got quite a lot of delta eight thc in there and then often that product then gets um you know solvent purged out they'll then distill it and refine it into these delta eight thc distillates and it's that term distillate i think really confuses people because when you call something at distillate it hides its origin um because you could distill uh raw cannabis extracts you could distill a synthetically derived cannabis product in this cannabinoid product in this case and it's all called distillate and i think that's kind of what's delayed people cluing in on the fact that most delta athc on the market is synthetically derived um if you want to don't want to call it synthetic it's at least semi-synthetic i mean they're taking one chemical and making another chemical and the problem with that is that you get um well the chemical synthesis process is not perfect and so you get unintended by-products and if you listen to the curious about cannabis podcast i made a really silly uh kind of promotional thing for one of the episodes uh that was kind of like a game show and it kind of poked fun at this problem that people were trying to pass off delta 8 thc is an extract and then when they go and look under the hood they see all of these weird uh peaks representing um on the on sort of the analytical graph that would be called a chromatogram they see all these mystery quote unquote mystery peaks that represent these chemical byproducts thc isomers that we don't know what they are xothc delta 10 thc whatever thc most of these things we don't have reference standards for it's very hard to solidly identify so not only is most delta 8 thc on the market being synthetically produced but depending on the producer it can be very impure and depending on the analytical lab testing it um this may not be always obvious labs vary in quality quite a lot depending on where you are and what regulations there are and stuff and so i remember back in the day when i was doing cannabis testing in oregon before there were any regulations whatsoever there were labs we were competing against that were lumping together delta 9 delta 8 cbn anything that was related to thc they'd lump it all together just call it thc same sort of thing happens with delta eight thc depending on the lab sometimes uh they'll take all of these mystery peaks and just add them all up and say yeah that's pretty much delta atc um so unless you're actually looking at the raw chromatogram that the lab produces sometimes even the producer may not know how impure their products are um so just to summarize delta a thc mostly synthetic um there's a chemical byproduct problem we don't know what these chemicals are exactly that are kind of hitching a ride and those uh byproducts can range from two or three to five percent of the final product to as much as 10 15 20 30 i've seen delta 8 uh distillates that were really only about 30 percent pure with huge isomer peaks i didn't know what they were um and you also have the fact that some producers are manipulating test results i mean if you have a pdf editor you can go through and change what a pdf says and in the hip market that you know where the uh the testing world is in some places kind of still the wild wild west um that can be more or less easier to do so there's several major problems um some of which are specific to delta eight and some of which aren't um so you have all that then you have the legal issue that i mentioned so is delta athc legal uh synthetic delta athc is as far as we can tell not legal um and this is not legal advice i'm not an attorney i don't have legal training blah blah blah disclaimers um but the dea has clarified that synthetically derived tetrahydrocannabinol meaning delta 9 thc and all of its isomers the thc class of compounds of which there are at least 30 or more that we know of all of those are controlled thus illegal in a very big way um the pushback from the hemp industry is folks say well but delta hthc is naturally occurring in hemp it is it is a natural phytocannabinoid and yes that is true but these products are not hemp derived they're derived from cbd which is derived from hemp but that is not the same and there's a big difference between producing a an herbal extract and producing a synthetic chemical regardless of whether that chemical occurs in nature or not if you have synthesized it it is a synthetic chemical and there are certain safety purity issues that come along with that that i've already highlighted so that's why this is kind of a no-brainer from the fed's perspective in the united states of course it's illegal is there much enforcement on this no are people taking advantage of this kind of lag of enforcement hell yes they are to the degree that there are companies that are spraying delta 8 thc on hemp flour to produce smokable flour that will get people high this is such a short-term vision i don't understand i do understand because human nature they're always going to be those people out there that are going to do stupid things um what all i will say sort of my mantra lately on some of this because i do a lot of consulting around cannabis quality and compliance and what i will say is that a lack of enforcement is not evidence of a lack of violation so just because the dea hasn't come after you just because the fda hasn't come after you um it doesn't mean that you're not doing something wrong and it also doesn't mean that they're not going to come after you later and possibly even retroactively apply um laws later so you may think you got away with it five years from now and they can still come down on you because a lot of these delta 8 thc products are very public a lot of these companies are very public about what they're doing and trying to rely on the gray area for safety i think that's incredibly stupid to do i'm sorry if that offends you um but just coming out of i i don't like the laws around cannabis and cannabinoids as they are i would love to see cannabis descheduled completely um and just totally take care of this issue but we're stuck with things the way they are for now and right now the way the controlled substances act is set up this is the way it is this is the feds have been pretty clear on how they read the law there's not really room for interpretation here uh even though a lot of people may argue that there is i really don't think there is uh in general you've always got to read laws as conservatively as possible because that's how they're going to be applied and interpreted not as liberally as possible that's just wishful thinking um so are delta athc products legal technically on a federal level no they're not not in terms of the controlled substances act um will people continue to get away with uh selling delta eight thc products for a while probably um i don't see indication that the dea is going to take action uh immediately but who knows um and i kind of expect that they will take a couple of bold moves at some point to make a statement that will kind of help balance the market a little bit likewise with the fda our cbd products legal that's a real gray area because the food drugs and cosmetics act says you can't put drugs in food or supplements cbd is technically a drug the fda has said in some of their warning letters to companies that they you know that's how they interpret the rules and even though they are continuing to take comments and and try to figure out how they're going to regulate the cbd industry technically according to the way the law is right now um cbd products sold as supplements and foods pet food cosmetics those are all technically they technically contain drugs once again i don't like that i don't like that that's the way the law is i think that lawmakers when they were writing the latest version of the farm bill and all that they should have been a lot more careful with their language so that we didn't have to deal with this problem and now congress is kind of trying to fix it by trying to get new legislation passed that would make exceptions for cbd uh to get it recognized as a dietary supplement and a signed uh grass status generally regarded as safe but right now that's not the case um it's just there's this lack of enforcement issue but like i said lack of enforcement is not indicative of a lack of violation and the fda is very careful about indicating in every warning letter that they send that just because they don't bring up a certain issue in a warning letter doesn't mean that that company has not violated other things they haven't mentioned this is all to say you know to those of you out there wanting to get into the cannabis industry want to get into to hemp and everything just really got to be careful and recognize that things are changing a lot and there's always hype around new laws there's so much hype around the farm bill and what it's going to do for the cbd industry that was just unfounded um and you know like i said you've really got to read laws conservatively because that's how they're going to be interpreted and applied most of the time a great example of this related to the farm bill is the issue over total thc is the reference to point three percent thc is that uh delta nine thc like the farm bill you know defines it or is it total thc that it incorporates thca the way that i read the farm bill it seems unambiguously that it is certainly total thc because the law as written states that that thc value has to be reported um as a post decarboxylation value which means total thc now does it explicitly say total thc no it doesn't have to though post decarboxylation that is a scientific term meaning after the carboxylic acid functional group has been removed from the molecule okay well um how do you calculate that like if you're doing liquid chromatography where you're actually seeing thca and thc separately the way you do it it's scientific mathematical thing divide the molecular mass of thca and thc you end up with a correction uh factor you find out you know thc is uh 87.7 percent the weight of thca the difference between those molecules the only difference between them is thc does not have the carboxylic acid functional group like uh thca does so you're just accounting for the loss of weight from basically that co2 molecule popping off of thca i don't see this as controversial i don't see this open to interpretation and i think when this gets challenged in courts um that's the way it's going to be read i think it's pretty clear that if you take the literal word of the farm bill and um you know as it stands right now title vii and the language of the controlled substances act which was amended when the farm bill passed to provide allowances for him it always brings you back to this post-decarboxylation requirement which means that it doesn't matter if um your product you know uh would would pass scrutiny under 0.3 delta 9 thc you've always got to assume the thca is going to be decarboxylated and and then add those values together so the actual formula just to make it clear for anyone that's watching or listening you just take thc your thc value and then you add it to uh you know put in parentheses your thca value times 0.877 which represents that 87.7 percent molecular difference and so you correct your thca for decarboxylation then you add it to thc um there's no other way to do it i mean that's that's all it is now one uh aspect to this that um folks may argue as well what about the fact that decarboxylation is never perfect so does doesn't the correction factor of 0.877 um exaggerate the decarboxylation potential i don't know i mean sure decarboxylation rates will vary for sure is it possible to totally decarboxylate thca it depends it depends on what you're doing with it and as i just pointed out with um like the delta eight thc issue i mean people are making are getting into synthetic semi-synthetic chemistry and everything and when you're getting into that world you kind of do have to make assumptions that people are going to completely decarboxylate and take that into account and i'll also point out the usda final rules clarified this issue and even put the formula in there so it's clear that the feds are reading this the same way that i'm reading it uh at least from my perspective that's that's the way it seems to me they haven't indicated in any way that i'm off as far as you know how i'm reading those words and i'm so you i'm very accustomed to reading legislation like i said i've just worked in quality management compliance for so long uh you just get used to understanding um you know how words are being used in laws and what they mean and how you know the writer that was writing the law you know what they were uh you know trying to get across and so it makes this kind of quick and easy if you're used to it but i can understand those that like don't read laws very very commonly they may not know certain things to look for nuances to to check and everything but you know uh the reading of of the farm bill and the control substances act makes it pretty clear that 0.3 percent uh value refers to um total what we often call an industry total thc or post decarboxylated thc um it is what it is uh i do think that when the farm bill is um revised i think that the definition of thc will be changed to represent all tetrahydrocannabinols all thcs all isomers it'll close the delta eight loophole um i'm not saying i want this to happen i'm saying this is the practical outcome that i expect based on my experience and based on my scientific knowledge and and other you know industry knowledge about all this stuff i don't really see it going a different direction but we'll see but i i expect that will change the definition of thc to represent all tetrahydrocannabinols and i think they will also bump up the 0.3 limit as a compromise with the industry they'll probably say okay you want us to bump up the 0.3 limit fine we'll do it however now more things count as thc and so it's it's gonna be kind of a double-edged sword uh sort of thing but um it's really not gonna affect things too much because these compounds are in such trace quantities uh concentrations like like delta thc for instance um uh and it's possible they could even change it to cannabinols which would also include cbn but i don't i kind of don't think they're going to do that i think they'll define it just as tetrahydrocannabinols they'll raise the 0.3 limit maybe to 0.5 or maybe to 1. i kind of don't think they'll go as high as 1. i think they'll they may go to 0.5 or 0.6 i think has been advocated for um but then a lot of these regulatory gray areas will be gone i also think that the next her revision of the farm bill if legislation doesn't pass beforehand uh there'll be something in there that clarifies for the fda how to think about these compounds whether we're going to give them treat them as generally regarded as safe uh how do we interpret these things in context of the food drugs and cosmetics act and when all of that happens which will happen in the next two years i think if i have my timing right how i'm thinking about this all of this ambiguity goes away and then i think we will see a new era of enforcement uh by the dea and the fda throughout um the hemp industry and all all cannabis um markets to some degree depending on how each state's laws are set up to protect themselves um yeah i don't know i could be totally totally wrong and that would be cool if i was but um i kind of don't think i will be um so um i did a recent podcast episode on the curious about cannabis podcast with david heldruth jr which i haven't gotten on youtube yet i need to catch up it takes longer to get things processed for youtube so that's just the way it is but we talk all about these issues and kind of how to prepare for the future of cannabinoid markets in the united states particularly and some of his companies have been working with the dea and the fda for quite a while um to understand how they're interpreting things and that conversation just told me that everything that i've been deciphering from all this seems to be on point based on the messaging he's hearing from the dea and the fda um so i don't know that ramble is just basically to say hey be careful out there and don't assume that just because you're getting away with something now that you will forever and it's generally not a good idea to build a business model with such short-term thinking in mind and for consumers out there be careful about new products in general um something we talked about in the workshop uh our live classroom session today in our workshop it's about contaminants and how uh as time has gone on you know cannabis flowers killing it in regulated markets as far as um you know being very clean and everything but when you get into extracts and concentrates and products made from extracts and concentrates you just enter a different world and the safety issue is just all over the place because when you think about safety of cannabis products you're not just talking about cannabinoids and terpenes you're talking about chemical byproducts you're talking about additives diluents excipients all sorts of different issues packaging hardware are metals leaching into your extract out of your vape pen i mean there's just a lot that goes in there so i don't know this is a live stream ramble so i just hope this has been helpful um stay safe out there don't assume that just because something is cannabis derived that it's safe it might be um but we got to be careful and hold each other accountable and take care of each other and that's you know as a scientist and an educator that's what i feel my role is here i've spent the better part of this decade the past decade of my life studying canada's products in the lab and getting experience in all sorts of areas of the industry and you know sort of view it as my role now to try to pass on some of these insights things i've learned things you know that i kind of see coming and um hopefully hopefully it's helpful to some of you and hopefully it leads to better outcomes with cannabis or whatever so with all of that said um i hope you enjoyed this live stream um if you haven't already check out our website cacpodcast.com that's curiousaboutcannabispodcast.com cacpodcast.com um you know you can find the podcast episodes there but we also have other stuff learning resources videos access to the courses

that is a very good antidepressant and tends to energize a person but most of the hemp oil I produce comes from indica strains indica strains tend to relax the person and give them more sleep rest and sleep are part of the healing process place the starting material preferably good bud in a plastic container dampen the bud material in the container with the solvent you are using then crush the bud material after the bud has been crushed add more solvent until the material is completely covered I generally use pure naphtha but 99% isopropyl alcohol also works well as a solvent as do many other substances work and stir the contents to let the THC dissolve into the solvent this process takes two to three minutes drain the solvent from the starting material and put it through a coffee filter the solvent now resembles the color of gasoline due to the presence of the hemp oil in the solvent make sure the area where you are going to boil the solvent off is very well ventilated the idea is to carry the fumes away from the boiling solvent to reduce the danger of an explosion or fire special care must be taken to avoid red-hot elements or a spark of any kind that could ignite the fumes from the solvent I have found that an electric rice cooker boils the solvent off very effectively bring the solve an oil mix in the rice cooker to a boil use a fan to carry the fumes from the solvent away as the solvent boils off continue adding more solvent oil mix until it is gone as the level in the boiling pot comes down for the last time add 8 to 10 drops of water since the boiling point of water is much higher than the boiling point of the solvent used this water that was at it allows the solvent to be released as the oil thickens as the last of the solvent is being released it is a good idea to lift the rice cooker and keep the contents in the cooker moving this helps release any remaining solvent and also protects the oil from too much heat at no time should the temperature of the oil go over 290 degrees Fahrenheit gently pour the oil from the rice cooker into a small metal container put this container with the oil into a dehydrator or put the container on a gentle heating device such as a coffee warmer it may take a few hours to evaporate the water off the oil in the end there should be no bubbling or other tivity on the surface of the oil when the oil is hot it is quite runny but as it cools the oil takes on the consistency of a thick grease generally a pound of good hemp bud will produce about two ounces of high-grade oil ingesting this amount of oil over a two to three month

doctor cat scan immediately ENT ten biopsies in my face and in a week I was expecting the phone call in my heart I knew it happened something serious I tried everything injection pills that all you do is have side effects been a pain has gotten to the point I talked to my pastor and I asked him even with my strong faith if I would go to heaven or hell because I couldn't suicide and just make everyone else's life easier because I wasn't who I was I wanted to separate myself first for my family my friends and then I just crawled inside my stuff because there was nothing my husband was doing research on what could possibly help me because all I wanted to do was go to bed sleep be left alone pain took away everything about who I was so my husband talked to me he left me read a lot of information and then he found the compassionate care clinics I walked in here really skeptical with no hope this was there this was it and dr. BRE looked at me and said I can't wait to see you next time Michelle because you are going to have a a smile on your face hello don't know how long it's been since I smiled and now I can honestly say from the bottom of my heart and my soul medical cannibis say Who I am and I think God every day and I will tell whoever I need that they need to come and see dr. berry if this is required in media don't feel hopeless but I did don't wait you do with them my advice comes first of all through your research check it all out you'll know if this is what you need if you have tried prescription meds only to find out you're not who you are on them please do the research and then come see dr. berry it's worth it [Music]", "3CbEI9-Oy0o": "hey folks I just wanted to do a quick video just on a few things that I'm curious about I'm wondering if anybody has any comments to help me learn a little bit further on the subject now so here now CBD oil teaching cannabis hybrid oil as well CBD is legal in Canada so I have stuff that is certified from the government it's it's certified is that it passes all their requirements to be suitable for human consumption safe all that sort of thing and then I have homemade oil CBD oil um made the rick simpson way okay so with that being said I used to do steroids before and this to me reminds me of something synthetic there's been no no water anything I never put nothing in here I peeled back the label because I don't want any problems from the company that provided this but I'm just saying this looks synthetic to me when I hope you guys can't see the the name I guess I'll have to see after but anyways sorry when I look at this this is the stuff I grew up with we would use it for hot knives I mean you can smoke it but it's edible and I'm dealing with something with my throat that is extremely important that I kill it before it gets out of hand and comparing the two it's weird and I'm not it's not a placebo effect they don't believe that it is I just got this stuff when I take it I believe in it so I think maybe it could be part of a placebo but I feel it working when I take this stuff it burns my throat immediately like as in a you know an after effect from a pepper it just kind of sits in your throat almost feels like a scratch you're catching a cold type type feeling which is weird in this stuff here you know you put it on a coffee candy or something feels amazing but you take it on its own you can feel it you know it could be up again a placebo thing but no burning but with this it's always burning I just came to that realization actually making the video because yeah anyways so I just want to know what your guys thoughts are like is this is this real because this it looks synthetic how can one be like this and the other one be like this like how can you get such a difference you know what I mean like I don't know it's almost like wine and water right there's such a difference so is this bleach down wine you know what I'm saying like how can you go from this and you know this stuff like like I said the body stone you'll get from it looking you know thick that stuff is this is over my pillow you know I mean I just don't you see the floor but I'm serious look how thick that is and then this one here it's like it put water in it anyways you know I don't know enough about this stuff to really you know have a ironclad theory but I want to hear what other people's comments are I would appreciate that very much if I've got a friend that has a website marijuana beignet it's got cannabis news and supplies and and I guess he's gonna try and post this video on there if he can but I appreciate your support if you can just give me some comments it's not necessarily about the likes and the views but it's just about some insight so that anybody watching can learn and I can also learn to like this looks synthetic to me so are we even getting what we're supposed to be getting when we're trust in the government rules I mean the government's rules I shouldn't be against the government because they're new to this as well so it's not their fault if if this is different than what we're really supposed to be getting other than the fact that they're supposed to be screening for all that stuff but with them like did they hire a hippie that's been growing for 60 years and knows his stuff like the back of his hand or is it people in a lab that are saying well this is the same effect this is the exact same thing you get so they're creating it in a lab I don't know and again that wouldn't be the government that would be the companies that are that are creating this or taking the CBD out of the plant I just don't know how do you get this out of a plant and this comes out of the same plant but they're both supposed to do the same thing I know people that have used this it's a Rick Simpson way of doing it like doing your homemade batch this stuff I've know a lot of people that were sick that said I'm already using my dad I'm already used in that [ __ ] CBD oil blah blah blah and this is the stuff he was using not this I'm sure of it and my aunt my mom so I'm just I'm just curious the ones that I know that's awful sorry the ones that I know that survived cancer beat it use CBD like this the ones that I know that tried the CBD and it didn't work use this so am I wrong here is this just you know I'm just totally off or what so please get back to me put in some comments let me know what's going on what your thoughts are I appreciate it very much thank you bye bye", "90jcnQuIR3k": "fuck me and do you truth information hello and welcome back to Tom who knows as promised from the fourth congress of raunchy science one of the speakers is rick simpson we will have our talk in english but i will try to translate everything into German as well so hello and welcome to Germany Rick Simpson really nice to meet you we had yesterday our first meeting which was for me really special but a really warm welcome so I have to say like I told you before I didn't know your name before I did some research a few minutes and found out like I got the picture like you were like The Godfather of Mariana and health if you want to call it like this but can you introduce yourself to the people who don't you not your name like what is your story or how did you came to all of this what's your background how do you get off well first off my name is Rick Simpson and I'm from Nova Scotia Canada and back in 1972 I watched my cousin die a horrible death from cancer you know he was 25 years old and I just couldn't believe what I was seeing but but at that time cancer was rare you know it was very rare at was what what in the 70s in the seventies in 1972 when he died like he I was about 23 years old myself and he was the first man our first person I ever knew that had cancer and he's also the first person I ever knew who died from it so it was quite rare at that time but things have gotten much worse since and of course but it was about three or four years later I was leaving work this day it was around 1975 and the report came on our local radio station and of course the announcer was at and laughing like a fool but he stated that a study in the u.s. had determined the THC the active ingredient in the marijuana or I prefer to call it cannabis marijuana is just a slang term but th-the THC in the cannabis plant was killing cancer cells and but it was put to me in such a way that it was like a joke yeah it's like a full yeah so it's stuck in my brain but I worked in the medical system myself as an engineer but in 1997 I suffered a severe head injury and this left me with what they call post concussion syndrome and then of course they started and I have this ringing in my head 24 hours a day very high-pitched balance issues my blood pressure was crazy they couldn't do a thing you know for me I went to the medical system they gave me all of these different prescriptions they made me nothing but worse but about a year after I was injured I was watching an episode of the nature of things with dr. David Suzuki and on this it was called reefer madness 2 and it showed all these patients with many different conditions smoking cannabis okay when was this on the timing scale this was nineteen seventeen seventy eight the fall of 1978 and when I watched this I mean I had smoked cannabis before but I never looked at it like a medicine so I went out and I got some cannabis and when I smoked it sure enough it worked better than anything the doctors were giving me and in Canada we had what they called a marijuana access program and so I when I went to the doctor's afterwards I asked them for prescriptions you know so I could you know illegally use the plant and but every doctor said the same thing you know it's bad for the lungs it's still under study and all this nonsense you know I mean a plant that's been used in medicine for five thousand years is still under studies its against so well I smoked a little bit of cannabis along with the medications but the cannabis did help me more but still I couldn't get a prescription and then in 1999 the effect of these chemicals and pills they were giving me we were making me suicidal and like depression and all you feel like you're in a hopeless state you know 24 hours a day noise you can't sleep you know you're really exhausted all the time it was just horrible so I was getting very desperate so I just the state popped into my head as well what would happen if you washed you know the trichomes or the resins that on the bud material if you wash that resin off with a good solvent and then filtered you know the mix and then boil to solve it off what would you have so like the basic the basic out of it like the core ingredients of its everybody anybody that used cannabis they know you could you can see the crystal on the bud material often it'll looked like almost like frost yeah you know stick straight out and that really that's what gets you high but that's also what gets you healed because the cannabinoids are in these resins all these wonderful healing cannabinoids so just just for my understanding because I'm not so into this topic like from a scientific point of view and that gets lot lots of people aren't as well what are the ingredients of let's say basically we have to plant there are I think two ingredients in it or what is it made of or what are the two substances are well we don't even know the right number a good friend of mine dr. Amir Anoosh he did a study here and I mean Lemire is one of the top experts in the world he works directly with Michelin right there at Hebrew University in Jerusalem okay he isolated a hundred and eight different cannabinoids and he said there's still more so we have no idea home we don't even know how many cannabinoids that plant consume to globe everywhere different types of ingredients or cabinets well you know the strains vary in their cannabinoid levels from strain to strain but the main ones people concentrate on are like THC CBD as are cbn CBG and it goes on and on and on but but the you know all of the all of the studies which were done by people like by like people in like Lemire Anoosh and what's the spanish researcher in madrid guzman and there's several other ones but they've all done their research with THC and they've achieved amazing results you know using that cannabinoid now there's a lot of attention being paid right now to CBD now CBD does have its medical benefits but I would suggest that anybody that's suffering from cancer you had better take an oil that has a high THC content so if you could to describe it in for a point a few CBT has what effect or THC has what effect like like I heard like one one has to be like you you you feel a little bit not drunk but you know in a state and the other one it's like expanding your consciousness how do you describe it for yourself well now you're talking about the different strains I mean there's there's three there's three different varieties there's sativas indicas and then there's ruderalis but that's more like an industrial Russian ditch weed that's really what it is but it's the indie cuz I always work with now when you smoke a good indica it makes you want to go lay down and relax and then when you make an extract from a good indica like the concentrate is a very is really a very powerful it's you know it's very very sedated and that's very important for the healing process but these other strains out there the sativas and you see a lot of sativas grown here in europe because they grow tall and they want those long fibers in the old days they made everything with cannabis and so there was a lot of sativas grown but a sativa like you make an extract or even smoke a sativa the bud material it's energizing and that's the last thing in the world you do not want a cancer patient energized you know if somebody's dying with terminal cancer you want them laying and sleeping so they can start or the healing process starts better if it's like more in a slower state or comma States or why don't you want to like give him energy for the healing process it started way around well we're talking about people that are at death's door you know I mean sleep and rest is part of the healing process and that's what the strong indica extracts promote but now a sativa extract would be fine to treat skin conditions skin cancers maybe third-degree burns that type of thing sativa would be just fine but for ingesting the name of the game is the indica extracts and if you want to make the best extracts see I used to grow many different indica strains and I used to mix you see all cannabis is not created equal you know some strains well luckily for us most indicas there seem to be effective in the treatment of cancer very effective and harmless but you know other strains are better for pain relief than some or some are better for lowering ocular pressure for glaucoma patients or lowering blood sugar for diabetics do you have any hints for people who can't to get more into this topic like which strain is would you recommend for what I can't recommend strange because this whole seed industry there's no stability yeah you have it's all this mixed under oh yeah I mean you don't know you you send to five different seed companies and buy say a strain called Northern Lights when you but when you get those see whenever a very famous stream okay but if you bought that same strain from five different seed companies when you grew it you'd find your growing five different types of cannabis see this is a problem right now well at least I don't have to the patents on it well you know I could tell people is just to simply go out and look for a strong indica varieties like there's there's many of them out there like LA Confidential that's around twenty five percent THC any of the pure indica strains and they will make a good extract but I always got the best results by you know where I was growing all of these different strains I would make the extracts from each different strain and then I would mix them and this literally created a cure oh okay you know did you test it on yourself so we can come back to it to your story your chest told you and you'd start to extract the stuff and what did you do like what was the first experience did you test yourself or meant that the oil would be a much more medicinal way to use the plant when I asked him about it so I am at home and I I produce the extract but I have to be honest I mean this was a concentrate and I knew it would be sedated but where these doctors were so reluctant to go in that direction I really thought that you know this stuff could be dangerous so I'm ashamed to say it but it literally literally it sat there for almost three more years before I used it it was in 2008 2001 my doctor called me to his office he said there's nothing more we can do for you you're on your own and I mean what the illness it did you have I didn't get this before I had post-concussion syndrome from that head injury in 90 and you know and I never found any relief in the medical system a headache right now it my head rings 24 hours a day it doesn't stop but anyway the just keep on talking ya know so you tested it for the first time you extracted it and you sleep out there for three years but when I am well when the doctor said there was nothing more they could do and I asked him again for prescription so I could use this I can't plant legally but no wouldn't give it to me so I went home and I started taking the extract but when that when the medical system cut me loose the effect of those pills and chemicals they had been giving me they they messed up my thinking processes so badly that I could hardly even remember my own name this is the effect they have it's awful but I went home and I started ingesting small doses of these extracts and in the evening and over a period of the next within a month I worked it up to the point I was taking like a quarter of a gram or maybe even as much as a third of a gram at night before I went to bed and this stuff was just knocking me up I mean like a baby and this is something I hadn't been able to do for five years what you felt how did you feel like well it was very refreshing well I mean it brought my blood pressure under control my arthritis and my knees disappeared I started losing weight because you know it was shocking because it's scary in the beginning because they couldn't imagine that an extract from a plant could make you lose weight but this does if you're overweight it brings you back to your healthy weight so it was doing all these things you know and it's the people around me they all seen it you know and it was truly amazing but in late 2002 I went back to the doctor because I had these three areas of skin cancer I had one close to my eye right here on the side of my nose and I had one of my left cheek and I had one of my chest so when the doctor looked at to me he said well this looks like skin cancer but he said we'll do the one next to your eye first because of the proximity to the eye and he said we'll do the other two at a later date so I went to the hospital they operated in a boat I don't know four or five days later I was looking at this and him where they had operated with a magnified mirror and of course it was infected you know that's pre standard in hospitals yeah and but it was rate at that moment that study I'd heard like thirty years before popped back into my mind you know THC the active ingredient and I was thinking well you know i eating this extract you know it's full of THC so if that was true then why do I have these open lesions and of course I'd had them since the 1990s and I mean I still had faith in the medical system up to that point you know and I thought really if there were if there really was a cure for cancer for God's sakes the government that wasn't ago they'd be using it that that all people are telling us the same thing like when we talked about that for example it's like yeah if they would have a cure for one big issue they would all release it because they want to help well some would but they can't because there is this this line of government or industry or whatever more like a line of corruption is preventing us from using this but anyway yeah I you know I I really felt that you know if there was any truth in this that they would have been using the THC and you know because they always said we want to cure for cancer we want preventive medicine you know and what a pack of lies that is but anyway I almost I hate to say but I almost didn't try it but I thought well I had the extract right there so I went down and I put a little just a drop on the skin cancer here in my cheek and the same in my chest I put a bandage on each one now the only thing I noticed when I put it on like when you have skin cancer it feels like there's like like you have wood splinters and yeah in the affected area and it's usually puffed up and bleeding a little more and so this you know all of these places were doing the same thing so I put put the you know the extract on these two that was the only the only thing I noticed was that that splinter feeling immediately went away but there was no other sensation that anything was happening so I left the bandages in place for four days and when I went down to the bathroom to remove them I was just shocked because when I peeled this one off it was just pink skin all healed and the same thing with one of my chest so I started telling friends and neighbors you know that I think that just cured my cancer and of course everybody just laughed at me you know they thought I was insane you know cannabis curing cancer do you know don't be ridiculous so anyway about seven weeks later the one that they had surgically removed by my eye it came roaring right back I watched it developed as the splinter in the face feeling bleeding and puffed up a little and so I put a drop of oil on that and put a bandage on now that's what thirteen and a half years ago I've never had to retreat these areas so I went down to my doctor's office a few days later to get a copy of my pathology report because they had taken a sample when they did the operation get the cross-check yeah and it was right there you know basal cell carcinoma so I told the secretary this was a the doctor's wife who was the secretary I told her I said I'd like to come back in the evening and discuss something I've been working on with the doctor and she said well what's this about and I said well that cancer they had removed by my eye I said it came right back so I healed it and the other two areas using what I what I called hemp oil and the reason I call it hemp oil because this is what farmers always called this plant him you know these are these hemp seed companies they get kind of mad at me because they're you know they they sell hemp oil but it really should their miss labeling their product it should say hemp seed oil because that's really what it is you know the him the oil that I make is the extract or the essential oil right from the plant itself from the seat from the from the land from the plant from the finished plan was sure plants but anyway she soon as I said hemp oil there's women she went ballistic she would you know she wouldn't read it like this you know the doctor will not go there and the doctor will not supply this and it was just like you know mentation like why not I she was screaming at me literally screaming at me and there was a in the waiting room I was at standing in a waiting room and there was about five or six other patients there waiting to see the doctor you know and I just thought these people they're crazy so I could own a vehicle and I was on the way home and I got thinking about and I said well if I was a small-town doctor and one of my patients had cured themselves with an extract cured themselves a cancer yeah I'd want to know about it well how can you know the doctor wouldn't they didn't want to discuss it with me at all none no I didn't find one let's say other doctor no no no the doctors are scared to death of this it's because in reality we all have access to these extracts most of these doctors are going to be out of work and they know it that's the scary part for them but afterwards you know I started supplying the extracts to people with skin conditions you know severe burns psoriasis skin cancers anything of that nature and then I started passing it out to people for internal use you know I thought well if it cures cancer on the outside what would it do on the inside and I'd been eating the extract then for quite some time and I knew it was harmless and totally non addictive so I started passing it out to people in the return of the results was just beyond belief I mean it was healing everything we used it on it was like COPD arthritis cancer diabetes you know a system by eating it just eating the extraction but you're gonna you know I mean this is a very powerful substance and if you go to my website Phoenix tears CA all the information is out there just it the whole information from your website but it's all the information is there anybody can go there and find out how to produce these extracts properly you know make you it makes people self-sufficient again you know put your faith in yourself because what the medical system supplies is not going to work you know in those cases I mean look at chemotherapy and radiation does to people and they use chemo not just for cancer they use chemotherapy for many different treatments for different diseases so as far as I'm concerned the whole medical system is just based on us just based on insanity but after that I mean I went to all the rice in 2003 I sent two great big huge folders with all this information trying to get the information out to to go to the right people you know I went to all the political parties in Canada I went to two federal ministers of health I went to say like I didn't reply I'm not a reply not one chance to I by saying look from human to human this is the results help me know the second minister of health allowed Asajj when I sent him Canada in Canada at that time and what was it six months later he sends me an email back telling me that I'm breaking the law you know I'm carrying people with terminal cancer and I'm breaking the law well thank you mr. Health Minister what a pack of thieves these people are unbelievable but I mean I did everything right I contacted all the right people we went to the Canadian Cancer Society we even took this to the United Nations nobody would do a thing because they're all corrupt what do mean I need nations that took it like I have no idea what distant unite I know but the new United States but you wrote a letter there or try to contact this woman's there Stephen Lewis was representative at that time for the United Nations in Canada we contacted Steve for health they never even got a reply nice people maybe he didn't read it I know Carol what are you ready you'll hear later in my lecture today what I think of the United Nations and all of that we will have this lecture by the way on video as well because we're gonna record it and - it'll be a second video so everyone can see your lecture as well thank you very much so so to get a little bit of us to summarize think things up so now should have said you you extract it on your own you tested it on your own and you helped other people you got tremendous results but in a positive way I was giving me oil way for nothing I wasn't charging people and in 2004 we put up the feench - you see a website and read on our website we told the whole world how they can heal themselves but look you're not selling it because it's not illegal to sell it so you you're trying to tell people how to you produce their own oil right that that's one thing we talked about it yesterday and you can remember like I got many many emails when I heard your name like can you ask him very key to all where to get to all people have to understand that they don't date they have to understand that you can't just sell because there are restrictions and this is the legal stuff we have to deal with but people have to go into their self-awareness to you to take your time get your ass off the chair and try and do this stuff on your own no it's a natural right you know we as human beings we have a natural right to use plants to heal ourselves you know we're the only ones that can say what medicine we actually take for our health you know but you know but like these people you know the allopathic approach to healing which like I said is to me is insane because from what I see it's not about healing they want you to just keep coming back here's another prescription it goes on and on and on you know but this is a medicine that anyone can grow in their backyard and in you know process it themselves because in reality once you make this medicine you realize that it's really not much harder than making a cup of coffee you know anybody can do this and this is the future I mean the healing powers of these cannabinoids that we've seen they are they're going to change the face of medicine forever medicine is going to become a whole different animal than it is now and people will start getting healed you're going back to the natural stuff like earth gave us to work with yeah it's not only like like this plant I was last year it was one month in Peru and you asked a retreat and met a really good lovely shaman and we did a tour through the jungle and it was like he went through I only see green stuff like plants and he said yeah this is for blood pressure cancer bah bah bah blah but does anyone have any pain or mosquito red stuff on his arms I'm like yeah it's it's it's hurting a little bit and he's cutting the tree it's called dragon blood I think and he carried he took it took the blood it was pure blood like red blood he took it instantly the pain was gone instantly I'm like why are they not using it anakata yeah sure they can't use it because there would be no illness yeah it's completely gone oh this is amazing thing with these extracts like they're natural they're natural antibiotic their natural anesthetic they kill pain - it's just amazing and the effects like I had I burnt myself very badly here at this hand third-degree burns I mean 3/4 of my hand just melted it was awful in and when okay pictures days later my girlfriend the time she told me she you know Ricky got to go see a doctor so I couldn't see the doctor and when I walked in I put my hand out and he looked at me and he said when did you do this and I said well four or five days ago oh my god man there's nothing I can do with that you got there degree burns so he just took some gauze and he wrapped it up around my hand he didn't put nothing on it so I got up and I was on under the influence of all MDM pharmaceuticals at the time and so I went home and I'm stubborn anyway so I went down and I had some other materials so I started and I did it again and of course I got the whole bandage just soaked in oil solvent mix and after about three or four days it got so ugly the the bandage I just took it and threw it away but the strange thing was you know like I said I was under the influence of the pharmaceuticals but seven days later that doctor told me to come back seven days later so I went back seven days later and when I put my hand out his eyes got his big as like to saucers it was just like what did you do seven days ago you had third-degree burns and he said all the surge of days pink skin I mean the hair follicles grew back no scarring whatsoever and I mean I was so stupid at the time you know from the effects of these cameras pills that I just got up and said well I guess I'm a good healer and I walked out well maybe that's the through it was years later before I finally clued in you know what I see me all these other things that did for me you know and then I remember that burn and you know why don't I have scars it this is the ultimate medicine for basically anything because we all have an endocannabinoid system and we have a brain in the brain right where we are releasing the components of the plant in our brains like DMT we have different types of components we release it on our own so it's a body produced stuff well on our bodies actually produce cannabinoids themselves we have natural cannabinoids when does it produce it like do we know it or do you have any suggestion why when is there that when is it pumping or won't when it is releasing just this stuff are you sure the timing during the days probably happens at night because a lot of this goes on and you know late at night when you're sleeping like Mother's Milk you know if a pregnant woman mother's milk is full of cannabinoids you know that that almost 80% of the of the of the women nowadays I heard us a study from from someone who is working with in the hospital said they don't still what is called in English when they breast breast feeding your kids like 80 percent because yet they don't think it's relevant it's like it's very relevant it's like the irrelevant it's like why do you have well I mean you know they did a study back Melanie dree her she did a study back in the 1980s to find out where the healthiest babies on earth were born and finally she found that the healthiest babies on this planet are born to mothers in Jamaica who used cannabis a great deal now these are the healthiest babies on the planet and she did a follow-up study 20 years later and there's most of them are still doing great but you know I mean if these if the use of cannabis does not affect the baby in the developmental stages in the womb and in fact these are the healthiest babies on the planet you know why wouldn't this met it why wouldn't this plant be good for medicinal use for people of all age groups including children you know a lot of people say that people are children shouldn't be exposed to this this is nonsense I mean look what the medical systems are doing to them look at the toxins and poisons you know give your child some real medicine medicine they even better yet that you produced yourself you know there's your answer become self-sufficient stop relying on others because these people are lying to you and all they want to do is make a huge profit but I think that that's more of a lifestyle this is self sufficient self getting into the various to do your choices and do your thing and not relying on yeah I have cancer someone other has to help me it's not working like this you you're the trigger you are the creator of your own reality you have to do this stuff that's right like it's in every aspect and it's it's so frustrating it's not frustrating but it's a so for me it's more and more cleaner when I see people they are just whining over their terror situation and have have some some feeling for me and I'm so bad situation but I don't that they don't have the guts to just do it this is what I mean actually what is it the fellow sent me an email here a while ago and he cured themselves with the oil and he said I decided that it would be better for me to be illegally alive okay you know I mean yeah let's hope but you know these extracts it's hard to believe because we've always been told you know like cannabis is dangerous it's a drug it's this is nonsense that's all propaganda is nothing more than a pack of lies I've studied this plant for well over a decade many of my friends very well-educated people have studied this and the top experts in the world are all saying the same thing yes for me the ultimate medicine for me right now it looks like at least from Austria at this perspective in Europe like some governments are switching like like like the whole in English too they are going back from arts it's it's a bad stroke they're more like tell me something how did they make it illegal in the first place the United States it's all of this nonsense started basically in the US and all these other countries a they made it illegal they just follow the lead of the United States these countries didn't do a study because if they had they've never would have been able to find a problem with cannabis we grew this plant for thousands of years no regulations no laws against it why do you think they're legalizing it like in Washington other states because they are trying to hide checks that if they say ok let's release it so the government can have the big pot and control it why do they legalize government's are trying to do but I mean what governments have to do they have to admit that a criminal act was committed here this plant should never have been outlawed they didn't no one has the right I mean who has the right to stand in front of you and tell you that you cannot grow a medicinal plant to heal yourself now who is this person and why do these governments go along with this nonsense I mean they're all they're they're all a bunch of criminals in suits as far as I'm concerned you know they're not representing the people and what people hate today I don't think so I mean we've all we've always been controlled one way or another the big money you know like people think governments run the world that's nonsense the people who run the world are named Rothschild Rockefeller those are there in gates and people like that those are the people that are really the show and the government's are all in their back pockets at least you can it's so when you talk to people like yesterday Rochelle Rockefeller I don't even give them a name but there is a direction whatever it is whoever is we don't know that the real people behind it will never know the names but there is some some wave or there is some direction who definitely make plans or open up plans plans and and restriction and and governments try to control it it's the same with like other plants with ayahuasca like that they try to cut it off in Peru thousands of people to Emma straight because it's like a nature that's a cultural nature there and the government said ok it's ok for you but the UN is trying to cut it out down there as well so if and I was there in Peru and I'm talking with the shaman like if everyone would just once just once have one retreat just once yeah this this whole world would be different yes they would see themselves differently and others differently and have more you know what I mean well I mean I just couldn't imagine the levels of corruption that I encountered I mean as I said I was giving the the medication away and to or 2005 I was raided in charged cultivation trafficking and possessive possession well I mean I had to cultivate the plants to make the medicine and of course I had to possess the plants to make the medicine and under if you look in a dictionary it says trafficking is the exchange of goods for monetary gain well I wasn't gaining anything you know but I went into the court system I went through a charter challenge because under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in Canada we all as Canadians are supposed to have the right to life but I found that that was untold untrue the only time you have the right to life is when you do what they do you know you can't use an extract from a plant to save your life even if it is for the ozone and safe is medication that's against the law you know this is what's wrong with our world you know the whole planet is being run by psychopaths and idiots and it's really for people to take back you know take back their natural rights and to create our own destiny because I mean they've messed this planet up to no end you know Fukushima Gulf oil spill you know toxic industries everywhere killing the planet and at the same time it's killing us because our immune systems are being compromised more and more every day by these toxins that surround us and when that happens our bodies are not producing the natural cannabinoids or then it can't produce a number of cannabinoids need it and that's when diseases like cancer and things like that you know rear their ugly heads but if you take these cannabinoids they fit right into the same receptors that our natural cannabinoids fit into do you still do you still think that there must be like in the healing process of cancer there must be up psychological or component or does this come by using the cannabinoids you know what I mean like well I mean I've talked to a lot of these people like New Age thinkers you know to the power of positive thinking and they're so convinced that you know if you think positively is going to make a big difference but when they used to come to me I used to look at them and say well tell me something do you think a dog has the power of positive thinking you because I treat dogs all the time with cancer and they get cured do you think a dog has that power and then they look at you because they don't know that they have the power to think negative I think using it in a good state you know even the people I treated I used to tell them you know change your diets and all you give them all this advice most of these people like three months later they would come back they were cured but I would ask them did you change your diet did you do anything do you get your body's pH up they didn't do a thing you know maybe one in 50 would actually do something but they all still healed them so you don't have to believe in it just the healing process will know what it's kind of automatic Wow wow that's very interesting so all of your experiences or you wrote how many books no well I have two books out now this this is the first one which is called Rick Simpson start is this one do you have one book in in German translated as well yes thank you we're planning to have this translated into German right away - but the second book or nature or Phoenix tears Rick Simpson oil nature's answer for cancer that's been translated into German okay so this is like your background story how you came to it and what would you describe the books like in what is it what is what part of you is there well it's basically you know what I mean it's kind of my life story but but mostly it's about the medicine and and you know what the system put me through I mean I'm just an ordinary man there's nothing special about me and really all I I consider myself to be the messenger I'm not a miracle worker the oil the extracts do that I'm just here to tell the world but I mean the way they used me in Canada it was just beyond belief you know the legal system you know I mean I went through a supreme supreme court at nova scotia trial over this i didn't have the money i had to represent myself i brought six I brought ten doctor ten patients in there to testify two of these patients have been cured with terminal cancer two with terminal cancer wouldn't let them understand I had six doctors they're the one that lots of speak up but knows why what's the reason you're not allowed to have a medical argument what the whole court is regarding in medical arguments that's Canada the land of their free yeah I think it would be like in Austria Germany like this as well like that there's that well the whole thing you know it's like you said they wouldn't let the doctors understand they wouldn't let the patients understand I had a box full of scientific evidence they wouldn't let me introduce that I destroyed you know when they put these police officers on the stand I destroyed them because you know I would see a year before that I was ever raided I went to the local newspapers they did full-page articles about me you know the whole thing picture of me and everything and you know in here year over a year later that's when the police come and raid me you know like I mean I wasn't hiding this and I told the police I went right to the police themselves and give them Oh evidence and told them that local politicians should be charged with criminal negligence causing death because they wouldn't do anything I even asked the police for whatever they confiscated if you have good bud for God's sakes give it to me and I can make more medicine for the people you know and three months later the same the same detachment comes and raids me so that just ate the same guy there's many people in the detachment but I mean I went the only person in the end the only person that could testify my behalf was me and I spent about two hours on the stand and I didn't think that there was a hope in hell that anybody could convict me of anything because there was people on that jury that I had treated some of their family members for nothing and healed them and they didn't speak up well no I mean they were on the jury they were supposed to determine if I was guilty or innocent so anyway we we gave our closing arguments three hours later we were called back to the courthouse the juries had reached a verdict I come in and I sat down in the courtroom and the prosecutor from the Justice Department this Monika McQueen she was the one who had done all the talking during my charter challenge and during the Supreme Court case but her sidekick Doug Shatford the crown prosecutor he was always right with her but when I come into the courtroom that day no Shatford and I'm sitting there and yeah and a few minutes later in Shatford finally come in and sat down and then the jury come in and I got a you know and I stood up and it was guilty guilty guilty and I looked at the jury and I said guilty of what saving lives is that a crime in Canada and then the judge he went oh you know mr. Simpson you can't take this personally in all this nonsense and I turned on the judge and I said listen pal you better lock me up right now because the minute I get out of here I'm gonna start I'm gonna continue distributing those damn extracts he never said a word to me you know and then finally when after you know and what was the next day one of the people had been the audience they came to my home and they she had this lady I know this lady quite well and she told me she said I seen Doug Shatford exit the jury room just about a minute before the jury came in with a verdict he tampered with the damn jury and the man's quite famous for the because he did the same thing about two years later in another case involving the oil you know no way that you can like to prevent these I say okay look we had evidence we took it to the judge but they they just swept it under the rug but yet you know but when at my sentencing about 35 or 40 supporters were there you know they were mad and then the court knew it so they put us through metal detectors and all this first time I ever seen it in Amherst courthouse but anyway when I when I stood up the judge said openly he said under different circumstances mr. Simpson would be winning awards for his work and then he said it's at consensus which one what I am meaning by that people so what do you know it was just idiotic and then he said in my 34 years in the legal system I've never seen a case like this he said there was no criminal intent you see money wasn't even mentioned during my court case because there was no money involved and so and then the same judge who wouldn't let the patients on the stand and wouldn't let the scientific evidence being introduced he turned right around he said the scientific evidence does exist to back up everything mr. Simpson is saying and he also has all this large body of evidence with the patients they gave me a two thousand dollar fine and a gun restriction I wasn't even put on probation you know and the gun reason the only reason I got the gun restrictions not that I was you know during those raids yeah the RCMP were waving guns around but I wasn't you know there was no guns in my home so but when you're convicted of trafficking that comes with an automatic 10-year gun restriction you know I truly sick of me and you know after that I wanted to leave Canada but the patients kept coming so for about two years they left me alone and then in November 2009 I was at the Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam giving a lecture and they made me freedom fighter of the year that year too but about two days before they gave the gave me that award I got a call from my son in Canada that the police had come in they were saying that they found restricted weapons yeah I mean there was a child spelling your home well now they kicked the door in they said they found restricted weapons whoops we found something and boom traps video and they found 70 pounds of cannabis now but somebody in my position get on an airplane and fly to Amsterdam for a week and leave 70 pounds of pot laying around his house not likely you know so I knew that they were trying to I'll see I was getting so much support the I think the government thought well if you know if we put the RCMP in there and bring these false charges that'll keep him out of the country and it did but I you know I stayed in Europe but I kept I started going from country to country telling the whole damn world the truth about what went on and now with the books and everything out there and now so much out there now on the Internet my god just go on YouTube there's hundreds of thousands of people you know testifying to what this and they're even what I I'm not 100 cent sure but I think they're now they legalize marijuana on a medicine what's the name when I talk to subscribe it to you in to cure or to help cancer patients a little bit whatever type of whatever they give them to smoke or oil I have no idea but it looks for me and like the attracted systems a little bit changing slightly but I'm not sure if this is a good way because like the ones who is controlling a system it's not anybody's I mean I got some joint quartet that trying to you like like yeah we have one seat this is you can buy weed or THC everywhere on the store but you have no idea what is inside who made it what is it in a synthetic varieties of points to and those those are dangerous but you know again it goes back to these government's they do they do not have the right to regulate this in any way and there's no reason that any one of us should have to go to a see a doctor to get a prescription you know to grow and use this plant as far as I'm concerned that's ridiculous you know this is our own natural right this plant the extracts the plant itself totally non-addictive no danger whatsoever no one has ever died from the effects of cancer in 5000 years of documented use no one has ever died now what other medicine can you say that I mean look at there's thousands of people every year across the planet that die from aspirin for God's sakes now we got the safest medicine on the planet it comes from nature but we're not allowed to use it because it's going to cut into the merchants of those rich you know rich people who own the pharmaceutical industry and practically everything else you know at the moment well they control the media they control the government for how long I think all of these much longer I hope I really think that this whole system that they're trying to to to hold us down or to control the people I think on all on all spheres it's breaking and shaking and people are trying to like they're asking that they're asking questions and good questions and people are yeah like esoteric they're waking up but they are they're getting aware of the things and they're just asking hey if you're telling this story like it's not a holistic story you can check it for yourself and you can talk to people who got cute like okay this guy is right so what so that's logical so it will break in the end when problem right now is they're not listening to the top experts in the world you know doctor who knows dr. Mann and me dr. Hornby I mean these people I mean these are the top scientists in this field but nobody it's like nobody's listening you know and it's such a shame because everywhere I go I see people suffering and dying needlessly if they had this yaktrax they could heal themselves after the same in my area like I think everyone knows at least in the first area or in the second one a friend of a friend you know the new prognosis are like in 20 years or ten years every fifth or sixth sky or human will have cancer like what the hell it's well well they're saying that one and two right now are going to end up with a disease but that number is going up every day you know I mean it's because we're living in a toxic world but this plant can detoxify our world we can practically everything we use in our day to day lives can be produced from cannabis in an earth friendly way and this is what we got to start doing you know even our fuel we can put an end to starvation this business about energy crisis what a pile of nonsense that is I mean I used to do this with people when they come to the house I used to take a spoon and put a lit bit of gasoline in it and light it on fire you know on the old black soot and everything coming off it and then I would take a little bit of alcohol and put the alcohol in there burn it and this beautiful blue flame you know no snow smoke no no pollution and you know and I used to say to people I said now what should we be burning in our cars you know alcohol obviously and the beauty of the cannabis now they had these new enzyme processes out and they say that you can produce as much as eighteen hundred gallons of ethanol off of one acre now one acre is a very small piece it's less than half a hectare for 1,800 gallons that would make us all in it you know you plan an acre of him your energy independent you've got enough fuel to run your car heat your home do whatever you want and it's not polluting the environment by plant we always set here like it was here a bit right before we came here or yeah it was put here for us to use as far as I'm concerned I mean and but it's so useful in so many different ways the building material the hempcrete you know it's just endless what you can do with this plant and it detoxifies the soil it's planted in you know we can detoxify the planet and we can give like future generations you know we can give them a future that you know that to look forward to but if we don't start and do something right now the earth is going to it's becoming so toxic you know more and more every day that you know in the end our children have nothing to look forward to except suffering and death and this is something we can prevent and it's up to us to do this yeah we have to get in charge again for the first time ever because it's always in a passive seat and just waiting and doing what you have to do like your own potential like in your New York god-given powers to to help other cents yourself well I mean that's really what it's all about and you know like I mean we've been led around by the nose all through history by the rich and powerful and you know any and the worst of it is you know like we've sat and watched you know these governments and P of these rich types do things that made no sense to us or whatsoever very harmful things to the planet but yet you know we don't unite and do anything about it why is that you know I'm so thing they become so complacent you know and apathy sets in but I mean it really is it's this is our world and we're the ones that have protect it and if people who are wealthy are ruining this planet then we have to put a stop to it and we have to do it now I think I think we will it's a lucious okay just gonna sign five five we have five more minutes I just have a few more question I hope we got all the topics just um let me just see what do you think is your purpose here like what is your why did you came here it's a lot I'm a little bit more of a spiritual question but what do you think why are you here what's your purpose did you find out yet or what do you think well as I said I'm really I'm just the messenger I feel it's my duty to the medicine man you know well I mean this oils these extracts safe they saved my life and I feel that it's basically my duty to tell everyone on this planet how they can do the same so that's really the cause I've been fighting for you know again our natural right to use this plant especially for medicinal purposes so the next question would be what is your purpose in life so it's it's the same you just well right now I'm looking I'm hoping to get involved in a big project that's I believe it will happen happen in a very near future now and I want to perfect this medicine to its highest levels I'd like to start supplying the public with seeds at a very cheap cost seeds that they know they can grow and trust you know that that's important because know if you if people are buying their wheat from somewhere then they never know whether it's come from you don't know what it is it like what mix crossing what was it sprayed with and there's so many variables it really is better just to grow your own you know I mean there will be companies that will supply it you know to people on a grand scale you know those who can't grow their own or whatever but yeah that's the only place I see any need for government regulation because anybody's supplying it to the public on a big scale then you know quality control and standards have to be maintained yeah sure beyond that I don't see any need for regulations and you know and like I said if you want to go out in your backyard and grow a hundred plants or a thousand plants I don't care it's gonna harm anyone and in Slovenia a lot of people are saying you know we should follow the you know the direction Colorado was taken well people better remember one thing it was the United States of America that led us into this mess in the first place now you really want to follow the advice of the US again you decide yeah you decide about it look at what's going on in Slovenia as far as I know right now in Slovenia the the government there are going to allow everyone to grow their own you're not trafficking they're not gonna bother but it's I think that's it's tricky because people will stop thinking about where it come from or for which organization or company or whatever I think that's the way they are trying to tinder us again in the next stage well they're using words out there you know no we're going to legalize or we're going to decriminalize and these are words that come with a lot of regulations it's a bunch of nonsense what we need right now we all have to stand as one and demand that governments worldwide repeal these laws these laws are all based on deceptions and lies anyway they're not ruling laws they belong in a trash can set the cannabis plant free and we set ourselves free I think that there must be some regulations like if you use the oil if you drink it or smoke it you're not allowed to drive a car totally for example like I mean I drove a big motorcycle for years and nothing will tell you any faster than a motorcycle if you're impaired what happens with alcohol and pharmaceuticals these substances impair your motor skills these extracts and cannabis they don't impair your motor skills once you're used to cannabis you can safely drive your car I did it for tens of thousands of miles on that motorcycle never had a problem you know it and actually I have one I've seen it actually makes people drive more carefully yeah and more sensibly but I would say if the government will say okay there are some restriction if you're in the public okay but not for healing at home at home I can do whatever I want sure and that's that's a problem I have so regarding that the time limit we have right now because you have to be on the stage soon if you would have let let's if you would have the opportunity to right now speak to to the camera or to the people like if if tomorrow the whole world would be able to watch your message your video what do you want to what is your what do you want to get out like well I mean the main message I'm sending to people everywhere is truthfully I mean you have the right to heal yourself and no one has the right to prevent this and you know if you go to my website Phoenix tears CA you know all the information is there we in 2000 and 2008 we brought out run from the Cure that documentary has been viewed by hundreds of millions now and the instructions for producing the extra healing into your own hands grow the plant you need produce your own extracts and heal yourself you have that right and this is what I want to see people everywhere you know that people have to come to realize this it is a natural right and you know let's put an end to all the suffering needless suffering and dying because this is ridiculous what's going on people are not being healed at present you know they put you on painkillers or other medications and then they just keep putting more pills into you that doesn't heal you so you know it's time that we got some common sense again and as far as I'm concerned you know really the cannabis plant offers us a future and not just our health but in all ways so we would have to be first class fools not to put it to good use thank you thank you very much Rick it was really a pleasure talking to you think yeah good internet but me and the usual information connect the dots big picture [Music]", "I9Z3anA0T3o":

smoking", "Mj7PpES8NDs": "I can't a lovely here IG canna critic today talking to you about RSO oil I'm gonna be talking about noir stargenetics Rick Simpson oil and if you don't know a little bit about Rick Simpson oil Rick Simpson was a man who discovered that concentrated amounts of cannabis oil was able to cure his cancer people use RSO or cannabis oil for cancer for seizures for for chronic pain for inflammation for nausea they find that they can cook with it they can use it topically again concentrated cannabis oil means 60 70 80 % THC the best of the cannabis is taken and cooked down leaving you this sort of black goo be yummy Rick Simpson or RSO oil this has been all about the talk people are looking for it everywhere please please don't just buy it from somebody online it needs to be made out of pure cannabis bud if it's high CBD it needs to be made out of high CBD bud not see em oil so there is a big difference please educate yourselves email me and or ask somebody at a dispensary in California if you can what the differences are so today North Star genetics came out with their own version of Rick Simpson oil quite a bit of oil right here I would say probably two to three grains of rice as people say they tell you to start with a half to one grain of rice for me I eat two to three this is what I'm going to eat right now I just put it in my mouth and eat it yes it's ingested that's the way Rick Simpson works it's an ingested product if you watch Rick Simpsons video and he says you don't get high I'm sorry you do get high um you can take it at night like he suggests and that'll minimize that to get started with but you do need to start off small because you will feel the effects of the THC so back to Northstar they make two brands and this is still sold right now at Sonoma patient group on Cleveland in Santa Rosa California the THC version that they have is a 1000 milligram syringe it has 444 milligrams of THC and 25 milligrams of CBD Perce Rindge so that would be great but if you are using Rick Simpson oil for cancer I'd really recommend you look for a Rick Simpson oil or RSO oil that has both THC and CBD THC is the part of the cannabis that gives you that head high and CBD is the part that helps you with the medicinal benefits aches pains and tae Naja anti-seizure well in cancer THC helps tumors shrink and CBD helps tumors not grow so having a balance of the two or even talking to North Star genetics they've done some research that combining THC and the THC CBD combo giving it more of a four to one ratio seems to be really helping cancer patients who are trying to shrink tumors so you may want to play around with it but the understanding is is that you need to consume a lot of this stuff you start off small you start with a half a grain to a grain size of rice Rick Simpson says at night I encourage people to eat this oil in small amounts every four to six hours it helps the cancer cells not grow by consuming it more on a regular basis I would play with both the THC and CBD ratios the whole goal is to get and consume 60 to 90 grams of this to cure yourself of cancer so it is a big program it costs a lot to get started you can make it yourself we encourage you to make it yourself if you can't this is we're going to a dispensary like being a California 215 medical marijuana patient allows you the opportunity to go into a dispensary and buy it I would ask dispensaries if they have some kind of cancer program to help you with the cost but I highly highly recommend this especially if you were told there's no other options for you there's no other way we can help you please give Rick Simpson oil a try it can't hurt and if you have the opportunity and the willingness to I recommend that you do get started right away I hope this helps I love North Star genetics products they make top-quality products all of the time always lab tested these numbers are off the hook yeah if you just even want to make something with our our so oil I would suggest you give their products a try what I like is is it doesn't taste funky there's no aftertaste of alcohol like some of the RSO oils that I've tasted and it's just pure great concentrated cannabis medicine and I hope this video helps and educate you and please comment below I'll get back to you and happy to answer anything any questions that you have on RSO oil Rick Simpson oil or like I love to call it concentrated cannabis oil have a great day bye bye", "JE3_9l7fYxo": "I gotta get out of it the next morning rested and feeling good see with what about what I have I couldn't sleep and they were always good all the prescriptions they gave me they didn't help so at least I was starting to get my rest then and all of a sudden the arthritis in my knees gone both knees since I was 45 had trouble with my knees all of a sudden after the oil no more itis I mean I was seeing all these improvements but it was scary the guys I used to weigh about 180 590 pounds I was really blocky and then all of a sudden I started losing weight Oh what's happening here you know and I was getting afraid of it and as weight was coming down I hit around 160 170 and then 165 and then I hit it 160 and all of a sudden I stopped losing weight just like the oil knows this is what you should weigh did properly right back to a healthy weight if you look at me you see every stomach muscle there's no fat on me it just really brought me back to a state of very good health the medical aspects of this plan they vary from strain to strange I mean practically all the heavy indica strains that are very sedated but what I've seen with them practically all of them could kick your cancer but you would get strange some strains are better for lowering ocular pressure for people that have glaucoma or controlling blood sugar for diabetics they all vary and I mean this is what we have to determine in the future which strains are the best I

I just wanted to do a video today because I'm gonna give you an update on my latest scan my latest CT scan about two months ago I started getting a lot of abdominal pain and I wasn't sure why I had this burning sensation and my gut and it was pretty really just relentless it went on a lot and it was especially bad at night and I remember there was a couple of nights when I actually went to bed with a hot water bottle against my stomach remember the old fashioned hot water bottles anyway went to bed with a hot water bottle across my stomach because it was so painful and then just after about a an hour or so just said screw it and got up and had about a half a banana and a couple of excedrin and that took care of it but I was starting to get kind of worried well did I also mention constipation I know TMI TMI but that was another problem I was really constipated and that gets to be very disconcerning because then the thoughts start going through your mind did the RSO really work has the cancer spread to my bowels has it spread to my liver you know these are all the things that go through your mind and you're just not sure so back to the internet I go for some further research and I was also trying to remember did I make any major changes in my diet and I remembered yeah I did I not major changes that I started incorporating dandelion root into my daily supplements now I drank the dandelion root tea no problems so I ordered some of the capsules and yet something else you know dandelion is really good for you and I remembered okay I remembered at that time that did the Aki berry hearing that it was so great for you and started taking Aki berry and it just tore my gut up so maybe the dandelion root was doing the same so I eliminated the dandelion root from my diet and lo and behold my stomach calmed way way down and as far as the constipation was going I started reading about everything that causes constipation and one thing that just really jumped out at me was cheese I thought you know I do a lot of cheese no no you know I'm not a brick a day or anything but since I'm not eating very much meat I do fill in with cheese so I thought okay let's see if we eliminate the cheese what happens so I eliminated the cheese and there that was the answer to that however I still thought you know it's been over a year since I've had a scan and maybe it's time to get that done because then I was just starting to wonder just okay I really need to know I need to know for sure what's going on inside of me so I not okay I'll get ahold the Native American Health and talk to my physician's assistant Christine Palazzo I talked to Christine miss Christine and she said you know she said I can order an MRI for you she said and I can order a scan for you but she didn't think that she felt qualified as qualified as say doctor bold in the oncology department at UC Davis as qualified as he would be to understand the scan and I said well you know I don't think I'm their patient anymore they did release me to go back to Native American Health and she thought she said no Linda she said you are still their patient and she said however if they refuse or or they put you off she said I will order the scan for you and she said and or an MRI and so that's on her advice I went ahead and I called dr. Boggs office and I talked to his secretary or I talked to the receptionist or the nurse or whoever she was and she said that she would ask him about the scan and get back to me and she did she got back to me and she said yes he definitely will do a scan he just needs to know where to send the order to so I said okay I will find a place down here to do the scan so I did I found Northridge imaging and got everything all arranged and they wanted me to come in ahead of time to pick up the paperwork I had an appointment with them I don't know and on a like a Friday I think was Friday and I had an appointment at 10:30 in the morning and they said to come down I don't know the day before so and pick up the paperwork and get the barium drink that I needed to drink because I had to not have anything to eat for 12 hours and then drink this barium one bottle at 8 o'clock one bottle at 10 o'clock and then come in for the scan and so that's what I did and you know the barium drink hasn't been it's vanilla and I was hungry you know no coffee no smoothie no nothing so I drank that vanilla barium and it satisfied my hunger okay so I'm in there I've drank my barium I'm on the table I am all ready to be him to put the the attendant to put the dye in my I guess right they were gonna put it in right there for the contrast and he asked me if I was allergic to any medication and I said no and then I kind of thought for a second and I told them I said however I am allergic to shellfish and he froze it's oh well he said this dye has iodine in it and if you're allergic to shellfish it's probably the iodine in the shellfish and he said I need to go ask my supervisor about this and he came back in a couple of minutes and he said no dye we're just gonna do the imaging but it's gonna be a little bit more difficult for your doctor to read it because it's not gonna have a good contrast okay so they told me down there at the imaging center that those images would be sent to doctor Boldt office on Saturday the next day so okay that I imagine that was done and I had gotten a notification from UC Davis an email and there was new information in my chart well I haven't you know I realized I haven't looked at my chart from time so I open up my chart and I start going through the different little things that you can look at in my chart and I found a scan that was taken my last scan that was taken a year ago last May or last month and I started reading then I thought I don't remember seeing this scan before have I did I find this before and look at it or not and I really couldn't remember having seen it before so I start reading it and I noticed that I've got I have a small cyst on my pancreas in the area called the unica process I don't remember hearing anything about a cyst or seeing anything about assist okay that's interesting and then I see that there's been a partial occlusion of my portal vein and my splenic veins a partial - complete occlusion of my splenic vein and that was something else I don't remember hearing anything about or did I even see that scan I don't know I don't recall anything and I asked Lou I said did dr. bull talk to us about anything about a a cyst on my pancreas or occlusion of my splenic and portal veins and what that might mean and he said no he didn't remember it at all so naturally I'm on the internet looking up occlusions of splenic and the wood that portal vein that's not too good if it is completely blocked of course no blood flow is going to be getting in but it's very prone to thrombosis blood clots and they said there really isn't a whole lot that can be done it's very common with pancreatic cancer common and the only thing that they can do for you is give you blood thinners so that your blood doesn't clot well I'm already taking the Hawthorn and I take the C the Co Q 10 and there's something else I take that is kind of you know a blood thinner too so okay I'm okay on that one but it there's really there's nothing that really could be dead about that as long as the cancers there I would imagine there's nothing that can be done about that and as for the cysts oh that's even better nothing can be done about the sister if it it talked about two kinds of cysts one is more of a thinner liquid a clear liquid and more as a heavier liquid inside of it and they can go along for years with no problems but they also can erupt like a cyst and if it does it's going to go into your abdominal cavity and cause peritonitis like a ruptured appendix isn't that nice but it's not a super common that they do that and so if you get like a really bad pain and immediately start getting a fever because it can go into blood poisoning as well so you get a big fever with it so that that's something to keep in mind on on that but up to this point I did not know that I had those other things besides the kids ward so it was a good three weeks later before doctor bolts office got in touch with me I called a couple of times and found out that he only came in on Fridays he's only been coming in on Friday since the the great quarantine has been in place and so that was what that was all about so he did he called me they arranged for a video conference type call or a video chat and even though I couldn't go to Sacramento we could do this video chat and so that's what we did and he seemed like he was really to see me they all smile and and very very cordial and not half as serious Issy was okay so he said essentially that my skin has not changed at all from the scan that I had done a year ago in me it looked to be exactly the same he said but because of the lack of contrast he couldn't see the edges of the cancer of the tumor and whether it's shrunk or not he's not sure and also about the the splenic and the portal veins couldn't tell about the blood flow going through there because of the lack of imaging as well so those were two things but he seemed very pleased that nothing nothing had changed he said all my other organs looked absolutely fine there was no cancer has spread at all so doctor Boldt he never asked what I've been doing he did not ask maybe it's on my chart that I was doing the THC but he didn't ask and he really didn't have any suggestions he just said he's gonna order the MRI and and see if he can discern a little bit more meanwhile as long as the assist doesn't rupture and I can get some blood through those portal veins I should be fine because the cancer is not spreading it doesn't seem to be getting any bigger so I could probably go along like this for years I just I don't know like I say as long as those other things don't play into this it is looking rather promising so what he wants to do is do an MRI he said he can get a better idea with an MRI so we're gonna do that I'll find out a place down here but the whole visit ended quite nicely quite well so did the RSL work the way Rick Simpson said it was gonna work I don't know it hasn't I don't know about the apoptosis I don't know it how much smaller the tumor is than it was before but did it do something oh yes I am sure it did I know the CBD keeps it from spreading and it certainly has not spread and the containment of it is is that's a very good thing you know because pancreatic cancer is a stubborn one it is a stubborn one so do I think the RSO is helping oh yes I definitely think so so like I said I'm just gonna have to wait and see I think the jury is still out on the RSO but I do know that something something has stopped that cancer from growing and I you know I'm betting that it is the RSO because I haven't done anything else so drastic and that it would stop pancreatic cancer from growing so we'll just have to wait and see and on that happy note of waiting and see on that happy note I'm going to say goodbye and thank you for watching my video and I'm sure that I will be keeping you up to date on what is happening with me and my pancreatic cancer and my RSO treatment okay all righty bye bye", "bcvDc9hRcws": "[Music] friends of mine that I buy my weed from and various things still told me about Eddie and I got on the internet and I researched him I found him I messaged him I met him and he started taking care of me with his RSO which you know you put this stuff in a capsule you take it and you go to sleep you sleep like a rock it's amazing everything I research made me understand that if I didn't change my diet and try to find something that was going to help me eliminate all the pain that I was in that I wouldn't be here much longer because it became too unbearable to just get up and go to our job in that process my doctors told me that there was pain clinic and there was go see a counselor or employee assistant counseling that talked about all of this was going on and just one medication after the next and one day I looked up and I like 17 different medications and I just wanted to do something different my first experience with helping somebody other than myself was my mother she was diagnosed with cancer in October of 2016 I actually had told her instead of taking sleeping pills and things like that I was offering her smoke weed because that was what I needed to do but when she was diagnosed with cancer I was kind of at a loss I knew that from experience of watching other people going through cancer that chemotherapy was destructive and very very sad and harsh and but when she was diagnosed we didn't know exactly the extent of it and then a couple weeks later found out that she was problem she was terminal by then already they gave her like three and a half months to live I had basically decided within me that I didn't want her to go through with the treatments but if that's what she wanted to try to do as far as what Western I was telling her fine but I was asking her to try cannabis as well and then she was but how how much what do I take and I said I don't know I basically didn't know I just went out to a dispensary and was like hey my mom's dying and I come here every week five times a week to buy my own weed smoke you guys have anything that my mom could take that would help her live or at least like feel better and they couldn't answer anything nobody knew anything well we have this and we have that and this is $90 and this is $150 I'm like is $150 stuff stronger better make her better faster no well we don't know um how much do I give to her I'm not sure and then CBD was the cure-all to that was the other thing you just need to give her lots of CBD and I'm like well how much what form you know do I rub it on her body do I put it in her mouth like what exactly do I do and it was it was scary cuz they were willing to take my money but they weren't willing to tell me what to do with this thing they were giving me for my money they do believe in some of the studies they say that smoking a joint when he gets into medicinal aspects you're getting anywhere between 12 to 16 percent cannabinoid absorption the endocannabinoid system is complementary to cannabis which is why I got named as partially and a cannabinoid system cannabis in and of itself is hundreds and hundreds of different chemicals that we are now starting to pick apart and take a look at on a much deeper level so you're smoking a joint some of the best weed there is and you're still even though you're a hundred percent stoned and 100 percent medicated or high you're only getting up to 16 percent of cannabinoid absorption in your body that's trying to kill cancer that's not gonna do anything when people take up to a thousand milligrams of concentrated oil to battle the cancers so that's smoking it then there's topicals topicals come in there also and you get anywhere from they believe a sixteen to twenty four percent absorption with topicals edibles they believe you get a forty to fifty two percent absorption rectally he get from 86 to 91 percent absorption but when you get into posit or EES you can't just make it like you make ganja butter you have to use a refined oil which has to be broken down in certain ways this is a full plant extract meaning that we cut the whole plant down we soak the whole plant in a solvent and whatever is made whatever's left after we remove the solvent is the pure product we keep it at certain volatile heat levels so it doesn't burn off certain properties and that's what the entourage effect is nowadays with all the legalization going on the vape carts that's called distillate and so this lid is actually a step after you make the NH Oro so the full plant oil extraction oils and is in a solvent and then you take that solvent and what I do is I just remove the solvent and what I have left is my product what other people do is once you remove the solvent they take this product they put it into a machine they call it a mantle they heat that up with vacuum pressure steam and cool and cold air and they collect what's called distillate and that's an isolation of THC you are now burning off all the entourage components everything is gone now and all you're removing is the THC and so that's what everybody's using in the vent cartridges and stuff which I believe is generic hi I've had no medical benefits of anybody feeling any better with them unless they're having headaches needed a quick quick appetite boost or a recreational setting where they just want to smoke something real quick and move on but when it came to all-around healing you have to internally eat it it's do you have to ingest it and I've stayed away from making edibles and stuff because a lot of it had sugars and preservatives and those are the things that were preservatives were preserving the cancers and all the anomalies and the sugars were just feeding the cancers and the anomalies and so I just figured instead of me making edibles I should create a pure concentrate oil that should be take a very very tiny amount it goes a long way so instead of you having to have medicated brownies or a medicated cookie I am now medicated whatever I eat is medicated now I can have Medicaid lasagna I could have medicated burritos I can have medicated tortilla chips I can have medicated salsa because I am medicated so I am the standard I don't need all these other outside anomaly's messing with me especially you have diabetic patients or people that are on harsh strict diets they just need to take a pure form of the oil and I feel like that's the best way to do it instead of using all these extra stuff that just cause you know food allergy problems or you know I have people that are making the oil now and putting all kinds of essential oils in it and no it just needs to be the oil just stick to the plan it comes to their face like their designers again and the plan has been healing for thousands of years without our effort it's gonna be here on this earth for thousands of years after we're gone I've been using this medicine for years because I was addicted to opiates after I broke my back and they told me I had stomach cancer and so I went after all these things myself because I didn't believe in their lies I didn't believe in the tools that they're gonna show me that I watched so many people lose their hair lose their teeth get their throats burnt out they call it they call it a burning and chemo and radiation when they actually zapped the wrong part and you get these burn blisters and I've helped people with Agent Orange issues - aids dementia ulcerative colitis Crohn's disease that list can go on forever at the end of the day it's poor diet negative efforts and negative community around people and once you give them positive good night's rest and you get rid of all those ailments they wake up the next day to eat better they want to do things and have fun with their life I had to go do my own research I thought people in my my surrounding there's a group on Facebook called I love San Bernadino and I live in the city of San Pertino and I was like well why not reach out to the community and see if there's people within my community that can help me or know somebody who might be able to help me and that's exactly what I did I said my mom's really ill I have all these things that they gave me at the dispensary and I don't know what to do with them can somebody send me an angel who can just say this is how much you give them or this is how much she shouldn't take or don't give her that you know somebody just gave me some information and a gentleman by the name of Robert Porter he was like I know somebody he doesn't live here right now but he I'm gonna contact him he's in town and I'm gonna talk to him about what's going on in your situation and he might be able to help you and I was like thank you anything's better than nothing within a few days he said he had spoken to Eddie and he said that I told him about your mom and he gave me some medicine you're gonna give it in on the back of this package it says how to administer it to your mom and I was just like what wait what okay um crazy okay cool you know and I was excited because like I was like I got an answer it's not the answer but it's an answer and I might be able to help her within 15 minutes of administering the medicine to my mom she was um she was happy and my one and a half year old niece was able to interact with her and it didn't make my mom sad or paint in pain because she was just it complete she was like and then she pulled me aside and it was like cannabis is what's gonna cure people amethyst don't forget that because she could feel it she told me when you give me I was giving her dilaudid on every four hours and then I was giving her a fentanyl patch and I was giving her so many so many medications and I put those things on her and I watched her go from chill to just watch her feel like she's like scared the mom are you okay no I feel not okay III don't want to die I don't want to die I'm like mom you're not gonna die I'm just making you feel out of paint no that's not what I feel though I feel out of pain but I feel like I'm dying and she said with cannabis it brought life back into her and so for me that right there was all I needed to know like I knew my mom wasn't going to live but I knew that she had life in her before she died so she was she was better than if she was on opiates and so that was probably the best healing for us as a family because she didn't want to leave us in turmoil and hurt in having a void and she wasn't when she left we were all there with her and she she we knew she went well because she was in a state of mind where we knew she was okay", "Yd3zaoaN1eM": "you're about to witness a video of an elderly lady who no longer recognizes her living room nor even her own son you don't know [Music] this lady is not just getting old her memories are being erased by a disease that's causing her brain to physically wither away and die Alzheimer's disease within a normal healthy brain there are cells that pass messages from one area to another when grandparents speak about the good old days it is thanks to these cells connecting their memory hub with their centers of speech if you look closely you'll see that the message must pass across a small space between each cell in Alzheimer's patients this space becomes clogged by an abnormal structure and communication comes to a halt furthermore the long thin part of the cell that the message passes across is destroyed from within due to a change in an important protein this causes the cell to shrivel and die leaving behind what scientists call and neurofibrillary tangles the tangle in conjunction with the blocks that prevent a cellular communication are the two features that define alzheimers disease there are currently no effective treatments for Alzheimer's though there's one promising frontier cannabis chemicals in cannabis including THC and now at the frontier of Alzheimer's research because they have potential to reduce and prevent the formation of our Simas plaques if plaque formation can be slowed or halted as recent studies suggest and if patients can be diagnosed early enough then the potential exists to prevent debilitating and lethal forms of Alzheimer's you cannabidiol another cannabis chemical has been found effective in improving symptoms in mouse models of Alzheimer's a recent Australian study concluded that the mouse model findings could easily be followed up in clinical trials since CBD is well tolerated by humans despite the promising research however the news is not all good in July 2015 a series of media articles reported that cannabis had been proven ineffective in treating Alzheimer's disease the only problem with the headlines is that they were not true the study they were referring to was commissioned to determine the safety of THC pills for persons with dementia as well as other technical data the conclusion reached was that the pills were safe and that further human studies with higher doses were warranted thankfully not everyone is fooled by the headlines you were pacing back and forth not believing this was your house and you had to get out of here [Music] [Music]", "DzG52iitQFA": "hey guys my name is Justin Marshall and I want to teach you all how to fight cancer to win see four years ago I was diagnosed with late stage 4 metastatic colon cancer and the doctors up there in Canada gave me three months to live because the colon cancer had spread to my lungs and there was about 40 tumors in there nickel dime and quarter size that just weren't going away so I decided after talking to a friend who told me about cannabis oil to learn how to make it a dear friend of mine up there in Medicine Hat Alberta taught me how to make this very special cannabis oil I made it that day which was about a week after my diagnosis since then I've been taking a gram a day and here we are four years later and I'm still in remission all the tumors after about six months died they can they kill themselves and they disappeared so I have proof of this through all my doctors and oncologists as a matter of fact I'm teaching doctors and oncologists down here in California how to fight cancer this way because it's become common knowledge that cannabis kills cancer so in my group of videos that I'm going to come out with I'm gonna teach you all how to make the oil how to take the oil meanwhile I'll be teaching you how to live healthy by cutting sugar out of your diet and try to eat a lot of vegetables and tumeric and what not things that are antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties that along in conjunction with the cannabis oil will cure you of cancer just like it did me now I can't promise or guarantee anything but I tell you if you try what I'm doing it might work and if you believe that it's gonna work and you truly believe in the power of cannabis then you know you just might believe yourself into remission well the world of cannabis is changing right now there's huge corporations poses themselves for the upcoming legalization of marijuana which is happening right around the corner pharmaceutical cop these are all interested in the properties of THC and CBD and how they seem to not only heal cancer but also stop epilepsy fits and help people with diabetes just probably 2030 other things so now it's really the time you want to know what's going on in the world of cannabis things are changing fast but first of all I want to teach you how to heal yourself from cancer thank you very much god bless you and have a great night", "-zuJsgr78R8": "every one so it's the eve well nearly midnight probably one of my most important scans in eight years because this is the scan where we know what my future is obviously my first brain tumor eight years ago we then thought we had five years clear we did not those mistakes made and I've actually been progressing that entire time but as you know eventually I stabilized it like I did last year and then since then it's been progressing now when I came off my RSO to go away for a couple of months abroad and I lost my tolerance and also I've completed the 90 days of the Rick Simpson oil protocol so I my dogs are making noises my little babies and when I came off it no longer stable progression like I said on my previous videos with the panic you as well we cleared the brain tumor so quickly that the dead brain tumor cells got eaten by the original tumor or while the second - moment going by the active cancer and it became active again so what we're hoping for now is a good result in the morning now they told me I could never stop this cancer without chemotherapy and even then it's not a long-term solution it always comes back 17 years is the average of our survival rate with combining them both but it always comes back and then and you do it again and again and it destroys you destroys your body your immunity everything your spirit everything so I don't ever want to go there no matter how hard this gets and so we changed to be care oncology they repurposed drugs and I'm back on my hours so I'm building up to a gram a day now I'm only on about a quarter of a gram because it's making me very high but sorry my throat I keep getting fog in my throat oh I'm unable to talk fogs are not part of the protocol it's just very worried about tomorrow and so I just want to share how I'm feeling and what happening because so many people get so worried and anxious by scans and I just want to happy here to tell you that's very normal I don't sleep til 5:00 a.m. that's why I've got these big old dark circles under my eyes I don't sleep a lot that's fine my appetites fine excuse me sorry but I just wanted to share you guys just my worries for tomorrow because of the covet my scans have been delayed two months and this can go one of two ways this can be by delaying my scans for two nearly three months it's given time for this care oncology we purpose drugs and our so to start working again and I'm absolutely praying I've not just cut off the metabolic pathways which are feeding the cancer but I've also started to shrink it in the kill phase so she knows I'm gonna pick it on video so we need to enter the kill phase which is what the IRA so comes in so the Met form and the repurposed drugs they cut off the the sugars and stuff entering the brain the proteins it's cutting off fats cutting off every metabolic pathway to stop this and I realize yesterday you know I'm 37 this year I think I get confused I think so and I've lived with this brain tumor for eight years and I fived I've done things I would never dream of I've achieved things I never dreamed of my cancer was not a curse to me it is for so many but for me it was a blessing because it enabled me to live the life of my dreams and do things I never fought because I was on borrowed time I didn't have 1890 years like someone else you know I had to do my dreams no today because if not had been taken from me and once it didn't matter what I was dying did it really matter if I didn't become this covergirl or getting this film or that film did it matter no because I would have been dead Oh unable to know who I am if I had the radiotherapy I would have know my own name however due to the protocol I chose the cannabis oil I have five I have lived the life of my dreams and if you all got taken away there would be no regrets however I still have a few more dreams left and I want to achieve them which is why I'm praying so hard that this is working but I feel good I feel well even though I don't sleep for my anxiety you know I feel good I won nearly every day I feel good I'm healthy but I've had worse there's been a couple of moments over the last year or two where there was no hope and I lost my faith and I signed those wretched chemo letters twice saying to mom if I'm not stable if I'm no longer winning I will take it for her because she wants me around for a long time and even if it's not the life I choose I could never be that person that stops fighting for my mum because she's my rock and she's my world and she has fought harder than me every step of the way last year we honest-to-god thought I was gonna die I had ambulances most days we think it was purge in the cancer just before I became stable I was on the floor shaking flowing up once I felt blood because it just tore my throat puking so much they took me to a me and I was in a hospital for three days unable to drink unable to eat and they want to put the sickness box into my arm which carry around in a bag and I said no way we're putting this little box on my body that's gonna inject me with an anti sickness all day every day to the point it's not addressing the cause we don't know why I'm sick and I will never ever get that out of my body because when do you know you'd no longer need it and the doctors didn't understand me so I said no and I went home and I tried a milkshake and I spat it out I sicked it all over my mother and I smashed the glass on the floor and so many times my mum had to clean up after my anger and frustration I punched through a wall I broke my hand in four places out of frustration that I could not eat and on my Facebook memories yesterday I'd celebrated by three chicken nuggets I know I shouldn't be in them but that's all in a week my way it was 60kg within a month I was 40 kg I did not eat and then it got to the point I could not drink I stopped waiting at 40 kg I was a skeleton the pictures would shock you and before I was gonna die and my mum cried and she begged and she screamed in my face I had to eat and I just couldn't and then I stopped drinking you know I would throw up every drink I had it would just spill out of my mouth I was throwing up bile and I had ambulances most days and there was nothing anyone could do for me and we think it was just all the cancer purging from all the things I did the cannabis the hoxsey and so on the clinic from Mexico i poisoned my body in order to get well to stabilize myself to get healthy which is exactly what chemo is but I used natural alternatives my hair fell out I could sit on my hair you know and my skin was rash all over and I was so sick but I got better I eat so much these days you know so much fear today I add a barbecued I don't really eat me I normally have vegan alternatives and I ate for about five people for Part II and I weigh 56 kg again I'm healthy I'm fit I'm strong I'm building muscle you know I got better just when we thought that I was gonna die we got better and then we stabilized and it was probably the best day of my life and then even before that the year before the doctors gave me one month to live if I didn't start radiotherapy and chemotherapy one month and I'm here two years on so whatever happens tomorrow with my results we know I've had worse those two instances a month to live there's no way they could tell me I've got a month to live now I feel so good not well not a portion of the former carry my fitness my health my energy I feel healthy and I probably feel better than a lot of my friends you don't have cancer and don't have the ailments I have due to the fact they have bad diets so I was snotty know what a train wreck and I'm so thankful to everyone who supports me whose fundraise to saved my life and I really really pray that the world who was watching me looking to me for Faith Hope and all these people that want to see me fighting and surviving this because it means hope for them and their families I really pray that I've got good news for you tomorrow I might not update you right away because me and my mom we need to process this whatever happens we need to attack this we need to have our next stage of planning we need to think what do I do next whether it's good or bad but I will not lose my faith I will not lose my hope I will not touch those wretched pharmaceutical drugs you know I will stay on this path for the rest of my life no matter how long that is and so I just want to say to you thank you am I scared for tomorrow I'm past scared what's done is done I can't do any more other than just keep fighting every day to take all these medicines look at all these boxes of medicines just keep taking them no matter how sick they sometimes make me and hopefully just keep five and hopefully I've got some good news for you so I'll keep you updated sorry for the tears and it's not a new year the folks in here and I'll forget about you I really feel hand on heart I am meeting this I really feel I don't have anyone spiritual spiritual they into numerology and stuff I'm seeing every sign that I've shrunk this and we've got a phone appointment because you can't even go in oncology because of the kind of it and I just so badly want to hold this radio reported my hand and see what the radiographers have said I don't want to see my brain on that screen I want to see this tumor and I cannot unless was breaking me so in less than 12 hours I will have my results good or bad and if they're bad I just have to hold on to that but I've been in a worse position twice and I've held on and I've got better and I thrived and I wanted to share that message to all of you as well that maybe if you're worried about results it's not the worst we've had it's not the worst you're gonna have so thank you all and I've been advising lots of people in brain tumors today do share my YouTube channel on your social media of anyone who you feel might benefit from learning about cannabis oil and repurposed drugs panic you and everything like that because I saw some on social media today saying THC doesn't help cancer and I don't want to argue with these fools this sheep you know but I just want to hold my hands up and say I am here alive fiving because of cannabis oil I am pain-free I have no no no pain when I broke my hand like I said a minute ago my friends all said that's gonna happen the cannabis wears off and I said cannabis never wears off I'm completely pain-free migraines have gone I never spell to open my eyes each day for pain and just even jogging now I could barely walk for each step was agony I mean the counselors three-quarters of my brain with the swelling edema and cancerous tumor and I haven't had migraines in a year but one single headache you know it's a miracle cannabis oil has saved my life it's given me a quality of life and I really really employ everyone to add it into their diet healthy or not had I not known my cannibal my concert grand back for those five years and wasn't using cannabis order to prevent err I've been the ground now so please do place your belief in that even if your belief is not in yourself or in me and we're gonna show the world that this works so in 12 hours I will know my safe please please if you say a little prayer for me and everyone else fighting this

fail you so goodnight god bless and sending love and courage to you all goodbye stay safe in these current times everyone and you'll see me again soon", "2aegxybCxY4": "hi Kenna lovely here doing a video today for everyone on YouTube and my blog again on RSO oil there's been a lot of talk out there about Rick Simpson oil and I wanted to have a conversation about it Rick Simpson is a man from Canada who discovered that concentrated amounts of cannabis oil could cure his cancer he also helped the whole bunch of other patients cure their cancer so basically it's cannabis bud that's cooked down through different forms of solvents and from that point it's cooked down I like to use a food grade alcohol base this is made by North Star genetics they also have new RSO caps that I've got samples of to try but their alcohol based food grade and I believe that that's the safest for our body I know that our bodies can absorb alcohol and when it's condensed down and extracted such residual amounts of alcohol or left that I'm not worried about it in consuming RSO oil if you've been reading about RSO oil you know that the program for cancer is 60 to 90 grams that you're supposed to eat 60 to 90 grams in as quick of a time as you humanly can do and please if anybody tells you you cannot get high or you don't get high that is not true you do get high um I recommend if you're using RSO oil for cancer treatment that you get and um please get one that's been lab tested please don't give anybody your money and hope that they're going to go make it for you please don't buy it off the internet please don't think CBD oil off the internet is Rick Simpson oil please learn that there is a difference or you're going to be wasting precious this time and valuable money so I live in California I'm best blessed to be a medical marijuana patient and have access to a dispensary so I get to go there just like a regular pharmacy and pick up the concentrated cannabis oil or RSL oil as one would need um my oil comes from North Star genetics as I talked about they make a high THC oil in a 1 gram syringe and a CBD to THC RSO oil which kind of gives you the best of both worlds I really believe in sort of a one-to-one ratio for if you're fighting cancer now RSO oil is used for a lot more than cancer juice for chronic pain it's used for inflammation it's used for seizures its use for nausea it's just more concentrated than if you were to smoke the cannabis flower so you eat like a half a grain to a grain size of rice back to the cancer treatment if you are using RSO oil i know rick simpson believes in starting with 1/2 a grain to a grain size of rice at night that's a good way to start you'll sleep it off and get a great night's sleep and maybe not feel the high as much but i've learned that cancer cells grow every eight to ten hours and so i recommend and have been doing this for five or six years now and have been really recommending to patients that they eat their oil even in smaller increments every four to six hours if possible and so one way to do it is just to put a little on your finger and to eat it some people like to put it in a little piece of bread and then swallow it and now large stargenetics has come out with prefilled capsules for you so you all you have to do is swallow it and each capsule comes with 45 milligrams of THC 25 milligrams of CBD which is just great point six grams of CBN a little bit of CBG and some CB c CB see there's a lot of great stuff in this it looks like the cap is about half full I would you know if you are starting a program this is something that I would probably if you are cannabis user go ahead and take one expect you're going to feel it or if you don't want to you could also pull it apart and just take a little bit out these were given to me as a sample and I'm going to be sampling them soon but I I really really want to emphasize Rick Simpson oil is fantastic I personally use it for my eye issues I know I don't have glasses on I have contacts on but I'm really really nearsighted I have glaucoma that's caused from being so nearsighted it's not cause from eye pressure so it's affecting my optic nerves I also have extremely thin retinas and have problems with my eyes in the fact that they're saying I could go blind 20 years younger than I should but ironically I have the most healthiest oxygenated thin retinas that my retina specialists have seen I think it's all the cannabis and cannabis oil I consume if you have any questions please hit me up on my blog please write on YouTube I'm at canna lovey on IG you know me here at wwk a critic blog spot.com but I am passionate about our soil North Star genetics I give them a 5 thumbs up if I had 5 thumbs they're fantastic their products are great their stuff is sold at Sonoma patient group in Santa Rosa California if you are a Sonoma County or a California resident give us a call check us out and learn all you can about RSO oil please be a good consumer please don't just buy something online thinking it is what they say it is do your research ask questions ask people in the cannabis community call dispensaries even to ask them what to buy but educate yourself and I highly recommend noir stargenetics have a great day", "ICSsCVtQ2gg": "all right doctor a from North Side ghetto STL Ferguson Missouri what people who don't know nothing is at is at look the role of cannabinoid receptors and renal diseases this is pubmed.gov if you're not familiar with it it is where scientists post the results and the government can hide it from you so what I want you to know is this site is important because you can find a lot of death now we know the endocannabinoid system is important so we're gonna see what they found our results we gather data regarding the current states of knowledge of the cannabinoid system in normal renal physiology and in various experimental whatever that word is especially diabetes we also received data obtained and models of diabetes and obesity as well as non meta metabolic models of renal fibrosis when cb1 that's the navin oi receptor blockers and cb2 agonist were used we also found very few data are available so far regarding to cellular pathways and filed downstream of the cannabinoid receptors in the development of renal fibrosis but we do know that the cannabinoids run on those receptors and that the cannabinoids that are pure heal overall we found that the cannabinoid receptors are a promising target in the development of renal disease and fibrosis particularly in chronic kidney disease and diabetes moving right along same site to give you some more insight the role of cannabinoids signaling and acute and chronic kidney disease I'm gonna skip down so that you can grab some information you can find these pages on your own and read for yourself but please understand that a lot of times they're trying to create synthetic drugs to duplicate the drugs and naturally I mean the the elements that naturally run on the cannabinoids a human body and these synthetic drugs are toxic and have always been dangerous and they have can't duplicate what the Creator has created for the maintenance of the human body so read right here where you will see the newly established role of the endocannabinoid system in the kidney might have therapeutic relevance as former college seal from a colleague to Co modulation of the endocannabinoid system see using drugs or modulated has rental productive effects in experimental animals raising hopes for a future potential applications and humans but it would make more sense that are using synthetic to just use the damn natural element and heal yourself there's been another report cases of acute kidney injury associated with the use of synthetic cannabinoids that appear to have higher potency and rate of toxicity than natural cannabis important this is an array it's just something I would like to mention here now I've never been a big fan of CBD I know most people don't really know all of this but THC is the cancer killer and this is what you got to remember now CB in you know in hormones driven cancers such as breast cancer CBD can have some good benefits there's no question but in most of the cancers I've seen you know one cancer bowel cancer whatever brain cancer the higher the THC level the better and I've always said so these people trying to force to the Siebels down your throat and CBD is a buzzword don't fall for the trick but check this out from Rick you know it's it's a lot like dr. Michelin said you know it's the entourage effect of all these different cannabinoids working together but you see today they're trying to separate them you know CBD tea or CBN and all these different cannabinoids there's well over a hundred of them you know the drug industry would like to separate everyone and saying well this is good for that and this is good for something else it's a bunch of nonsense take the damn extract and I mean it might make you high in the beginning I won't deny that but getting high never hurt no one and uh the thing is what once you become accustomed to an extract you become immune to it that's how I get people up usually within a month up to a lota gram every 24 hours but if you get up to that dosage and if you get a different extract from a different strain and you take that same dosage you're gonna get as high as kite but again nobody ever died forget about all these cannabinoids are important and so is CBD but like I said never underestimate you know the you know the THC is definitely needed any extract it doesn't contain THC I don't even I don't even consider to be you know hip extract you heard it from Rick himself hey talk to you in a minute listen this is it it's the same for all major diseases you needed about sixty grams it costs but you gotta have that there's no way around it listen to Rick listen to Rick listen to Rick so we all have to find our own levels and comfort zones when people are taking the oil to treat serious disease or just to reset their bodies back to a healthy state I suggest to them that they ingest 60 grams of high-grade oil as quickly as possible for the average person it usually takes about 90 days to adjust this amount of oil but I have seen people I've seen people in just 60 grams in 30 days and cure their terminal in a month now we have seen this and more than once this is very potent so you start off with little tiny doses if I'm half the size of a grain of dry rice just little tiny doses three to four times a day and then after about four days increase your dose and as time goes on you about every four days just keep increasing the object would be like for them to ingest about 60 grams of this high-grade oil as quickly as they can now in most cases usually within third of their three months they can take it but I've had patients take the whole treatment and in like a month people with terminal cancer is cured in a month California right now I'm in three states all the time and it's people I find them all the time they're being healed at being healthy helping their family members it's different things going on in this lady here this video was called him works kicks kidney disease he had great results that are tested back you can find that by searching but listen once you say stop producing urine over six months ago she starts to realize wait the CBD oil there might be something to it that might be what's working for him so all in all he's doing phenomenal on his journey function has increased more he's it's not gonna return back to full kidney function but his kidneys have improved they're still working and this time a year and a half ago he was in kidney failure his kidneys were operating at 3% he was producing zero urine and he was he was having their called T is mini-strokes because of it because he had fluid overload and his blood pressure was about 260 over I think was 130 and I was extremely high and dangerous it was throwing him and having mini strokes maybe if you're angry get off my life he was throwing him into you know many strokes he had high blood pressure high cholesterol his ocular levels were through we're here at red blood cell pop red blood cells vessels popping daily and he was just an overall bad state he went into a diabetic coma for about 32 hours and when he woke up they were like who has end-stage kidney failure your kidneys are not operating and then today his doctor tells us that he has improved kidney function he should have not been producing urine at this state and he is still producing two full liters of urine a day which is normal for an adult male his age so I mean this is just my boy I had to come on and share it with you I really hope whoever is playing angry faces it's an accident anyways I really would hop on and share this information with you because it was truly amazing to hear this and you know I'm the firmament firm cannabis activists I've seen what it can do for me for my family but I longed for it and my answer for almost my entire family I've seen what it can do and so to get this news today just really really was exciting for us thank you for watching I had to share it with you", "DT7arDe8qjs": "cannabis oil cures stomach cancer a new prostate cancer deoxyribonucleic acid DNA genetic material test identifies the one in 100 men who are six times more at risk of developing the life-threatening disease researchers identified 63 new genetic mutations that are linked to the condition which they combined with more than 100 DNA variants that were already known to cause the condition to create the test which could cost as little as 30 pounds the findings were published in the journal Nature Genetics one percent of men carry many of these risky genetic variations putting them at a much higher risk of prostate cancer than the average male a study found today these DNA mutations tend to occur in cells that regulate communication between the immune system and other parts of the body which could pave the way for new treatments according to the researchers the scientists from the Institute of cancer research iciar London are planning to assess whether investigating the DNA of men's saliva samples taken in GP practices could identify at-risk men such men are currently identified via a blood test that assesses their prostate specific antigen PSA levels which rise when the cancer occurs yet results can be skewed by vigorous exercise urine infections and certain medications the researchers analyzed the genetic codes of nearly 80 thousand men with prostate cancer and more than 61 thousand without the disease results suggest each DNA mutation individually has a small effect on men's prostate cancer risk however the combined effect could be dramatic those at the highest risk are five point seven times more likely to develop the disease while people in the top 10% are 2.7 times more at risk than the average man meanwhile a 52 year old mother who took cannabis oil to battle her terminal cancer has been given the all clear by doctors according to the report published Joyce Smith was told she would only have six weeks to live when she was diagnosed with incurable stomach and bowel cancer in August 2016 in a desperate attempt to defy expectations she began taking a cannabis oil that contained THC which is illegal in the United Kingdom she is believed to have bought it online and after a roller coaster 2 years she found out on Monday morning that she was cancer free and with no longer to have a chemotherapy mrs. Smith from Coventry said I am going to party for the rest of my life I have got to be the only person in the world who have survived this I keep pinching myself to see if this is real I am being monitored every three months but other than that I have no more treatment plant Miss Smith was told that she would have little longer than a month left to live unless she started chemotherapy to buy her more time she started having treatment every two weeks for three days but had to have the line that delivered her chemotherapy taken out after she developed sepsis MS Smith was unaware her friends had been researching an alternative cancer cure online until she was handed a cannabis based tablet out of the blue she admitted that she didn't want to take it at first because she didn't know what it was but did so anyway in the hope of a cure the effects of THC the compound that causes the high left her feeling drunk miss Smith claimed as she struggled to speak and words just slurred out Miss Smith then started researching cannabis oil online and discovered it had worked for other sufferers even though scientists are dubious after taking regular doses of cannabis oil containing THC which is currently illegal in the UK her inoperable tumors almost completely disappeared Miss Smith spoke about her battle against the cancer with the oil in March when scans showed just a small amount of the disease left in her stomach she was hopeful then that the cancer would completely disappear with continued cannabis oil use and miss Smith said she hadn't stopped smiling since her appointment with her consultant on Monday and said the news has yet to sink in ms Smith has received thousands of messages from fellow sufferers desperate to know more about her miracle cure which has left doctor stunned also a mother of two claimed in February that she has cured her aggressive breast cancer by taking one drop of cannabis oil containing THC every day"}
