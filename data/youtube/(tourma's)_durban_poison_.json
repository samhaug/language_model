starting to perk straight up and some of them are starting to claw so i was told to add a little bit of sulfur to this so i did go get some micronized sulfur and laid about a handful underneath the plants and scratched it in well just this one and hopefully it helps out now i did lose one durbin poison earlier in the year to this issue there's no mites on this plant this one's just got me

a taste test cannabis pre-roll review we uh we recently visited the grocery dispensary g-r-o-w-c-e-r-y uh here in los angeles and i picked up a couple pre-rolls so i went in there i said give me the freshest drop give me some of the best of the best the budtender i forget her name but she recommended two of their most freshest and popular house strains we've got the durbin poison right here and then we've got the tri-fi cookies from right here as well so the grocery coming in with their own house brand indica pre-roll for the tri-fi 17.93 um produced on 1229 so that's pretty pretty recent and then the durbin poison um what are we looking at here 25.67 thc produced on december 7th and so these are really fresh today i'm only going to be reviewing one of them we will have a second episode where i feature the second uh pre-roll um for now we are going to start off with the durbin poison this is one of my favorite strings this is the strain of the year in high times back in 2016. i've sold a lot of durban poison i've tried a lot of durban poison i absolutely love it and so i'm confident that i'll be able to identify if it's not only like an accurate strain profile but you know i can kind of give some perspective as to the quality too uh cannabinoids at twenty eight point four nine percent it says sativa um packaged by high pack www.highdashpack.com there is a little qr code for you to take a picture of to see the test results and some other information but for now we're going to dive right in the way that we do the taste test reviews is going to be slightly different from the west coast we tour you guys might have heard me say one hit review two hits you know three hits occasionally this is an entire product review we will be filming the entire review in terms of the whole pre-roll smoke um it might take a little bit longer but you guys are more than welcome to fast forward to the end of the video or just check out the comments in the description there all right so we are getting some sweet piney flavor in terms of the scent this is what the pre-roll looks like i personally really enjoy durban poison i've smoked again a lot of this it's not packed too tightly the dry hint is citrusy sweet sour with a nice trapinoline or pinene profile i'm going to give it a like shout out to have a sweet high distribution for the lighter all right you guys so in terms of this pre-roll dry hit tasted delicious the first hit tasted good i don't necessarily know what kind of paper it is i'm getting that raw paper vice but it's not it's not listed it's not harsh it was smooth first two hits first eight and a half there's very very nice light sweet flavor i personally don't think that this is going to be very much of a harsh smoke it's significantly more potent than the other pre-roll it was roughly 11 more cannabinoids it's delicious it's energetic it's kind of clarifying in terms of the high it's clear-headed i don't feel the racy heart attack anxiety happening german poison has been known to give people anxiety it's just it's one of those sativas that actually works as a land race train land race means it's one of the original strains from the geographical location as to where it originated from i believe durbin comes from a region in africa which gives it a very racy sativa desert type of cannabis qualities um reaching for the sun sweet light kind of citrusy not an indica not in the mountains not dark not bushy this is going to be a light light green it's delicious i absolutely love it absolutely love it see if we can't smoke do a little bit i want to know what it's like down here it's easy for the weed to taste good up at the top but after the smoke a little bit the profile does change some of the resin might burn down the paper could could cause a change i see a little bit of the resin here kind of going down the paper so it's terpe it's definitely terpe we have a 10-point review system in terms of the categories you can get uh individual points in each of the categories uh we got a hundred point review system in terms of like the west coast we tour and things like that and so the way that we're gonna do it for the taste test um i'll give you guys a hundred point taste test review you guys have to read the full article the full the full description to get that information um and the reason is is because when you guys go hang out on our website there's tons of other content and so we can only deliver so much via instagram linkedin you know social media so got to get you guys all that information on the website it's delicious it's not burning here's a little color in terms of the ash is it white no is there some white yes but for the most part it is slightly darker um it may or may not create a harsher smoke people definitely say that the darker the ash the harsher the smoke but i've had super turpy super flavorful cannabis before flour pre-roll you name it and sometimes it just gets really resinous the terp glands just really like leak or drip or kind of diffuse through the flower through the joint and sometimes it's harsh sometimes the turpiere the flower the harsher it can be obviously you want to get a good dry good cure to remove the harshness to remove some of the chlorophyll and things that are going to still be remaining in there in terms of various plant chemicals and things but this is a quality experience and as a nine dollar pre-roll i paid 18 i think 1850 1860 for the two again full grams when i start to think about a score out of 10 i mean obviously the joint isn't all the way through i'll probably cut it this video short a little bit down to when it gets right around there past this bulk middle area well we got presentation we've got a peel we've got color taste smell potency uh more information you know i really like having the qr code there i'm gonna check that out after the episode trying to think um would i recommend it i i really would for a nine dollar house pre-roll this is very potent i can understand why this is one of the more popular products at the grocery you guys can see how to spell grocery right there as i mentioned earlier g-r-o-w-c-e-r-y uh they're they're located over in kind of like um west l.a um this is probably the best way to describe it i don't exactly know the area too well being that i'm you know new uh to california are still relatively new but i really enjoy really enjoy the inside of the store it's a beautiful location uh the staff the security very friendly the uh the outside has is it's not too dirty or messy it's not too like you know it doesn't have a trap vibe at all um yeah i think i think score out of 10 and score out of a hundred i'm sitting at a 90 i'm i'm sitting at a 94 and the reason is is i want to know what kind of paper this is i think that contributes to the experience it's not a branded paper over here in terms of the filter the tip so i want to know a little bit more information in terms of that but taste test i mean this is what i want on german poison this is what i want it's affordable it's sweet it's sour it's piney and so if you want a very clear-headed energizing euphoric sativa durbin poison from grocery is gonna be for you less than ten dollars super deal make sure you guys check them out score out of a hundred ninety three maybe a ninety four um final score 9.3 9.4 that's where i'm at i love you guys for so much you know so much all the love we just wrapped up the west coast we tour please go follow and subscribe to that playlist go watch all

beautiful it was so fragrant out of the jar this i don't really talk about the smells too much out of the jar but this one was a beautiful beautiful smell out of the jar i mean open the jar and i smelled it i'm like oh my goodness i can't wait to try this and what is it this is something called durbin poison and it's from a cultivator called up north and we've reviewed one other up north strain and someone made a comment that up north durban poison was good now over all these years of trying flour durbin poison was never good for me i tried it a bunch of times and i never found one that i thought was magic ever and so those are not flowers i would usually buy but because it's been so many years since i tried it and because they have better cultivation better everything right now uh and it was a tip flower i decided to give it a shot so today is going to be durban poisons day and i'm telling you this thing is just so beautiful unbelievable so let me load my one more scooper into vapor cup straw i got two in there and i just put one more in there and we're gonna tamper i just love this thing there's no amount of don't love i can't wait to get done with my daily responsibility so i can enjoy that incredible i'm going to stick it down in my vapor cup and just that amount of flour can last you 10 minutes crazy so anyway we're going to get back to talking about durbin poison so it comes in a box with all the information and this flower has 27 thc and it was packaged on 1 20 21 and i need to get my uh magnifying glass these texts are getting smaller and smaller something's going on anyway and it also comes in a nice glass jar and so we appreciate that and so we're going to check it out today so i've got this cup set to 325 let me just pump it up to 3 30 i really like 3 30. and so when i do these reviews i reviewed the flower the day before and today i'm just doing a short video about it i don't want to get super stoned because i can't give you the information better but today it's durbin poison's day so it's ready so let's check it out durbin poison at a vapor cup at 300 330 degrees let's do that again so i really like jack herrera and jackyar has a very specific jackareer taste and this flower is like a jack herrera plus i'm not going to explain it more than that you know what jack herrera tastes like this is like a jacquard with a little bit of a pungent finish and it is very smooth and wonderful actually this flower was an absolutely fantastic vape this flower also had great focus and that's one of my main things i like is focus and this flower actually has it this flower is medium strong and it was a little hazy to me meaning it had focus but you still had some brain fog but it was reasonable i love doing it so we're looking for the best at least the best of the flowers that i'm looking for which is heavy flowers with focus that can grin us out that can give us the perma-grin smile and what do we think of durban poison by up north i'm giving this flower an h65 this flower it was good has 27 thc i liked it but there are other sativa flowers that i think are even better than this one so it rates in an 865 which means that it's better than an average flower and it's good if you like up north and you like uh focus flowers this is a really good flower to try it's a good one i'm the doctor if you want to see vapor cup you can see it at vaporcup.com read the reviews i'm telling you everyone's got their own reason for loving this thing i've got mine too it's just changed everything i do about flour i get to use it much more times during the day i love flour i love this thing and you can see it at vaporcup.com if you want to see all my favorite strains they're on wheat entertainment i really uh tried a lot a lot of flowers and i'm telling you if you follow those lists you're gonna on the road to better flowers thanks for joining in the flowers are getting better because all the tips thank you very much for the tips if you got one for me post it below the video i'll be back tomorrow party on my [Music] friends", "BL9bMC8aDNs": "I'm Russ Gareth and the prince in this life I was born in Cape Town 48 years ago

about life and I am privileged and honored to have led to this battle it's our time time so our task is towards making the people of South Africa see the value of cannabis and to change the conversation away from recreational drug use into industry how do we make cannabis work for the people of South Africa let's make use of our people you know the fact that people are burning in order to improve their lives people don't want to look for handouts people want to work for themselves and what cannabis we are going to give them an opportunity to do that South Africa is the place that is the most suitable for cannabis growth on earth we have 300 out of 365 days that are considered sunshine days in South Africa which means that we can grow 3 crops in this country and the ability to make medicine from the cannabis that we grow in South Africa it's tremendous and that is what we are going to export to other parts of the world and that is how we're going to repatriate the currency

"[Music] well guys welcome to the CCC I'm Shane dam and we are back for a stranger view today a little double strand review a double strand review we've actually got two really really nice flour samples here to check out for you guys from the herb shop and carros that's right I stopped by the herb shop the other day they literally had this stuff literally just came out of the back and got done curing like as I walked in there it was really fresh stuff and I just broke down this Durban poison they were literally taking off the last of their old batches and bringing out the fresh stuff so this is like the first of their weed to the shelves from their new grow and I gotta give him props man yeah I have here in front of me the what they're calling kid cush I couldn't really find much wrong though yeah there's nothing about kid cush anywhere online I talked to one of the guys there and he gave me a little bit of background on it it's basically and it seems dead on when you check it out it's basically a some kind of variation of a pre 98 bubba kush yeah it honestly just looks to me like some of the best 3 98 I've ever seen doesn't as far as the structure you know it could be the closest thing you're gonna find online if you actually try to do a search for kid Kush is like the Oregon kid blackberry cush and because of common words but we've smoked a ton of blackberry blackberry with using California we've smoked a ton of pre 98 Bubba this is that pretty much any boat it's got the it's got the structure you know it's got the super caked up like pre 98 98 on roids yeah it's got the color mmm is on steroids for sure yeah as you see that this stuff is just absolutely covered in frost probably could not be clicked anymore I would love to see this this particular flower it's just as far as extraction I bet this would make some awesome oil yeah probably full melt as well but it has a ton of tiny little heads that instead of like bigger heads you know it's got a ton of tiny little heads yeah it's not real oily so that you'll might not be too well - good good but it's another one of like on the plant like Bubba it's another one of those ones that has you know real frosty and her leaves and stuff like that so that kind of helps make up for that trooper hacking but the trim is super all I'm trying to say is this stuff is just absolutely beautiful to look at which is because of the way it shines yeah and what we got two joints rolled up here I have the pre 98 no no kid oh and then Dan has some bourbon pointer important obviously this is a sativa dominant it smells kind of like a XJ 13/9 Jack Herer but it's a little more sweet where's Jax a little more spicy you know at least that's what I get from it it kind of tastes similar to like a xj 13 super frosty though the dry hit is super super hazy you know tell me how business Michael white gummy bear mm-hmm that's Mike that's super like I mean it smells like artificial fruity but just super super fruity and like citrusy yeah it's definitely different from the the poison that's more definitely more hazy more Jackie but I love that Turkey that makes good oil it's just hot yeah I was just gonna say oh I was just drooling over that what kind of oil that would make but I would probably if I had my choice of a problem to see just one first actually yeah just cuz that sweet sweet candy smell like this would probably swish really good for rosin two balls in there and both of these both these strains I don't know I didn't see any kind of test results or anything on this but I would expect really really high THC so real fruity yes this is this is pre 98 through and through I don't know if they said it was a pre 98 cross meaning 398 millions of something else or if it was you know just a particular cut or you know if it's just bringing onion or whatever you just said there's some pre 98 in the background but that's all I'm kidding true and through that derma is really sweet though we got to basically the reason I picked these two strains one because they look at us and two is good good for video purposes because they're complete opposites we got a heavy in deke over here we got interested he was dominant over there this is gonna give you a complete different kind of buzz and that would give you so it's kind of gonna be interesting to see you mixing the two oh I'm sorry about these ones this one's better in the d'haran I'm gonna be honest I don't know or maybe it's just such a I don't know maybe it's such a different change in the palate like that one has a more that one has a more full flavor but this one has a kind more of a sharp like fruity flavor that kind of lingers a little bit longer it was just so we're going from that like hazy you know Jackie taste to this like real deep bubble taste you know yeah SS like complete opposites as far as smell you know flavor case you know that whole profile and then the medicinal effects and just the effects the buzz it's just completely it's definitely 398 - I don't look at all I'd also kind of reminds me of like a really really really good sweet master Chris almost you know like it's like almost kind of like a pre 98 with a master condition there yeah I love don't be shy to come it this way I love the lime green look at this this here in the Durban yeah I love I've always loved be like this that's just as light lime greenish could be tasty though I gotta say both of these are manicured really really well I got to give props to the to the growers and the trimmers on these parlour you know you can tell it was pulled just the right time it wasn't all beat up in the turn process yeah and I like when I hold a bud up like that and I can still see the hairs sticking off of it you know what I mean it hasn't been sitting in a turkey bag hasn't been moved from one bag to the next it just makes it feel you know it's just nice to have something that feels so direct from the plant you know you are just like fresh medicine you know yeah and the Cure on that bubb couldn't be any air I mean the trim on that bubba couldn't be any better and the curious whoa like i said this stuff they literally had curing in the back like and bringing it out to put it on the shelf as i walked in so I was pretty stoked that I was able to get a fresh batch of their stuff being it this is the first stuff I found on the show from the herb shop I have smoked their flowers before they usually do have pretty good flowers they grow up in any coach that's pretty nice as well me personally I would rate the bubbler just a little higher I've always been a good guy though I've always admitted that so I mean the buzz on the pre 98 has always been really had just Bubba in general you know it's just another another one of the coaches master has been one that has never really hit me as hard and that's probably for a lot of people that's probably why it's faded and brought the popularity Alonso og imbaba are just always gonna be staples because they they always get the job done yeah we're gonna rake these I mean I yeah I mean that it's hard to hate on yeah I'm on good weed you know especially alcohol our attitude because it's hard it's really hard to find weeds it's not super dry day and like a lot yet that's one thing I was gonna say like this a lot of weed maybe this good but getting it this fresh from a collective is something that is pretty hard to time to make that possible yeah so that's definitely a plus if a lot of people grow really good weed and then they get lazy with the cure of the trim process that definitely didn't happen here so yeah we bring the ashtray until well oh well but uh this is some long wait ten out of ten yeah we're bait I would say time for sure thank you guys for joining us for the other video that's who I am you know who he is I'm Dan see you later [Music]", "euJKlnApg_g": "I wish I had the original Durbin poison I mean that went to Amsterdam became something entirely different not entirely different but quite different but the first one that I had had the one that I really liked actually I just lost it it never went to Amsterdam well when today I had two different lines of the Durban I hadn't in a and B and the a happened to be the one that I liked the most it had a a real licorice flavor it had purple stigmas which you just don't see you know purple was some of them with lavender that I wish I had you know what you have now is a much more commercial kind of rendition of what went to Amsterdam part of that problem was that I made a mistake it's really embarrassing but I gave skunk me and Sam Afghani one I gave him the Durban the beeline but the beeline had a little bit of her Africa's aminute and I I didn't realize it when I gave it to him at the time and I didn't find this out until many years later when he told me you had to work with it work with it work with it they get rid of their magnetism right so that was part of what changed that that lying a lot but it's a heavier yielder now it's not as sativa like as it was when I first got it but it was the most unusual plant that I I would say variety that I grow I've seen individuals that were pretty spectacular but as a variety it was just very different from anything else the main thing was this is what a short season it was you know I agree that you are harvesting it here in Oakland in September and when I brought it to New York this is about 60 miles from New York City we were having some of that in August it was that that early so in being from the east originally my whole thing with breeding when I came out here was to develop cultivars that could mature back east before the terrible weather came in because the people I knew who grew up back there they were basically growing leaf are really crappy Mexican that had some flowers right I saw a situation out there where I went back I already had hybrids F ones of things like Afghani and Congolese Afghani in Nigeria and Afghani and Durban and so forth but I went back and I took those sativa crosses and I caused him again to Afghani to try to make sure that we go out the shortness of Afghani in there and they did fantastic out there I mean those people couldn't believe how strong that pot was they had never experienced anything like in their lives", "ql7vsOA6G9s": "you durbin poison is what it's called not this dove and and it comes from South Africa and there's a lot of really cool the reason why I notice is because I've been working with South African strains for years and they have a lot of promise to me that's where we found the THC Valley v levels or we wanted it or we could get it out the concentrates we make from it or special I have 15 South African strains I breed with myself so I have quite a bit of knowledge on Durban poison and the strains that come off of it Durban itself but what we're buying it as is a hybrid real Durban is an outdoor plant but these Durbin's now that we're growing is a sativa that's been indoor iced and regular Durban poison is about a 10-week indoor it'll grow outdoors really well here it'll harvest before winter gets bigger buds outdoors grow difficulty of Durban is about a - it's almost rosy so that average flyering town for Durban is about ten leagues wild urban gets about 10 foot tall tamed Irving gets about six to eight foot tall the average yield for government poisons about eight eight ounces to a pound pros and cons of Durban is it's very good quality genetics cons is the link to the flowering town Durban poison that has a lot of similar strains in Australia but I don't know if I mean America other may be seen on in a Cinderella 99 is kind of close but it doesn't have ta CV [Music] you", "RPICRUtsL8w": "the

things are the smell and the taste oh yeah oh my gosh smells like animal cookies from back in the day when you put your head or when you put your head when you put your nose in the jar to smell it it smells like you just put your head in a huge dark cookie yeah yeah it's amazing in the way they do when you first have smoked it and taste it you don't even know what about it because it doesn't even taste like weed all the way it's so amazing you crazy and what I really need looks really purple but it doesn't remind me anything purple yeah you look at it on the fluorescence right here has a little bit more of a purple tinge to it but when you look at it in person it's kind of more of like bluish silvery lavender blue beautiful amazing color I love the way the orange hair stick out on this thing and I think we can all agree this train is caked up with frog yeah you can just see that it almost looks like it was snowed on or something the strikes are so close together most of them are touching smaller trichomes on this one but absolutely caked oh my god look at that right there yeah it's so crazy for cookies smelling it right now and it smells like straight cookie we're on this [ __ ] hard right now guys this pretty much been you know what we've been smoking probably for 50% of our stash we don't last like month or two yeah this is what I've been on for a minute not them the

yeah definitely a really good buzz as you see right here as you dices it up it's real cakey and like light as you get inside there kind of reminds me of a Sour Diesel full mouth for a moment alone yeah I love the consistency of this stuff just real light and cakey easy to work with you can see we went from that big ball that we had when we started out and now it's just you know light and crumbly something that you can just pack over a bowl there you know you can hit it pretty much any way you want to this smell is pretty much like a sour menthol and the taste is just like the sweet sweet like piney flavor yeah it's kind of kind of taste like licorice to me or you know just something like kind of minty you like liver for some durbin poisons you know an african strains got african origins I've heard that this train just goes great outdoors yeah like I took what sativa does good and hot climates you can see there the pictures are just cakey definitely there's it packed up on a ball getting driving in right here going on I'm not sure how many lines so we even had to go in with the lighter you can see it just melts right up there though couldn't build no almost most down to nothing these very small residue behind we had to go with the lighter because we didn't have any B line and we only had one one with us at the time [Music] others were in the car some but I was a fat rip though it definitely got me it was a little bit of a skinny one and it went up we went ahead and used it here there's the one as you can see stuff definitely bubbles good nose real nice yeah when you take a little rip like that that's you know kind of a fail as part of smoking the whole bowl but you just burn all the goodies at the top you get real real good you know flavor and immediately

new routier thanks for stopping by man so quick little update this is that Durbin poison I just wanted to show y'all I'm about to have to scrap this whole plant so I went on a little trip was away for four or five days and we got loads and loads of rain in the process this plant has just took the [ __ ] and so if you get in close you can see it the blood rot is running I got back and discovered it I cut off everything that was rotten and so that's been a couple days ago now and we're loaded with it again so it's like it's gonna be a complete loss that's what you get fellas down here in Oklahoma this time of year we got a lot of rain and I went on a trip you know ones unable to take care of these this planet like I need it to bud rot full effect", "RUF6G8_GiaE": "hey guys welcome to this video um what i'm going to do is just going to show you i've got a couple of plants here that are all from uh dutch passion um who actually contacted me asking me well we started conversation anyway and they said oh would you like to try some of our genetics and i said well how about for outdoors in the uk what have you got what do you think will work and so they selected selected a couple of strains for me and uh i'll walk you through them um the these are both the same these two here um so these are auto durbin poison um all the same age uh the the medium that these are in is is basically it's a mixture of a lot of stuff that i had um because this all sort of kicked off at the beginning of lockdown and obviously couldn't get out and can buy things um i like to recycle everything anyway uh but it's also nice having fresh new compost and new cocoa but anyway so what i did i just i just mixed mixed up all that i've got lying around basically so there's a mixture there's old cocoa in there and there's perlite and there's compost i think that's it basically a couple of different peat free things sorry waffling again juice so here we go so auto derben poison um been in flower now for about four weeks i think roughly uh as you can see excuse going away um for those that haven't grown outdoor before and when you see sort of in indoor buds um outdoor can look a lot different a lot airier you don't get the full compact uh buds that you get inside so much but it doesn't mean that outdoor weeds no good as you can see this is looking all right um i haven't topped these uh i've talked about this before i've topped autos outside before and then the weather's gone [ __ ] like it is now and then they end up getting stunted so i made a decision uh not to top any of the autos um so yeah anyway going really nice a little bit of color on there as you can see uh this one this one's more colorful and you can see some really nice uh deeper sort of purple colors in this it's interesting different strains sorry same strains but different seeds can produce very different plants there we go so yeah really happy with these going really well um i think i choose the right size root power she wasn't sure if they were going to be a bit big uh they might have been a bit big but yeah so it's all going all right so there we go so that's that one and then move around to here down um so this is an auto duck you see by the leaves uh it's kind of like a stealth weed um the little duck shaped leaves now this one is tiny um my kitten was very i'm sorry my kitten was very kind enough uh to piss on this when it was just a tiny little seedling and it has been stunted ever since at least i thought it was stunted ever since um so what i actually did i popped another seed which is this one here exactly the same hasn't been pissed on and you can already see it's going to be like a a normal sized plant rather than a stunted one like this so yeah so that's cool looking forward to that it's not been pissed on that's just you uh and then this one this is a photo period again was sent to me by them um this oh god is it white snow i'm sorry snow bud so i've got a couple of different snows on the go at the moment so this is snowbird again chosen to to do well outside in the uk um i haven't topped this which maybe i should have done i still could to be honest i topped all the other photos uh because they were getting really tall but this was a lot shorter at the time so see nice nice leaves on it it's grown really well um yes i think i'll just leave it to be honest uh i'm not gonna light dapper or anything like that if i did then i'd get it a lot smaller um so anyway so there we go so a little update on those we've got snow bird one duck little baby duck and then these two here auto durbin poisons so there we go dutch passion peace", "UhR58rpzaCc": "[Music] one what's up this is another episode of squared talk this is your host loris and my man ro what's happening I'm here I'm ready to go I'm ready for this special report on a strand a species a genus a phylum if you will that of cannabis that are very few people know about well we're gonna be talking today about the largest producer of cannabis in the world which is the continent of Africa which most people have no idea no when you think about cannabis you don't necessarily think Africa other content no no most people don't and in fact Africa has so many what are called land race strains these are strains that have never been contaminated that have allowed to grow around each other and whatever region they in combined with the soil and the sunlight and the conditions and the time of year they harvested and the other plants they bred with on their own I guess one of the it's it's it's like the last bastion of untapped land race train so you have strains that haven't even been discovered yet because all the strains in America and Europe they were running out of strains I was actually watching something on Canada and they were saying how Canada can't keep up with the demand for cannabis so much so that they have to shut down the the operations for some of the dispensaries and places like that to like four days a week because they can't keep up with demand because soon as they open up there's lines around the bill they can't keep up with demand they don't even with all their massive indoor facilities and you know all the corporate infusion of cash they still cannot keep up with with demand so Africa is the future of wheat they're gonna be there they're gonna be heading their Europe mostly Amsterdam you know they've been going to a couple of countries to get basically import cannabis so you think about that you know that it's it's very interesting but it's logical I mean anything that grows on the equator with direct sunlight year-round would um you know would be a vibrant potent product whether it's you know pineapples and mangoes or cannabis so it makes perfect sense and it makes me wonder how come no one is um try to develop that before now I mean you know why would people want to throw it in there uh you know in an indoor facility with the grow UV lights and stuff rather than put it in real soil in a real environment and make the best product they can make because again once the corporate people got into it you know it's changed it's changed the game because they're now pushing out the little people who lease to grow it at home and you know if you're in Humboldt California they grow it out in their little farms and backyards and you know they have now corporations it's huge facilities lights and people in jumpsuits and scientists and and it's just not the same you know you know that's akin to like trying to grow potatoes in a fact you know in a you know you know in an indoor facility with special lights and guys with a you know you know jumpsuits and stuff like that no one does that for any other crop we don't run out of potatoes running out of cannabis up in Canada why don't you grow it like you grow everything else well with the case of the African strains they can't grow it like they grow everything else because the African strains are the African strains because of thousands of years of natural cultivation you know and the environments that have adapted for the local strains of these cannabis plants and because of that you cannot rip it's next to near impossible to replicate that in a lab even if you dig up to specific soil it's in and take it over then a minute you take it out of that environment you grow on something else yes true there's a lot of a lot of uh you know roots and herbs you know medicinal things like that that need to grow in a specific region for those specific properties but people grow them there you know you know what I mean whether it's uh you know mucuna hunt manuka mucuna honey or you know yeah you know I'm confusing Manuka I'm sorry or maca root you know it you know maca root has to be in the mountains between believes at Peru you can't even make them grow in Idaho but it's a tuber like a potato but you can't take it out of that region so they grow in that region so it's just amazing it's curious why no one ever thought of doing this before you know growing it in the regions where you could really cultivate it you know year-round and really produce a lot of it ya know there's that to logical it makes absolute it's it makes absolute sense and it's not it's not even something to me that even needs to be explained it's it to me it's common sense you know but I think the the problem I'm seeing you know here in this part of the world and what I'm also seeing on the African continent is that certain people a dominating this coming into this industry and they're coming in with corporate money and corporate know-how and is snatching it from the people who've been doing it for so long and who deserves to be reaping the benefits I was at the spark event spark cannabis networking event in Columbia Maryland yesterday and I met a guy from a company called Shimazu and they're here based in Maryland was actually a multinational company a Japanese company but they test cannabis for contaminants and because again with all these corporate hacks coming in and they basically mass producing cannabis there's all kinds of contaminants and unnatural things that are being put in it and these guys basically test for you know everything under the Sun including you know contaminants and as one of them was saying to me last night he was like and I and I you know I broached the subject I say you know it's gonna come with its we're getting to that point now already even at this early stage where we have to ask where is the source where is this cannabis coming from the CBD oil you're selling me or this THC fake cartridge you're selling me where did you get the cannabis from who grew it what they put in it you know it's funny you mention that because I stumbled upon a story the other day of people smoking TAC vape cartridges that they think they're illegal cartridges that are mostly been used in states where it's that THC vaping is illegal but there's some new ingredient that's being used some new oil some thick oil they're using two in a cartridge to suspend the the THC and it's producing an inflammatory respiratory disease and people that's akin to pneumonia and people are getting so barely sick and being in the hospital for days with what looks like pneumonia if their lungs are full of fluid to the point where they they're having to hook them up to oxygen because they they just can't breathe on their own the respiratory system is not working on its own so you know it's um you know at that that service that you just scrub is very important especially with stuff like that happen to people you know you think you know it's almost harmless when you're vaping you know don't even sound like it sound like some nice Star Trek let me sound like a cigarette right just this little device you just puff on it exhale all this smoke and it seems harmless but um you know you got to watch out because there's a lot of people right now they're in a bad way with you know ammonia we'll take you out they've also even seen new conditions new diseases one of them is called popcorn popcorn lung where the lung has these basically would look like pimples growing on them and again this is attributed to people who vape they've started to see you know the effects of and we still in the early stages of vaping it's not like cigarettes where you can say okay we've had a long time to see the adverse effects of tobacco but already we're seeing this popcorn lung problem you know showing up yes now is it because we are our technology allows us to detect this stuff quicker than it did when cigarettes were an issue or is it because it's the chemicals are that bad that they're they're they're ravaging people's bodies faster you know I'm saying like in a you know 40s 30s 40s and 50s you know people kind of thought it was bad for you but they had no proof and it wasn't until around you know this late 70s and 80s that they could definitively say yeah this [ __ ] is killing you so I wonder if now with vaping I mean it kind of just started and we're already having problems is it they you know cat scans and MRIs and stuff that can pick up this stuff and you know those little cameras they can put inside of your body that pick it up or is it [ __ ] that bad that is happening way faster than there was cigarettes I think it's definitely too technology we have much better technology in terms of detection now than in the past but I also think that there's also I think even more so sinister chemicals because we know we now know what's in tobacco and but with this with this with this new plant was not new but this this new industry I should say we're like I said the corporate heads are getting into it and everything is becoming scientific almost like the food we have flavor crystals and enhanced tastes you know with with with with whether it's your bag of Cheetos or your McDonald's burger you know where you can it taste the same and it gives you the same euphoric effect like when you eat it you know that's all done in a lab it's all scientific and you're seeing the same thing now happening with with cannabis so I think it's a bit of both definitely yeah yeah yeah I just would hate for you know something happening on a legal side of things to to you know paint what's going on on the legal side of the house but I guess is inevitable yeah yeah but I think that if we nip it in the bud now or at least try to address it now or recognize that okay this is what's coming we can find ways to to circumvent this there I was reading about a guy who the guy who invented the gelato strain of marijuana and California and you know he is a well-known name at like MJ Pez con and you know in the cannabis world for making that that strain like even rappers and artists have made songs about gelato like that's how big this thing is and he was saying how he even can't compete with with this but what he's looking to do is do the supreme branding model where I don't know if any people listening familiar with supreme supreme makes one-of-a-kind products or they'll make like ten they'll make a helmet there was like a bike helmet or supreme logo on it but they'll make like 20 so but then each helmet costs like $1,200 but because there's only 20 of them you can now take that helmet and resell it on eBay or somewhere else for like five times the price you can buy a sweater that's like $400 when it comes out because again it's limited and you can sell it for $1,200 and people will line up to buy it and they only have a couple of stores around the world mostly in Western countries but he was basically wanting to do that with his strains of weed where he comes out with products and maybe even strains where there's only a certain limited amount so that of course increases the value so that's his plan to combat the corporate hijacking that you know that's going on which is kind of interesting what do you think well you know it it returns it back to the culture you know it I think it just keeps coming back to the culture of this thing and there's a definite cultural expression associated with cannabis and THC and now we're seeing it grow and legitimize itself with CBD which is a whole nother you know demographic of people but you know if you try to separate this thing from its culture it I don't see it working and so you can follow Supremes model and do that with with cannabis because it represents a cultural expression I think that's where people should focus and I think that'll keep the of the corporations at bay because they can't duplicate culture you know I mean I don't know if anybody I kind of follow I don't follow but I check out various people blog sites and websites and in certain YouTube channels one of the biggest things going on right now this is gonna sound like a complete non sequitur but I won't bring it back home in a second one of the biggest things going on right now is the fans of Star Wars or Star Wars movie they are completely at open or with Disney for what they did with the last Star Wars movie and how they treated Luke Skywalker and what and what is being leaked about the next one is coming out right and it just shows that there was this culture that was established way back in 1977 with the first movie and and it's become part of people's lives I mean you know they they show it on they used to show it on Christmas for Disney bought the rights to it people have shown their children it's this whole thing it's this whole cultural Express ounce silly but it is a real cultural thing with this Star Wars and it's international and if corporation bought it and is you know for all intents and purposes destroyed it to the place where the fans or the people that represent that closer are rejecting it and in open conflict with this corporation and so I think the model that you're describing with this some gelato stream then he's establishing this cultural expression with it I think that's what I think that's what you have to do with this because it is such a um what's the word I don't know it is just a cultural personal expression with this that it is it's how it's going to be very difficult to corporatize it long long term in my opinion they let me they may make some progress but I just see it self-destructing like what's happening with Star Wars what's going on with Star Trek now now it's starting with that the Marvel movies you know I'm saying now it's starting I remember when uh back in a J day when I was a big whiskey drinker Jack Daniels lowered their alcohol content and it affected Jack Daniels sales but it affected the culture of people who participated Jack Daniels and that's when bourbon took off because bourbon was just some old Kentucky back would think that nobody was into but when you know the major player Jack Daniels started to disrespect the supporters in the culture of Jack Daniels which was very much a culture you know that's when bourbon got started because the day we're like no we're not you're disrespecting what we're about we'll go take us to somewhere else III don't think that I don't think a cultural expression around things can be overlooked and when the bean counters get older something just are crunching numbers I don't that that's you can't factor that and that's an that's saying intangible that can be measured with the human experience but they can't with it with a you know Excel spreadsheet hmm well like I've always said cannabis is not corporate it is a culture and in branding when you want a brand something your first goal is to create a culture around your product or service and that culture is how you create a brand and you want oil tea you want that rabid loyalty like what Apple has like what supreme has where it announced a new iPhone tomorrow and people are lined up around the building to get it supreme comes out with a new sweater shirt or pen or you know whatever the hell they thinking about coming out with and they just slap supreme on it and people are lining up to get it that has say you know do with creating a culture that has to do with brand loyalty and each one of those things are interconnected you can't have one and it's a sequences if you tried to do the sequin if you try to do it out of sequence and your sequencing is off it's not gonna work yeah and it is exactly what it looks like the supreme does it looks like he just put a label I didn't think it was a real company I thought it was just guys saw it first on Instagram and somebody had a shirt two white shirts and one was on the left and it said this shirt cost 1250 and I had no name no label no brand oh just a generic white shirt this shirt on the other side another white shirt with the word supreme written on it in red cost 200 so I just thought okay somebody's just put in the name supreme just like they're looking for a name to just give it just give it a brand name give it something you know just stick it I had no idea it was a real actual company that was selling limited edition products so basically they come out with something and it'll only make a small amount and so so they're basically there's not enough to meet demand and that scarcity creates an intense interest and people you know start trampling each other to get it and that also the resale value goes up because there's only a small amount of their mate you know does go psychology of sales and and branding and how you know with with human beings it's you really it's all about getting in their head I mean I don't care what you're selling cuz to me there's nothing special about supreme I mean I'm concerned the first time I saw it it was a skateboard company right didn't it grow from being a skateboard company and they were making his teach t-shirts and stuff for you know they were making skateboard decks or a wheels or something and they were making t-shirts to go with that right and then how they got started and then they kind of became like they were legitimizing the skateboard culture by taking it into this completely different direction and and and making products outside of that in the head I started I'm not sure like I said when I first saw it I saw it on Instagram or one of those pages you follow for business and they'll show you like you know business ideas or business tips like each pulse is a business idea or a tip and they had one on branding versus brand versus generic and like I said on one side it said blank t-shirt twelve dollars on the other side I said supreme t-shirt $200 and I just thought it cuz cuz even the design of the logo the look it just looks so basic does just amazed me is nothing special no so I thought okay somebody just created this to just make an illustration as to say okay yes one has a brand one doesn't come to find out as a real company so I don't I don't know what the the the genesis of supreme you know was I'm pretty I'm pretty I'm pretty sure it was a skateboard company making skateboard decks and wheels and the name has started making shirts and bumper stickers I think on a West Coast I'm pretty sure he came out the West Coast and then they kept it just was the way they just kept developing products and pushing it and making it like exclusive even within that skateboard realm it started off as its exclusive thing that was hard to get but you had to have because that was a cool thing and they just pushed that and so once again is that it's that culture that it came out of that supports it and it blew up to where it is now because of the legitimacy of the people who participate in that culture and if it and when it loses favor in a world of you know high fashion and exclusive items to own it'll go right back to be a skateboard brand and they'll still support it because I'm not sure if it was a skateboard brand but I def because I this now with the people that line up to get it everybody from all other cultures whatever something comes out they all trying to buy supreme so I could the people I saw were lined up in London they didn't look like they skateboard at all no but it's grown it grew out yeah cuz I'm looking at up now with skateboard company but it just they pushed their products outs away from that and marketed it as like what it is now you know and then their foundation was those skaters that you know had to have it is it I'm just trying to make a parallel into what the guys doing with a gelato it these cultures of what makes you know with the difference between uh really the Marvel superhero movies and a DC one is that the Marvel cultivated a culture in an experience and a loyalty and integrity and a promise that they were going to lay this whole thing out in the way they've never been seen before and people know that I think one one looks comic books were colorful and fun and you know it sucks you into another world and you know you made it it stimulates your imagination Marvel translated that from comic it's it's basically a live comic book DC this stuff is just dark it when you look at no but with the movies what one is what is bright and one is bright and where Marvel and and and fun and interesting and better character design but a casting and then you just have the other one on the other hand which is DC and it's just dark and it's just it's just not as interesting and it's just a complete letdown in my opinion I'm not a fan of the DC universe if you even want to call it that because they're subtle they're sorely lacking when it comes to they leave a lot to be desired when it comes to comparing them to Marvel asked for what the last ten years or ten plus years they've been coming out with these you know with these movies it reminds me of uh when Star Wars go back to Star Wars when that came out you know I mean I saw that in the theater when it came out and then everything was trying to jump on that bandwagon because it was such a hit but it didn't have any integrity in it it wasn't really taking a chance it wasn't really investing anything you know Star Wars on the surface is his goofy movie but it is a real story they're the first one and it's a story that's universal that you can really buy into but everyone so yet star chase and yet all these goofy Oh everything was just trying to get make a dollar off of it and when I look at the chance Marvel took with you know the first Iron Man film and and even the way it ended with Samuel Jackson and Nick Fury and it just said we're gonna lay this whole world out for you over years and that's our promise to you we're gonna lay this out and treat it with respect and we're gonna honor it we might have to make some changes we're gonna really respect this and show you something that you've always wanted to see to me when DC jumped on they were like look we're just gonna cash in we're just gonna throw superheroes out there to you know cartoon show that has I think four or five seasons it was on in the early 2000s that entire show those did the real cartoon heads or real comic blue heads know what I'm talking about that entire show is better than every single movie they've put out in the last ten years I'm so serious and it was a cartoon but it was just very well done and it was it wasn't dark it had great humor it had great voice actors the stories were farming it was it was that was that is at par with the MCU that's how good it was yeah and then you look at what they've done with the movies it's just it's just abysmal you know the DC stuff that DC superheroes were always more lighthearted and more you know All American characters Marvel guys always had like real problems and real issues and stuff they were almost not even really like superheroes they were like normal people that could just do some special stuff that's that's what this cartoon was like though yeah that's a like a Superman is me he is nothing he can't do so you gotta like you know put people he cares about in danger but you know one of the hallmarks of the whole DC thing was that you know it was almost wholesome all-american apple-pie you know wave the flag storytelling and characters you know protagonist but when this corporation wanted to go make a dime and jump on a bandwagon or what Marvel had done they didn't even take that a consideration they just we're gonna copy what Marvel is doing but ours is gonna be dark and grittier cuz that sells right dark and gritty earth and they just completely [ __ ] the bed and did a fan base that was already there ready to give them money turned away and now they're just disillusioned because the thing they love the most of this has been defiled and destroyed so you know the exact I mean that's I'm trying to draw a parallel between you know Star Wars and Disney buying Star Wars I'm bringing it back Warner Brothers trying to do what Marvel was doing you've already got a can and CBD in cannabis you've already got a built-in audience and a culture all you do is respectfully participate yeah but there's something about their corporate mindset it can't be respectful if you can't dominate you don't want to do it you know that cuz even the latest spider-man movie the one that came out this year they've already messed that up because Fox I think is fighting Disney and apparently they've put a hold as a moratorium on the movie in the movie has now been put on hold indefinitely and the movie you know left ended on a cliffhanger because again it's the MCU and Tom Holland who is the guy who plays spider-man has no idea what they has a job or not because they frozen the whole thing they don't know yeah and even they even talking about going back to the Tobey Maguire days you know of spider-man like you know so again I know all that is in corporate you know corporate BS that that you know that goes on when you know people come in who are not really about the culture and about the art they just in it for the money you know and unfortunately that's what I see happening with cannabis yeah it's inevitable but I mean at the same time there's myriad examples we just talked about how these corporations just they don't get it they [ __ ] the bed you know like there was a talk of remaking one of my favorite films in the world Big Trouble in Little China they want to remake it with the rock you know say like can you just the movie is aged well I mean you watch that it mean it you know - him using a pay phone that could be today there's no need I mean these guys aren't think of it thinking of anything original they're not establishing a new culture they just want to go back and rape everything that ever came out that people loved it was something else they wanted to remake and it was just like no whywhy are you doing this you know so I mean I think you know it's inevitable that they do this with cannabis and CBD but I think it's inevitable they'll [ __ ] the bed and and the people will be able to reclaim it and move forward you know it they they're there their thought process and their vision is so limited you know and I think accountants are completely taken over every aspect of entertainment that they just can't see the human touch and a human quality that makes this stuff work and makes it magic you know there's a reason why magnum p.i was a big deal and Simon and Simon wasn't not to [ __ ] on Simon and Simon was okay but it was no magnum p.i because you know they caught lightning in a bottle you know and it was it it is still of this magnum p.i suit you know a fan favorite to this day Magnum it's automatic killer intro though the music yeah yeah you know look at magnum p.i look at Miami Vice you know you got some guys and I am addressing real cool who would care but they created this culture people still said and I always say Miami did not look like that when that's okay Miami was not like that in 1984 no but by 1989 Miami was like that show that's so made Miami Miami was not debated or the world and citizen Miami and Miami grew to reflect that artificial world to this day to this very day Miami is still just be Miami Vice the TV show yeah so you know the cotinine they try to make a movie we cut Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx and it was the drizzle but but my point is because they completely betrayed the culture of what it was the movie was nothing comparable to the show other than there was some two cops in Miami you know so I don't think the culture of things can be discounted because they're proving that when you ignore the culture end up in the people who love that you're just you're just gonna make a mess yeah there's any solace and this is that once they get done you know screwin it up yeah but you can have it back yeah that point is too late who wants it back at that point I mean that's just that's just that's just a disaster at that point and they trying to you know can't shine [ __ ] and that's basically what you're doing at that point it's not gonna work let's go ahead and plug in our sponsor since we're already have more than halfway through

kind of went into the doom and gloom a little bit so where to god I always do that that's my father when I apologize I do that I do it but you need to know so let's go back to cannabis in Africa the future of weed where you have strains like Durban poison which is from South Africa Swasey cold which is from Swaziland Malawi Gold which is from Malawi Congo red and Congo black which is from the DRC or the Democratic Republic of Congo strains that are very very difficult to get in this part of the world I think Swasey gold you can buy that I think they have been exporting that to Europe and I think you can even have even seen anything for sale here but Africa is the largest like I said in the beginning to show the largest producer of cannabis in the world and get this only four countries are participating in the cannabis trade South Africa Zimbabwe Lesotho and Malawi these are the only countries that are participating in and and South Africa is the only unique one because they passed an act called the Dada Act which allows for possession of marijuana for personal use so basically the police find it on you they won't arrest you you won't go to jail and that has now sprung up cannabis expose the only cannabis expo on the continent of Africa is in South Africa where you will find cannabis companies local like there's a guy who brews a cannabis beer called Durbin poison that's again from the Durbin poison strain from South Africa it's a larga and he brews that in in South Africa apparently just to talk about some history they're also very big on hemp because when the Dutch came to South Africa and settled down there they used to make a lot of their clothing and a ropes and a lot of those materials from hemp so it's actually for them it's a return to something they used to do before was outlawed and so you're seeing ropes and and and and clothing and and I didn't even know that you could make cement from hemp by taking the stem and adding lime juice to it and when it basically those two mix it can form a cement that can hold bricks together I mean so hemp is an incredible product and I think hemp is probably the most revolution is more revolutionary than marijuana because there's so much you can do with a plastics clothing ropes cements which I just learned about and again all this stuff is biodegradable so I there was on the news last week China shipping back all the plastic and all the plastic bottles back to America and Europe and they're like yep we're not gonna be the world's trashcan anymore and Europe and America don't know what to do with these plastics now you've seen turtles and whales and all these sea creatures with straws and plastic stuck in their noses and in their bodies and the some of the fish ate and plastic like the salmon is eating plastic so your salmon dish it your favorite restaurant is full of micro plastics because again plastic does not degrade but yes one product that makes plastic that is biodegradable that's not made from petroleum and that product is hamper so this is this is really amazing and you can see why they've suppressed this amazing plant you know for so long because the petrol dollars are definitely at risk because a lot of the plastics and you know things that we use that seep into our food and you know contaminate the sea and all that is made from petroleum fossil fuels and it's it's it's not good for the environment doesn't break down well yet we've had this plant that you could make plastics from all this time and the powers-that-be have suppressed it well you think about on that wrong no you know it's it's um it's it's funny because I always reference the title of the film back to the future my area subjects when I talk about stuff and you know I never knew what that title meant back to the future sounds oxymoronic like then he makes sense but now being much older and putting the world into a greater context when I realized what that movie was saying was in order for Marty McFly to have a future he had to go back in time and correct some things and bring and get a better perspective on what the past was about and again and embrace some tenants and virtues of the past and bring them forward to have a future and we're really at a stage in our society where we're gonna have to go back to the future reading go backward and embrace some of the things we were doing 100 200 years ago and bring them forward with a 21st century mindset in context you know hemp but as you said that was used for you know everything the riggings on ships sails you know in fact that flower was in I mean it was used for everything and there's no reason it can't be used now there's no reason it can't be used in industry now there's no reason that my laundry detergent can't be in a hemp hemp bottle so to speak there's no reason why and then you know the thread and my shirt can't be hemp again there's no reason that we can't go back and reimburse on that was so since I died anok product with so many industrial uses and have a great quality of life without destroying a goddamn planet and I'm not one of these you know leading heart go green types no disrespect to y'all that's just not what I do but you know it's there's no reason with the current level of technology that the free flow of information exactly that we can't go back and get some of this stuff that used to work better then in a [ __ ] now and make a life in which we don't have to worry about what's in our drinking water you know because I don't know about the rest of y'all but every day I wake up this [ __ ] is like a bad science fiction film you know and I'm tired of it yes I'm tired of hearing the next problem that sounds like it's right out of Robocop you know there's no there's no reason for any this week we can have a very clean lifestyle in which we don't have to get poisoned by the very air we breathe and the water we drink in the rain for Christ's sakes yeah yeah yeah we we have everything we need to solve most of the world's problems and one plant that can definitely aid in a significant amount of the reduction of that is is hemp and again hemp is the sibling of marijuana whose parent is cannabis because they're people who still think who don't know the difference between the two of them and think they're one in the same but they're not but the hemp is an amazing an amazing plant but these are these African strains is one that's super rare called Malawi Gold I mean where if you were able to even get your hands on it you could charge thousands of dollars for seeds because it's it's it's one of those landrace strains it's super rare and it's also it's at Eva most of the African strains of sativa strains which is interesting and most of the people benefiting from the African strains aren't really in America Europe is benefiting because that's where a lot of the export is going I see South Korea just opened up or allowed a dispensary that because they do I don't think they grow it over there so they're importing it so the import export market will if exporting if you're in one of those countries but importing if you're if you're in the West or you know Asia or whatever those markets are you gonna be huge for the African markets because the African markets have strains that the world has never seen before and so far a lot of the farmers that produce this stuff it's subsistence farming so they're not really even making anything off it I mean they and they have buckets and bales and you know this stuff and and there's still also the stigma that because a lot of these cultures a lot of these countries because only like I said Malawi Lesotho Swaziland Zimbabwe South Africa there's still very much the stigma of to use your phrase ro wacky tabacky and you know if I smell this thing there was one farmer I saw on Vice this was and I think Swaziland and she can't stand the smell of it but she grows it because that's how she feeds their family and she had tons of this stuff and the other ones do grow it but they don't have the context to you know to export it to the South Africa with these Expos and all this stuff they have now there's a lot of mostly the white South Africans who come up to Swaziland and the zoo too and you know all these are the places and coming by you know the the the different strains of marijuana cuz they're setting up businesses so again you kind of see the parallels between that and you know what's going on here in this part of the world where a lot of the African American community most of the cannabis entrepreneurs are in jail you know and then now all of a sudden somebody I I was talking to last night at the spark Expo was saying that and he was he was a Caucasian fellow and he was saying he recognizes that you know the unfairness of that and the fact that that is a problem and the fact that you have people like him and many others who are now in it legally you have all these people who were you know put in jail some of them are still there for possession for sales you know but the African market - you're seeing the government's basically allow the the farmers to farm it for export but there's no local trade going on so they're not making what they could be and should be making in Assam crazy ship you know what people are gonna have to you know you know I understand the Golden Rule do unto others and as you would have them do unto you fool me once shame on you fool me twice I ain't getting fooled on more times but um yeah I don't know if you well I'm sure you do but I don't know if the listeners remember some maybe too young in the 1980s when Japan transformed himself from being making cheap transistor radios and cheap automobiles to being such a corporate powerhouse that the term in corporate takeover became synonymous with a preemptive strike militarily like the Japanese became so good at business that it was a kin to war and America was afraid of Japan as business I remember and the Japanese had their guys reading sunsoo their executives reading Sun Tzu every morning before they went to work they would practice kendo and swordsmanship and in American executives started getting into this war footing to do war oh but just on a battlefield of business and um I think one thing all of us are going to have to understand is that anything worth having is worth taking and anything that you can make money with is worth taking and if you don't position yourself to one protect what it is you're doing and to going to attack against your competition oh you know you ain't gonna have it for long cuz we've tried it the other way we've tried to be so goddamn friendly in business we've tried to just make eke out a living with stuff I'm telling you the way this world is going if you can't protect what you have and go on the attack and try to crush your competitor or just put them into a position don't get started don't do it yeah you know if you're not playing to win if you're not playing to dominate don't even play the game it sounds harsh it sounds so harsh and cruel and out of this [ __ ] combative it's the way of the world that's why every nation has an army or defense force as weighing a whole country of people out here just chilling they got a couple guys in the back with some guns it's unfortunate but there's always gonna be somebody coming to take what you have or slick you out of it and if you have a great idea listen it's Dirty Harry all over again man's got to know his limitations if you have a great idea great make your product well find somebody that can protect your stuff and go on the attack when they need to because they will need to you know and you hear you talk about you know what's going on with these farmers in Malawi and and and Swaziland and they they're not yeah they're not protected and I don't even think they know they need to be perhaps they don't know they need to be practicing they did I think they do because some of them can see but some of them also recognize that they're facing stigma because there's still stigma from the colonial times where they were like oh because again when they realized they had to suppress marijuana those stick that we didn't we didn't invent those stigmas no those stigmas were invented and opposed and not just there and on the continent here in America there was a time when marijuana and hemp wasn't illegal and there were certain people who saw it as a threat to their industries mostly the fossil fuel industries and they say oh no we got a we have to suppress this and one of the best ways to do that is to culturally suppress it well it's like oh you know you smoking that wacky tabacky and you know all the other terms you pothead you're this year that and this is a gateway drug and all this other crap you know so it's a it's the same game being played on another continent but you know that takes that you know along the lines of you know protecting what you have and being able to go on the attack another another tenant is you've got to control the narrative if you're if you grow cannabis and and and and some entity out there saying well you know that's a gateway drug and it's in it potheads and yada yada yada then focus on something else it does right you know you can clean your toilet with coca-cola yeah pine pine oil you can also clean your battery yeah car yeah with the battery terminals with coca-cola so if tomorrow the the Journal of American medicine said look the sodas you know soda is killing every goddamn body you know soda company to come out say yeah but did you know you clean your toilet with it but control the narrative of your product and work around what the impediment is narrative lies I guess what I'm trying to say through these examples is listen if you will come out hearing in getting business in and sell something you've got to get dynamic with your thought process you got to protect what you have in on the case you're gonna have to go any attack and you're gonna have to control the narrative this is a this is a dynamic game you can't just sit back and do anything because either you're gonna be barely making a living what if someone's gonna take your stuff you know pretty much pretty much and so for everybody out there who wants to come out with a cannabis product cannabis a CBD oil prod to create a narrative they're so far out of the box but but but productive and can illustrate people why they need this product you'll defeat the stigma attached to it you can think of every product you love that's what they did cuz you only need half the [ __ ] you buy but they gave you a narrative that induced you to to need it but that's the power of branding and that's the power of psychology and that's the power of creating a culture and which leads to creating loyal customers around a brand so that's the secret right there it's all branding branding is strategy and it's it's psychology you know next time we're going to get into because we're about to wrap things up here we're gonna get into sales funnels and growth hacking and and and a new way to grow inbound marketing lead my magnets the new way to grow businesses and social-media followings cuz you know you're dealing with all these algorithms that you know before it used to be you could you could use an algorithm for a year or two now an algorithm to barely last six months and then they've changed it and that's mostly because of the marketers because they've you know well the market ears as they call them in Europe who you know they they basically effed everything up and that's why Facebook and all these companies keep changing their you know there's but that's is for next episode that will be our topics anything else you want to plug row before we before we get out of here how much time I have yeah you got a couple minutes late okay watch this right quick well I just want to say this I've been walking this earth for pretty good stretch of time and well I've seen a lot you know and I'll reflect on life and try to boil it down to what's really going on and I keep coming up with the same answer try as I might to deny it I keep calling the same answer this [ __ ] is war now when I say war I don't mean tanks and helicopters and punchy sticks and ak-47 I mean one person or a group of people trying to dominate another one through through intent in action right so if if me and Laura sir hanging out and Laura says okay let's go to a strip club I said what I really don't do that bro no come on man and he gets me to go that was warfare and he just won right he didn't have to you have a tank he used his subterfuge and he browbeat me and used peer pressure and all the rest of it and psychologically got me to do something I had no intention of doing and probably got me to buy a couple of drinks in a mix as well so all I'm saying is that every aspect of human behavior and interpersonal dynamics it comes down to a conflict a war might not be open war may not be bullets flying but someone is trying to take what you got or get you to do something you have no intention of doing the best friendships are built upon mutual respect and wish that that subject has already been broached and now we're not even gonna try to do that with each other we're gonna go do that to somebody else so I'm trying to say this that if you have something worth taking it will be taken if you can't defend it please view all your business endeavors as warfare please view all your relationships protecting the people you care about as warfare there's too many people out here trying to exploit victimized you get in the game because that's gonna make this world a better place when righteous people take just an aggressive stance as the unrighteous people I am done all right right on time all right people we out", "skAbnxBOWDU": "hi guys here we are again I thought they'd give

videos one of my most viewed videos is my pax era review so I thought I would come back to you guys today with another medical marijuana video my video today it's going to be along the same lines my packs cartridges are made by drip concentrates I talked about that in my first medical marijuana video link will be down below basically I did a full comprehensive review on the pax era and the cartridges I had at the time just to update you guys like a little bit later on I still absolutely love these like love I use them now pretty much solely instead of flour right now I basically have three devices with three different pods and pink starburst my favourite straw nana and bubble gum same flavors I talked to you about last time I still love those and I'm tried and true to those flavors that I like but today I'm gonna be talking about something along the same lines same company drip extracts also makes concentrates and extracts a day at my local dispense are youing a buy one get one for olive drip extracts so I got some crumble and some honeycomb and I'm gonna be showing that to you today so when you buy some concentrates from drip that are not the pods the PAX pods are the C cell pods it comes in a little box like this and you open it and there is your little pot with this one happens to be Durbin poison this is Durbin poison it is honeycomb Oh honeycomb is so nice because I picked two kinds of extracts that you can put basically on top of a bowl of flour because I personally am NOT a huge fan of using the whole like dab machine or whatever like you can dab machine using a rig I think it's a beauty I did for a really long time and I think that the butane is really bad for your throat if you don't do it the right way or you overheated or whatever and I basically just had a really bad experience after using wax for a really long time out of a rig and I think it's best when you just put it on top of a bowl not changing anything out of my normal routine I'm just using the same balm and the lighter like I normally would but yeah this tier of extracts was $30 and for a gram and um it was buy one get one so I got two different strains I got fruit cake crumble and durbin poison honeycomb this is a hybrid and this is a sativa so I actually tried both of these and personally the flavor of the fruitcake I'm not like a huge fan of but that's okay to each their own another patient that had tried this told me that they actually really liked the flavor so I guess it's just like personal preference I don't I don't particularly like it but I know people that do so it's not necessarily bad it's just not my taste but I really do love the Durbin poison it is so smooth and like it's not flavorless but it's it's good I'm not a sativa person I was never as a taper person but the pink starburst which is a sativa dominant hybrid has been absolutely like one of my favorite things in the whole wide world so because of this I've been more open to trying different things because I had so much success with the pink starburst so because of that I was willing to branch out and try this full sativa Durbin poison and I actually loved it so what I'm gonna get into next is actually showing you how consume I'm going to be consuming the honeycomb basically what I'm going to do is take some flour right here I have purple punch strain from I bought this at muv but we're gonna be taking a little bit of purple punch and just basically clogging that hole at the bottom like so really like a little bit in there you can't see but you can see it's the hole is clogged and then after that we're gonna take the Durban poison have my spoon here I'm gonna take it out and grab pretty decent sized chunk right there and this is a technique that my bud tender actually told me to if you're gonna put it on top of a bowl of flour this is the most efficient way you're gonna put the concentrate in the middle so we're gonna make layers the first layer was a little bit of flour and then that ball of durbin poison I put there and then we're gonna make the next layer up a little bit more flour and basically when you light it it kind of cherries know you get the most out of your extract inside a bowl so right there there's the flour on top so as you can see I'm done with the bull and wow that was so good it was so smooth and just it was so good so my review for the turbine poison is that it's so smooth and so tasty and it really left me feeling energetic which was nice because it's really good for the daytime like I definitely wouldn't recommend it at nighttime if you have insomnia because it is it's pretty late now and I'm awake because of this but I definitely would recommend this for a daytime strain and the extract is really really strong really powerful and I just I like it a lot so I would give this probably like an 8 out of 10 because it is a concentrate and they are a little bit harsh but that's honestly just like the nature of using concentrates because like they're obviously gonna be a little bit harsh they're obviously gonna burn your throat but yeah that's about it thank you guys so much for watching if you want to see any more medical marijuana related videos please like this video comment subscribe I really try to listen it's like feedback from you guys like for example my last video somebody told me I work on the sound so I'm working on projecting my voice cuz I was being really quiet in the last video so thank you to you guys for your feedback I hope you like this video I hope you give drip

"DadBXsPse5A": "hey everybody it's me for girly here and today we are back with the third day of the 12 days of wake and bake thank you for sticking with me I've been enjoying this series so far you guys let me know in the comments if you guys have I know you guys been pretty responsible already so I appreciate that keep those comments coming and make sure you give it a thumbs up as well today we're going to be digging right into some durbin poison that's our land race South African strain that is a pure sativa and one of the Turkish strains we've got and probably our bread and butter of the fmg canopy this was actually from our outdoor this year so it's definitely not as large of nuts but the density on these is pretty impressive and I'm pretty excited to share this with you guys so this is pretty much the lighting might be pretty off here but yeah that's gonna be a problem let's see if I can zoom in over here it's both close we're gonna get a guess but I yeah so this is you know I'm not sure how many grams as soon as I could pull out the skill I guess and weed it but this is just one of the loudest strains I got mentioned I know we've had lab tests that showed terpene my volume results of over 3.8 percent so getting close to that 4 percent range unfortunately I don't think we ever actually did break 4 percent but nonetheless it is one of those ones that when you open the bag or the jar you just know exactly what it is it's it's just so tasty it's hard to describe but it's true petaline is the terpene that really dominates the profile and if you're familiar with that one at all it seems to go along with the CBG cannabinoid and more kind of sativa strange so I guess I better get grinding up on this thing but you know I'm gonna take that top knocker right there and we're gonna actually only roll a regular size I think the 1 and 1/4 rock phone here normally I'm like in those king-sized but we actually finally reigned through that 800 count box with king-size Rock cones so that was kind of crazy but in any case the Turpin allene terpene it's like I believe like I said one of the ones that kind of goes along with that city no profile because we have it in several of our strains that dominates the terpene profiler as it or is at least the the leading terpene and the lab results and that goes for Durbin poison it goes for our grapefruit Durbin which is of course Iturbide poison cross and goes for lime skunk so life script number four and five and I set an exotic genetic strain the lime skunk sauce or turf sugar that we checked out on the first day of wake-and-bake here but the other one that I'm not sure if I had many test results on at all unfortunately and it's no longer in my garden but silver Kush from Reserva privada and DNA genetics that was another one of those very kind sativa terpene or turpentine heavy strains and I gotta say it just matches my palate and maybe it's the effects that you get along with it but the taste is just unreal one of the nice things I do like about Durbin poison too is even with these rock cones now flavor is gonna last the whole way through I know unfortunately you know paper you know using any kind of wraps or paper or especially blunts it can really take away from the flavor of the cannabis and it's certain poison I want to taste especially so I try to stay away from most of those things but these raw clones I think these are just the classic anothers hemp and other ones but these Rock clones generally work pretty well and just carrying the flavor through and not kind of disrupting that terpene profile so with that I'm gonna cheers you guys happy third day of wake and bake and uh this is to Durbin poison [Music] I mean they even have flavor papers which I've tried before you I thought the grape flavored ones or the blueberry flavored ones go good with a Kimbo cushion thing they kind of did but you know it's I'd rather just grow something that I didn't need to enhance the flavor of but you know using glass like a especially like a water pipe a bong is gonna definitely carry the flavor pretty good but yeah I haven't had any problems with these Rock cones so I'm gonna join those the beauty of this dirt poison as I mentioned it's a sativa so I'm like the last couple days of way can make this is truly one of those ones that you can wake and bake with you can smoke throughout the day or during the day and you're not gonna get that like super heavy down sleepy or sluggish feeling this one's gonna keep you going it's gonna make you pretty active I'm not sure if I could say I know I've mentioned in the past or certain strains that I think could really like replace you know your espresso that you're gonna have or your cup of coffee that you're gonna have every morning I don't know I do like pairing durbin poison with coffee for some reason burden really well stays pretty smooth as I mention this those are outdoor crops so here we are in December a couple months past it's got a nice long cure on it so again you know the second I open that jarred actually hop alright so the second I open that jar you know your spell adder employees you're gonna know what it is but I was gonna say there's some strains that you really almost have to grind out to really kind of taste that chirping profile and some of them you can really you know you can smell it you know what it is by the flavor the you know the pungency that you're getting out of the jar but then sometimes you grind it up and it's like oh like that's the true flavor or the true smell of the plant you know I think Derby poison is one of those ones are you just don't need to grind up to smell that it is just so potent and so ridiculous and it's truly it's really one of my favorites the other good thing about it you do not need a smug little joint that's actually why I'm using these regular classic rock bones because let's king size probably is gonna get pretty thick with rusting by the last like maybe quarter of it but you just with the dirt poison and some of these other cities you just don't need to smoke a whole joint of it so I think I'm gonna leave you guys with that thank you guys for joining me on another 12 days of way can make I hope you guys are enjoying the series make sure your thumbs up comment below subscribe here on YouTube youtube.com slash for really you can check out for all a calm on instagram at 4 Rowley farms and of course on weed maps and maybe they'll just be able to find something and the Durbin poison lineup that we got well with that guys good luck and grow big you [Music]", "2paHb9SVXpc": "hey guys welcome back it's a good smoke report from top shelf tonight we have the Durban poisoned indica phenotype oh yes right guys so just for a quick update on the statistics we have the Durban poison sativa that was in the previous videos smoke reports harvest you seen all that I've got the final tally here we've got one two tree jars total of 70 grams from the two planets we got 38 Browns from the first one 32 from the second to announce two ounces and a half not too bad haha from the sativa now from the indica we have a grand total of 42 grams weren't were so we got no here more than a half here just for some sampler notes for you guys take a look at right sowing told we got in around 115 grams we still have three more Northern Lights number 5 haze mist to go and then we'll give you the grand total so whatever further ado let's get down to the smoke report for the Derby poison indica phenotype right so let's just zoom in here give you guys a look at the sweet nooks there we go the jars there now let's get some samples yum-yum so she's perfectly draw it out now and yeah lovely and frosty yeah too close there you go perfecto so what we're gonna do is grind some up blaze a joint I'll tell you all about it okay so I'm gonna grab a couple of these dogs now they're bare webby just set back up over here well I'm gonna get one row with you now okay okay one of these nice dogs here okay oh yeah she sounds nice and crunchy perfectly dried yeah mmm very similar aroma to the a sativa perhaps it actually a little bit more fruit it's excellent oh yeah so I'm literally chomping at the bit sample here so now the moment of truth is she gonna be crunchy get up perfect nice piece over here this was another plan that was a pleasure to crops just a little bit this point of the year that I think she these girls probably got a little bit crowded that was by the Haze's I'm guessing Oh beautiful that's like you're very different finishes Eva it's a hell of a lot more fruit kind of berries in there not getting that a media licorice aroma just yeah overwhelmingly fruity okay zoomy not that yeah guys look at mmm-hmm oil burrata that's got one of these boards and just showing you how Kristen E she actually is okay precariously balanced this camera you just give me a moment okay get a good look at her there show you how chrisley she is on the inside too no I got that sticky icky okay now there's one I roll there right so that's lighter up or hope and berries we're hoping through oh she's a smooth smoke that was delicious mmm what actually say she's pretty smooth but more about conventional sort of smoke I'm not getting the the berries I'm not getting the muck at 90-year licorice mm-hmm she's smooth but bring very mild I would say in here mmm definitely different doesn't have that kind of skunky you know generic kind of flavor this is mmm I can't quite put my finger on it actually it's different very different nice and smooth but yeah bit mysterious I have to say overall I probably prefer the sativa phenotype no needed to yield better she actually I think has the edge on the flavor here mmm I still give this girl Tom's up there's some premium quality stuff definitely some nice smoke mmm so yeah very pleased with that some nice fine Durban boys to different phenotypes fantastic plenty of jars a dope I can't complain hmm that's just seeing a little bit more flavor commentary go true I still can't quite put my finger on it mmm she does go on it it's a smooth smoked I'll give it that very very smooth mm-hmm that's a strange kind of pain taste on the palate hmm I would recommend most Athenee I wouldn't say she's exceptionally potent nor would disappear it's good kind of mellow kind of relaxed and smoked I don't have to say isn't it it's quit that the sativa was quite a clear high and you know it was relatively long a duration but wouldn't be too overpowering this I'm definitely feeling more of an indica vibe to it not really picking up much the fever here at all definitely good show that smoke I think hmm so what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna keep these boards loose cuz I need some smoke oh yeah I'm gonna enjoy these and Emmalyn do let these babies cure for in around 30 days is about the perfect time and like I said once a week take them out or at the very least take the lid off let them air out for 15 minutes at least once a week and do that for 4 weeks hmm then you will have some perfectly cured top-shelf bullet okay guys I'm gonna finish up mm-hmm join me Dora

ripen up a little bit so it's my second harvest on this land lies our prescription drug coverage to get the benefits you deserve call the medicare cover jump line no Joe named private call the secondary's going for a bike ride today got one bud down helmet size the simple layout of disease the belts second pressure student and media it looks like it has done some kind of apparatus on the back for the day it's my morning snow these two and see how far along with trichomes are I never did that yet it's very hot it's very humid you wear a lot of clothes the idea that they would wear some sort of ceremonial clothes exactly like having pressurized a something is who we got here perhaps something worst of all time left in Japan and was very everywhere in the red from dust created 12 figures as [Music] [Music] [Music] this German poison strain right here is really awesome people because it's a powdery mildew resistant to mold and mildew resistance [ __ ] asses there a truth that to me with people's about the exact nature of them we burn with extraterrestrial reserves and secondaries that would normally be like popcorn [ __ ] what up armament Patriot pain farms with a crypto roger going Michigan I smoked some Durbin and awesome can't fire a couple weeks ago it was probably disturbed and poison but the top colas welcome to the stream Duane Milne made some during one of my favorite year for sure there's already a harvest and then top colas and then we took them to Camp Palooza and sold some we smoked tons of it and this is the plan that was left and right now we're come down or secondary taking some of the station work on based on years research I was outside picking off release trip in the big book but started raining so there's all these positive enhancer I should've been out there getting so much [ __ ] you know so I just inside this morning Gary I'm going to collect pollen one more time say that's why I'm hoping it rains actually then I collect this pollen one more time and then down the mail plane so what I'm gonna do here is I got the secondary Harvey's going on with these little secondaries and [ __ ] little harder buds and stuff and then I'm gonna do a third virus on the ones that are left and then anything left on the plan I'm gonna send it into rematch no be a whole bunch of little tiny buds and [ __ ] left on here someone sent us all back in the rebate and then keep this plant growing and for as long as I possibly can we got cuts and stuff like that but I just want to do a little project with this specific plan Robert Burton pretty sure territory yeah they can't fire with dope I just posted some of the footage I had I was really really really wasted it's bonfire so I didn't get too much footage so I got enough I missed a lot of the people singing yes do ruins good the durbin I took there probably wasn't quite as mature as this one he's here because this one on so I cut down Durbin on July 8th or August 8th I mean and then I brought it to the to the can include the right so this one has been growing since the 8th the secondaries see that wasn't even cured or not and it could be so much better so I'm going to cross this drain with the Afghani the pure indica UFO researchers or to see what we come up with and you want many consider to be the oldest civilization of the Americas the open located 170 miles west of belated need the Gulf of Mexico that people fly but so I have this little teeny tiny tiny bit of the golden poison laughs I think I'm gonna smoke it today with you guys on your men that's why I've got enough you know you might think it's kind of a waste you let it grow a little bit but that's my second year we found sad thing is what it is well if I would have known about the dirty poison trust me it would be a monster playing outside right now be anything as I could possibly have his mother's like just a lot of cool fall colors going on though their culture there was a priestly caste they knew the earth was round you guys here's like to be heard you can see people mysteriously they love the planet researchers believe these she went to space as ancient art oh my fur monster and extinct but it actually big anticipation which I really wanted to do we church though on Sunday morning at that bonfire browse to wasted researchers disagree like weird monsters exactly respond [ __ ] tons of [ __ ] minutes they have elevators little fairly shaped little Betty would have new new growing monsters on this one in sauce they'd flower time but you know when you do this second you can do two or three harvests and [ __ ] and then reinvent your plant right so what you gotta do is you you fede fede fede fede fede right and then you harvest your top once you do your flush and then you harvest your top Colin's you know the ones that are all stick in the ones that are all sticking up real tall and fat right and cut all those off and then this can be normally like your popcorn [ __ ] real fluffy larkey right but then what you do is after you cut those top colors off while you're processing we dry it you feed this pitch again you feed it your flower new insects and then these start getting chunky and harder it's you know they may or may not get big and fast but on they will get harder and not Murphy and then you can choose when to pick them you know so on the secondaries I wanted to wait like two or three weeks you know I'm saying and check the trichomes you know kept forgetting the chats check the trichomes but they're right now they're probably like 50 or 60 percent amber so there should be some pretty strong [ __ ] hopefully this does but yeah you got to feed it and then flush it again and then harvest and then feed it again and then get the other little baby ones to start growing could be polluted man's interpretation and then flush it again and then harvest it again it's fun little process fun little game it is the earliest known representation of the feathered circles god-like figure known to both the all my furniture and my 19 is the picture of a warrior wearing a helmet and he's with this feather burnished would you know he's awesome on America and the fact that he has that little kids maybe what that's symbolizing is this person is adopted after all for investigators however Monument is regarded as evidence suggesting that there really was contact with UFOs in the ancient past monument 19 at levente shows what many people believe is a representation of a human figure in a spaceship of some sort yeah there's one seems to be machinery it really does look like something that's being constructed I think the fairly normally these these ones here would be tiny little [ __ ] bugs down here they're not massive or anything like that but you do get more for what you had breathing here definitely not anything flew to the Olmec would have been better this is sort of bird so again it appears that they're exactly what they saw which is a pilot of a feathered serpent an aircraft high-altitude aircraft spacecraft listen yes you have oblique or one of these pressurized suits according to UFO researchers the idea that ancient people that imagined a travel scenario as a requirement of protection is significant evidence in and of itself is secondary is someplace different so now if I undergo a season or a greenhouse I would try to do this outside where ancient civilization under saying where you can move all Harvest a couple times like in Cali they can do it and stuff like that but our weather changes pretty fast up here on us so I won't be able to do it she got nice and purple thanks outside experience I was okay we were just the only problem was you know we paid a lot of money for things that we did not get that was the problems that no other net there is no animosity or sudden anything like that you saw us at right next to all the people can't please us it was always good you know I'm saying it was just in the end we had a lot of people coming from a lot of different states made people's coming all the way from Massachusetts that paid a lot of money to come there and you know do their thing in first of all the people that didn't show up that's not anybody's fault but you know we can maybe do a better nicer but uh you know just the whole point and like you pay all this money and you make a deal and then the deals that we made and kept like we kept communicating you don't say and we kept communications up we visited with you know the people a couple times and and everything always stays the same except for when we arrived when we arrived we did not get the things that were promised to us for the money we spent and that hurt a lot of people that came from so far hey you know I'm saying it hurt a lot of people her everybody because it was like man we just got like our dick stomped in the dirt the event was cool oh the event was nice I had a good time I think my people had a good time I was just you know in the end it was just you know when you make a deal you should get what you paid for it or not well yeah it was cool other than that though dope time we all had a real good time you know we got to be together and hang out together we all went to the cup - Donna Clio and we all got together for that event also but only one of us had a beast and the booth wasn't big enough read your text after your lackeys is important article book but we all went to the cop and then we decided we're going to go to the Detroit cop but and we're like oh let's go to camp Palooza so we went there and we all decided to go there only so you want those now big mugs yeah there's no hard feelings though I mean it basically it goes on Michigan German states you know I'm saying everyone's gonna come down this you gotcha mid-space because we were the ones that held that for our peoples you know I mean so that's the only only kind of issue but hopefully all the people that were there understand and know what's going on we're on the same page it's not a big deal it was our first actual event that we had all had booze we all had an opportunities we all got the meet people we all got to be involved we all got our names put out there as Michigan's misfits and individually you know what I'm saying I mean look it going Michigan [ __ ] comes in here you know from yeah he [ __ ] the misfits we still had an awesome time you did yeah they [ __ ] us over a little bit but it wasn't that huge of a deal it's just you know it's just a deal's a deal when you shake someone's hand you give them [ __ ] you know twenty would we give them twenty two hundred dollars I mean we expected exactly what we're supposed to yes but you know we don't want to keep griping on the bad [ __ ] you know we don't try we're a cannabis community you know saying we don't try to focus on the negative stuff we try to focus on the good stuff and the good stuff was the difference between the cannabis cups and cantaloup the was there as camping we all got to hang out we all got to chill relax talk we didn't have to feel rushed like at the top speed I felt rushed the whole [ __ ] time even though I was stolen barely even said three words half the time like dude I felt brush everywhere I went it was terrible and can applause gave us an opportunity to AAM's human civilization really told to get with you guys in the future hell yeah we want actually like so Goliath and I I would love to do a cannabis event for ourselves you know Sam and that would be [ __ ] awesome pyramid-like structures I really likes to do that been trying to find I found somebody with a 14 acre property but I really don't know if that would be big enough elven big enough like might be although religious scholars would be the ziggurats really is mostly for spiritual purposes but I want to have a candidates event where it's like where people don't really have to have boots you know you can have a booth if you want to sit down and chill but I want people to just walk around with their [ __ ] bags the [ __ ] weed and be like here's my [ __ ] you want some like old school parties man you don't eat beans that would be dope but you got to find private as property like somebody's yard type [ __ ] yeah we had a great time though other events you know the little mishap stuff I mean it I think we had a great time I know everyone is at that bonfire had a [ __ ] blast like that was a time that we all cherish and we love young okay we were working just for you to be on that way it was always I thought we did that was there just whereas most reputable reapered smoke research oh yeah yeah right the back forty pence is unfortunate like so glide has big property but not that he almonds attached to the back of his house kind of things on there's 42 acres like right next door you know I'm saying is for sale and stuff and we keep trying to like look into buying it but the land would actually need a lot of work like you guys would [ __ ] kill yourselves walking through that place it's all like it's weird it looks like a burn and there's all this like shale like lime like flat rocks like real flat rock everywhere but it's broken up into like billions and zillions of pieces so walking through there is like treacherous man just roll your angles on every [ __ ] thing so that would have to be there you'd actually have 10 bulldozers come in there and cleared out a stupid [ __ ] but yeah trying to find something trying to find some of them B don't beautifully precise some more hanging out an event school and stuff but then you know we had to be somewhere at a certain timing kind of thing you know we had to go do stuff it was fun to actually be involved in do it but man I like to just relax and chill you know and then like a big party like you know how like the electric forest runs right you might have boots or something like that but the people I watched run through the electric forest they didn't really show booths or stuff like that I think it's just like people that run around and have their stuff you know and then you find people and you go hey man can I get some of that you know what I mean that's like the party I'm talking about just a party man we're all just walking around we can have bands come in there can be a cover charge for sure you know it's not like people have to be in a booth and selling anything you know there could be people that they want it to be you know little vendors and stuff that they want to come there and do that but it's like not one of this wouldn't be event like that would be just like hangout kind of camping party big [ __ ] yeah just can't be in Sochi a yeah yep yeah man just camping and hanging out [ __ ] getting high you know people need weed they'll be playing weed smoke but also plenty of things that can be purchased of course because you know it's a it's it's a it's a legal here so just like when we go to these events if you're on private property I mean maybe I should check into more legalities of this but if you're on private property you can [ __ ] seriously like donate your lead to any [ __ ] anybody as long as you're on that private private property that's why we can do it conchal and Cleo and our Clio and we can do that Kenan Palooza you know it's private property you can't just go stand on the street corner and go hey man you me weed you know well you can but you have to have them come back to your house questions yeah I had a really fun time I was more worried about like other people having a good time hounds and the people that would wander around some some of us that were with us they went to sleep kind of early you don't say but that's their schedule you don't mean I don't expect everyone to stay up all the [ __ ] time like I do yeah you know but yeah the people that came out we went to the concerts a couple times and man it was [ __ ] awesome that those bands just all [ __ ] night long and what was kind of cool was you could kind of hear it out of that a pavilion thing but it wasn't like it was rocking all the neighbors you know so that was kind of a cool little different thing secondary's yo is dope though yeah I got an uncle jesse's number from there yeah if I knew can't loser again i won't i won't be doing the food unless it's guaranteed like at least three thousand because that was the only only part though like paying for that preparing for that you know getting everything ready and set up like right now I have gallons and gallons of cannon butter nothing I can do with it you know Sam I mean people can only eat so many edibles around here so that's the only that was the only downfall was just not enough people came to the camp there's nobody's fault in understands maybe though the advertising was enough to fire but you know it is what it is that's again where you take sometimes you know it was not a cannabis cup but it was canvas event rate and coming by weed it figured more people come out but see it's hard it's really hard to do when you know you're in a legal [ __ ] state area and this is all farming up here dude so now all all over the place a lot of places are farming so you know everyone that lives around their gross weed you don't mean so they don't really need to come and get me but I saw that Hustler's going through there you know those people that come up in there they got three or four people standing behind them with bags full of weed and they'll come up and give you that whole hustle about from out of town and I came up here just for this event and I only got twenty bucks to spend but what's funny is if you you know be in Michigan's misfits and said how we sad you've got to hear those people go from booting the boos of ours telling the same [ __ ] spiel you know what I'm saying yeah yeah you can email me my email it was a winter room cousin with smoke fire earlier needs you legal everywhere yeah when it goes legal federally that's when I'm really gonna [ __ ] party because that's you know then they if they make it federal eagle and then limit your plan account that would be [ __ ] dumb but you know I just don't want any kind of any [ __ ] of any job trying to come in my yard and tell me I can't [ __ ] draw a plan that's the stupidest [ __ ] I ever [ __ ] not even they won't come in here guard and say oh you're this big dealer your supply in the whole [ __ ] Northeast Michigan with ganja so they don't say that they come in and say you're growing weed we're cutting it all down and now you're in trouble wait hold on so I'm not as big huge drug dealer by your standards I'm not corrupting anything I'm not tax evading anything on doing and growing a plant and I'm in trouble that's [ __ ] that's [ __ ] I'm sayin [ __ ] out Nora tell ya yeah that's why I went Ohio gets legal oh [ __ ] and you understand I'm from Ohio I know it exactly what's there I know exactly how she runs I know exactly how it works in the underground you know rich in Ohio Oh cousin you got that hurts man you know who I can't wait to come around we had a guy with us white point genetics he get all of that dude and see what he's got because holy [ __ ] he had some bomb-ass read that truffles cute it was blue raspberry truffles oh my god and it fooled me I thought it was Durbin poison I was like that's my Durbin they're like I'm and that's the trouble so I'm like [ __ ] so I gave it back to white point I gave a bold choice and I go you tell me which one is the truffles and then he was like that one's the trouble so I'm like holy [ __ ] I'm like that's crazy I was wild yeah but the UH the stage it cannot Palooza was [ __ ] that was legendary I don't know who put that together I don't know who set it up but that [ __ ] was awesome oh you know what I gotta take a [ __ ] big neither she all right talk about just I was gonna be back in like three minutes where the shoes is it most of the exclusive truth discovered in the cuneiform tablets reveals the Sumerians were actually visited by lynx-o extraterrestrial believed that the Sumerians words will cure them about extraterrestrials who had visited the Sumerians share knowledge even seeded human society as we know it by breeding with humans and actually producing a hybrid race for a decision the Anunnaki came down here to do some work to do some mining for ball to find things that they needed in their civilization when the work became too intense for them they couldn't handle all the work they decided with Ashley workers in citizen and they took the genetics of themselves apparently create physical bodies we now call modern men the Sumerians believed that you mine gold that's very very interesting if you think about it they read that into us we still have that fascination to this day but the real question that we want to ask about the Anunnaki edge do we take these stories to be a little bit trigger okay or do we take them as stories that the Sumerians their culture if we're gonna take them as literature we have a lot of questions one question relates to extraordinary similarities in the artwork of this Americans are the owner of Mesoamerica in Sumerian depictions the Anunnaki guards home for appears to be a small bath with a handle how's it possible that strangely similar bag is being held by the Olmec astronaut as a vente you see in our case something in their hand what is this object Perseus next civilization it is an object or objects that are almost identical perhaps as some theorize in extraterrestrial intelligence and sharing this information in both civilizations direct connection between all that in sumerian civilizations as UFO researchers theorized they had existed a very different period of time but nonetheless is it possible at this time maybe it's a coincidence this suggests that these really are talking about was saying extraterrestrial visitors does the evidence suggests that the Olmec and Maya were visited by the same list so-called stardom is known to the Sumerians as the Anunnaki and if so what were extraterrestrials have to gain by these felicitations the UFOs are an advanced alien civilization the mayor here the 21st century it's absolutely logical to think that they probably been here for thousands of years they could essentially be watching the growth of humanity when they stick around and research us that model that's a big question mark maybe their agenda is to see the natural evolution of young species maybe that is their mission of this oppressive governments around the world including in Mexico and know that our civilization they haven't seen by extraterrestrial landings in the ancient past if so what else are they not telling us an inherently mysterious phenomena which we are we are also dealing with government and military obfuscation and see Christine and that's just the fact we live in an era in which there is tremendous amount of secrecy still one thing is clear the Sumerian tablets do offer clues to the future if they are to be believed there is a prophecy that some day the Anunnaki will come back they return to claim their property claim their mistake and the harmony with the people appearance we should see about actually why's abundantly clear is that the plastination of otherworldly visitors and their likeness throughout ancient history is not something that [Music] information is transforming what people believe extraterrestrial spacecraft the government hiding the truth July 7th 2003 11 18 p.m. a NASA Delta 2 launch vehicle blasts off from Cape Canaveral for error is an expert bag opportunity [Music] they don't try my new bonnet today information in search of any traces of what not this idea of we should follow the water dr. gevaarlijk going to intense searches the people over as a kid in the shop to search for signs of life exists yeah NASA NASA knows that shit's real NASA be known [Music] two months things claim to keep clean as clean as a scientist claimed that electrostatic charge particles in Martian dust and some so how do you pick up chatter with the tools so you gonna keep this part here these people news was perhaps a base for any terrestrial technology there this was cancer a stopping off point on the journey to earth UFO researchers have even gone so far as to raise the question of whether or not the rover has been secretly outfitted with ultra advanced technology from an unknown source Turner's not only one from a distant were not a [ __ ] [Music] [Music] torch maybe torch in my going to be good for nectar clay yes prehab I wanna see if I can use this piece in this piece now we can put some flour in here and got some dry it's not goodies crumb boys just put in the egg got some dried urban poison for Dan your [ __ ] pipe and smoke it first time using the paper flower cheers [ __ ] ha ha from that damned shatter got some Shannon from the cannibal loser [ __ ] yeah so Jason conned us is like yo guys brought some blunts I'll share some of these diamonds with you man we roll up two bucks and you dip the [ __ ] out it is really clean but dead lower than that dinner some good [ __ ] have to say don't know if it's gonna rain or shine outside today Tony to go what up the mad scientist what Manchus welcome to the twisted house welcome to the twisted Misfits peg was what a [ __ ] is going on we're trying out this new [ __ ] claw Cyrus what I can bond I got one still got some [ __ ] in there last night should what's the role people stale bomb smoke make you choke you haven't tough just in a long time damn bro I toss dress mean water water the corner monarchy order to learn or [Music] question your nipples and everything yeah oh that's why you're blooming late because you're still feeding veg nutrients bro you have to switch a muscle so to ignition ignite flowering great you gotta go and get yourself some bat guano get you some background on it's high in phosphorus blast it with that [ __ ] top dress it and then water it in it and then boom over nice you should have [ __ ] dish it off pop and then you want to switch to low low nitrogen higher phosphorous phosphorous and then like else you can have like lower potassium at first cuz that in the beginning a flower you want the phosphorous to get that stretch and stacked on on right then later on you need that high potassium to build the [ __ ] the fatness [ __ ] get all them resins going in shares yeah phosphorus is very most ingenious well it's all depends bro what you got in your soil backwoods you know some plants will go but some plant seeds there's two [ __ ] stubborn you know and you need to [ __ ] kick him in and if you're not a flower yet man we live in Michigan I know you boys live down south so I don't know exactly how late you're growing season is but for me around August 15 when I wasn't seeing flowers I was tripping like hold off man that's not good because you got think about it October 13 is the full moon so two months would go for me I don't count exact days in the months but roughly two moons you know that's how it goes on Indian Way will be from [ __ ] you know August 13th to October 13 so by the 15th when I didn't see blooming I was like aw [ __ ] house for the full moon you know that means so like oh [ __ ] so we gotta give this [ __ ] brawling so we night it with the

your plants bro oh yeah we'll have nutrients piss on your bucket plants are in the shade he's in full suck for as long as he has son if he was in more shade he would be in flower at least some of you would be you've got some late bloomer seeds from Mars it's entirely possible itself truth and I think that given his and his ideas 85 it's entirely possible that he was influenced by outside forces here yes I like it I don't like how long these pieces right it works of course you know I love the color changers for sure we're in the farmers are too sensitive information those there are predator

of Roswell Army Airfield who wrote the original press release about the fact that they captured a flying saucer seen here for the first time on national television is Walter house video recorded by the disclosure project a UFO research group as these nice the 1947 Roswell press release story that I've given to me almost leaner by Colonel Blanchard do they in fact that we have enough possession of lying saucer it was found on a ranch up north as well newspapers and radio stations a stranger the very next day the military retracted the statement he did not believe that that press release was legitimate he believed that the original intention prostate essentially medgar one [ __ ] yeah so I got some primal punch last year I tried to grow all of them and not among pop so I went to the cup in a Clio right went over to ocean grow and Stan met Bader and then made for one sitting there I'm like Amy what's up and I was like you didn't talk today he gifted me some of those primal punches but dude I planted all [ __ ] six of them [ __ ] and none [ __ ] pop these I don't know what's going on sighs wondering if you had them here he was like nah man but here take my newest strain I just came out with that I was like sweet it's call if you inspire our [Music] [Music] [Music] ran selection also for the revenge mirror for decades the US government has shown a fierce commitment to keeping from the public what UFO researchers claim is smoking gun evidence of extraterrestrial visitation inherently mysterious phenomena which we are we are also dealing with Lewis government and military confiscation and secrecy and that's just the fact the United States top-secret security clearances are designed to be ironclad the unlawful disclosure of such classified information is punishable by steep fines and up to 10 years in prison yeah now has a technology to take e.t knowledge to travel to the stars which was also reported to say there are UFOs and there are UFOs the rich apparently use the phrase hand-me-downs talking about things like stealth and drones as the hand-me-downs presume from extraterrestrial was very rich claiming that our most advanced aerospace and military technologies many he himself helped develop were originally engineered by extraterrestrials she's were also shittiness from space shuttle program the drone there's a real track record here if somebody was being involved with almost every highly advanced aerospace in space and into the list of high-profile confessions is lieutenant colonel philip corso who is once a part of the US national security state a decorated veteran who served in the Eisenhower White House horrified witness accounts shot the UFO research community take courses probably the single most controversial legitimate genuine military use a colonel for the end of his life in 1997 published in the book and the video recorded by the disclosure project of course those feats about an extraordinary impact he experienced in 1947

what planet is that this is Durban poison so we have already cut off the main primary colas off this thing stuff like this what's so frosting [ __ ] dirt poison man [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so I have clones of this we're gonna grow those ones out too but we're going to keep this from alive for as long as possible and you harvest after harvest after harvest after hurts so this is the second harvest in course so became chief of the Pentagon's one technology best in army research when I came to research record to talk to the court small that's a nice little fanny according to course the autopsies detailed in the reports or the alien bodies recovered when I saw the body River nothing else of along later on when I got the adoption we put their experts they've done our own nations name

too into the turkey bags I'll probably happen to dry mine and cure mine and [ __ ] totes [ __ ] I didn't buy another house as we did damn we bring jobs some of these brands are shooting right I made it to switch and it's gotten to be nothing these projects now they've got pull together we do information out we do regarding the theme that runs through an awful lot of these skies that embassy said that confessions that are helped made from somewhere else other words we didn't get to this point incredibly advanced technology without somebody else intervening or you have OB surgeries one question remains if the government is with all the evidence pointing to otherworldly contact how long do they plan to concede truth to think that this lie can last forever is the height of foolishness it's coming out we're never gonna be ready for the truth leaders although many regard these so-called confessions as questionable there was an astonishing event and which gathered for all to see and hear reputable former military and government officials and scientists and a first ever press conference in Washington DC where explosive claims were raised about secrets and where those government does not want [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Rael Arcania like older ones with next episodes of mania and depression patients call your doctor about unusual changes

trimming God's operations of highly regarded members of the scientific and military communities the US telemedicine concealing for decades in contact intervention with UFOs recently many more children stepped forward may 2001 a first-of-its-kind press conferences held at the National Press Club in Washington DC military intelligence and in some cases had an experience here super heard he talked about the literary coverage by the CIA in particular cases over Alaska since retired employee was a manager for the accent evaluation investigation division and they soon Callahan's testimony regarding what came to be known as the Anchorage incident involved that UFO encounter over Alaska with a Japan Airlines jet chopper 17 [Music] promptly ship the government question had been reported by the jaeil flight crew who said that as many as this meeting and all evidence of the Anchorage incident was confiscated and callahan was told by government authorities not just that there was never disclosed nor discuss the government a retired Air Force radar controller also appeared at the conference my name is Michael Smith while I was assigned to final fault or gap there I put the radar site and they were watching him on the radar that was Iranian about 8,000 feet it sat there for about 10 minutes and then slowly descended telegraph dog the radar was going on for about five ten minutes when it's totally read here that the stationary big Swede earlier was miles away stationary you know we're there about ten months and redid the whole cycle twice more officer Smith of air force protocol and reported the sightings to the North America arrow states the events demand or know that once again the government stepped in to ensure the incident was kept under wraps as they keep yourself need-to-know basis on one of the most dramatic testimony came from officer Dan Willis had top secret documents nobody listening is overbroad what about Brahman Chancellor 14500 top secret clearance to security glance County near Alaska was caused by the secret Bishop reporter the greatly blowing the British foreign political object constantly emerging out of the ocean shot into space at about 7,000 the UFO was tracked ugly and the sightings carried by people officers on board the ship in Alaska Willis immediately reported the seconds superiors the scroll bar to discuss it one after another of these people got off control the assembled members of the media you know this this is not just hopes this information we experienced in terms of range I'll tell these stories various different secrets that are being kept our news government at different levels at different times ways what you see is a very consistent secrecy cover-up conspiracy by the US government to keep us from Nelly women are Mexicans now as the mainstream press began to research and report on the incredible testimony given of the covers the public began to take notice but this dramatic new UFO evidence was soon over shell origins partnered months later 9/11 and all of this was suddenly no longer knew what was in tor society if evidence taking evidence exists these questions about how this line has corroded and infiltrated and damaged the very institutions that we have relied on the truth and what might the repercussions team or government responds with the reality of the existence of UFOs and number traditions one that one centers for 36 months and is no will be slower like a nut he's like a and so someone asked me the other day like what strains I was excited for what strains I'm like you know really my on so I think what I'm gonna do is Tang Tang which ones I like which ones I walk through you'll see a big sign there's a marker a there's some that really man they got my renounce would put second according to UFO researchers evidence from deathbed confessions and prominent scientists indicates that UFOs may actually exist and suggests there may also be serious security implications while there are many who do not believe there has been any alien contact from UFO encounters to the end I do believe from time to time they do come back and they spread knowledge do are these are they extraterrestrial be wait till Lord Shiva comes back to earth and sees how good as the weed is is going to be impressed will they return in peace dude I'm Tony as soon as these [ __ ] land I'll be like the Weed Man I've been growing it this whole time for you check it out man teach me how to make that annoying oil though try male 17 damn rope yeah I'm out there top Justin every week yes I believe him with that [ __ ] frequency hit him with that [ __ ] water in between I do some hands-on type T's like we're casting at E launch it [ __ ] you in the house host T I've done some weed sprout teas new marijuana reads brought tears I've done that twice and then I'll so use my provide stock from the stream gardening's mister means green trees and kids own double-oh-seven yeah burrowing in being broke though Tony here's the thing this is not not saying anything about you bro just hear me out first and then you'll understand what I'm talking about the soldiers to be a [ __ ] badass grower right to be a good grower you need to learn how to not depend on you know Amazon Prime or a growth story you don't saying you have everything you need around you in your yard to actually make nutrients when you have none you know I'm saying it's as easy as going fishing bro you know I'm saying you go fishing you catch a little [ __ ] [ __ ] finish you chop them all up you make fish heads do broke into your planet you know said you got grass there's grass you know when you cut your grass all you do is you ferment that grass in the bucket for three days you straighten it out feed that to your plant that's [ __ ] straight as nitrogen right there you know I would dilute it you know there's certain things other things you could put on your plant that are organic that are a little out of the realm you've been doing but on the fly you know I'm saying when you got no money you can do [ __ ] like that what I really like to do - Oh Tony - totes this is my go-to when I run out of nutrients and I'm waiting for new nutrients to come I go to Home Depot and get me some dr. earth every [ __ ] time I throw that dr. earth down there to dry amendment on the top there and I water that [ __ ] in and the plants it's 100% organic dude plants love dr. earth Berlin yeah they got this dr. earth pump pump stuff now must be in the other room too - it's really fun cool um it says you just pump it in your plant and then water you be do it like that I did it like that a couple times but I prefer to pump it into a bucket and then you know bubble it a little bit and then run with it come down completely surrounded what is the government keep this image of my child and from the public what secrets are they trying to conceal me beginning to tell us what we are we sons child the government to reveal the truth little child new information is transforming what people believe about extraterrestrials 52 y'all knew by her feet - right March 16th 1968 stone it's called our area of web in central Utah it's home to a small Native American population owned for research it had become infamous for something far different that morning ranchers woke up to find a home with thousands and thousands of bear oh what a feral yes is my second harvest on this sumbitch you got smoke take that [ __ ] at Cannon Palooza my Second Harvest taking on a little bit of wheat up in here there's still no official explanation for what happened [Music] in the sense secret's out but in some ways this officially basic maybe that's the this more 2,000 square miles of research in their way [Music] you know it's taken me years and years just lately go around this place to document there's like disorders houston state stand on the other white and look across maybe things will get your decision and as far as you can see started in the extreme no loves catching flies someone died yo purple Dozier Sucker Free Oh Jean - killing it [ __ ] [ __ ] toy soldier if you guys don't know [ __ ] toy soldier you ain't [ __ ] been around nowhere you better [ __ ] sub up right now and [ __ ] hope you [ __ ] forgives you know that purple Dozier is [ __ ] amazing bro I'm having reports that it gets purple flowers and week one or week two of flowering so I'm [ __ ] excited bro because everything I got outside right now it's got some super super [ __ ] color on it I got some [ __ ] that has purple white hairs I have some [ __ ] that's got fuchsia [ __ ] white hairs I got some [ __ ] that's got white white here's my guards lookin good bro but I try to look the [ __ ] toy soldier almost like I don't know if you still go big like you used to when I first found you a couple years ago but man Johnny toy soldiers like the little secret no it really talks about toy soldiers guard two months I'm on the [ __ ] got the biggest goddamn buds remember [ __ ] teeth man not that wide like that mom like [ __ ] monsters the whole [ __ ] thing so begging this [ __ ] looks like a monster [ __ ] yo children doesn't big man besides that's where all these crazy strains come from - got that black rhino Oh should I do that this year oh I got that uh New Orleans night cross right inhale back there something clutch pump net we do a couple crosses with this noise soldier boy so desires doing base [ __ ] on this channel guys always doing all kind see dog sheds and [ __ ] that we oh I don't know how [ __ ] you find that we don't but next season I mean I'll test anything [ __ ] yeah but I got off a busy plate from now until next outdoor season I got a fee no hunt all the [ __ ] that I created so and I got to do a great project for date knowledge some work right now I'm working on breeding projects to indoors list of like Deborah foot can do I'll test anything I love toys Linda strains me honor if you want you to give you my email and uh if you'd like to hit me up I'll definitely [ __ ] I'll definitely test and [ __ ] up I have to do a seed run in Mars hi Joe for my sponsors but I'm gonna do after harvest good about [ __ ] time man we're delighted you're good go what a pork garden good life growing house [ __ ] you in so I saw the man you need to [ __ ] your bank Green Brooks you're like one of the [ __ ] master men you're like one of these to me you're like the hidden master you know you're not like we're not popular out there like [ __ ] you know like TGA and all that stuff but then from like the people I know from YouTube dude there's a couple masters that I I consider masters and you're definitely one of them everything I've ever got from you was [ __ ] great dude - which great stuff I am a [ __ ] on your strings to tons of them from all kinds of different evil disruption some of these trying to give it second third harvest off this planet does Durban poison right here so you've got 100% Afghan myth male and it costs a hundred percent indica male Afghani has all those so we're gonna do some breathing with that for show stories they've seen witnessed experience where these contact me modern meet me at a restaurant show me something special so they're 300 number two it's a beast out there it's a trained beast that prove knows you tonight's definitely Big East big all based so very welcome to come clean this little [ __ ] up you know if you see like inside this plant right just you like little [ __ ] like like this little stuff down here all these little [ __ ] nodes and stuff right so I'm not gonna cut those off on my final harvest I'm gonna leave those and imma let them rebadge out and those will turn back into branches trying to find the nice hard secondaries black Reynold crazy I know I was showing a [ __ ] I forgot I had it bro I was looking through my seeds and I'm like wag Brian oh what's the [ __ ] subs just talking about a white rhino and [ __ ] and I saw that one and I was like son of a [ __ ] I should have planted at this summer I forgot a head though that's what I'm definitely gonna be kneeling here next in the next time I knew some seed runs yeah but I'm gonna try to stabilize for the rest of the year I'm gonna try to stabilize stabilize a couple of strains that I created it and see if we can pick some phenols out of it we'll do a live feed Oh hunt and all that stuff I'll have like my pick off Goliath come over and have him do a pic and then we'll do a a youtube pic of course you guys can't smell it or nothing like that you can go based on looks or whatever I think it might be a little fun interaction interactive series we can do and then we'll see what comes out at the end you know might be good [Music] yeah revenge oh yeah yeah yeah these these here so the first time I pulled the top colas I just I wanted to take some mechanic blues with me so we had all all cloudy embers and I know we had a couple that were amber you know I just due to weather there's nothing like that right so on the secondary harvest right here these are all [ __ ] almost [ __ ] hammer there's like a lot there's new ones too but there's a lot that's amber on this so we're gonna pull these ones and see how these ones are and cost-plus them out of turbine poison so we're gonna take these down and smoke on these then we'll let these little baby ones here like all these little ones we'll let those ones grow for another couple weeks let them get plump again plump these ones up and then we'll harvest all the rest of the top shed basically all the purple stuff and then whatever's left we're gonna rebadge you know rebadge it out so I only had one seed of this one seed I've got clums and stuff but I like to try to see if I can keep the plant alive I think it'd be pretty cool like 2020 2020 Mon I pull this [ __ ] around I'm like yeah I'm like harvest 8 yeah we have cloud yeah yeah absolutely yes still awesome I wanna see and that's killing land rate so I know I only have one see not like [ __ ] so I couldn't [ __ ] it up and I got clones a bit we're gonna revenge this one out though and we'll use some [ __ ] with it yeah one scene just can't wait to see we're gonna cross it with that [ __ ] Durban poison see what comes out that's gonna be nice or I'm sorry the Hannah's sister put trying to cross with the Afghani in the coffin is hundred percent sativa see what comes with that these buds these secondary buds are nothing to sneeze they had their mouth bigger anything just trying to get some bud in my bag you know had I known how [ __ ] awesome this one would be I would have grown it into a big plant on to date this is my favorite I'm absolutely in love with this for their poison weaponry like to me the high is perfect it's not that [ __ ] punch you in the face and I know this is sativas your guys bald for signs of sativa go smoke tangent tell me how punched in the face you feel tangey is sativa honest a 100% to and it will not give up security area is a location where traumatic projects between US government extraterrestrial say facts this is the researchers who contend don't worry has been a hotbed of UFO activity during maneuvers that I know he's either there metal craft or its owners I personally witnessed unconventional crafts being escorted by might not compel others I've heard other sources that in my way the glue that's in the area these type of craft not me all military there's no way that the military can account for all the sightings of the time getting them going on here that cross everything and finalement yeah I need help I know right and so there was a plan kind of that taught our I mean Texas og had and I we came up with you know to be able to find like-minded breeders with high plant counts that we can start doing projects and using their plant count you know to the benefit of the coalition but it kind of never never happened like that there be cool though I think their cannabis show said he's looking at at harvest time we're looking at 96 new strains so how the [ __ ] you're gonna feed on that [ __ ] okay it's gonna take them [ __ ] 10 years that's that's extreme that's a lot of new flavors last year I did roughly like 20-something cheers for 22 oh man we missed 420 so what up Katie I heard a dude and you never showed oh don't you hate that [ __ ] so Joe all right let's folks weed since we miss [ __ ] 4/20 send them a [ __ ] [ __ ] we get our nectar collector TV people cheers canteen 1999 watered down the order called 105 in three one zero three five are good to get legacy killer back on that 20 M in five three one zero three five we know the US government has recovered through various means Soviet meat and coffee I managed to reverse-engineer dirt but look at something like stealth yeah to smoke out it has such a funky Everest Mount oh my god caterpillars bro [ __ ] I just picked about 150 caterpillars off my [ __ ] no let me let me let me put that battery inchworms there the inchworms they're the ones that have like two little grass bruise on the back of their [ __ ] body and then like four or six up front and they fold it in half and all that weird [ __ ] those are the ones I'm getting caterpillars the army tent ones the [ __ ] we were getting last year I have not [ __ ] seen an army tent where army since June we are getting those inchworms like them on [ __ ] dogs yeah I just go and they go it's wrong wrong you know I'm saying so yeah black magic yeah did I get hundreds of them out there those little inch worms the army tent worms in my opinion or a lot worse because I haven't seen those inch worms really going in my bud much they seem to be on the top or on the leaf and they're just being stupid they're easily to pick off for those army time worms are the ones that like if this is your bud they like rapid eating you're [ __ ] buzz like a [ __ ] blanket and that they web all in there and then they start to eat and plant material and poop and all his air and then spam they turn into a [ __ ] moth and fly away and then your butt gets butt rot you have no idea because it's so the Leafs are like they camouflage you you know I'm saying because you got your butt on top and then all the Leafs start growing down you know from there so so much [ __ ] gets covered you got really I pulled my whole butt out like I'll pull my branch legs fold it out and then look like oh man it's a [ __ ] the purple ones I found a pink one today I don't know what the [ __ ] it was even but it was pink you know we got green ones yellow ones orange ones enough on the paper yeah purple ones maybe your weeds purple and that's why they're privileged because for instance I always find these things eaten like my white hairs right and I have bright ass red white hair cloud there they're like fuchsia which I was thinking maybe that thing was eaten on those and then came over to my other one oh yeah every morning dude I go out there and do my caterpillar cake and then as them out there normally mouths are like just all day [ __ ] around tinkering and stuff but started getting shitty out there may be bugs run in so instead of having my [ __ ] get all wet like I said [ __ ] let me just come in here work on this stuff but yeah normally I'd be out there all day just pick it leaves still doing branch selection still doing some training pulling through stuff through supporting stuff and then that find some [ __ ] the worm it was there was like hundreds a fit and then you know the the [ __ ] ants went work in the all the predator bugs went to work out there the bugs and [ __ ] and now the aphids you might find like one on an entire plant when you research even if you have looked on your whole entire brains like if you only have one 8-bit per branch like you're doing good that means your friends or boats are merging no bugs are no that's the best but dude you're outdoors you know without the brain and blasting all the damn time or any meat oh you know maybe next year something I'll look into is the nematodes you know like how men dodo bad there's this year they worked really well for them so maybe we'll look into that for next year so I think we're gonna let the rest of this one go [Music] conventional or no select filter from the 1599 that's a heck of a deal laminate brain can they [ __ ] although I think the rest of this we're gonna let go for a little bit another couple weeks maybe like September 15 all the work is for around September 15th or so somewhere around there will cut this down and then put it back and rematch [Music] put them in back in the remade John Sam the rusty it's got some kind of those are test plants we test our spray on and [ __ ] yeah test the spray on those plants and then if they pass and don't get fried up or anything stupid like that spray our big plants so far so good [Music] here's the story mountain coffee roasters supposed to reconfirm UFO researcher Dave Rosenfeld as seen and heard reports of so many astounding spacecraft in and around area 52 to suspect that somewhere massive property at Dugway proving ground he believes their existence could alter human history forever I personally witnessed my saucers disappearing janitor working around my conclusion is that there's a military space bug waiting I don't the gaming community but is there proof genetic of such cleanly investigators say V Evans lives with a message you know crazy is I have plants that are growing in rocks that I never for the first time on national coach shows a previously undiscovered mysterious rock formation on the Martian surface though this is the NASA Mariner 9 image from the surface of Mars mount rain even here Mountain cluster here they valley the area of interest is this cone shape [Music] the Clone official page where the we've got a little bit of weed right here that's we need this away if I gave this to Pharaoh he roll this up into like three [ __ ] joints I bet you what about Michael Wallace have you ever tried an outdoor plan after harvesting beds like dig it up throw in a tent know what to do tutto from my state go down I did the same thing though I had one that it [ __ ] on Kaiser whatever plush I planted like four of the same plants and one one five gallon bucket three or four of nine all night whatever I put it outside it died all the way and then came back and flowered I went to revenge no it's the biggest plant outside if I was you know bucket that's bruising into the ground so that's pretty [ __ ] school where do we did you said where did we get out my brayer back go get that we so we use our does the evidence suggests that there you really does function you know as those are right the things for Christmas ornaments that's what I like to use the hangman ganja if the evidence is credible as UFO researchers believe what else is the government possibly hai tang my god information from scientists changing the conversation about ulo seconds does this provide a new perspective on the government's involvement with death of another we're Dave Rosenfeld there is no doubt that UFOs are connected to top-secret activity area 52 and leaves he's got to there's many times we gone there were sky watches we bring all our equipment up there pigeon and when I don't wanna o'clock in the morning and then also receive about my miles okay each flashing light beam of light like static electricity Dave describes what happened next he took this time shul never before seen photo at night down second time that fire we watched work five blue lights come down and completely surround this game left they were watching excuse that being shut off they took on it's interesting you back in it yeah you you what's the simply attention yeah I'm gonna hang this [ __ ] up once we're gonna pop them on beard on fire beans like [Music] [Music] [Music] you're tall Foundation don't is proving to treat and reduce the risk of DVT or this put this if there was something post the video chopped some buds what up grow man oh there was something there's something else I was gonna save with me and I got stoned and like these for God should be seen first sorry dude I suspect will change people's mind about the whole phenomena that one such diamond infant was a report by the CIA scientific intelligence department following a wave of UFO sightings over Washington DC today this would normally be little tiny popcorn buds not saying that the biggest thing in the world but to do the Second Harvest man it's so worth it if you have time in space you know this easy is when you know this was how easy was by the time I chopped it down everything outside was basically going in the flour so all I had to do is Stadium flower piece boom his easy is - I don't have to take up any space inside I don't have to keep climbing right I don't have to do [ __ ] I'm flirt outside I check it every once in a while I feed it once a week and just come back we got a box a box of Bud we have few stragglers let's go [Music] [Music] [Music] please big-nose nipple things we're gonna crack sucking on fire so beard on fire is an ocean grown right it sounds like just another free prints working credit Sesame is so much more than for headaches would kind of texted me just give the power to take control of your credit and just think about all you can do is break credit so I don't have to drop off the grid Michigan now just plain old water here grown from the cup gravy what up let me in I'll have four strains building websites not much work can be done what a mojo how bad can be more we leave so here have beard on fire that's because it's just the right temperature where liquid water could exist on the surface so for a video they have no idea that a hundred years after they achieve the science and technology progresses into the future 150 years this one now this one just has characteristics we'll see so we want to scare far exceeds a scare for my presidency about you why people say you scare only old seeds but are you doing this scratching off that show show a little bit playing in the water what am i sorry for 28 streets which problems so I cut down the some of it but now we are scary things beard on fire get [ __ ] out of to beard on fires and I'm gonna do these different than I normally do so I'm gonna leave these for 24 hours in the water and then they will go into a you know to more later for video beers times the base on fire going through your time-space on fire that makes weird on fire Peter gone fighter so we have some of those pops this is gonna be for the Mars hides row grow series Mars hydro grow series so we're gonna put this up as a safe if you visit why the Commission's then we keep it safe oh [ __ ] I didn't know I had this bag we were just come from hill yeah we got dams but see the dams I want to like do a [ __ ] monster rip of a dad but if I do I'm afraid I might chick pence and blow boogers all over it straight at the same time saying some kind of little scared but we love the dads man sorry I got a GDP I can chop up to toy soldiers like wow I just got weed for [ __ ] days and years knows Levin weed over here in this bag right here is donkey punch so it's baboon times tangerine dream times purple Urkel and then this one is pineapple Larry which is kind of Express times thing clear yeah I forgot Edna's there's a little jar of it sitting on the floor over there now smoking down the tube is big this is when I created those breasts I'm Stevie Larry it's [ __ ] sweet itself smells all pineapple II gotta see if that GDP is dry now when I if I pull a CBP out on live camera you guys gonna promise me one thing don't laugh at me Terrell terrible it's basically a stick full of calyxes there's no but is what investigators are focused on we might even like because it was made from a ship care from a ship man y'all saw Rainier routes ocean grown genetics my guys man war I was looking at one of those and I was going to come back by the time I came back they shut their boot down gosh is yes it wasn't meant to be but uh yeah I

"Q5P408mr6Wo": "true leaves Durbin poisoned true pods are 20 to 1 THC to CBD ratio it's super easy to get a poll from the new true pods Durbin poison is smooth at first and again upon exhale there may be a slight tickle or COFF with a sour flavor but that's just the taste as for the effects I feel a lot of focus in my headspace a very good strain to wake up and start the day I'm able to get whatever I need to get done throughout the day with little to no resistance as it settles in I feel calmer and less anxious Durbin poison contains around 25 percent THC with a decent amount of CBG which is known to help stomach related irritation and pain Durbin poison also has a high amount of D limonene which may come off as a citrusy taste the Tru pod contains roughly 800 milligrams of product and each three-second Pole is roughly 2 point 5 milligrams everyone's dosing is different for me I take around 5 polls a day equal to 12 point five milligrams which comes out to about two

"good morning it must be 7:10 because I don't have a Slurpee so what's going on out there we are going to have we're gonna have a short show today we're gonna cut it down to 15 minutes because we actually have to get on the road to get up to the FM CC conference today and we're gonna be in the Big Green Bus so we got a lot to do to get ready to get up there so we're gonna have to cut it out a little bit early we need a start timer we should start the time yeah right now I just take on there so I don't have like a bunch of cannabis news to talk about today because I mean there was some some news over you know the past couple of days about some nefarious doctors that have been circulating and stuff like that and you know I don't know enough details about it to go into it but I would just say vet your doctors and make sure that they're good doctors and that they're not just well the doctor you also want to say clinics and doctors you cannot pay for referrals right it was there was one that's less linic right there's a there's a patient brokerage act right Florida and one clinic I saw a post and this is free advice for everybody here regards to Varna but it was an actual post gettin $25 to refer patients to us and it was like it was like qualified referral like a bunch of marketing kids right like that didn't know anything I just like oh let's do this how come I was doing infernos seems like a no-brainer but also guys working in the dispensaries do not take backs from doctors it's a major problem in this industry and they're starting to investigate and they're starting to find out in people getting in trouble there was a news report recently I think it was out of Miami Miami Herald about some new stuff in the industry doctor Doran yeah so just be careful out there guys there's laws and make sure you know you're doing okay key states there with doctors they you can dress yes and we're hopefully putting together like a list of doctors that we trust say Go Go trust going with dr. trust where do I find one now I know okay guys I can trust them we know a lot of good ones so we're putting a list together to spend a lot of work enjoy meeting people throughout the state and yeah so I'm so bad as my little freaking hot flashes a little bit and you're drinking iced coffee yeah I know which is Dunkin Donuts is that where you went this morning did you get a doughnut no no no that's impressive although Dunkin Donuts have you ever seen them make coffee at Dunkin Donuts when they put sugar in the cup they use a scooper like none yeah like red scooper and they don't like take a scoop and then put it in they level and they go like this so it's like like it pushes a whole bunch of it in there like it's like oh and like that whole like sugar like bottom of it yes are we convinced for a time that Dunkin Donuts lace their cups with sugar because I would get black coffee in the morning on a gym like a big guys black coffee I was on this kick for a while where I wouldn't even do pre-workout so I wouldn't even drink a bang or anything I would just need a black coffee and I would go to Dunkin Donuts and I get this tall black coffee and I'm like this is swinging like this and well first when you order it I'm like I'm like black like no sugar no sugar just black no cream no cream just black so no sugar no cream oh my god just like can you pour the coffee in the cup and just hand it to me so hey so and then I drink it I feel like it's sweet I'm like they gotta put something that's good this shit's coffee because they're wanting people to come back alright or cocaine or something like a sweet crack so are you rolling that rolling so this is some atlas from fluent which is Durbin poisoning there have been poison what a coincidence I just happen to have a whole lot of facts about there but not absolute German poison is one of our streams that we like to look for yes it's actually one of the more sought after strains and once we start getting into why anyway once you start getting into the reasons that people use it you'll understand why so the biggest thing about Durbin poison is not that it comes from Africa but it's that it has a high concentration of THC v right and THC v is it's known to be an appetite suppressant but it also is known to help focus so it's this is like the focus strain some people not me because I don't have a lot of experience with it but some people say that it's comparable to using adderall for anxiety right and the thing about this is that it actually decreases anxiety while increasing focus and energy right which is like way better yeah so it's a really energetic sativa but it's not racy and it doesn't give you anxiety as a matter of fact I love my music for anxiety THC V also helps with diabetes and blood sugar helps regulate blood sugar it helps like we just said reduce anxiety attacks so it's great for people with PTSD or anxiety and actually one of the more promising things is that it helps with Alzheimer's and that it has been shown to help with tremors motor control and even it works for me and great nations I thought of that like tremors my hand drummer isn't like oh god so it's a well I think and the focus and then the other one was probably worked for me I don't know if it's bone or cartilage but it actually promotes bone growth so that's it's being studied for use with osteoporosis so th t v-- what does that even mean it means tetrahydrocannabinol Canepa baron Pavan I don't know but but if you made a th CV medicine huh what would you call it I would call it Babar it it looks like a pharmaceutical there right you can hear you can hear the commercial yeah if you don't take if you're allergic to the Lorelai versus don't take lyrica if you're allergic to lyrica what good for allergic to what Thanks this that Captain Obvious should be in those commercials so what is the terpene profile wait for more national commercials yeah they're gonna be greater the Kentuckians that are in there um so the most prominent one is Chuck pinna lean turkey no lean sounds made-up to me because it just sounds like like the overall overarching turkey but it's actually a real terpene it's real fruity and it's you can find it in apples it's it kind of gives you like a fruity kind of aroma but then it's got some Mersin in it which is kind of your your staple cannabis terpene that's got like that kind of herbal you know cannabis flavor also found in mangos effect right right and then there's a sim us amine I've never heard of that one it's the first time I've said that word out loud I'm actually gonna make a blooper must try to pronounce all the turkey and I mean that's it and that's a minty it's got like a minty flavor and or minty scent and they use it a lot in perfumes I was not aware of that but yeah all that you know all of that just from one strain and the THC V that's in there mm-hmm time is a very center taste oh me too mr. tired this morning late last night very cut the end off was she saying it's 721 awesome what does that give us four minutes he hasn't been like that oh no I hate the morning we're happy to see you guys yeah I know what we could do honey oh yeah it's ready meant to show that honey cat from Florida - hey buddy today yeah I came to the Valentine's Day event and brought some honey for us speaking of focus right so this one is be fluid be fluid be fluid and be flu contains Kaminoans flavonoids and specific terpenes such as nursing trip in Turpan all turpan all oh no I'm Elaine pine bindi I don't know beta-carotene to deliver a powerful anti-inflammatory boost there's all-natural and tastes delicious and that's the beef fluid so this one helps you be fluid the root cause of pain inflammation is to be fluid that's a big bottle man yeah so white label it we've got a black there's a white label black nail all black label is extra strong no the bigger viral whoa that's a Black Label Black Label is way cooler and that one is um pumpkin Palmetto honey oh my goodness gracious yeah freaking Palmetto tastes like pumpkin I'm sure it does now is that like bees that pollinate both pumpkin and like how do that how does that work this has a thousand milligrams of CBD in it I don't know these pumpkins I have no idea what makes it pumpkin is it like pumpkin flavor in it or is it because I know that some beers are right it's like Palmetto honey is what oh yeah I mean like your teens there's something about it yeah and then honey itself I mean the reason that CBD is great in honey is that honey has got so many Bennett it's almost like cannabis it's almost like cannabis because there's all this stuff that it does that's great and people don't really understand why all the time like I used to eat honey when I was diving I'm so that's why and it didn't impact like my blood sugar but it's got a bunch of sugar in it but it doesn't spike your insulin right weird it's like my insulin oh why you know because I can feel it when I would take like post workouts I've had sugar in them enough I could feel it I could feel I can I could feel it like in my in my body cuz I wasn't any sugar at all anything like that at all so like this didn't impact like that and I was using it while I was cutting and I was still losing weight and they're like helps with allergies are so much better for you it's just you have to eat them earlier in the day or in the morning or you can eat nothing earlier in the day although I'm using it to sponsor I'm clean I feel like my arms getting bloated Archer you know like oh my god you could go on a diet I'm using testosterone cream because I'm having some changes did you rub it directly on your bicep and you watched your bicep grow inside and I swear getting like bloated I'm like oh my god I feel like good we're not selling I'm sweating so much it's not a bad idea I think I'm gonna lay off him for a little bit oh it really is so much more I don't you need a balance it out with the progesterone I didn't even know we had any I wasn't using it but it actually helps me and like not be so tired during the day you know but then we smoke weed and that's got all the phytoestrogens in it like Floyd I've actually heard that it's not great for testosterone production before but I chose not to believe that fake news that's that's that's America now we can just decide what we want to believe yeah it doesn't fit my narrative smoke weed so it must be us bastard that's it goose testosterone so I don't know about you I feel like it's 726 yeah thank you so much thank you the shark song will be live tomorrow we're gonna live from the events we see and we're gonna do Saturday and Sunday special editions - yeah well either big on the expo floor tomorrow all will be in my got they're interviewing people I want to talk to patients and why like me on the street how does cannabis alveoli all right we gots the rug all right guys hope to see you all out there", "FjFYnW8cFRg": "well it's the moment we've all been waiting for I know all you sure as hell have it's the smoke report for the Durbin poison oh yeah check this out whoo yeah so uh I expected we did phenomenally well with the harvest from the Derby boys and we got the first one dry here you know some boy shots here oh yeah super crystals yeah so this is the first sativa phenotype we're just about ready got some grinded up hair give her a taste test oh yes so in total I got 38 drawing grams of premium durbin poison now this is the slightly more sativa phenotype I recognize that both of the phenotypes you know were not purely to tea that I had you know there were basically hybrids but both leaning on the sativa side or so I've been led to believe by the dollars of the clones especially whatever canes to the high so right now joint roll up a joint and oh yes almost couldn't get that to turn I found so many dogs in there but yeah that's the crunchy Center we want so we're hoping now some really really nice fluffy boards and Barbara crying they're here and it's joint coconut is so far I have to say the smell is mmm interesting very sort of licorice with perhaps a little bit of pine in that delicious not really your average sort of smell but it's definitely different remarkably different from the Northern Lights over five phases and the indica females of the Indian phenotype of the turban actually has a really different odor but get that out in the next no report first of all all right I got this out of there yeah a thing to eat that's what we want to see I got your nice clothes and shot it out guys check this out that's what we want to see lovely big grinder fall hmm at some close-up shots here some nice juicy boards check this out so yeah she really came out nice and frosty in the end I produce pretty nice so like I said I got this jar here which I recommend is an excellent method of storing your boards for a long time simple effective and this was formerly a coffee jar no it's a board storage jar any type of killer type jar will work to make sure she's there to tie you down before you put your bullets in there mixing it thoroughly dry like I like to use keep it simple just a regular old brown paper bag once that's right give them a taste test VOC test pop them in the jar here and once a week I'd like to do is take the boards out put them on a dry flat piece paper like that for maybe 10-15 minutes let her marry Road pop back in the jar again do that maybe once a week for three four weeks and I was absolutely perfect earring cheering okay so back to a report all right died back in position here you know this as being a European we like to travel a little bit a tobacco in our joints it's just a daunting here especially if you've chrome up smoking pretty much exclusively hash which is quite common like how else you're gonna have got to stuff the burn well it's really just an overhang from those days what it's really just a tiny amount help everything burn true noisy ya don't belong fit in here mmm beautiful aroma we're gonna get enough liquor scent coming through now hmm delightful sound like I said it's like nova cigarette sprinkle have been on the top there you don't have to of course you can go for pure weed because she'll be relied nur maybe five six seven times up so for ease I'm just a more enjoyable smoke we travel a little bit in I like to use an ultrafine papers and when I can get my hands on extra long skins saves you having to have you know skin or build your joints there we go hmm also notice that I don't have the roach or filter and as they're all just personal practice I find it kind of difficult to do it but in there always have just a pain in the ass I like to pop it in after a little pokey here everything nice there you go voila one perfect spliff in 60 seconds or less as my filter crew does it may be again very effective so again this plant was also slashed to grow can't complain about the derby boys really really simplistic stuff to grow really talk to the scrub as you noticed you've seen my previous videos of the ultimate sativa scrub no height control issues like granted the Northern Lights number 5 haze myths were wild but the turbines in comparison were so much more easy control and filled up the screen nicely and delivers beautiful take the sides and evenings excellent just was like this consistent throughout now whatever further ideal you've gotta go in for another one mm there she is mmm that's amazing there's quite a noticeable lemony flavor actually coming true but that licorice mmm that's coming true in the flavour amazing oh yeah that's just great it just it's so worthwhile I can't recommend this enough to really take care of the floor share plants surely you've spent so many weeks and moments you know investing in your time your labor feeding pumping them full of nutrients be they organic or chemical the last thing you want to do is slack off at the end and just you know chocolate out without giving them a thorough flush you're really god it's absolutely would be necessary like even if you don't know many products isn't do it for a youth pure water for two weeks on a minimal leach out the soil turn hmm and you too can enjoy a flavor a really really tasty board oh this is just fantastic so it's two thumbs up from the top shelf grammar on this one absolutely amazing stuff really easy to smoke beautiful flavor coming true quite potent hmm notes to be more potent and I suppose than the auto strain there can smoke and mention my last video a kind of right never smoked myself so 25 grams got eaten up pretty damn quick I think I've only got like maybe a quarter or so left so harvest time came just in time for me this season guys so this is really just fantastic training to grow I tend to favor an organic method I like to grow my plants in a boy obeys light mix soil and see my new trick videos you can see all the products that I'd like to use there but basically I like to keep things as organic as I can and the only a man but maybe I'd make my soil is to buy a premium quality brand soil and maybe I'll add a cocoa break in there for some extra absorption of moisture and also I think it helps to drain it as well isn't yeah but also a little bit of pearl and there are some soils now comb-like like mix that I've mentioned has a really good balance of peat perlite in there already so it doesn't really meet need much thinking around you know it's each each to their own but definitely plan your grow out plan what nutrients you're gonna use on your soils and ideally look for quality genetics isn't the fire genetics if you don't start with the right seeds and the right plants or the right clones you can't get bullets like this so it's really important preparation preparation guys okay I think that the better does it I'll just give you guys a quick couple more posting shots here and then you can leave me a piece to enjoy my the fruits of my labor oh yeah nice chunky board out here just say it's fantastic really mature took my time on his minor Karen you could say nothing my blood delicious frosty milks

most of the birds are like this size but it is packed with try colors the bright orange hairs I'm in the bright orange pistols on it like these these little suckers are packed and I'm saying they are

max active THC 0.57 max active th CBD 14.7 for total active cannabinoids 0.38 was bringing you to a total of cannabinoids 17250 I'd be wondering how to hide a how to get these numbers because it's weird to me yeah it's very weird so THC a is at 0.65 been at the bottom it says max act of THC and 0.57 Matt CBD dismisses at the bottom it's a max EBP fourteen point seven four but look at the top is

have my medical card for about five years or so now I'm just going on going everything else off but um I just saw in the intro it was a real nice crystallized keep you looking but I don't want to handle it too much but you can kinda the light here is not real I don't think it's gonna give me a crystal-clear look but that's okay so let's go ahead this is a Durban poison it is a definitely a

even comes out a little liquorice he like smell it's very to the nose very pointy very good I mean though that smell goes right up in your nose and you can really feel it the resin it's very resonating in the nose I mean yeah the licorice really comes to get quite a licorice I know I always remembered urban being more of a licorice like smell that floral herbal herbal skunky yeah it's really good it smells good let's go ahead and pack some this and take some off this crunches real nice it's been nice and crunchy it's been cured for a little over a month now I'm straight-up just putting it out and I'm gonna grind it it's probably not the best way to do it but that's just how I'm doing it now so all right let's get the smokes like it's burning white somewhat a whole lot I flushed it maybe two or three weeks with water of pH water last two three weeks very floral on the out on that like when you're blowing it out on the draw it's very floral very peppery that pepper it's very peppery with a spicy pepper a floral you get more of the black anise the the licorice like smells in the nose kind of heating in the throat not burning just kind of like hot dry and the throat it's very key it's very nice that pretty pretty quick effect it happens fairly fast and what I feel this is a this is a sativa dominant strain in fact I believe it's just sativa period it's a pretty sure cuz Durban poison I want to say as a land restraint coming from South Africa believe so kind of interesting it's a if if grown right and I believe I've grown this correctly and let it you know let it go to its maximum on budding and there anyone on the hot before harvesting flowering stuff I had some nice big fat colas of it you know maybe inch-and-a-half why not - not too great but not too bad it was nice and full thick fat buds that weren't going anywhere you know they were [ __ ] there they were solid you can barely they're very dense and they're dense now you know it's I'm pressing hard and it's dense as hell it's crystallized it tastes delicious world don't shoot what man I really like what I get out of it the feeling I have is more of like oh it's more of daytime you know kind of a happy I need to sleep I probably shouldn't have done this strain but it does kind of give you creativity in the mind you know you want to sit down and like right now with my playing guitar or something it's late you know I figured I might even um edit a video or something you know it's it is pretty late tonight right now though but um it's making me all Chinese eyes you know I definitely I mean I might have Chinese eyes all the times but but really from the smoking it's really doing it um real dry eyes a bit of a cottonmouth going on though nice feeling overall it tastes really nice honestly I'm not like saying he hated me but I think I could have trimmed this better I'll knock myself for that I think it could have been a little more white in the burn it's a little dark talking flushing and stuff like that and I grew it overall but a though the butt itself the strain is awesome overall out of five of five five five bud I would I would give this four buds for four point two five buds [Music] [Applause] that was fun right on well you guys have a good night if you have had this dream before let me know what you think if there's a string that you'd like me to

in Effingham and only the rise we probably won't go back to collinsville they did have they did have this it's the Durbin poison you can see it's a sativa and got some pretty good numbers and was very I'm very curious because they said that it smells like lemons I'm curious to see if that's actually true but give me just second I'll get her open as you can see it's all still absolutely closed and perfect give me just a second all right we've got her open and their show wow that looks really pretty that looks like Christmas tree nuggets let's see what that looks like outside here oh really dense so we think that looks good I can smell the lemon in the citrus but this was on the that's right here was on the bottle the inside but that was pretty cool pretty crazy this first time I've seen anything like that but got a really good smell smell the citrus I can't wait to taste it but this is Cresco labs i think let's go yeah Crisco and a neat little jar but I think I need to do something else with their jars I smell something that shouldn't actually be there and I don't know if it's the sativa I don't know if it's them putting it in these jars and the jars having a smell and then it getting on the weed but only time will tell as always I can subscribe I'm EQ same Brad time same Brad Channel later y'all", "njHPyPJM3Vs": "we like the packaging here pop it out [Music] and that's your true pod right there as you can see it's 93.6% total cannabinoids and you just take this true pod right here and pop it in your true stick just like that the true stick by true leave is a vaporization device and it uses the true pod which is a magnetic cartridge that pops right in and to turn it on you hit this black button five times and then to get a dose you press the black button again and hold it for three seconds while inhaling smooth and consistent true sticks the best product on the market you can hit it for three seconds and get a normal dose or as long as you want I

I will be reviewing this wonderful Durbin poison this is the last of it the last of the last of the last this is the last that I had from Tacoma wellness this stuff is sitting at about 26% so I'm really excited to try this so this is a hand rolled I rolled this those of you that know me know my arthritis is horrible and makes it so I have great difficulty doing this so what I've been using is strain-specific RSO and that has done wonders for my arthritis so I was able to hand roll again hand roll a perfect cone blunt cannabis has really done wonders for me but I'll also say is that those of you I think that I am just some you know stone half-dead party Punk not the case I take care of my body in many ways one of them being I have IBS subsequent to my PTSD so what does that mean that means at any time I eat anything I bloat like a whale anytime I'm stressed my face puffs up my stomach puffs up i bloat and I canti because basically what I what I say I'm full on stress so what have I been doing as of late so as of late I've been drinking this got your attention now right so these are chia seeds that I have puffed with some hot water and then I stir them until I make sure that the consistency as you can see is not clumping it's almost like a syrupy consistency right and I stir the heck out of that until it cools down just a little bit so it needs to be warm to drink and then I drink this every morning I've been doing this for about a week now I do this because again I have really bad IBS and PTSD bloat that I get in my stomach to where I can't eat meals at a time sometimes a couple days at a time so I drink to you seeds believe me it works my little buddy trying to protect me as I said Aaron's mower so I'm gonna talk about day absolutely nothing I slept all right hello thank you handsome I appreciate the protection I don't need it though this fool anyway having that said that's sparking lovely already I probably won't even need a smoking old thing I'll probably smoke a third of this and be good Durbin poison so Durbin poison is an excellent strain for me it's one of my top five not because it gets me suited because it gets me moving excuse me those of us that have dealt with serious injuries shouldn't say serious I'm still gonna stand those of us that have dealt with injuries to our back are spying our musculoskeletal system our knees or ankles deal with arthritis deal with dealing with the chronic pain I've found this is like instant [ __ ] it all it allows me to realize okay I have [ __ ] that I need to get done I realize that I'm in pain or I might be this is going to help alleviate some of that so that I can be productive so this is my get [ __ ] done strength day yesterday we got a chance to venture outside of DC for an afternoon and an evening and I got to go see Amish country I grew up near Amish country so it wasn't much of a feat for me but it was pretty fun for my wife for her sister so for my sister-in-law and my niece and nephew so we got to enjoy that and then we got the drive home last night and come back to DC where I can medicate but what I've noticed is the entourage effect more so as of late since I've switched to the strain-specific RSO and what I mean by that as I'm using RSO that is strain specific I'm gonna go ahead and say that again so I'm getting like Girl Scout cookie ara so I'm getting well they're not calling it that because it can't be burner you know it's not not proprietary or whatever so what form cut cookies or whatever they call it Mara so I'm getting I'm trying to find some like really really heavy indica RSO now I'm working on trying to find one that I can blend into my own edibles for me at night so I'm still searching anybody have any insight I'd be really happy to you were yet to say but you know I don't have much else to do I got to talk to a couple professors today to make sure that they've gotten the information from my DRC to know that I in fact do you have disabilities I'm not making this [ __ ] up and I need concessions made so that I can get my schoolwork done other than that I'm gonna making my chia seeds yeah skis I'm tricking my chia seeds and just

foot apart been using for the dirt it's just coco loco from fox farm and then five five five dry mills for fox farm and then 493 from loom all organic dry amendments and she's loving it first time ever using it it's pretty good product to use i ain't got no complaints about it as you can see the girls look at the two big girls right here in the front the little ones they're all five gallon pots but these two girls in the back just did not grow it all because of these two right here they completely took over and that right there is just one big branch all the way down i did super crop some down there got multiple branches she's loving how they are can't be sitting as beautiful as this that's the first time ever using a scrog i use it as lsd and use some metal stakes in the ground in the soil but it's all grown underneath the sp 250 from myers hydro but mine could update it live but it's gonna work for my budget i have no complaints there are better lights out there but i enjoy her and it isn't a 2x410 it's not very good lighting in here and this phone ain't that great for videos but we do our best one day i will get a better camera but yeah well they popped them all and those are all netflix from the organic soil that i got that's a pain yes to keep up with trying to follows i got them up everywhere i'm on the exhaust bed got him on the back wall back there like the first week of flower i put him in decided one day i opened it and there's thousands of netflix everywhere i had these sticky traps around some use those they work great still fighting them off but that's the only problem i got right now i can't complain i'll keep you all updated let you know how it's going just to see next time when i do start flowering i'm just gonna use some three five gallon pots instead of four because four is a little too big for this for this tent three would be perfect all right guys i'll be seeing y'all next week enjoy have a great weekend you", "VzlGjH19W4g": "well having a lot of up and downs with us organic dry amendments most most the problem is because net flies i put nematodes in the dirt still didn't help about a week or two and that was about it but i still got about a mother another month before these are ready but we'll let them try as you can tell the nitrogen is coming out of these but they're completely getting burned up and that's not from the light or anything it's just they're completely yellow and dying out like these so i don't know if it's the fox farm drive minutes i'm using them i have to try something else go back to my synthetics my bottom nutrients what i'm used to but we're going to keep going organic until the very end of this grow at least try it out but i think it has to do with mostly because the nets flies in here but keep her going let's see what she does out there but there you go wrong buds you know they're getting big going around here and just cut the tops of these off because i've seen some people try and they said they make the buds fatter i really doubt they do we're going to try them out just for experiment to see but like the bottom half it's green and luscious just going through there looking just not the top half and i've been using a straw net but i don't know if i'm a big fan of these grog nets i don't like that i can't move my buckets around before i can water them they're completely staying still not a big fan of this i'm just going to go ahead and and use some bamboo sticks and some tie downs like i used to [Music] until i get everything down but next season for series what i'll call it will be making seeds trying to give it a good try see if i can do it or not [Applause] and i've been using recharge every once a week just to try that i think that's what's keeping these girls alive oh well [Applause] a lot of microbes but we'll see how she does i think i got about four weeks i think i've already said that but until she's ready maybe i think it's week six flower yep this today starts week six flowers pretty sure but super skunk and durban poison from what's on the bag says eight to nine weeks and a good time people are saying if you have a infestation somewhere give another week to her so give her a month four more weeks it won't kill it but i'll keep checking the trichomes they're still pretty clear even though these buds look like they're getting done triathlon is still clear on air all right guys i'll keep you updated you'll have a good week if you have any suggestions let me know take them off there ain't no wrong answer for me all right guys have a good one", "L9_-cTISkxw": "yeah hi guys you go again and start a week name they decided I'm going extra week and the Durbin poison which is here that is a Standish orange orange trichomes and not too many at the moment but like to see that done of where it's going to be like you know by Friday but then like 20 percent I think is okay so that's that's what's going on the and on the other side the peyote cookies that's that's not showing any orange at all really but they are very young cloudy tray corns here they are very very very is very frosty very cloudy trichomes there yeah they're looking really nice really really lovely would recommend the pody cookies II seem to have a lot of trichomes a lot most of ever out I think but yeah something light of the lights been hanging 40 said yeah go to meet a tent to me the hi tent and it's been hanging 40 centimeters from the top since the start source it says it says a lot about the the cree cob 35 nineties they are [ __ ] there's an excellent light it's on yeah and be opus I used be a prison and molasses molasses once a week I used about 20 milliliters in 10 liters of water once a week and I used bo-buddies bloom Bo peas grow and the but in the bureau biz but in solution horse as well so yeah that's where I used I did put a little bit of epson salts in to notice there was a bit of a magnesium deficiency even though I was using cal-mag so I tell no I know I just always seem to note some magnesium deficiency I don't know why it was ordinary tap water and it just doesn't seem to have enough magnesium in it or enough calcium very nice and there I think no this would be the last time you see them they'll be coming down on Friday and I'm taking it all down on Friday the the peyote cookies would have had enough to play then as well I keep well I'll check them and on Friday but the Durbin poison would definitely be coming down on Friday and that would be the end of this growth and then sadly new one just after that I think and go on a game for a while at I saw some yeah anyway guys thanks for watching and thanks for the lokes and the in the comments and I'll see you next time bye",

there now it's the tree Northern Lights number five haze mists it's gonna be the next harvest videos taken another juicy no okay this is just amazing stuff this one I think is actually a fair bit more rasmus than the previous turbine poisons you'll notice this phenotype is just fantastic again chairs the very noticeable red hairs they both seem to have in common but yeah and we're looking forward to in the smoke reports and doing a head-to-head comparison on both of these phenotypes yeah these plants are actually an absolute pleasure to grow the Durban poison they were pretty easy to maintain quite heavy feeding on the nutrients absolutely love this stuff and I gave him a good flush for two weeks again this was left in for the full 70 days so what we're gonna do now it's not see manicured

Sun go down you just wanted to buy about which out a little bit it's gonna be a different video compared to the other ones the other ones that usually vape cartridges or whatever tonight we got a [ __ ] pre-roll right but [ __ ] the pre-roll first things first if you're not 18 and older you can get the [ __ ] off this page right this video is for patients 18 and older who enjoy the use of cannabis right so yeah man make sure to LIKE follow subscribe to everything the snapchat the YouTube make sure to sub man I need them like something even if subs up 80 percent of the viewers any sub man come on bro I love y'all man hook it up man just hook it up yo I had a shitty Friday two subs would make me happy I'm not even going from sweet subs and I'd be like hi my day was cool but but anyway man I understand at the end of the week you know we feel drained you know we just want to smoke inside [ __ ] so I figured what better way to safe with the homies and with the subs and have a nice little pre-roll sesh man and why I'm gonna get into why this was so important to get I don't want to say employee but why I felt like I needed to get this right so you know a couple of the subs a couple of the homies that were like yo let's get a video of you smoking some herb instead of smoking depends which I understand because a lot of the homies they either you know the end a lot of the homies of the subs are even in different states that they just can't sash or whatever so that's what I'm here for you know I mean that's what I'm here for the vibes bro always I'm always for the good vibes and the cool like soul music are soul R&B around all of that I mean because at the end of the day bro like I said it's Friday we Melo went down we're getting ready for the weekend we smoking me chilling and sometimes we need that person to Bob but sometimes that person ain't there that's why I'm here man so I appreciate olya right so without further ado let me get into why I chose this strain and where I got it from and all of that so this is Durbin poison by bro it don't say but I know it's gotta be Durbin poison the labs is there is real so definitely a real product 19 point 43 percent THC 0% CBD and yeah this is from Lake Colt I got this from Lake Hulk in downtown LA which is conveniently right next to the Staples Center so I went there the other night to go copy a superb cartridge because they're one of very few dispensaries that actually carry the product and me and my uncle right since we was kids we used to love like smoke movies smoker movie stoner movies the weed movies just that weed humor and one of those movies that we watched was the watch and there's a scene where Chong pulls up in like a little scooter right and he said he was driving the [ __ ] all the way from Humboldt County and he has some Buddha that he wanted to sell the snow and he pulls out this week this kind of weed this kind of weed but out of his shirt pocket he pulls out a little nub of Durbin poison he's like yo I've been driving since Humboldt County off of this you describe this from Africa it's this it's that so me and my uncle my G my uncle's like three years older than me and him would just be like yo we got a smoke that [ __ ] one day mind you we're in New York and we just started smoking me I don't even know if he was smoking at that point so it was just a mission to get this although I did see a all the eights of this they were just too pricey for me at the time they were like $60 from up north up north the brand is up north I'm not sure of my flower up north flat I don't know what it was but I don't know too many brands that actually have Durbin poison so you know I saw it and I was like you know what this is the closest thing I'm probably gonna get to actually have him like Durbin poison so let me just cuz it's also what I mean by that is that you can't find this anywhere like it's you know Durbin poison something that's like it's a unique strand it's almost like a blue cheese the blue cheese in the constraint like there's some strands that you just cannot find for whatever reason so I was very excited to see this I was very excited to smoke it like I felt like I would when I was looking at this I was like bro I'm getting high just looking at this so I had to copy it it's only a point 7 gram so it's not even a full gram but it's cool I don't need a full gram I'm a smoker I'm gonna try to smoke all of this which out at night so let's crack this [ __ ] open I already took off the plastic and because I had to when I copped it I had to give it a the dry taste and all that so boom urban poison 0.7 got a shit-kicking Wow I can't supremo's we can't really tell nice little point 7 and the brand a knobhead just says premium infuse cannabis sativa blend that's it and the manufacturing date it doesn't have a brand on it nothing it just has that so yeah I know the brand let me know put it down in the comments so yeah before I spark this up man shoutout to y'all shoutout to the homies I've been kickin this out it's homies I've been smoking with which a homie which a boy and all of that I appreciate it bro yeah I mean I'm away for you how to get you a little smoking 10 Susan apparatus his way to God done rolling up so you can smoke this with me yeah man today was rough I'm not even gonna front like I'm tired as [ __ ] I'm not even done working like after this I gotta go paint a bathroom ride don't stop me and grind don't stop hi man like I said this video is for patients 18 although he'll enjoy the use of cannabis this is Durbin poison from an unknown brand I have no idea but I got it from litko salut kids damn that [ __ ] tastes good I don't get nothing crazy from it like I don't get like then again I didn't set in but I'm talking about as far as taste it don't taste any different from like a haze or you know it doesn't taste like Jack I don't have that that part that that's that spicy peppery sativa feel to it don't have the smoke good though this is Kate this muhfucka chicken right now and one thing I've always learned roads if the ash and white it ain't right get the resin on it smoking on that [ __ ] like that man put a puff of give on that $10 but it wasn't bad for 0.78 Durbin which you can never find is I it's a vibe though I'll tell you what some free roses don't come out smoking good though remember I spent like $25 on a pre-roll banana cruffin by Kenneth E Kenneth tech Kenneth one of those higher brand top-shelf we brains and they got spent like $25 I had the caning cold blast hit all that had the

some vape pen products woohoo hey pen I've got these great products right here 1:1 ratio THC CBD I've got Durbin poison no that's the gelato so there we go again I've got gelato and I've got Durbin poison Durbin poison is the sativa the gelato is the indica I have what do I have in here oh oh do I really oh okay well I guess I've got the gelato I've got the indica in here right now I'm surprised I thought I had the sativa see what happens and you don't pay attention anyway excuse me on piece canyon a month anyway so a little while ago I did a review on a vape n CBD cartridge and I was not happy with it at all and not only was I only happy that the CBD vape pen didn't work for me I really was hoping for that to not have the THC and to just use something that would help alleviate my pain but apparently I'm one of those people that I do need the THC in the vape pen along with the CBD which I've discovered from these I got these on 4/20 and this is what I purchased they had a buy one get one so I thought I might as well take advantage of it and it's this one to one ratio I was really hoping for because again I want I want that pain killing effects from the CBD so anyway again going back to what I was saying I'm so distracted there's people playing acai and I keep looking at them so I should probably stop doing that okay they all have no distraction um okay so I was really looking forward to doing another review of a product cuz they pen was kind enough to give me this battery when I saw them when they were doing some biomass their stuff they were there at the Phoenix dispensary and I mentioned I was looking for some CVD babes and they gave me the battery and so I came back gonna try that product and it was really kind of crappy that I didn't like it it was like oh thanks for the gift oh yes garbage I don't like it so I'm happy to review something of the vape pen for the vape pen battery that I actually do enjoy and both of these are great for different reasons of course I use the gelato in the evening time I'm pretty active person mentally very active and I have a hard time shutting down at night and sometimes again there's children in the home here and sometimes I don't want to go outside and smoke and when I'm really having a hard time sleeping if I'm not using and edible I definitely need to smoke it in to kind of go to bed so these are really convenient I really like using them before I go to the gym especially the sativa this Durban poison was great at the gym because I never felt that the yucky illness you know how you get a little heavy sometimes when you smoke this did not do that at all I was able to make it through my workouts even through yoga and then just some weight training and I had no problems at all so really convenient the smoke is nice I will say though the the gelato the indica is a lot smoother than the Durban poison the Durban there's a bag stuck to a tree and I thought it was a squirrel okay see how easily distracted I haven't hold on a minute I need to bring myself back to what I'm doing hold on get some of this indica gone okay the bag blew away that's good I love blowing smoke at you I just want to say no it would be cool if you sent me videos of you receiving this that would be great anyway okay so even though baby lungs do-do-do-do-do so even though excuse me while I wipe away my cry baby tears okay so even though gelato is smoother again it's a vape pen they do kind of cause me to cough it's a lot smoother than some that I've tried I have had some some big products but I've tried of other people's know something I'm gonna try that and see if I like it they made me cough a lot more so this is definitely smoother maybe it's the battery maybe it's the way it burns it I am looking to try some other one that you can set the temperature and because this one does get hot and I'm wondering if maybe one my oil my my cartridge will last longer if it doesn't burn so hot but also maybe I won't get that burning sensation that I get in the back of my throat mainly from the Durbin poison a little bit here umm so keep that in mind when you're getting them certain ones do burn a little hotter than others I'm noticing so some you might have a little more discomfort and I think it also depends on the way you hit it if you hit it really hard it's been gonna burn a little hotter maybe it's cuz I'm searching sit up straight sit up straight head up and beat into work I know I'm not even funny I'm just gonna smoke this okay see today's a day that I need the in the cup when that stuff to do that requires me sitting down which is pretty much what I've been doing the last few days and it helps curb the I need to get up and do something else thing so big help for those kinds of situations again these were I believe 300 milligrams I'll correct that on there if I'm wrong I don't believe I am though whereas a 500-mile against Amador I knew this before I started anyone it was $30 for one of these 0.5 grams anyway $38 I got a buy one get one free so you know what is that $19 I guess piece and in that sense from the Phoenix dispensary I'm just gonna end up cutting all this stuff out because I'm [ __ ] all right so so these cost me $20 so these cost 38 dollars each except there was a buy one get one so you know game II and the DL they lasted a while I mean you could see how much I have left and I've been smoking on this all week I've been trading off with the sativa but the Durban poison and that's how much of that I have left um so it's been again since since April 20th so since 4/20 I've been smoking on these and I have flowers so I've been smoking my flower to again I'm not real thrilled with how long these cartridges last for as expensive as they are but they are convenient and so I guess you are paying for convenience again if I found the battery that maybe control the temperature there by controlling how much of the oil I was using per puff maybe it would help better I don't know maybe you guys know again you know this is not one-sided I'd love to hear some info from you maybe you've had different experiences or you know certain tricks of using these things that I don't know because I really don't I'm really new to vaping if you have favourites let me know so also if you like my videos hit subscribe this is a rambling one I hope I'm able to edit this together to make it somewhat entertaining because I really like this so that's that's how I'm gonna summarize I really like this of a pen cartridge I really appreciate both of these for different reasons so gelato the turbine the gelato and the Durbin poison they both work different different times a day it's like oh this is the morning and this is the night time if you can do a buy one get one I definitely suggest it as the way to go for trying them out because you can try different products I can't wait to try other ones not just buy a pen but definitely I want to try the other ones like a pen yeah like my videos subscribe say hi talk to me every now and then I'm so long", "sMRRNMiayPE": "good afternoon folks Michael Canaday akh alador here and I am pretty excited about what I found at the dispensary today that is a select elite Durbin poison and it as you can see there has ninety three point seven percent THC which is the highest cannabinoid percentage I've ever seen in a cartridge and yeah I just wanted to get documentation of this little experience here I'm about loaded up my my battery with with this new cartridge and see what 93.7% THC does to my brain this ought to be interesting well I am loading the cartridge up here excuse the wobbly video I'm trying to film while screwing this cartridge cap on here have a look at the new office I haven't really shared that with YouTube yet but I'm kind of kind of proud of it I've been working on it a while it's still work in progress you I got my got my dogs playing poker tapestry and you know some other [ __ ] but uh yeah at my workstation you know my rigs my dope ass paint job it's good for tripping out while I'm well I'm doing my thing in here okay we are ready to try all right tastes damn good definitely

cartridge this is supposed to make me feel energetic and focused so that's good cuz I got [ __ ] to do you know yeah it's a sativa which you know at this that this percentage of THC at 93.7% THC it doesn't matter if it's a sativa or indica or what the [ __ ] it is that's just that's just [ __ ] amazing it's really good and I'm not coughing a lot and I've noticed because it's so pure I think the more pure you get the less harsh it is on your lungs and the less coughing you do so yeah ok folks will we're coming up on 5 minutes for a [ __ ] select elite cartridge review video and that's yeah that's getting a little long so I'm gonna play some [ __ ] video games and maybe you drink me something and yeah I highly highly is the keyword here highly recommend picking up select elite durbin

would take of cannabis on a regular basis for PTSD arthritis and both my knees and ankles social anxiety and a few other conditions you can learn more about through watching the previous shows on this channel this is the productive cannabis connoisseur a channel dedicated to medical cannabis patients and adults 18 and over so today what I want to talk to you guys about is a strain called dirt and poison I looked up the review of it on wiki leaf which I really have been enjoying that site so you can check out what the leaf and see it for yourself and all the other reviews that they have on there so yeah we're gonna be smoking on dirt my poison and before I get into reading the review I'm gonna load up a ball with this like Spacey looking glass bowl I have that really like it's really nice after I do the review read you the review for luckily what I do if you do is just in general is I'll give you my opinion on what I think the strain does for me personally so which I feel like sometimes it can be a ninja individual thing you know the strain that that you prefer you know I almost lost for words there Cheers oh I didn't even show you the German poison hold on that's not fair so yeah it's different poison right here beautiful dirty poison mmm this smells good too it's got a sweet smell let's try that again all right it goes Cheers I'm not sure how far I'll get on this review so it might be a two-part video show so okay feel free to stay tuned for the second part if it runs out it runs out so dirty poison is 100 percent sativa Durbin poison as a pure sativa grown in the South African port city of Durban it has a sweet earthy taste to it with a piney almost grapefruit aftertaste upon exhalation this taste carries over to its smell as a strain as achieved worldwide fanfare for a sweet odour truly a pleasurable aroma Durban poison buds are rounded and chunky and feature a thick trichome coating that covers the majority of the plant many people hold urban poison as a personal favorite both to spark creativity and to help them stay productive throughout the day the strain is associated with a general earning energy boost mental productivity and increased social ability some even consider it the espresso of strains due to the clear-headed and invigorating high it provides Derman poison is effective in treating anxiety disorders such as a DD and ADHD bipolar disorder it may even prove beneficial to sufferers of post-traumatic stress disorder also known as PTSD many folks also swear by German poison in the treatment of migraine headaches during poison is quite the enduring strain as it has a long and storied history its origins date way back to the late 1970s in South Africa an ambitious young man named edy Rosenthal was seeking a new strain upon securing a variety of seeds he returned home to America and began honing in on inbreeding the lines which possessed his favorite growing characteristics add later past the Durban line to one male frank to further solidify the strain Mel's main goal was to grow play that yielded the highest resonance content with the quickest growth time mel had taken ed strain and after several generations now possess what he called his a and B strains with mel preferring the a strain mel frank passed on his beeline to sam the skunk man from amsterdam sam took seeds of the beeline back to amsterdam with the goal of again reducing the flowering time the goal was to get high-quality strain that could finish outdoors in the rather short time of the Dutch summer this is not to discredit the strands versatility derman poison can be grown both outside and hot weather conditions or inside under grow lights and yield good results in each scenario although it is favorable to grow them outdoors as a ceiling height can limit the planets potential some different poison plants grow up to twelve feet tall these needless to say the plant still remains a global favorite to this day with over decades of history and favourable reviews it is even one of the main building blocks of the modern cannabis DNA pool it is a strain that has been mixed with nearly everything and is likely a part of the lineage of some of your favorite strains I guess I've read all the way through so yeah that's Durban poison for you THC content the highest can go to 25.5% average will average would be sixteen point three percent as far as THC content goes for German poison so the medicinal uses that suggest for a depression and the effects are energetic okay so I'm going to tell you what I think about that review I think that reviews are awesome it's very in-depth and detailed it tells you the history behind urban poison it tells you accurate characteristics of it because if you look at this indeed the buds are around it like they say it is rounded buds like they say and it does have that earthy taste to it that I really like about a lot strains does I have a sweet taste to it I agree with that I do agree with the fact that it is very energetic strand it's a hundred percent sativa so just let me know if you're not really a fan of sativa then maybe only have a tiny bit I mean a fan of the the effects of sativa like if you don't want to feel like you've drank an espresso like they said then have only a little bit or you can mix it with the indica and that's what I like to do with a lot of strains sometimes like with a sativa I'll put a little bit indica in there and then it may balance it a bit yeah so it's definitely I could see how we'd be good for a DD and ADHD because it definitely gives you that focus I'm not saying that I have either of those conditions which I don't I have dyslexia so that as far as concentration and being focused I feel like it's helping with that a lot and there's not a lot of research out there that I've seen about cannabis and dyslexia so I'll probably do another show about that soon I've done I think a couple of shows talking about that so yeah so

want to rate it and I got my hands on some of these tasty tasty Royals by Wamba doodle extract here we go daddy I'm gonna do them one at a time this so you'll see you'll see the three flavors listed myzel toe Durbin poison king cake and white widow I personally chose those I won two of them in a in a contest from wampa doodle Thank You wampa doodle oh yeah and then I I bought one because I uh you know good you know you you want to you want to repay good luck with good grace it uh it keeps good karma so I uh I got those ones and we're about to try wampa doodles Durbin poison Durbin poison is a sativa this is the cart I was got excited I took the cartridge out I'm so sorry but I had to just see it before I put the camera on I hope you forgive me here is what they look like whole this is the the king cake isn't that's just that's just beautiful and it's got some of the stats behind it right there that looks really good right there womp a doodle people use just fine and this is the 1i we're trying right now Durbin poison and the cartridge is very similar to the to the Jazz cabbage cartridge it's got the three little air breathing holes there for you looks very very similar I would be surprised if it was just wasn't the same cartridge so that tells me one big thing about wampa doodle and that is uh that they're gonna go for for the extra they're gonna go with with the class because uh this is a steel glass cartridge container and you know these are top of the lines so that that already gives me a vote of confidence even before trying the oil so but you know you never know until you know so we're gonna give her a try right now here we go number this is Durbin poison it is now they're oils are triple distilled they're a dis elite triple distilled icily they reintroduce the terpenes from that batch so you're gonna have the flavor from the terpenes of the buds and on top of that you're gonna have the power and potency of the distillate which is you I mean you're cooking with like 90 percent it up as far as I concentrate so that is super badass so let's try this Durbin poison let's see what it's rockin with tonight mmm I'm tell you I'm excited whoo Wow ooh man has that earthy flavor that you that's a very Durban poison he Durban point is very like oh it's almost decently there's like that diesel Chron so like it's got that earthy diesel II flavor man big time like right in there man it's like I put my whole mouth into the buds that's really good the high is settling in really really good idea as you can see I didn't even take the biggest sake because I I know these cartridges man and you can [ __ ] yourself up taking like I'll try to press the video take the baby's head no so that was pretty good man that was good let's try it again let's get one more good hit for the video and then I'm gonna raid and I do have my set odd 3.7 which is very conservative again you can really taste like that that discipline oil taste is in the back of my throat like I know that'll taste cuz Pat pen makes the oil that's pure distillate and I know that like there's there's that just to the flavor in the back of my throat it's kind of like that like base oil wax enos not waxy right but like that really like oily oiliness flavor that's in the back of your throat but then you have like that earthy decently like gasps like like that decently flavor from the terpenes so that's really really really good and then the high like is very like it's it's very it's great it's got that good sativa burst as you can see I'm getting very chatty so that's really awesome I would give it from a flavor standpoint I would give it a nine 9.20 we have a nine point two maybe even a knife point you know I always feel so weird about writing it right on the point because I sometimes you need to think about it but I would say saying nine point nine point three one say nine points and I'm very conservative in these ratings because I always leave room for you know something new so nine point three on flavor which might be the highest rating I've given out except for at and then uh as far as potency I would give it like a nine point four so we're rocking we're looking at a nine point four nine point of a nine point three point five I mean just a great oil this particular flavor very very good I and that's probably more of a taste thing because I you know I appreciate like that decently earthy flavor but it's not necessarily my favorite like my favorite flavor would be something more I would say like something more like like fruity would be more of my like my jam like maybe like a lemon like a lemon cush or like like a strawberry cough I kind of like that flavor but so like a lot of this is subjective but so but that's but a great oil great potency great flavor I'm gonna say it again wampa doodle extracts cartridges they're getting hot people are noticing them I got my hands on some you're gonna want to get your hands on some to go and get your hands on some why aren't you doing it right now the [ __ ] great talk to you later", "tk9x-A84blA": "hey YouTube another quick update week 5 Durbin poison how nice they filled out put him in

seeds it is at eight and a half weeks and I'll be going through all the way through the tenth week with nutrients so we've got about two weeks left of nutrients and then we're gonna hit it with the flawless finish for about a week or two weeks and give it a really nice flush Durbin poison strain is 100% sativa and it originally rains from South Africa and it it has trouble growing in some colder states but when you're in there go indoor growing you can definitely control the climate to benefit you and one thing I've been starting to do is just look where the climates that my strains come from and I tried my best to match it anyways for this strain here I'm gonna give it a 5 out of 5 star rating I'm hoping for about a half pound yield off this baby and this is Boca ponics and I will say that the more bubbles you have the better your plants gonna grow and the faster it's going to grow bigger buds you're gonna be and that's a lot to say about that so don't skimp on your your bubble disks and if you can get a nice industrial bubbler pump should help you out quite a bit alright that's about it for my update on the Durbin poison auto and I hope that you guys have a good day and

edibles these are the blowout special of nine dollars but with our medical discount comes to 831 so with those two items our total came to 35 10 so just for a quick reference on the gummies I've been eating these gummies about one at least every one every afternoon afternoon maybe two a day and I haven't had a seizure in four days just saying okay but on Durbin poison there's a is a strain that I always get but I just wanted to show you this one oh here's the particulars on it so the CBD nice and high THC as high as normal but this is all another one that I'm also not gonna try to pronounce it but it's a 18% in this batch this one is also high at 3.5 and of course the one that's in most most rings that's a 2.2 so it was very high in the terpenes really good in this terpene itself is one that they say it was really good for the seizures and all neurological problems neurological pain so imagine that may be another reason helping bring back my seizures saw back to the 1/8 so I have it in this reef - container has a rubber coating just an old ball metal container play ball came gentle thing as you can see here I put the label from the other bottle one a-two Durbin poisons it's a Street sativa so and open this bad boy up of course I got my little moisturizers in here but I just wanted to show you this one because this one ain't is actually just one bud so it is there and we'll just slide around here may even get some better views of it overdo it so let's put that light back there with the camera around so you can get some better pictures this way yeah so they're from poison I wish I could smell this other way so really actually describe the smell is actually smells a little like cow poop but with in a flowered field so if that makes sense because it's still got a real floral fruity smell but very very earthy that's I guess what it what I would describe the child food smell from so so here we go and then so let me put the little lens on here and get a close-up and we'll take a look at it that way so here we go now let's move it up here I'll move the tip up in there first you can see it's actually kind of dark in some spots so some I've had has actually been almost purple so dark so yeah you can almost kind of see that one there almost looks black but uh I can't get the camera in there close there but yeah then there's the orange hairs if you look there it also has these on top of that purples it has like a green hair sometime never really seen another buds but yeah it's kind of a good example there well if you can see there's orange on and then there's a group like a yellowish green one next to it so kind of strange but okay let's put it by the stem here I don't see it take a look at the stem cuz they can get a good fry look at the frosty

seeds urban poison is a attempt we made in the last few years to beef up the famous durban poison which has always been famous for its high flavor yet to manas modern standards it's a th concert HD content is a little bit low we've we've crossed it with our northern lights to beef up its structure and THC content which it's done and still maintains we've selected plants that maintain the durban flavor and high still has that almost juniper flavor to it series", "Pmsbco0V69o": "hey guys NMC here another update forgive me but that right there that's just my fan going on these right here I'll start with these right here first and foremost man shout out to the people in Texas you know I'm saying that's going through that flood you know I mean and all the family a Dick Gregory and I mean a brother passed away last week and stuff you know what I mean very good brother man if you have any time you know I'm saying go check him out Dick Gregory real intelligent brother but um get back to this right here this right here is the um this was the the clones from a boy Tron this was the top of his plant and this one a shot off crazy this is two weeks from room and along with these right here the same thing but then shoot off that quick I'm saying but these all the strawberry crushes here from a boy Tron Tron good looks on that appreciate that brother and these guys right here are the Durban poisons a gets done it these are the Durban poisons today I will be opening all of them out like opening this out here open them all out so this where they can Bush out especially these guys right here cuz these like these look like the indica more indica some Bush diesel out these little guys I'm let them grow for a little while this one right here I had got some seeds from forgot his name but I appreciate it and I put eight of them down six of them popped this is the only one that survived and really came through so I believe this is the auto the Auto app or the minigun I'm not sure once you grow up on the hidden like L do you know this one is you know but yeah I think that's one cuz all the seeds got mixed up that he sent me so I'm not sure what's what but yeah um basically I wanna give you guys a video shot up this right here these two a five weeks old these two right here five weeks from seeded urban poisons I didn't record last week I'd take my son back to college and on yeah so basically I couldn't record last week and these right here are from we could say two weeks right now because when I first took him off right I cloned him a week later they had root the big one had room the top had roots these little ones that had no roots at all they didn't get roots for like another week and a half after that so that's why I say like I'll just say like two weeks these are from clone two weeks all of them right there and then we got these two right here and then we got that one right there and then I got somewhat alive germinating right now I think I got some mom I think I got some to her bin what is it no blue dream g13 I think I got some seeds germinating right now yeah so yo she's your boy mitt mmz grow listen you know I'm saying on [ __ ] no and listen you some comments man let me know what's up if you see something I'm doing wrong let me know please um yes you guys got some beans out there that you know you want beta tested trust and believe I'm down for it I mean but chairman LMC grow shibori look at the MMD shot", "bFmCP57FTxU": "so back to the gotalk wit sativa bye stay medicated this is a good one that learned from right ear man I usually only grow strains dominant and in the cuffs when I got this plant to a larger size I figured out it is a very sativa which I have no practice with I'm currently looking for some advice because this plant is in weak set or seven weeks in the flower according to the research I've done I know they can grow well sort of 12 weeks the pH is right Neutrik nutrients are measured lights are 3,500 K I want to know if the buds look normal or is this plant essentially a waste of time that plant looks weirdly in looks like a haze almost oh yeah it does but if the leaves don't look so good guys we're looking at a plant with real thin family who's coming out of a real wispy bud in general for seven weeks in the flower yeah and that's a big plant but I mean you're definitely a I don't know I get respect for you looking at your setup as far as your grow man it looks like you did spend a lot of time on that thing to get very little out of it unfortunately yeah well he didn't did he say what him going for genetics I think nobody hooked him up any city didn't know to it was just that it was a sativa right there guys we're looking at this plant likes the pit look picture of the whole plant you're right Scotty like this bud it's a beautiful grow setup nice trellis and everything like that the sativa stuff like you definitely could have trained this canopy out a little better you could have done some I don't know what man there is a torn of tops on that canopy it's just the wrong variety and that's yeah through it is top of the variety but when growing sativas do be ready for knowing to train more he said you have a limited ceiling knowing when to top or top like sometimes if I do I know this plant stretches like crazy so I'm a top it you know to like not two feet sometimes depending on the size of the plant down like eight days before flower which I know sounds aggressive but if everything's rocking right for the certain strain it would work so you got to know the techniques or you can throw a sativa dominant like eight week or eight or nine weeks train yeah I just want to end by saying it's important to know your strains it's important to know what you're working with kind of going back to that auto flower thing that I was talking when you have experience like he was an experienced guy indica grower and yeah I'm just looking at all the different strings even look at this one I got bunk that not bunked out but maybe bunked out this is my wedding cake right here little popcorn buds man this is my flow right here and I mean which one's more fun than grow so that totally depends maybe the popcorn buds are they dense I thought popcorn doesn't I don't know right I'm just okay my point is that you gotta know you're strange you gotta be able to talk to other people like seats here now I'll give a shout out those guys are always cool when you get something from them it's vetted he's not gonna bother to get a whole bunch of seeds and push out a whole season for him yeah they're gonna piss people off he's got to be growing Bank man anyway I just think be really careful as you as you select your strains if you want to grow a sativa go find one that's gonna work for you man they've got plenty out there that are eight nine ten weeks of TVs they're [ __ ] crazy in there your frame work with some of the breeders too I'll just to give an example they give a lot of information we talked about on the show Duke diamond luckily yep he's been in studio a few times lives in Colorado we've had the opportunity to develop a little bit of a friendship there but he put stunning information on his packs and as far as seats here now is over on the YouTube comments i won of this post what Steve said here he goes seeds here now is number one lol I've had one transaction with them and my seeds took two days to arrive I called an ass about the freebie with my order and my other seeds and they were there two days later eighteen of eighteen popped which is awesome that's obviously not a guarantee but they do have man if you have a problem with your [ __ ] call them up and that's one reason we recommend them and don't forget coupon code dude ten yes dude 10 at seeds your now we'll hook you up I recommend because they deliver but beans a good guy he's part of our crew he totally gets what we're doing he jumped up to support us man so I'm all day you see just the other flip side of this is we have seen a fair amount of grow talk dank nugs in different things throughout the years whereas like just a bag seed check this [ __ ] out but man I have to shoot it is a crapshoot I agree and if I take all that time and money to power my lights and effort to be in the grove and all I don't know what I'm doing yeah invest fifty a hundred bucks I'm having really solid genetics that you can work with and build on", "OE7vAqt9_Dg": "alright guys welcome back to another 420 strains reviews this time I got some dirt and poison here I'm going to show you guys a little bit of review this stuff I like all my information I'm telling you guys is off Leafly comm check them out I don't take credit for it by Durbin poison this is the stuff I got here this beautiful beautiful well trimmed bud besides that little piece right there but we're doing a little review on this for you guys let's see if I could put that somewhere here's like all every single one of them are really good-looking buds and this was breaking off like look how just perfect that is it's like a perfect butt right there [Music] very dense very delicious this is a sativa like I said beautiful snap see if I can get this to focus there we go look at how crystally that is on the inside the scale of a bigger piece to break if I have a bigger piece right here I got 7 grams of it guys but like every piece in here is just beautiful just absolutely beautiful but this stuff is just amazing like you guys see that money shot ok we could drop that piece let's try to get that there we go that's some good stuff right there guys be a durbin poison let me see here I'm ugly flee like ah guys effects energetic happy uplifted focused medical purposes it's used for depression stress fatigue pain headaches which actually makes sense cuz when I smoke it it's usually when I have headaches the negatives is basically as any other sativa dry mouth dry eyes dizzy anxious and paranoid the dry eyes dizzy anxious and paranoid is very little but dry mouth is really good like really high up on the list it has an earthy sweet peyote taste which I could taste in this its most popular in Portland Oregon Denver Colorado Las Vegas or Los Angeles Phoenix Seattle Washington Colorado Springs you know Vancouver just stuff like that guys and it's really good I'm in love with a this stuff is $20 a gram so I only got seven grams Cassie the math it's 140 bucks um I got eight grams of marble a which is fifteen or this one was telegram and then I got eight of the blueberry which was 15 gram and I

right yeah I right peace love and light I'm back once again today I want to talk about a very controversial subject or plant matter that taken over the United States of the world right now and it's cannabis cannabis is something that the majority of our people are using recreationally medically and what I want to do was just dispel some of the myths about ten of us and talk about some of the good things and some of the balcony's what we have here is my mother plant this is Durbin poison it's originally out of Durban Africa it was booked into the United States and the 75 column in this calmness that worked with the hi Time magazine they brought it over because it is a pure sativa hybrid it's not mix it has a very good yield anywhere from 8 ounces to a pound per plant and it usually takes about 10 weeks for it to come to fruition when you can actually harvest it what I'm gonna be doing today is that you can see she's very pushy so that means she's eaten a lot and I've had I've been holding her in [ __ ] now for about eight weeks I've been holding her [ __ ] now for about eight weeks and that's because I feed a pool close on top of her and I'll explain to you what that is also later so essentially I'm gonna be pruning her and basically what I'll do is I'll just take off these big water leaves I'll take these big leaves and what that will do is it'll redirect the nutrients of the plant from these big leaves into other smaller leaves or other parts of the plant that could use them even the stem making the stem stronger and making all of this really really strong so when she goes into bloom she'll be ready to go right so one thing about campus and how it affects our community is of course a high usage of it but what people have to realize is just like any other thing that you're going to take them to by the way the food was herbs or whether it's from superbugs you have to be aware of what it is actually doing to your body and with that being said we have to know how these masks open and a lot of the companies actually move to differ I actually moved out there to number four to learn more about it before it comes down south when it does be prepared to be a party business a big part of the market that's going to happen in the South one day hopefully so like I said a lot of us are using it illegally and just ingesting whatever it is we get and not paying attention to it so I came up here to learn about it and learn how to cultivate it learn how to grow up organically we can grow it vegan to where you know you don't use any anything like compost from them use that create your own compost to you know feed the plant and help it grow healthy yeah so Sheila I'm gonna flip around so you can see her totally I'll keep her veg for about another month or so and so her babies or clones can catch up that way I could throw them all into [ __ ] at one time and I can tell the light cycle so there's no confusion confusing the planet because literally what you're doing is when you're growing indoors which is what I'm doing is you're controlling the atmosphere I'm provided with the co2 she needs I provided with the water to means I actually provided with the light that she needs and I'm using metal high light lights and high pressure sodium lights which gives me the full spectrum of the Sun well I suppose we can duplicate on earth without actually having them outside in the Sun or outdoors bro process so right now what I'm doing is I'm running her 18 hours on and then I'm running her about what six hours off and that's what's keeping our engage if I run her along the lifecycle you know actually a shorter life cycle which would throw her into bloom because it'll make her think that it's springtime and should we get to produce flower and then you know I let her flower for several more weeks and then and then I harvest but let me show you a clone a clone or a baby of hers that I pulled off of her when she was maybe a month or two younger and I pulled off some clones so I couldn't replicate her symbol to which the grandmother even though they used to do what she had houseplants she chopped off a piece and put it in some water and to the roots then we pod but let me grab one of the columns for you yeah so what we have here is a clone of the model plan yeah beautiful and she is probably I say this plan if I'm not mistaken is about a month and a half old and I literally snipped her off when I snipped this plan off I promise nipped up about this much and I routed her they have put her in I'm actually growing these plants in cocoa 100% cocoa and then I'm feeding them a cocoa base nutrient very good new shapes so with that being said I'm gonna go ahead and get to Poona her and you can see what she looks like now and once I finish you actually see what she looks like I'm gonna snip off a lot of these leaves so we can concentrate on the stems and the stock you know really strong before okay so I got my pruning shears and I so we just pick them up and actually these leaves our excellent source nutrient value help to fight the common cold and other illnesses that you might have blood circulation high blood pressure sort in all you do is you take a handful of these leaves and I think I'll do that later and show you please and I can do this for one I'm throwing them inside and I keep my girl very clean so we don't have to deal with pesticides spider mites thrips or any type of p.m. which is powdered mold because I can total environment very good cleanliness it's super important when you're cultivating counters I can show you how I make my tea with it and I'm actually in Atlanta I worked at a barber shop in Union City actually it was a Jamaican restaurant right next door and I went into the restaurant and I had a terrible cold coffee lots of phlegm and it was an older elder Jamaican lady in there and she called me over and she's like what's going on this is for I knew not to eat dairy products or drinking anything like that because that dairy products of milk is what allows disease to grow in your body and thrive to make you sick because they they live in that mucus that you get from milk and if you investigate what the milk really is you might stop drinking it but nonetheless so I went up to her and she said we were back home in Jamaica I would make a tea for you out of a marijuana leaf and you'd never have a cold again unbeknownst to her I was growing marijuana at home I had a harvest at home so I went home I'm sure I'll be right back I went home and I brought her a bag of leaves and she took him in the back and she stood them up for me she steamed vermissa and I guess a pot and ten minutes later she whipped me out of a cup of it put some honey in it and a few other things I'm not sure she put in there for seasoning and I'm sure and I drank that tea that she made from the marijuana leaves and I've never had a cold again I've never had a cold again I think that a long side would change my diet and taking some things out of my diet that contains dairy products ice cream things I love to eat I had to really sacrifice you know things there amazing to my palate that I ate for sheer delight no nutritional value I was eating her because it tastes great like ice cream so after that I got the tea I drank it the coal went away in a few days and I harvested my plants and I collected leaves and I made tea and no I think not just from the leaf but the leaves help me fight and break down the mucus and then by changing my diet I kind of eliminated mucus in my diet just basically a bunch of pups you know what I mean and it's really not good for you so that's just one of the benefits of the cannabis now another thing I learned coming out here to deal with is that they do sell what they call recreational cannabis and they sell but they call the medical grade cannabis and you do have some people like I say that growing vegan and actually grow it you know pure cleaning way a natural organic way and it has very very good additional values but whatever what I got out here is that a lot of these dispensaries really having a regard for your health and it's all a money game and they'll just have different sides of the century both sides medical run-time correct and a basically selling the same thing on both sides but if you don't get your medical car you better discount than you would if you didn't have it right and the way you know just when I research to find out that it was a farce in some some dispensaries I'm really arguing that though it's because the th levels are so high and when you understand what makes the THC levels so high of course it's great environment but what happens is this plant for example when she gets when she goes into bloom it's like the mating season for the plant so she's starving for the pollen from the male plant and part of her attraction to the male plant or for the pollen that's why through the air is to produce THC which makes it sticky so when the pollen do float around someone a problem does float around that actually stick to the plan and fertilizer not fertilizer [Music] the process of creating more plants or creating seeds takes place yeah and so once the pollen hits the plant and the seeds begin to generate it stops producing THC the THC levels drop way down but a plant that has no pollinating it has completed the process will actually have better medicinal values because it is it's a complete situation the family and everything exactly sometimes necessary and relationships to have a child you know to give the relationship purpose so it's the same thing with the plant when the plant is pollinated by the male seed the male plant then it will create seeds and that's when it creates a lot of the medicinal things that you need some additional components that you need for a host of things off the writers you have people that have pain joint pains or or even help you stop seizures there's a lot of medicinal value in a marijuana plant so so what they're doing is they're starving or they're they're actually not allowing the plants to take its natural course for the sake of higher THC which just gets you high it really is nothing medicinal about THC itself so that right there in the cell you know me coming out of there honestly my whole purpose to come out here initially was to grow a lot more to make a lot of money but once I got out here and began to understand more about the plant and see how the plant was being exploited it kind of my homegirl from development I'm lying what I think is right it kind of changed my outlook it kind of changed my purpose so at this point I really want to tell people understand the plan because I think it's essential that people grow their own plants because that way you know exactly what you're smoking you know exactly what you give them and you don't have to worry so much about whoa what do they put in this plant so make it so big harm you actually harm units that have helped you there's nutrients out here that will actually stun or stymie humans ability to reproduce you know actually deposit those same nutrients in the plant into you and cause you all kind of reproductive issues that you might not want will be aware that's even happening because people aren't being educated about it but I think it's also a big missed opportunity for our people because I don't see a lot of us out here getting involved in the business and I think it is due to lack of education about what it is you know most people have the same thought process I have they just want to get hotter you just want to get higher but we really have to be careful and we really should get more involved in the whole cultivating process so we can decide what it is that we're putting in our bodies and we can decide how we want to use it and what type of weight you want for medical for recreational I mean I don't think anything's wrong with recreational use of it but I think you know like anything else you have to you have to do it in moderation you know you can abuse anything that potentially would be good for you make it be a problem I'm growing this particular strand dirty poison it's a it's not a hybrid it's a pure sativa out of Durban Africa I really want to really focus on genetics of different plants at harvest up and crossbreed them and create my home strains and really really have control of what the benefits are from the plant so that's where I'm at with it right down learn even cultivate learning the business of it all so it'll take care of me and then I just love taking care of plants I think this is my B and then you know originally coming from Alabama both my parents and parents you know grew up in a time where you didn't really go to the store for much at all you know they grew it all in their gardens around their farms just for a few things so I really want to get back to that because I'm not gonna only cultivate cannabis I want to cultivate a lot of vegetables and things that we you might have seen me on here now in the future with some lemon plants or some avocados peppers some heirloom tomatoes and I think it's important that we do that and collect our own seeds I really really really get back and control of what it is we're eating happens over diet so if you live longer healthier more prosperous life yeah so I keep on pruning I don't want to do too much so basically I'm just trying to get all the leads that are really big and it could be potentially blocking the light from the other leaves yeah I can't wait actually allow it to go into bloom and take you guys to that process as well and I would I am gonna let her go into bloom I have some clones of her some things that I could not murder so I can continue my massive growth but I'm gonna let her go into bloom and I'm a pollinator and I'm gonna actually create some seeds that are creating some babies and I'm gonna harvest all the seeds and collect them and then what I'll do is I'll get another plant and produce more seeds I think I'll get something like I'm gonna be a bubble cush or something like that and which is another high yields or popular strain out here and cross let's see laughing creating you know [Music] this is a help control how much nutrients or how often I have to Peter because these big leaves they they eat a lot of nutrient which causes to me the feed of my life around it's really not necessary right now because but I want the happiness for these branches to get strong getting really strong because when she goes into bloom the bugs will be so heavy that the branches will actually just bend over and break and a lot of time that's because people rush them into bloom you know before the stems are strong enough because there's some time with her like I said she's been around for almost three months now so generally three months you can you can you can start from a flower morosini and at three months and be blooming than in harvesting but I just I just really wanted to get strong so the buds will be strong she won't be stressed out the branches won't break so I just wanted to show you guys this process or idea just so you can see it makes me never seen before and we'll continue to talk about this a little more later and I don't answer some questions if anyone has any I'll just leave my information we can email New York make comments in the chat it's a lot smaller a lot thinner I'm sure you were again after a day or two because normally after you prune them they have a tendency to you know to wilt a little you know you know I don't want to do too much cuz I don't want her to go into shock you know and that's a problem because if she goes into shock she could potentially start flowering right off or she could do what they call they call it her mouth and have you shock them too much so actually become male and female and pollinate herself because of all the stress that she's going through so it's like it's like having a child and you have to really take care of her you have to the better to show you have a feeder at the giver of life make sure she has enough hair make sure she has everything so I let her sit for a couple days and I'll come back and show you guys all right now I think I want to take these leaves it's beautiful leaves on the table and go ahead and see we can make some nice tea so I'm gonna take these and I'm actually going to make some tea take that down [Music]", "nXHUE1jHelo": "well hello there it's play with fire once again let's see if I can do this so that there is my turbine poisoned it's on about day 42 right now here's my early miss it's 20-something days long yeah 20 or 25 something like that but these two should be coming into bloom about the same time and what you're seeing right now is the reflection off my tape my safety glasses so you guys don't see it all in purple this is the Durbin poison once again it's opening up nicely in the early mists I'm not even going to bother playing with because it's such a quick auto flower here I've got gelato in another gelato and these two are gonna be on a different late schedule", "NroPl1nCiuc": "hello everybody wonders oh yeah well you purchased today I've got some shatter and we got some shake I've already opened it you can see it down here but we've got a half ounce of sweet Island young sativa and like I said I've already opened this and there's little buddy in some shaky though but I wanted to show you the numbers on it so CBD testing at 0.8 the THC at 20.8 Kerry Faline is at 3.1 and this turbine no lean I guess that's how we say at Turpin h\u00e9l\u00e8ne that's awesome for my neurological conditions and really really amazing with headaches I've been an experience and some really bad headaches and that helps a lot with it the third terpene here is maya cream and that's at two milligrams so get down to opening this up here you can see they're kind of nuggie but there's some a lot of shaking it - but you can see the container it's just full of orange hairs and of course they're all muda they could see it there's quite a few there - so look at it this is actually a really tasty strange world fruity taste and you can see all the orange hairs in that spot like I said there is some gonna get some stems and such this is the shake here let's pull up some shake just so you can see what it actually you can see yeah there's a little stem there let's say but there's so many hairs aren't hairs in it and crystals and let's just focus a little better but take a couple towards the window here maybe we can see a little better and I guess not really but there we go so they call it shake because the this is what um actually they have a automatic trimming machine they said and this is what comes out sometimes you'll see there's like a little strains from and this isn't like a string or anything it's actually part of the hemp and it gets caught up in the machine at terms of buds they said so this is why when they have this in the machine when they clean it out and instead of pushing that through the machine again and getting tiny buds they'll put it in one of these containers and sell it a shake and as far as the price goes here's a receipt from today you can see that the shake sweet Island skunk on my medical discount it was fifty dollars but the medical discount brings it to 46 we also got some Durbin poison shatter and that's on sale for 15 bucks so with medical discount that brings it down to 13 85 then we got some kanji gummies pineapple indica and they're ugly 18 bucks medical brings it down to 1755 and I get my senior discount takes another 10% off knocks it down seven dollars and 76 cents and we paid with five dollar bills forty dollars worth that gives us one pre-roll for a penny so our grand total well it's 69 eighty three and five dollars and seventy seven cents in tax burn it to a total of 760 so and just to show you what the shatter looks like there's the shatter all golden kind of looks like a little Swiss cheese thing so and to give you the numbers on the shatter it's a turbine turbine poisoned strain so the THC for the whole thing is three hundred and eighty five point zero five CBDs testing at one milligram the lime amine which gives it a nice fruity flavor is testing extremely high at fourteen point twenty five and once again this is the Turpin Holly which helps me a lot and that's just at seven point three five and carry clean is at two point three so and like I said this is a shatter comes a little glass container and a little cap and there it is half ounce bacon shake sweet Island Scout and half gram of Durban poisons shatter", "US6E6S1FhDM": "what's up YouTube this is I saw images back with another product review I did one of these earlier today they're probably gonna drop at the same time or within a half-hour 45 minutes of each other so I haven't dropped that one yet I'm gonna drop that one in a few minutes and then I'll drop this one short they have to so this is another mary's medicinals review this one is durbin poison i would show you the other one but i got rid of that one today no because it was bad it was really good I could have kept it from my own but I already have stuff for that so I figured I'd hook somebody up so this one is durbin poisonous a sativa I don't have any more of the information delete Li next to me at the moment my potency is THC seventy four point seven nine percent zero CBD production date is seven 1919 and it's kind of spatch number used by day psi lab tested on seven twenty nine nineteen test batch number in national poison control number it's a label if you want to know about the other one go back and watch the other video that I'm gonna draw up to shortly says contrary to a popular relief it's made at the same place that the platinum beeps carts are made up [Music] that one's from Saginaw so once again the bottom not like a little pull tab piece pull that decide the only difference between this one and the other one I had is the other one had a black tip this one has a white tip this both I know my room is dark at the moment I still gotta get that light not very dark the bubble is not moving super quick so it's not watered down liquid whatever the situation is so let me look this up to the bomb battery take a few rips and let you guys know how I feel about this one I'm not getting any real predominant flavors from that at all I think you can tell it's just an old card like that kind of flavor like some basic oil without a lot of Terps well then give this one a go the other one was good was actually really good so we're gonna see what this one's all about it's not bad that's pretty earthy though it's pretty damn earthy actually as I said I'm going to the sweet flavors so the next review I'll do I'll probably enjoy that one a little more just based on what I feel the flavor is gonna be the sugar cookies one was really good great flavor this one isn't bad at all just personal preference I prefer the the sweeter flavors versus the earthy tones I said that in a bunch of them but this is not bad I would definitely recommend this to people I'm gonna say they're two and home right now and the products I've tasted the potencies there and at least the sugar cookies I thought that [ __ ] immediately was really intense I drove to my friend's house I felt pretty pretty [ __ ] baked no I don't support the I don't promote smoking and driving you know you can still get a DUI even though it's illegal I'm sure there's still a gray area with all of that but DUI is driving under the influence so this is something obviously drove on I made it safely I didn't swerve all over the road I know not a drunk so yeah I would definitely recommend that to somebody - a lot of people actually as I said it comes down to flavor preference a lot of people like this kind of flavoring more than the sweet ones some people wanted to just taste that straight wheat excuse me not the nose again yeah Mary's medicinal and there's - an O on this channel so far I'd recommend them I'm gonna get my hands on some more the flavors and just keep trying then I'll look into some of the other companies and see about testing out their stuff but Mary's medicinals give it a thumbs up very tasty just something that was just a little too woodsy for me so I personally probably wouldn't buy this one again for personal use um the sugar cookies absolutely I'd buy that again and again nothing bad on that one flavor taste everything was there but it's as I said it's not a bad flavor it's kind of like Mars og wedding cake any of those other ones from platinum it's just got that that type of taste to it yeah pretty hot I can feel it I'm a little high before I did this video I'll be honest I can definitely feel like the kicking it up a notch being a sativa I definitely feel like through my frontal lobe right here I got the foreground of my forehead yeah I wouldn't sound like super uplifted at the moment pretty sure I was smoking on the indica yeah it was an indica a Skywalker OG I was hitting that on my club and a little bit ago that wants a straight indica so doing that before doing a sativa you know I kind of riding out both feelings at the moment but yeah as I stated there to when I won this journal I definitely recommend Mary's medicinals so far unless I can find some research stating otherwise well I'm gonna say they're all good but uh I'm gonna run I got some xbox overwatch to play relax kick it hang out with my boys but yeah if you guys don't mind smash that subscribe button hit the like button comment

rate so if it's not broke don't fix it I would say what our years definitely worked really good you want my shot there already well this one's got a scraggly besides that I'm pretty good so probably

be harvested yet the other one some of them have even built ended here yet the altered so I'm not sure what's after that now I have increased the amount of dark hour lessons last week buh-bah giving it [Applause] need 13 hours of darkness and 11 hours of light to speed up the harvest because it really is to get variable so I'd like to you what I and I can see they did I can see where it is increasing right now are being my new master system it looks like I next opto-video okay these are the two plants that are ready for harvest I took a good look at the chrome the buds they look very ready to me you can't see on this of course but when I looked at him there were tons of trichomes and they were also very cloudy the majority of them are all cloudy", "gTO-bVzkZlo": "so I'm doing this video because there's just not that many places where you can get a pretty summed up decent knowledge about th TV and the strain Durbin poison as well so I recently got some drivin poison and it's a really interesting smell it's much stronger it has been reported to have 1% THC v which is basically like an additional cannabinoid considering how small amounts are found in other strains so it's 1% which isn't really that high but it does change the effects massively it's been called the espresso of weed it's 100% sativa straight from the place of Durban in Africa and just as a sort of experiment really to see if there are any differences you could notice and I think suddenly the race car cannabinoid which is the nickname given to it is quite appropriate it does set in much quicker yeah it's a it's it's a different kind of look as well but it's interesting because th TV it works with THC in a different way so it changes the way the THC binds to the receptor for one I think it prevents it from rebinding continuously so it just binds once does its duties and then disassociate and then it's not allowed to keep keep on stimulating so that changes the way that THC works with THC V itself is a neutral antagonist for the cb1 receptor and that's that's something that pharmacies have not been able to replicate when they try to do what THC V does very well which is prevent the reward from food it seems to do and when pharmacies did that they made Rehman band and that accidentally caused suicidal beliefs and ideologies so they had to very quickly pull it from the market after finding out that it seemed to suppress a lot of the rewards from values in general which made life quite depressing clearly so this is a new potential therapeutic for obesity or and diabetes as well might be good for pain perhaps it's it's of ensuring to a shift to the default mode network which is the resting state when you're not doing any tasks of your EEG activity so it shifts that base activity towards more executive regions like the prefrontal cortex anterior cingulate gyrus as well I think and a few other odd places but mostly the prefrontal areas and that could explain why lots of people when they try Durbin poison they have this feeling to clean their room or tidy their desk Hoover their stairs that kind of thing we did to me tells me that a lot of stoners or people who smoke don't have tidy rooms or perhaps they just really liked hiding in their room especially so I'd like to know what someone might do if they had to tidy room this note don't point we shall find out I I don't have a tidy room unfortunately so maybe I will do it a few days it depends oh good this time so yeah it's it's really interesting hi that's for sure it's quite expensive difficult to get hold off for now but it has been around a long time and it has been given this title but now we can finally see what the cannabinoid profiles are yeah there is there something else about th TV it may could work with terpenes I suppose it has many medicinal properties I so sure but yeah be the neutral antagonist idea is really interesting because there are just not that many of them around I haven't seen it before a new tonight agonist has 0% efficacy at the receptor exactly right what does I mean so yeah I'll find out the details of that at some point but yeah just as an experiment it's a really good string so yeah hopefully this could be a treatment for motivational disorders like depression and things so it could be really nice to see to strain to encourage that sort of high childlike mind state that some people get when perhaps the first smoke and see more of that you know going out and creating something making a ramp but completely  it up that's the kind of thing I'd like to see more instead of the sort of couch lot kind of style to it because it's just be far more funny I think everywhere will just be a pineapple Express movie it all day long cheats and junk so

them right but got em lollipops i ain't done nothing to this super skunk really besides take her out of the corner she's been out for a day or so second day and she's already getting bigger so i'm happy about that but this is the durban poison and these are the super skugs but i got it filled up from wall-to-wall and it is grown under the mars sp250 which is a good light for a 2x4 no problems out of either then i'll be posting a video on the outside girls too the dirt and poison i put outside and then the blue dream crust the big i have outside and i did get the nemo toads from nature's

closer he's got about two more weeks then they'll be at the ninth week that's all he getting but it looks good that's all the greasy grape well this one is the ice cream cake this one got about uh four more weeks this no this is the this is the ice cream cake yeah they got four more weeks this is the g3 it got three more weeks gonna let it go to eight weeks uh the durban poison this one got until next thursday and it'll be coming down just giving y'all an update on them well i was supposed to be making a video tomorrow giving y'all an update on all of them so i guess that's what what

next thursday not this coming thursday but next thursday just today is monday nice fat colas on here these are big ass nudes right here okay y'all that's the end of the video i gotta turn my light back on i just flushed this big one right here with uh 15 gallons of water i know i gotta do more than that but i did it like that so i can uh uh for the last two weeks i'm just gonna feed the water and that [ __ ] just about take care of it hold on one second let me turn my light back on okay i just turned it back on i guess i got to warm up first but there you go in my next grow i'm going to be doing some zookeys across between girl scout cookies and garu gorilla glue number four i got the invasion already so hopefully they'll be big enough once these are done to come in here and i'm sorry i still ain't made a video of my other tent i got two plants in there and guess what i finally got my spider former sf4 thousand i didn't even make an unboxing video because i was so eager to set it up and i had took my other leds off of it and put that sf4 thousand and immediately the plants was reacting better to the sf4000 than they were with my other led i had so that's a good thing so so far that sf4000 gets uh thumb up thumbs up so yeah everything's looking good so far i just fed uh my other tank yesterday last night because with that sf4 thousands uh own over is drinking up i mean drawing i mean is it drying up the water or is the plants just eating more but i fed them two days prior and then the dirt was already dry so i'm gonna have to up my feeding on them to every other day or check them every other day and see because these i did every three days or when i came in and seen that the dirt was dry the pots was light you know that's when i fit these but they are looking good turn my fan back on before i forget because i will forget it'd be mad as hell i have did it before and uh left out fed him or did something made a video and forgot to turn the fan back on and come up here hours or a day later and realize i didn't turn on the fan not under this big light yeah i know it would have killed them you know but up under my old led i did it before so there you go let me spin out a little bit there we go so i don't know if you watched my last video and uh how they was looking on my last video i can't tell if they grew any bigger but uh they are looking nice they are looking nice this one today had no the uh ice cream cake today had made its fifth week and that week five them nugs are huge for week five so hopefully they'll be looking like these right here or those in the back uh at week seven so we'll see i can't even stop the video because i'm just amazed on how good they looking and everything like that but i have no choice i gotta vacuum the rest of that water at the bottom of my uh greasy grapes because like i said i just flooded them i mean flushed them even though they got three weeks left i still flushed them you know you know my durvan poison i seen that the the leaves start yellowing i took a wild guess and said it needed some cow mag and i also gave it some epsom salt a teaspoon per gallon and you know i've been using my cool bloom and stuff like that but that's cool and cool bloom it plays a big part in them but he's a real big part i ordered me a dry hanging that thing i got a hook that uh started hanging there moving some stuff around in here so i can hang it i don't know if i'm just going to trim my stick that's my baby she in here she screaming to see her daddy but uh her mama took her from me hey get my cigarette out the bathroom but i'm gonna end this video y'all i hope y'all like what y'all see uh like comment and share uh thanks spider farmer for finally sending my lights so far i am pleased with

it's another week down in the bloom room and things are getting even crazier in here we are going to be harvesting our cindy 99 or cinderella 99 [Music] looking very nice they go long colas all the different coal is in here it's getting crazy and then tomorrow going to be harvesting the fatty durban poison branches are about the size of one liter bottle i mean it's pretty crazy okay another one right here i'm gonna put in comparison again our pretty orange hairs on her trichomes are getting nice and mature only about 10 um of the trichomes are uncloudy some of the lower buds i mean are going to be different but i mean with all the foliage in here i mean oh definitely uh i'm tapped for space so i mean it's not helping things at all i mean this look at this skywalker kush right here i mean this thing is just taking up a massive amount of room right here and then i just had to put in one of the power plants because this was getting way too big in the veg room on my veg table and the other one along with a second reincarnation of that uh skywalker kush from last season it needs to be brought in here because it is getting gigantic as well which i will be showing you guys in a second here's an um this german poison here is a few weeks younger and then the durban poisons back here are about i want to say two two weeks two or three weeks shy of where this one's at this durban poison and that one are the same age this one obviously the older one and then yep we got our skywalker kush here starting to show those beautiful bud nodes looking tasty cindy 99 she's being taken out today she's looking beautiful beautiful look at this thing beautiful cinderella 99 buds definitely one of my favorite strains to grow definitely has a kick-ass kick-ass high to it good medicinal use for sure especially if you're looking for something to toke on during the day and you still have plenty of [ __ ] to get done and you don't want the come down to leave you you know struggling behind or wondering when it's going to wear off because you got [ __ ] to do cinderella 99 will take care of you our power plant getting big so as you guys can see have got some overgrowth going on and uh yeah hopefully after they had a big durbin poison in the center there along with our cindy 99 kind of free up a little bit of space we see here well you guys don't see until i show you but i picked up another light i had to had to do it so now we got our 2000 watt perifact works [Music] beautiful light works amazing have not had an issue with it at all and then i just had to get this baby right here it is a 1500 watt i ordered it from amazon it has top-notch reviews and that's exactly what i want there's the name right there it's a funky name i mean a lot of the lights on amazon they all have some crazy ass names other than bloom spect and parafax um my other one in the uh veg room that's a grass uh grassy land instead of grassy land i don't know why they would call it grassy land but that's what that one's called so yeah a lot of the lights they have weird names but i definitely pay attention heavily heavily to reviews and i even look at multiple sources of reviews just to make sure because when you're spending you know 130 dollars on a you know 1500 watt but i just got done spending 130 on a 2000 watt you kind of want to make sure you're getting your money's worth okay here's a little look at the cinderella 99 and some regular daylight that light is definitely bright right now but you can also see a lot more of the true colors i mean it's gonna be they're definitely really really frosty i mean the crystals just glisten off some of these leaves look at all those nice orange hairs on there all the frosty trichomes didn't get to give you guys a little look at the the last cinderella 99 before i harvested it i told you i would on this one nice and frosty so goodbye to this cindy 99 and on to the next one okay i almost forgot to show you guys but i'm harvesting the durbin poison my first urban poison anyways and uh yeah i made it i started trimming up one of the uh one of the branches uh until i realized that uh i didn't show you guys what it looked like before i started cutting it um when it's in the bloom room you can see all kinds of red hairs you know the pretty trichomes and stuff it's like a good spot here my hand is it's about every bit as long as my forearm each one of these branches see if i can get a better shot here of it because i kind of want to show you guys just how frosty and gnarly these colas are kind of hard to see with this camera i don't know if it's picking up the uh nice fuzziness of all the trichomes but beautiful big old fat nuggets all the way down the branches i mean look at this just gnarly buds all the way down all the way down the branches and then all in the jungle down here i mean you just have colas popping up everywhere i mean it's just it's a gnarly mess yeah i wanted to show you guys before i actually started harvesting it nice and delicious oh yeah see see that back up you can't see the white hairs you zoom in bring it in now you can see all the red hairs like i said uh with all my plants when i grow them i always leave 10 trichomes still clear 90 cloudy trichomes because i like the more uplifting high and trust me at 90 it is plenty potent no matter what you're growing i mean it's it's all based on preference look at that white hairs nothing but red hairs it's crazy it's just a matter of the lighting you know um yeah it's all based on preference um the more amber you let the trichomes get obviously the more potent the uh the effects are going to be um but i mean that's something you've got to play around with as a cultivator and um that way you know how to grow what you like to smoke 90 cloudy for me is exactly how i like them that's just my preference this is what the durban poison looks like before harvest see you next week all right so this is the durban poison trimmed up well um let's say about uh two thirds of it anyways because i was trimming some of the branches there was a uh there's some buds and some branches that were slightly you know undeveloped or immature so um i'm gonna let those remaining branches mature a little bit before i cut them down but this is what we're looking at this is all the uh sugar leaves that's all the you know fan leaves and garbage leaves this is all the savable sugar leaves a whole pie pan and then all these tasty buds and there's some fat ones too i have my cell phone right here for uh you know comparison to the buds it's the size of an iphone 11. so as you can see we've got some big big colas going on some nice sized colas and some hefty branches that was the harvest of the uh durban poison you guys [Music]",

is that where it is and the three hours are becoming four is it up the top or in west work all the way down to the rhythm and the heels are getting steeper and steeper and steeper look the most important thing to know is that if you are not sure about something you have to let us know tell us we take you're not sure it's fine but don't let us think it's one hour and then after one hour it's another 45 minutes and then after 45 minutes it's another hour and a half because it doesn't work so watch the whole day the walk was like longer than six seven hours and we had to go back in the dark and we did it make it sometimes that's what it takes it can't always go good sometimes you have to just keep walking for nothing [Music] good morning this is Franco I'm waiting I'm part of the crew that he's waiting for this to four-by-four sir city and how high are the plant high in the second day we started driving and meet a very very old contact of me called Isaac he brought us to a really tiny tiny village high up in the mountain and you set up for a while talk to the local people made our connection see this plant this plant here is ganja plug John it's his plan the minty one the minty one yes in a sativa and then we only had to walk 500 meters down into the bush and there was a huge huge field of five six hectares in Malawi [Music] yeah [Music] Sammis coke man we find your stop make [Music] [Music] some serious really the size of the crystals short Shyamalan unbelievable no it's marvelous this is very good this generation to catch a sheet now you don't see this in Africa normally so many Russian on the plans how many people you need for this to work because there's a lot of work 15 people you have from the village to clear all the weeds and that field really impressed me because it was for me the first time that I had the chance to see the Malawi Gold growing in such a scale so I could really see many special characteristics of the plants on a big scale on a good volume for statistical watch this is monkeys don't eat heavier and gets told it's funny and the baboons is a problem they take a lot or because I can see everywhere a little bit baboon dementia they then they make party if you go into an area like Malawi and you meet a lot of people you see grows for 20 years you see grows for 10 years and she grows for one or two years most of the time they are a little bit scared and not allowed to say to you from the family or the community how long they grow as a straight hunter you really have to make sure that you know who is doing what because often you can see that the not so good grower is also the guy who hasn't obtained the very good seats too gross next year crop dramas in Malawi are very resourceful people they are very poor people there are people who have used everything they can to maintain their family and the children there is one why the quote marker is that this coke yeah it is rare just like code you can't find it in other way or another can and this with just a little you can take much man that words makes them good growers the need for survival these guys don't know nothing they don't know to speak English almost but they know things about the plants that are pretty amazing did you ever try to be fertilizer to the plant yeah that the talk all the users fertilizer yeah some of them are already so advanced they actually pull their mails some of them are so advanced that they actually know they have two phenotypes in their field even if they don't know the meaning of the word phenotype in English hey when did you plan this when did you plant anywhere between 20 January and when you harvest May May 20 May 4 months yeah so you for most of harvest you can", "wzDYOie9En4": "what's up kanji

big shoutouts to this this is a Teva so we might get a little bit of energy from this I actually have Durbin poison seeds but an auto flower what's up Kate Magnus thank you so much for tuning in and hopefully if your plant as dark as this did it look as dark as this because I you know every grows a little different everybody does it a little bit different I would assume that where it's grown you know the in Colorado here you know it might be a little different looks good to me guys I say we pop it in Yoda and smoke it what do you guys say much baked we'll get put cannabis in pipe we must and smoke it we will alright guys I'm looking a fatty here guys there's a big little stem in there someone to take that out once I get bear with me guys big shout out some mixed up calm guys don't forget

heights guys so don't be afraid to check out that if you're in the 50 to 80 I'm gonna swing around here and put you guys back up okay so real sorry I'll remember that and so we are smoking some of that Durban boys and it's gonna be absolutely yummy I I would imagine so that's right what do you guys say if this would be the time if we were Facebook live and right now that people would be like flooding it with love guys and you guys would just be packing that bowl right now but you know what YouTube doesn't have that option so let's just go ahead and throw a few comments up there guys and I see it how many people we can maybe get into here I know the inviting and I know it's a little different guys but maybe we can get a few people in here I'm shocked it's a little but people already know this start just sleeping mokosh man big shout out said everything that you guys do man I love that you stopped in brother man give cannabis guys when I smoke cannabis I don't know if you guys get this but sometimes it hits me right here I don't know if you guys know that feeling it's kind of like you know like you get that a more relaxing I'm sure you could pull a bigger hint and caught it it's not as dry as normal buds would be in Colorado which is a good sign which means they just cured them right which means they're grown right and means they put a little bit more love into it California or Colorado peers are a lot different than California peers yeah they're a little wet you know what I mean sargent sleeping my cush man you know about that I'm sure down there and Florida dude you're probably getting hit with that kind of sticky moist weed and Colorado usually it's pretty dry so it's nice for a change not to get all dry super dry bud and and just rip through it you know Yoga definitely helps with the dropping effect with the cannabis as well you know with the pipe that you put it in for me personally the way that it hits too because some pipes are really rough some pipes are really tough you know and Yoda is a smooth pipe man you just got to get used to it it pulls a little thicker than most people because this holds a lot of smoke so you got to remember that and get to know your pieces as well I feel like when smoking flour me personally guys and I don't know about you guys I like a nice smooth cannabis taste where it's rich it's just like you just you can tell I was been harsh lately I'm not sure but why I've noticed that I choked more than I used to choke dude it you know people might be spraying their plants or doing something crazy on them you never know dude it's it's hard out there because you guys don't have dispensaries and that's the number one thing that we're trying to do with the ganja lovers can attainment that support recreational and medical use guys so you guys can go in there and get it you know and youtubers right now if your YouTube in for the first time onto the guns lovers page guys hippie Komets it's kind

update I'll show you all my stuff here there's my Girl Scout cookies made urban poison they just transplanted that one tonight so I got that and I got my super Lemon Haze cones they're gonna go into flower in a couple weeks time everything seems to be in like a slow motion and everything's taking his time growing cold when I don't know Matt they must be able to sense winter I don't know I haven't been making merry many videos lately people have been busy getting my house ready for the generator stuff so I got everything now got a wired into my panel got it all set to go so power goes off I'm set no more elder just never you know that's that so I got my buddy's got somewhere strange started another utopia another you midnight kush blueberry bubblegum or something like that a few different strains coming you'll see them right here you're gonna have them within a week or so I'll make more videos but not much has been going on like I said Girl Scout cookies Durbin poison I got an update I got two super Lemon Haze and one blueberry that's in week week 10 of flour right now so anyways that's it people just a quick update that was nudey like subscribe comment Oh", "8piWlkj5RC0": "okay so I'm doing another video right now and the streams that I have for today is Durban OG wonderful strength Durban OG is a sativa dominant hybrid and it's Durban poison cross with og cush so two really wonderful strains in this and this is a great day time medication wonderful way can be and I was I was able to wake you make with this I hit this midday if this in the evening and also right before bed and it was good the whole entire day except before bed because it's energetic kind of kept me up for a couple of hours but it's energetic its uppity it's very um upbeat and think it's a pretty positive vibe you get with this and to put you in a good mood its euphoric you're very happy and one of the things I like about this is it's a really good strain for if you have to go to work if you have things to do whether it's crafting or cleaning house or cooking or working on the computer video game whatever it is you're very focused you're very in tuned and involved in what you're doing time seems to just go on weave around you you don't really pay attention to it you're very caught up in what whatever it is that you're doing it's creative it's very wonderful for your daytime smoke the only things I could find wrong with this was that there is crash with this and there's also munchies and cottonmouth so you might want to keep an eye on that have a bottle of water which you just to kind of keep things comfortable and that's just about it but the crash that comes with this isn't even hard course it's small kindness client it's like if you've got strong willpower you can get through it there's no problem but if you don't have the willpower to fight through the naps all you do is just hit this again because it is energetic and it kind of takes you right back up so if you start to get a thought you throughout the day took it up a bit you know it'll put you back on your feet this is a really wonderful tasting strain it's almost like a fruity herbal tea it's a very sweet earthy taste to it and the earth in the sweetness is like a fruity very sweetness so it's it's really Pleasant really great a really good social smoke if you've got like friends over and stuff then you kinda wanna keep the conversation flowing and the by I'm happy really wonderful strange so yeah I would definitely get this again and I put this up from health for life so it's good stuff", "ecn7WXiZjG4": "okay I'm back I kind of shut that off well it was a close-up I broke the butt up and there's kind of a real good close-up and see all the crystals in there hope so that one job but yeah it's pretty good really crystal e so there's one little one and you know gets a few more up here for you so like I said there's the orange chairs deeply I'm fine now and there's other ones that are kind of white crystal II and it's really strange so pretty so there's the Leafs that kind of a dark color to it once again so crystallize so that's one on to another one so here we go with the what I call green yes or more yellow but definitely nice so and here's the purplish black color and I was talking about there's an awful lot of this purple I also got the strain one time called purple Urkel and it looked just like this oh not lesbian Durbin poison south african strain I'm not sure it'll research much history of that but I guess I'd there's those dark colors that guy's one down another one here yeah it was so nice don't you look at that wow just amazing you see the shiny crystals Wow its flipped over the others like that I kind of push it up in there okay let's get one more then let it be so this is a big one and kind of see the stem where I picked off the other ones so let's try to get in closer cursing it too much say here it's kind of a picture of the leaves may be okay we're grins to the tip of it there it is I see all the twists it up a little more chairs there and there you go different poison close up I'll show you what a mess I'd meat to the poor thing so

house you can actually see the branches shake your down sideways shoot him I'll get the trellis net before I get in flower yeah no guys keep you updated", "yzjpObllRvQ": "we're away welcome hey babies today on green light we're going to talk about the origin of strains like this one where are you from she's not talking where are you from she's not talking luckily we have an expert we've heard about sativas and indicas and people are starting to I think yet kind of the basic idea so now we're taking it another stuff and like where do these come from and how did we know we basically kind of have to go backwards in time to figure out where they come from sativas are usually kind of from the equatorial regions in because it's literally because of India you know the Hindu Kush region like where r OG Kush and Hells Angel originated from it's like taking your own family tree and be like this is grandma and who's grandpa people use different strains for different things so some people might use an OG Kush to make a plant more weighty or they might add in a tangerine for flavor it's like genetically creating the perfect baby exactly yeah just our little girls here oh hi little girl gotta keep him happy she's so smart that's what she said--oh smart she's a brainiac she's a brainiac brains are chunky cherry malawi uh what does he carry malawi yes yeah like an ice cream or something yeah yeah this one is actually an amalgam of about six different strains and you almost get even the savory node of like a cherry pie crust out of it yeah when it's cured up it's really interesting we do have strains such as our durban poison which is selective Roland race where electively yeah it's basically where they had a batch of durban poison or basically local strains from south africa and they took the best phenotypes and basically put them together to make durban poison you are getting very nerdy and scientific silent I kind of like it okay so this is a durban poison right very popular yeah I mean about it why it's so popular I think it's really affect you know it's a really really clear headed sativa test high in a THC V which is basically just another compound achieve seeing a different shape that actually can like suppress your appetite a little bit a lot of people believe that they all make you hungry yeah so that's not true not true so now we've learned about the origin of strains Nick you're yes your boards have mine and he's humble you're watching green light I'm Aaron we'll see you next time", "zNcWSHjonNM": "there are you to viewers this is gone finest dope this is my first grow actually it's not my first but this is the first i'm actually going to keep and i would just like your advice on how to make it a mind full of potential a sipper cropped it down there no so yeah please comment back about any advice you can get me thank you have a nice day to viewers", "zFQXg-0UWwY": "hi my name is Gil pine I have just created and they were hosting now bud talks it's going to be a show about trying to bring people together ending the stigma on marijuana testing marijuana products that's why I prefer my audience to be 18 and older preferably 21 and older I don't condone anyone under 21 smoking marijuana um you know that's the law I like to follow the law that way I don't remember the next generation we get this taken away um I think some of the things think about is that we don't have the right everywhere yet some states we do majority of states have medical at this point I believe is somewhere around 25 26 medical and there's a few recreational um I believe in recreational I think it's better than that alcohol that's not really up for debate at this point I believe there's no recorded overdosing of marijuana you could drink water more you could consume more water to kill you than you could marijuana but that's how unli Thal this stuff is um there are people that are allergic they might have some bad side effects but you will not die from marijuana I believe um I'm not a doctor or scientists who do not take my word for that if you have any questions you really should consult a doctor honestly at this point um they'll be open to you about it um I know that people with some mental illnesses will have bad side effects for marijuana so there's something to keep in mind while consuming and partaking in marijuana um one of my main points of the show is though is to bring together political debates about current events happening what our presidents doing you know I don't like to say he's our president but he is so like that's what he is he's the president he does some goofy things I don't agree with most of time he's dropped crack gas prices originally probably the best thing he's done in his presidency in my opinion um obviously that's not how a lot you will think there's lots of Trump supporters out there lot people I don't support them so that is probably a little not the main subject of talking about gossip he doesn't stand for most Republicans I don't believe I think that there's a small Bay set follows him blindly and that that is something that is just a fad you know there's people that are always like that I don't believe that most Americans are bad people I think that they're just looking for something different and picked the wrong person I think that he was a con artist and he conned America that's not really what tonight's podcaster videos about but that's just you know something that will not talk about always Donald Trump but a lot of his policies and whatnot and the statistics and reality of it all um this is gizmo she is a bangle Kitty she's about one year old she will make appearances whenever she feels like she wants to UM and then she will go away maybe submit gay bro we don't know she's got a mind of her own you know she's got a nice fur though um shrugging her butt on my face so but tonight's episode is about the state law that I live in which is Washington State um before that I'm guess I'm gonna get into myself I'm 24 years old um 23 gainer a b24 in March um I'm currently a invite environmental an engineering major at a South Puget Sound Community College I'll transfer grew up probably st. Martin's after or a local state school um environmental or civil is probably what I'm going to be aiming for I you know I believe that I have a lot ideas that could be good for society and you might hear from some some of these and some of podcasts and whatnot like today I'll be talking about um this marijuana project product oops sorry that is dipped by Green labs they also produce the Swift's edibles I don't know if I had any other products before so will be a first for me actually it's kind of cool for the first podcast first try so for the laws they're pretty pretty lean in this state luckily um you can buy up to gizmo hey I can't be having to do this right now I know I know I know I know I know be hanging with the marijuana uh so those state laws in in Washington state they would be 21 and older just like alcohol um you can't buy it after midnight and before 8 a.m. kind of a bummer you know um not sure why they put that 12 amu anything open later than that usually that's that I have found at least um most of them closed by midnight you know like 11:50 um even by one full ounce of flour you can buy seven grams of concentrate 16 ounces of edibles and 72 ounces I believe of the liquid form which is a tincture people that are our family worth recreational stores probably don't know what that is something that will try eventually but not tonight um you can also not buy or sell from anyone that's not licensed you know pretty simple it's a it's done through the state and alcohol tobacco and marijuana borders and like that um I give you local companies I try I'm you know I get the smart support small business I believe that's good for the economy and whatnot um you cannot drive also with five active nano grams of marijuana so if your smoked recently you shop you behind the wheel of car usually if I come home after a long day of work I I don't partake and driving I partake in the marijuana and I'm home for the night you know I don't want to be an administer society I try to end this stigma on on pot heads and where you want calm you know um I'm an active and productive member of society I think of this stigma that is labeled with marijuana's terrible for society I think that you know we have a lot of drug problems in the United States and marijuana is not one of them I think they could probably reverse a lot of the other drugs in in we were trying to say I'm trying to say is along with rehabilitation I think they probably lower the risk of people falling off the wagon for say heroin or meth it's a good relaxer good easy stimulant it's not going to make you go do anything crazy to make you sit and eat a whole pizza which I did yesterday but hey you know it's it is what it is but this product we're going over today is actually pretty cool it's a 100% full flower Keith and distillate which is a concentrate of some type it doesn't really say what kind you know just says dis lit the person I think is annoying um so the percentage is on this I memorize this sorry um let's see it's 36 percent THC for the key Flitz that's pretty good you know I'm basically the THC crystals fall off when you grind up the weed the weed itself is 32 which is extremely high for weed I don't think they're telling the truth I'm not lie to you I think they're bullshitting us I've what worsen watches documentary that they're not telling the truth they're having people fake the numbers um I have a buddy that works for one and he says that yeah they just they grow a really good batch keep a small portion of it use that for testing sitting out the bad [ __ ] you know who's keeping track I don't know don't appreciate it follow the rules you know your shits not 17 percent don't label a 17 percent percent don't like that this seems to be upper up a brand you know so it's probably closer to then farther away do not like to packaging ivar taken it out um look at the packaging it's just been bugging me actually um this is a lot this is a 1 gram joint but this whole big old box it's this little guy like come on like that's a lot of waste Gordon 2018-19 at this point sorry and we can do better there's a lot of way so we can get around this reusable containers like there's a little plastic sticker on here that keep its clothes like why could I not bring in a box of or a seal I see you know airtight container and allow myself to buy one you know um will they allow me to buy one with a renewal container nope so we have to use this trash and so there's a lot of it um you see on the streets I don't like it I don't litter you know um you know back when I was younger age to see the world's our trash can and you know I was dumb you know III don't litter I recycle I try to use a compost at this point um you know I your yard waste I'm not compost so you know I don't I don't appreciate the packaging on it honestly um the joint itself seems pretty pretty solid it's pretty tightly packed you know I feel like pre girls themselves tend to run which is the one I get one side goes a lot farther bag more than the other and that's something that I just found that happens with pretty rules so I usually don't buy these I'm I'm more about just flour no by itself I'll roll or smoke how I want in a moment um but this bad boy I usually you know little secret I found it and make them not roll yet kind undo the tip like that a little bit um and so yeah I think that this is gonna wrap up the first talking segment I'm gonna go partake in this bad boy I'm gonna smoke the whole thing um I like a smoker till it's gone you know it's not meant to sit around type deal um so now I'll give myself about 20-25 minutes I'll come back and get a little review of how the highs going and I'll probably play law yeah xbox you know I'll do it in there and you know I'll get back to you guys though I'm talking old nope I've uh I've got it pretty good there's not there's a slight run not too bad um smoked about a fifth of it so far I'd say and it's very very tasty nice flowery aroma the the distillate kinda though ty gets in the back of the throat a little rougher than I'd like it to be but you know it's a they usually only use their top quality on you know this let's inside the actual joints usually lower quality more profit margin you know it's we're capitalists so can you say you know but uh the Durbin poisons are hidden pretty good you know I'm only a little bit way through the joint right now but I'm feeling pretty relaxed already so I'm I'll get back to you a little bit when I finishes up alright so that hit really hard I have a smoked about half of it and hit the other half and go to bed so um I don't really know how much it's worth during much it costs my girlfriend Danielle bought it for me for Christmas and a stocking stuffer so I really appreciate that so Thank You Danielle um but yeah if it's like within the five to six dollar range seven dollars max I probably buy it um although you guys know", "63kHpyYJznA": "a little Durbin poison here for you some close-up shots it's just a smellivision look at the crystals my goodness Christmas tree look at I'm just grabbing random bugs off the air to show you an old urban poison there's like I know I get this all the time but you know what this is a straight-up sativa and although it's only tested on at 19 percent THC the other terpenes are so high and actually

knowledge so we got this dirty poison pure sativa THC levels up to 24% South African Landry's so right off the bat this is where I got confused I've had a land race before I wasn't necessarily sure exactly what the [ __ ] that even meant so I went and I did my research land release is just a way to [ __ ] identify a strain that grows out in one certain place totally naturally delish it legit from Durban in South Africa that's where it was grown that's where it grows naturally today other [ __ ] examples would be like Afghani whatever else you could think of that thank you no it grows in that one location it's adapted to the climates and I even got info on how this [ __ ] made its way into my hands yeah this pure sativa originates from the South African port city of dirt urban in the 1970s an American cannabis activist named ed Rosenthal discovered the original strain in Durban and he brought it back to the US so he actually went out there looking for [ __ ] cannabis seeds he found this Durban poison out in Durban he brought it back and bring that [ __ ] simple but he actually had to go out to Durban to get it that's where the [ __ ] land race comes from like I said the [ __ ] scent I got I got really tiny [ __ ] overtones hearts most [ __ ] incredible look tiny spicy album sweet candy it's [ __ ] intense they need to invent a [ __ ] smell smell vision this stuff is unreal I wish I could just send every single one of you guys a little chunk for this Durban poison I guess get you smelling your smoke gun [ __ ] powerful strain that twenty four percent THC so people

we're just gonna be a pack what's up guys so the camera just [ __ ] cut I totally lost my [ __ ] place and everything all I remember is we were packing up a bar here totally lost my [ __ ] place and

see that until I [ __ ] pull them out and show them off like crazy which we're going to be doing right away I'm killing myself for not [ __ ] using those things but if we just add this [ __ ] delicious I didn't mention the taste or anything and I'm pretty sure that that's where we were I just talked about the aroma and then the camera cut and then I lost my spot [ __ ] up and now we're

watch it I also want to welcome all the new YouTube subscribers and the Twitter followers to the family let's get to it on this video I'm gonna tell you about the at last black drops that I picked up from fluent in Tallahassee I paid $60 for this bottle it has 11.25 milliliters of tincture every drop has 2 milligrams of THC for a total of 450 milligrams of THC it has a beautiful clear golden color which tells me they use high quality oil to make this tincture in this case you get a strong herbal and pine scent with a small hint of citrus used sublingually it just has the herbal and pine flavor the minute is done in the doses swaddle first off just a quick reminder that there are 3 ways you can use the tincture the first one sublingual where you put a few drops of the tincture under your tongue and hold it there for us close to 1 minute as you can and then swallow the doses the second way to do it is ice and edible which is where you put your dose on food either breads crackers snacks and then eat the whole item you added the Tator on to so where to do it let's to do it that's a drink which means you put your dosage on a cold or hot drink of your choice and then drink it after that you pour a second serving of the drink that way you can pick up whatever residue of the thing sure is left and you get a complete dosage now on to the effects the effect started with a warm blanket of

the 11 to 22 wide angle lens on here rode shotgun mic so you should have a little bit better sound quality in this video and we got here press co ll our cartridge Durban it's called [Applause] we get this bad boy open this is coming in at 80% which is pretty strong for an lll cartridge he's either not that high even though the blood tender was like wow 80% that's pretty high I was like that's why I got it that's why I saw it on the menu and I came and got it I actually bought two of them that's right I had a $10 discount so I still under paying a hundred bucks for a gram cuz I bought two of these I can run and grab the other one show you I'm not bullshitting you but I did let's get this open you got my kangertech ready might be charged though up here in a little while I did smoke a couple of half grams off of it already the battery lasts forever these kangertech pens I've smoked probably about 3 1/2 gram cartridges off of this maybe four and it still got power this is Durban and this is one of my favorites I like the Durban oh look at that I'm gonna show you that that is filled to the rim look at that filled up all the way to the top that is Durban you can be able to tell because it's filled up so much come on focus red for sativa this is sativa she says Cresco on it nice and filled up all the way to the top like that let's give it a few tastes here I'll take this a little bottom piece off of it here yeah yeah I've had this before though Durbin and that's why God because the taste on Durbin is so good the LR cartridges taste so good and I like sativas a lot they're my favorite they really filled that one up though man that's up to the top Cheers just as I remember that tastes good it's got a real nice flavor sweet earthy real smooth we're trying to seek is a budtender when she sold this to me she asked me if I had any problems with anxiety because this has a high amount of terpil een in it 2.99 something and she said that sometimes that can give people like paranoia or anxiety but I never had that when I smoked out Durbin before I had the lor cartridge before but it was only like 58 or 68 percent THC it was pretty low but I still bought it cuz I love the flavor of it these ones are 80 almost 81% so a lot stronger cartridge yeah tastes amazing Fresco's Durbin yeah [Music] mmm-hmm wow that's amazing that tastes really good I'm glad I bought two of them half gram each one so I bought a gram for a hundred bucks for the gram there are fifty five apiece but I had a $10 discount rise gives you a for every hundred bucks you spend you get $5 discount $5 off so in the past a couple weeks month I spent about 200 bucks 300 bucks I had like 30 points so I used ten of them you got $10 off not too bad taste is amazing sativa Durban 80% I'll wrap this video up I don't want to make it too long shout out to all my subscribers the new ones man over 300 subscribers you guys are awesome PA medical marijuana is on the rise no pun intended Frye's Irie I think there's other rises in Pennsylvania to let me know whether there's other rise rise dispensaries AK in PA alright have a good one I'm out", "I3C5WsMIXmc": "oh how you doing guys war vision back for another review I'm gonna be talking a little bit louder in this video I noticed the audio of my videos has been a little bit hard to hear if you don't use headphones to watch the videos so just got done busting a dab of some of this cherry wine from extracts labs easily some of the tastiest CBD that I've had and I have a very tasty product to review for you tonight as well so I got this earlier today this is something I've been wanting to try for a while secret nature's vape cartridges now I did a video on secret nature's but back in the past so if you'd like to see that go ahead and check it out but this is secret nature's vape cartridges these are some of the most highly regarded cartridges that I've seen online everyone says they're top of the line and the reason why is because they're you they use cannabis drive terpenes so they use terpenes derived from actual but this particular cartridge i'm going to be reviewing is the gelato strain gelato if you don't know is one of the most popular top-shelf cannabis strains right now in legal states it's like 30 percent THC I think and it's a cross between well it was the gelato strain was created using the famous strain Girl Scout cookies or GSC so this is supposed to be a extremely popular top-shelf cannabis strain and I've never tried it so I decided to go with the gelato cartridge flavor it is a hybrid because the gelato cannabis strain is a hybrid so they extract the terpenes and they mix it with CBD distillate this particular distillate that they use is 51% CBD 0.2 three percent THC so you get that full spectrum entourage effect the only thing that this oil is lacking that I would have liked to see is CBG and CBC those are some other cannabinoids when you get high concentrations of all these cannabinoids you get what is called the entourage effect which means you get its more full spectrum and they work together to produce the effects that they would have it would have naturally caused or produced in like but if you're smoking bud so the more cannabinoid spectrum you have the more effects you are likely to feel so this is a 1/2 gram 500 milligram cartridges if it's 50% CBD there's 250 milligrams of CBD in this so the first thing I noticed when I open this package up is the packaging on secret nature this packaging is super professional-looking in just premium and it sits like a hard cardboard stock it almost reminds me of like when you buy a new phone the black cardboard box it comes in that's kind of what this is and I like that they use cardboard versus plastic the amount of plastic that we use as humans is getting out of control it's not good so any company that's using a paper or cardboard I applaud them for that so I'm gonna go ahead and show you this packaging it is beautiful it's black and it's got gold ink and it's even like indented and raised up in some parts so when you open it up it slides open which is cool and then the cartridge was sitting right in there so really cool packaging in the front says secret nature artisan cvd gelato hybrid vapor cartridge full spectrum CBD distillate 500 milligrams on the back that secret nature our goal is to help people enhance their chosen lifestyle through relaxation meditation relief in creativity this 100% organic extract is a true full-spectrum CBD distillate has been purified to concentrate beneficial compounds while removing unwanted plant materials full-spectrum oils contain a wide wide array of cannabinoids like I explained together these compounds synergize entourage effect to create the desired effects from the planet we use real cannabis flower terpenes THC free source from artisan cultivators in California to enhance our extracts and give a true plant experience this company is out of Rogue Valley Oregon without further ado so 10 out of 10 for the packaging let's get into it I'm going to show you the cartridge before I taste it so this oil is like really light in color it almost looks if you've ever poured a mountain Dew in a clear glass that's kind of what the color looks like and it's got this really nice metal mouthpiece I'm not sure what kind of cartridge this is it doesn't say C cell on it but it's definitely a ceramic coiled cartridge the oil is very thick as you can see the bubbles are not moving which is expected CBD oil is usually very thick because it crystallizes around 60% so these are supposed to be some of the tastiest cartridges available because they have real cannabis terpenes so we'll go ahead and try this gelato so the first thing I noticed when hitting this cartridge is it kind of has a a hard you have to kind of pull a little bit harder than you wouldn't normally then I've had to pull on cartridges in the past which doesn't bother me sometimes I like having to pull a little bit harder because you can almost feel how much smoke you're taking in a little bit easier and the mouthpiece has a really sturdy feel to it I don't know it feels good on the lips Wow so the flavor on this stuff is amazing you get all flavor and nothing else you don't get any weird taste you're just getting the terpene flavor so it kind of has like a woody fruity taste to it I know that sounds weird woody but that's literally what it I'm getting and it's an enjoyable taste yeah I don't know how to describe it a head it's like oh like a woody fruity taste like almost like if you I don't know I'm almost getting like some strawberries what I want to say but extremely tasty um if you want a cartridge that for the flavor check out secret nature because this is the best tasting cartridge I've probably ever tried this blows for the people's card Church out of the watermelon taste I mean I thought this tasted pretty good but I mean this is this is the real deal Wow amazing taste I'm I would actually really like to try all their flavors now too rather not like a sample pack because it's really that tasty so I got this from the chrome leaf if you watch my videos you know I've been getting a lot of cartridge from the Khalif website it's because the cone Lee's hat the chrome leaf has the cheapest cartridge prices that I've found online so the cone leaf is a reseller so they'll buy also from a company and then sell but they're pricing their pride it's very very cheap I went to the secret nature website and the cartridge on the secret nature website are even more expensive than what you'll find that the column leaves so if you're interested in cartridges check out the palm leaf and I would highly recommend secret nature I think this 1/2 gram cartridge runs at about 40 maybe like 44 dollars for a half gram so it is expensive but it's not uncommon for what we're seeing CBD cartridges being priced at right now and this is I'll tell you what a premium product I would choose this over for the people for sure just based on the taste and the looks of the oil but like I said the only thing lacking in this is the CBG and cbc that's okay it still is a full spectrum product I have to give this 10 out of 10 the effects on this stuff I did hit it a few times before I did this video just to try to give you guys good effects I'm not tired at all it is a hybrid so just with the terpenes you're not gonna get sedated or anything like that and especially it's got the lower CBD not lower CBD percentage but right around 50 so this would be a great daytime product to use I feel energetic but focused as well and I'm also used to CBD so if you're not used to seedy trying a cartridge like this may make you very tired you know it kind of just depends on your tolerance your body type what time of the day you're using it but overall good effects on this stuff I definitely feel it with any constancy be concentrate you will feel it if it's full-spectrum and I feel just a little bit lighter a little bit more uplifted a little bit happier more and more content with life that's my review on secret nature gelato cartridge I couldn't give this anything less than a 10 out of 10 to be honest with you well I've give it a 9 out of 10 because me personally I would like a little bit more full-spectrum maybe a little bit more THC like right cut off maybe even some thca to really bring out the full spectrum effects and hit yet but nonetheless this is a very uplifting cartridge and extremely flavorful that's all for this review I hope everyone's having a great day night whatever it is as always peace out", "J7OsCyaaSGs": "RT what up guys welcome our first class TV was 18 and over channel design people of marijuana music is force and tonight's episode we're gonna be doing extreme review on some durban poison so if you guys saw a couple clips to go a couple videos ago it gave you guys a sneak peek or an up close shot of this durban poison here we went out to locals can a house or recreational pot shop that we normally go to and we went out there they happen to have a menu now one that's actually uh you guys have ever been to a fancy restaurant and got the fancy bucking you know menu and [ __ ] they sit there and open up well they've never menu there they could open up you can check out all their strings and [ __ ] and they have like you know 20 30 40 50 [ __ ] that hundreds of strange but like anywhere from 20 to 50 strains in different price categories i SAT there I looked through aids and stuff and I found some durban poison here and before we get into our strand review i'm going to show you guys a quick close up shot of this package and also read what's on the package here then after that will actually get into the strain review of this durban poison so you guys see there it's actually in a plastic container you guys notice one of these little medicated or [ __ ] medicine pop tops which i [ __ ] hate i love glass by hate your [ __ ] little plastic pop tops put this in your pocket and well they're going to read but as you can see they're got the package there durban poison all that good stuff got some weed in there re so it's gotten read broke quickly what it says here on the package and then get into the strain review of this durban poison here so like I said this is durban poison so that locals can a house producer was Rainier acres this is a three and a half grams this was harvested on 12 23 a 2015 so about over a little bit over three months ago potency analyst says that the total THC in this is 18.4 percent THC and then it goes into TC itself is 0.7 percent CBD is 0.1 percent thca is 20.2 percent and then of course at the bottom there has the barcode and stop turn down the music a little bit then of course it says at the bottom which I probably haven't read this before on the show but I'll read it here this product has intoxicating effects and may be happy to farming this product may be unlawful outside of Washington State and then of course oh [ __ ] just about dropped it what does it say here premium cannabis Washington State Rainier acres so that's what I was reading there that's damn that's what it says all right there's party so it's gotten get into the strain review I've durban poison so automatically go with the price I'd start off with here and i paid forty bucks for three and a half grams so right off the bat we're gonna have to rate the price eight three out of five that's just an average price of an eight or no an eighth of some cannabis here in washington state all the way around 40 bucks for three and half gram such as pretty average that's not a great deal so three now or three out of five for the price for this at durban poison here so next up we're going to open this [ __ ] up here we're a smell it we're gonna see if it smells good as well as if it's very strong very pungent log package weed here so here we go guys just open this [ __ ] office even smells like I get a pine lemony diesel sweet smell there's a sweet lemon pine and diesel smell you smile a little bit of pine a little bit of earthiness a little hint of sweet lemon god damn this [ __ ] to smoke really good and just a very very strong skunky almost deeply smelled there's kind of a funky type of smoke but they'll be very strong very loud package me this [ __ ] burns my eyes as well as my [ __ ] nose how strong this [ __ ] is holy [ __ ] that's a [ __ ] pungent [ __ ] weed hmm this [ __ ] here when you smell like gives you that staying face that oh [ __ ] what the [ __ ] is that but again in good with holy damn so the smell test of five out of five great smelling weed sweet time sweet lemon with that funky diesel strong skunky smell to it and don't be very strong very pungent very loud package lead so all the way around five out of five to the smell test so next up we're gonna pull this but out here and that like I showed you guys are to give you close up shot above the entire eight and as you guys notice there are all buds like this here I wouldn't call them pop corn dogs because I noticed you know a lot of people complaining about having stems in their weed so what I uh I've seen pot shops or producers actually do is sit there take a full bud you know a big top bud and then start breaking it down into little butts like this so you guys actually don't get stem when you buy your product you get more weed than stem but what I notice here is that all the buds are perfectly manicured the density is just [ __ ] ridiculous like super rock art no flex no nothing and then on a scale to dress up to dress to freshen to dry is just [ __ ] perfect like got to freshen not too dry and not too loud like the [ __ ] music but straight up all three categories categories Jesus Christ I can barely speak but all three density skeleton fresh teeth dry as well as the manager job all the way around a 5 out of 5 all these bugs were perfectly manicured no lead whatsoever I didn't find one leaf on anybody at all and we're down to the bottom here and manicured job like I said just professional 5 out of 5 density and five out of five broad card and I'll skeleton fresh you drive perfect and it's a little bit sticky just a little bit that's perfect so the bud is just perfect all the way around probably the best but I've ever had or you know the best looking but are the best all the way around bud I've actually purchased at some out of pot shop so next up we're going to load this [ __ ] up here we're just going to smoke a bowl then after we're done smoking our bowl here we'll get into our a official review here of this durban poison and then of course will at the end of it will include our green space test what it tastes like on the first hit or after greens taste test see what it tastes like after a couple hints and then of course the high and then the official review of the durban poison here so enough talking hopefully that didn't take too long holy [ __ ] already eight minutes trying to make this a little bit quicker strand of you and real quickly guys before we get into that I want to show you guys my new bowl I guess you could say I've actually had it for a couple years now but I went and cleaned it up there because I noticed that up this thing here or this bowl piece the number one W it has a large hole in it so when I go to smoke out of it I have to have a screen in it so if I'm using a screen I normally have to keep the inside of this kind of dirty or kind of resonated so then the screen will actually you know fit in there and have something to grip on to you because when the glass is all clean like this the screen and the bullets just going to flop all around and because the hole in this is a little too big that'll suck bleep through I you know I can't completely one hundred percent clean it but I did find this [ __ ] here and this one here are the small hole in it as you guys to see I was able to 100% quickly clean it and what I noticed also is it actually looks a lot better on the green bastard than the old one does so look at that I'll check that out so fancy tell you that that looks nice doesn't it see that's a new one and then there's old one clear that it looks like yet why it's dirty hey guys you guys see there since the ball already popped out small hole there but got that all cleaned up there so you don't have any resin taste or anything like that when we do our interview so enough rambling on and [ __ ] hope you guys at home IRA smoking device little guys were joining herb you honey all the wives hashkee shouted colorable whatever spoke down can discuss Oh Jonah with me and as always to get hit challenge guys hopping up all loaded up every time you see me check it as a marriage of water i want you guys at home to smoke along and do the same so enough talking let's get the smoking try to find a song here and then get to smoke in and toast guys here we go durban poison screen review never smoked during poison ever this is the very first time I've actually ever had some durban poison in my entire life sir we go guys to have been smoking on it so enough rambling I need to find a song again to smoke okay I'll take that one [ __ ] it re go guys sorry you can get a close up shot here oh thank you guys are what a justice here let me just a little hit feel like that's just up too high hopefully that's a little bit better all right let's go ahead and take a big group here so I definitely got the Greens taste us and after green to his desk gonna get the smoked up and see what kind of how we get do what kind of shot harwin take one more hit here that ball piece is just so much bigger [ __ ] milk sup it's almost like having a little mini ashcatcher attachment on to it holy [ __ ] I noticed that there was much splash back or nothing I didn't have much water going up into the [ __ ] uh type of the mouthpiece there think there's goods are better air flow with this one the holy [ __ ] the difference in the bull peas just a little bit different right there just getting a little bit bigger one that ma'fucker just completely changed that [ __ ] water bike there's clearly knew I was the [ __ ] device there that rips like nobody's business holy [ __ ] well what I [ __ ] wing cleaned up o P sub cuz it just hits way better well you said what up with that well there it is alright so I was going to give to this official review of this durban poison here all right are you so first up the price was forty bucks for three and a half grams average price a weed here in Washington state has been for you know at least ten years now since I've been buying weed so three out of five for the prize forty bucks from you half grams like I said average price of wheat here in Washington State so not a great deal at all but not a bad deal either so throughout a fire for the price next up the oh my goodness the smell test there we go the smell test so it's not pretty damn good gosh with you smell really great just very lemony very piney and very easily it was like a strong skunky but it was like a super skunk mixed with that funky diesel smoke guys have ever smelled sour diesel has a really strange funky smell to it but definitely some very good smelling weed or should say some great smelling weed that's very as well very strong and very loud package weed it almost [ __ ] burn my eyes and my nose like for some reason every time I go and get some marijuana some recreational pot every single week the smell is just getting stronger and stronger this [ __ ] here very strong probably the loudest pack [ __ ] a weed I've ever had my entire life this year's really really strong smelling like I bet you can put a grammar this in your house and within about 15 minutes your entire house will just be freaking a weed with a gram of that [ __ ] just laying out on the table holy [ __ ] on a 5 out of 5 for the smell test and the next up on the bus just a 5 out of 5 across the board the density was great the [ __ ] the scale too fresh to dry perfect all the way around even a little bit stinky which is awesome as well as the manicure job manicured golf professional manicure job no leaf and also manicure job density as well scale too fresh to drive 5 out of 5 for all three just some great [ __ ] perfectly manicured and cured but they'll be a great job on that then in the green space test just a very strong cash kind of th like purity she tastes like guys Maria had the first hit of past or that first hit of some Keith maybe that greens hit a keep or something just that purity diesel [ __ ] tight stage is a very strong PTA mix with a little bit of sweet pie so 5 out of 5 for the Greens taste has definitely very great tasting of sweet as well as very strong very long-lasting on the palate I using that even as I'm talking Delphie can still taste that [ __ ] very strong Kashi sweet time k still on my palate so 5 out of 5 for the greens taste test and also a 5 out of 5 for the after Green chased us every single okay even the fourth fifth and six hit there still tastes like we had a brand-new bowl so it tastes like a brand-new [ __ ] green bowl right on top there some great [ __ ] tasting [ __ ] so a 5 out of 5 for dr. Greene States has still to taste that hash eNOS make sure that hint of sweet pine to it like I said brand new green hit are you know kids like a green hit or green sit on every single hit so far about five for the green paint and then the high as you guys could tell this [ __ ] is Duffy used to keep a dominate cuz I'm having a hard time [ __ ] talking like I definitely have a very very strong afford [ __ ] head high I don't have very much from the body high at all definitely a very strong and poor cat I so adeptly have to give a high of 5 out of 5 mission definitely got me stone in the couple hits that I did take a bit I'm definitely you know I wouldn't have to smoke anymore weed tonight I think I'd be good you know I'd be perfect even though it's me so I'm probably gonna smoke some more weed but if I you know what needed to or if I wanted to I could easily just stop smoking right now and just be good for the rest of night so I'm definitely stoned a 5 out of 5 for the price so my official review of this durban poison here this is some really [ __ ] great ship you're someone who wants some are you know you're someone who likes to smoke in the morning or maybe like to smoke during the day I definitely recommend you guys to go to your recreational black market or even your medical dealer wherever you go get your on cannabis at go see if you can get yourself some durban

had a lot of stuff going on at school some really important tests and stuff I usually have really important tests all throughout the year but this this specific course in my school kicking my ass it's really difficult but we're good through it we just finished today so I'm treating myself I'm treating you guys we got a new video it's about to be smack right before we jump into this video let's go

Arizona I have my own medical card everything I do on this channel is legal yeah so now that that's out of the way I guess we can get right into this so I'm completely sober right now I smoked a little bit this morning awesome an old cart that I had actually was a venom acts I was supposed to do a video for that but I just like I said school was just training me I was stressed I just couldn't do it but I the two cars that I showed in the last the strange Saturday which we're still debating if we want to do Sunday or not but the let's train Saturday I said I had two carts those were venom X's I think they were tangi I don't remember pineapple tangi or something like that I got i don't remember the strain but i threw out the boxes but they were supposed to be two different ones now it's going to review them and have two two videos two completely separate videos but since they were the same it would have been useless and only one video and like I said I just was stressed as [ __ ] so I just skipped out of it and didn't do a video but we are we're here with another video and I got to cut two videos coming up here so this one and then another one the cards were reviewing on these two videos are gonna be pure earth no I don't remember exactly I could be wrong but the first pure earth cart I did actually was one of them I beated viewed videos I think in their first or second which is actually insane so if this video can be even like 1/4 or 1/2 of that that would be dopes mad appreciation so the cart we're gonna review today though is the pure earth DJ short right there I don't know if you can see that there you go um uncut VAP cartridge is a half gram I won't lie to you guys these are probably my favorite boxes I've seen out of any descent cart they're just so [ __ ] elegant I don't know it's just it's super dope um I don't know if y'all are into video games or anything like that but there's this game called destiny - there's this raid at the boss by Calvin our model remember that narrates called but this [ __ ] color scheme anyway flashbacks if you play that game but yeah this box is clean and and just like the other one they're the same box got a little pull tab there I'm pure earth it you know somehow some rep saying this or whatever [ __ ] yeah you guys killed this box gorgeous box so on the back here says in infused with authentic cannabis terpenes no PG propylene glycol propylene glycol PG I don't know what that is or MCT I don't know what that is a proprietary pure atropine and cannabinoid profiles so that's what that says right there on the back right there then there's their website and then all their other information blah blah says requires pure earth battery for use this product has been tested for potency wow that's cool so that says that on the back right there and then read above that it says right here this little like black dark black line so the extremely potent cartridge use small draws until comfortable with the effects so that's super dope I'm excited this isn't my first pure earth like I said I do not remember at all what that one was what the strain was how it hit anything like that so if you guys want to know before you see this video go ahead and check it out you know check out my channel you know life subscribe do all that [ __ ] if you haven't of course but well let's go ahead and open this [ __ ] up I think you just pull okay there's a sticker right here the best thing to use lightning cables for if you have an iPhone is for cutting a little like [ __ ] piece of corners like that [ __ ] yeah cool boom and then not a tape no that's done boom she just slides on out there and it oh no I thought it locked um so it didn't fall out but it doesn't uh box [ __ ] hollow box it's a very sturdy box so that she you know you could take this [ __ ] and eat it and not really have to worry too much about breaking the cart which is which is really nice that's uh that's a good feature to have on carts let's do a little hydration break here guys drinking another pees tea Georgia Peach you already know yall already know so here's the Box simple box right there on the front it even says it says the this is an indica dominant so I didn't even say that this isn't in a kendama net strain it's like 8020 ad indica xx sativa but you know basically indica just oh that's nice so this is a little really soft foam packaging so it's gonna be even harder to break your carts in here if you drop or throw them in your backpack or whatever you got to do that was loud I apologize for that um yeah so here's the cart so this is pure earth there on the front super dope and then here on the back yeah well cuz I'm a terrible youtuber and everything like that it says the strain which is oh I drew that [ __ ] it says the strain which is DG a short and then it says that it is an eighty indica 20 sativa so it shows you like the breakdown which is super cool it's going to pop this cap off alright there we go there's the bottom authentic see so [ __ ] you know you already know here we got the dr. zodiacs Moonrock battery here I really want to get another one of those cards just to have the battery to be honest but those cards did smack as well we just charged this one up you already know how I am when it comes to hits on the cards I think a fully charged battery is always gonna hit hella harder that just makes a [ __ ] ton of sense to if you'll think about it I mean you know but if you guys like to you know use your batteries all day that's fine I do - I did - I burned through them then I charged them for the [ __ ] video so cuz I want to show you guys the potency I had its finest so let's do one more quick hydration break here without out of what what did I just say and with that out of the

think this doesn't want to stay walkabout pretty impressive this is Dervin poison it's our South Africa's signature strain and you know there's a coffee cup so you can get an idea of just how big it is that's a lot of weed there in one branch I said if this plant kid about I don't know half a kilo even more perhaps yeah so I mean that's it's pretty damn big there's my hand and I mean just look at

[Music]", "pMeXFWcpyws": "okay I'm doing a video and the strain that I have for today is if you can read that it's fitmin Girl Scout cookies absolutely wonderful strain I mean this thing smells just like chocolate cookies we'd like a little bit of mint it's just perfect very great bag appeal um hmm yeah I need a better camera you know and I will I'm in the process of getting Wenders in a budget lots of different shades of green light green forest green there's even some purple right there tons of orange hairs it's just a great gorgeous but to behold and it smells wonderful this is a very good social smoke it's something that's very pleasant you know on to taste but it's really really nice it's always a treat when you have meds that smell and taste really good oh that's good that's tasty oh man mmm so thinman Girl Scout cookies is a hybrid strain and it's Durbin poison crossed with og cush so you get two really good strains oh I love oh gee cush and dirty poison is another one that I really love pain relief and the hi are both a creeper didn't really feel anything to like I started on my third Bowl but maybe I smoked a little fast move in a hurry um but the beginning of it is that Durbin poison really shines I mean I was talkative so so happy just out there very wonderful way to start your day but I noticed that after that I kind of started coming down getting a nice very super relaxed feeling not couch locked but just I was very very very comfortable I was so comfortable I wound up taking a nap and man it was it was a great felt very refreshed didn't even have the munchies after but from what I read this is good for loss of appetite insomnia anxiety nausea swelling and severe pain and the pain relief is wonderful I love it that's it about maybe three three and a half hours long so that was nice and the high was nice too probably a good hour and a half and another maybe hour of just buzzing in and out but uh it was great I would definitely buy this again I've had Girl Scout cookies before but this is probably the best kind of stuck because I've had who ever goodness did a wonderful job so thank you keep doing that man I love when I get okay disappoint when you go and you got weed it doesn't even smell at all doesn't any taste I mean I know it's all about the pain relief and stuff and all the benefits from it but yeah it doesn't hurt that tastes good doesn't hurt you know to enjoy even more it is already enjoyable", "o_lZnWuvGgk": "good day you view us welcome to millennial Lodge I've already prepared my cousin for that good day band Poison what are you waiting [Music] [Music]", "gLibtQm-OR8": "[Music] out here we do another video and extraneous out for today's [ __ ] cookies and I picked this up from Green farms in mesa and this was off their private reserve so it's going for like fifty dollars in eight wonderful stuff though I really enjoy medicating with the student cookies and I couldn't find much information about this the only thing I know is that this is a cross between durban poison and girl scout cookies I went up looking about [ __ ] cookies and the only thing isn't finding reference [ __ ] cookies was an interview with burner when he was asked a question who's part of the cookies family and jig his name came up so I don't know if this is maybe one of his creations but this is really what this is really wonderful and really well grown whoever did this for a good job it's got a nice kind of earthy pungent spiciness to it a little bit of sweetness in there but overall it's got wonderful bag appeal a good smell good taste wonderful high and the effects are wonderful as well great pain relief if you give me with chronic pain this is a really good strain for that because it's like it does only deal with like lessening the pain kind of lowering bringing it down but also on your like you don't you do it like chronic pain sometimes you're constantly irritated agitated aggravated even you know because you know you dealing with pain constantly this kind of brings that valor you know it kind of settles the nerves chills the emotions you just kind of put you in a nice euphoric happy state of mind and that kind of stuff goes a long way especially when you're dealing with other people yeah and strangers who don't know you or what you're going into but still wonderful strange totally enjoyed medicating with this and I hit this thing drop the whole entire day wake and bake all into like evening time so like right before bed and I didn't have no problems with being lethargic or pumps going to sleep it was a really good strain for me so take a quick toke sir with the hit to like and then a screw the more on the strain the [ __ ] cookies is up I couldn't find much information but it feels like it might be our 60 for you in the car something along that line is very well balanced but it just feels a lot more comfy on the body than that anything else but I did medicate with this and I had no problems throughout the day it's a stony strain yet is functional so for me this would be like a good day type in the car I don't know this is an indica dominant you guessing because I have no idea what the what the ratios are on this just kind of quite off my own experience it didn't catch me throughout the day but I feel like if I wanted to I could the galloping cofactor was wonderful so if you've got like stuff to do or people kind of pushing you along let's go it's not a problem to like to kind of get into gear and go ahead with with your day you know it's a really wonderful strain Frank comfy yet functional you know and I like that I like that in a strain because the stuff that I need it's good for like anxiety and stress and it's uplifting enough that you know it would be good for your depression and it's very relaxing so it's good for the pain relief it didn't sedate me it didn't intoxicate me it just gave me a nice stony kind of a high and nice wonderful body butters the mind was still active so it's a good schaefer for me I would say anytime throughout the whole entire day there's not like daytime or nighttime but the whole entire day was good man but yeah it can't get comfy so maybe if you did want to if he has a pic of time if you're like real susceptible to falling asleep get to the target easy then maybe I want to see this more the evening time but I don't think so i think probably using any time of the day man i was black this all morning so even right now it's morning time token this up but yeah anyhow man [ __ ] cookies my wonderful stuff", "i5fuNWGBVhg": "welcome to marijuana etiquette today I will be sharing with you the top five rated sativa strains number one and Misha haze honestly out get this strain not be number one amnesia haze is an all-time favorite and Amsterdam's coffee shops and quickly became one of the most recognized TV strains of all time amnesia is no random name for this haze indeed under her influence you might have a hard time keeping track of you're trying to thaw while she is incredibly inspiring and creatively boosting she is one of those strains with which you can come to realize the ultimate purpose of life but then forget about it she has a unique smell that's easy to remember sweet and lemony with a balanced earthy undertone with an average THC content of 22% and Mia haze can take you to the other side after all she's one powerful mistress number two Cali miss Callie mist is a very well-known almost pure sativa strain that comes from the master breeders of serious seeds she delivers a very strong energetic and clear minded high one that is said to be particularly enjoyed by women Cali mist has a sweet and nutty taste that induces a very potent high the THC content of Cali miss tends to be in the region of 22% so you know she is one of the big players number three Sour Diesel Sour Diesel is one of the original sour strains and is one of the few sativa dominant varieties Saira diesel is behind the success of our Sara strains that have become so popular recently this smelly powerhouse is the parent of many hybrids so if you like sour she's the big mama as you would expect the bud has a very earthy sour and jet fuel like taste with pleasant pine undertones while her THC content of 16% is a bit lower than that of the other contenders she still packs a punch the high is long lasting strong and mind centered without any body effects whatsoever number four trainwreck as the name suggests she's a heavy hitter with almost 90% sativa Genetics she will induce an intense cerebral high that very slowly fades out however what sucks trainwreck apart from other sativa strains is her indica body load along with the cerebral stimulation she will almost death we find you to the couch and tingle through your limbs this rather unique combination is the reason this strain is a favorite among medical users it's a complete high with a cerebral Rush and physical relaxation the bud has an earthy pine quality to it and produces a zesty lemon undertone with a THC content of 18% trainwreck is a respectable sativa that will surely satisfy number 5 Jack Herer Jack Harris an old-school sativa dominant strain that has gone down in history as one of the most decorated and renowned strains ever named after the activists in cannabis Paragon Jack Herer there could be no other fitting strain if you're looking to see what premium old-school cannabis was really about with 55% sativa genetics Jack Herer isn't as pure of a sativa as the previously presented strains and yet it induces a superb clear potent and happy cerebral high the but itself has a predominantly pine flavor with strong woody and earthy undertones it produces a very potent high that both encapsulate the best sativa and indica effects you can expect a strong and clear head high that will leave you happy and uplifted whilst the indica affects simply and gently lower your body into bliss the THC content of Jack hair can vary between 20 to 24 percent so it is definitely a strain for those who need some power this concludes the top 5 sativa strains list thanks for watching please comment like share and

this morning and I've had dabs throughout the day and I had like one or two drinks nothing crazy but we're gonna do some new stuff their version of diamonds which is not so much diamonds but we're gonna do it anyways because we have four four different types and we're gonna do all of them together so this one is a hybrid it's called old white Kempes I'm sure there's not much in here the ice where most of their stuff just smells like chocolate I don't know this camera on the front of this is definitely not gonna be able to see this this is like a little tiny and they're definitely some crystals in there I see them but they're very small this stuff sells for $85 a gram it was on sale this week for like 65 or 60 but when they had some other strings that I had tried but I don't know man I find better diamonds cheaper big fat diamonds this one's called for Pearl Linda it's an indica this one was so dark I think I remember correctly yeah Wow again you're not gonna grab the seat you good there's a good glob there this is gonna get interesting here in a second I might need more than the puff go I might need something a little bit more ballsy oh that's a pretty big dab at this

but for the puff go I guarantee you you know what we'll go we're gonna go for it this one smells really gassy lemon lights another indigo good because it's dude in my last video I said I think it's I said it was 1 a.m. it's it was 11 a.m. when I did the video there 11 p.m. Wow Wow okay so there's barely nothing of this one so not even worship you all right I mean I got help pretty much don't worry I always go back I'll throw them in the alcohol or something sometimes I might run heat run a little heat underneath them get it all collected if you do that be very careful some of this glass is really cheap if he hid it was just too much heat I just had one tonight shatter in my hand while I was like this close to my face I'm so scared that I wanted this time I'm gonna do it and when a chap because it will shatter in your hand and beat little shards of glass go everywhere and they're hot because of the torch and this is me trying to just gently touch like flick it with the torch this one's called pillow factory another indigo all righty all right so all right okay so this is gonna be a B handle this yeah let's go get an analyst yeah all right so there's work I wonder if I should you know what let me add a little Street diamonds or diamonds these are a little bit bigger and lighter in color I'll just grow a little bit so we're actually at five I think I forget what strain this is uh bourbon poison or something like that something like that which i think is also an end of not like right in my head at this point anybody wants to give me a big shot for 7/10 you know I look I need the torch I need the torch I got one more tip and I couple thousand dollar ready all right well top and bottom all right let's do it um that's a low temp you know we're gonna need to go at least

flavors are Nomos one of them tastes like nerds the funny thing is it almost feels like I'm going through a symphony of flavors it's the weirdest thing usually they all just mash together but it each poll kind of felt like a little bit tasting different one tastes like skittles one tastes like nerds very pleasant surprise I was not expecting that Wow big reheat but we always take it step down just we don't want right on the scorched oil this oil from them usually tends to really squirts these buckets really decent here is a bucket alright that one tastes like Bigfoot's dick [Music] Wow this turned out a lot better than I thought it was gonna Wow no it really does taste good actually is surprisingly even on the read I can't believe that miss the sale I'm not paying 85 a gram there's still another heat in there easy I think I'm gonna bring it down even there we got a green let's go down blue oh there's a piece of broken glass earlier careful if you try to eat these up and get them off a

across between Durbin pause and the granddaddy purp it's a hybrid 50/50 more or less I guess um he's very heavy he smells very potent and once your arms open there's a jar the bag or whatever is standing up is very um potent uh funky cherry type vibe going on with us and I was very good and I think everybody would like house me that there's nobody that I wanted um on the drive toka has that same type of feel on it when you are burning it on on the inhale that has a very strong on sour cherry type own vibe going on and then on the exhale as I got cherry Joey type tasters they're good and that's a very good strand right here now go did an excellent job on it as you can see is very crystal a very dense sticky super sticky as you get super tasters everything I'll recommend cherry fighting anybody ever see this try is good for anxiety appetite stimulation depression migraines cramps all that kind of stuff is very good for it and I think you'll find a lot of good releasing hope you enjoyed this on review until next time peace you too", "oO3aQh5_VgY": "chroming to the world here we go back with that update right quick I went ahead and fixed her up a few days ain't letting

hold up you know drop down comments let me know what y'all think stayed so for some more updates he's a boy family out casting them Oh [Music]", "CHNNXN1RjbI": "Oh good morning today we're talking cherry pie this is Oscar a sweet relief in the herb nerd segment so welcome guys this is Oscar with sweet relief and we are looking at some cherry pie bud right here and I wanted to do a deep dive on this for our first video just because cherry pie to me has been such a classic strain it really has like the classic coke of pot characteristics it really seems to smell taste and at least affect me like how I imagined a stereotypical cannabis train would hit taste and be it's an incredibly smooth strain when grown properly the batch that we currently have in a story and a little bit left in Scappoose is incredibly smooth you know if you're somebody that has sensitive lungs or wants to consume something in a smoke fashion that's not harsh or coughing do seem cherry pie is a great strain to check out so let's take a peek into what we've got going on here so but I punched up cherry pie into Google it says his parents are granddaddy purple across with Durbin poison I got lots of orange hair is touch of purple smells of sweet and sour cherry pie a little bit of a stretch but it's it really is that sweet punchy just great cannabis smell and a great flavor hits in a couple minutes sticks around for hours I'd say that's pretty accurate so cherry pie and I don't know if this is accurate still because there are some ways that people are able to take a clone only strain and manipulate it into producing strain-specific seeds using things like colloidal silver and there may be some other fancy tricks that people have but clone only is what this seed finder EU and this is a very trusted site for lineage and where I go to get a lot of research but as you can see it you know as a really good smell the the floral smell shines through the the effects are are fairly even the seven points who's the grower of this puts it on an indica leaning I feel it's it's pretty close to even 50/50 in effects for me I mean everybody's a little bit different but they say muscle relaxant pain relief and saw me an appetite anxiety and stress and I would go easy on the insomnia cherry pie for me has never really been a knockout punch but again for some people your mileage may vary but I I would lean on and saw me a curing affects on this drain this is one of my favorite aspects of this seed finder EU is this lineage in genealogy and you got to put a grain of salt on this because this can be anecdotal it's it's probably backed up as best to anybody can in regards to cannabis which has a tumultuous history due to its legality in the past made it a little bit more difficult to keep accurate track of things but cherry pie like thing you've mentioned is across remaindermen poison and granddaddy purple Durbin poison bean in African sativa and we'll get into that here in just a second but as you can see it's just what it is Durbin poison is forkin Durbin poison granddaddy purple however is like it says Mendel perched crossed with a skunk and Afghanistan strain in skunker ironically is an Afghanistan strain crossed with some other landrace sativas mexican sativa and Colombians the Teemo so you have kind of already some hybridization in with the GDP granddaddy purple which makes for a really complex nice strain because what you've got essentially is a heavy African sativa with some little little bass notes of Mexican and Colombia sativa bookended a little bit with these Afghanistan in I'm assuming they're indicas there are some sativa leaning Afghan varieties but this is it's the on the indica side so you have a lot going on in there but really the only indica holding its own is the Afghanistan strain in with this you've got three other sativas and so that's where I really feel you get a nice balanced effect so it's let's dive into so here is the Durban poison and this is a South Africa and sativa that was brought in in bred never hybridized and like we said as a whole hundred-percent sativa you got a little bit of that licorice flavor in it and it's got a similar up high like a Thai string but like a Thai strain for me at least these Durban poisons can be a little racy and a little they can be a little much and they can sneak up on you too especially if they're cured properly the Durban poison is gonna kind of keep creeping for about a good 15 minutes and I know for me when I'm enjoying a joint I'm enjoying a joy and sometimes they can you can sneak up and bite me so uh does not look like there's a whole lot of lineage so just this it's basically like what we saw on the other one in that it's just a straight sativa so it's kind of interesting like see you nothing I really have a whole lot of knowledge on some interesting name strains crossed with it so that's the Durbin poison and then the granddaddy purple is an interesting project and this is it I'm not sure for sure but I know it's one of the first strains that's really kind of had like a branding to it it definitely is legendary and it's there's a lot of sub fee notes to it but it's it's been a great strain nice yielder as you can see and then um okay so they basically have kept to the same thing sometimes they'll give a little bit different history or different lineage on the base strain which can give a little bit more background but again you're looking at the that skunk which is a combination of Afghanistan II indica Mexican sativa and then crossed with the straight Afghanistan so again Cherry Pie great string great hybrid you've got a lot of history in with it you've got a lot of great land race sativas tied in with what seems to be a singular Afghanistan indica and something I really enjoy I hope you guys got a lot out of this video I would love to hear any comments below on your ideas on cherry pie or anecdotal reports or your take on the

where it originated land ray strains are the cannabis that most closely resembles the variety that mankind discovered thousands of years ago then cultivated for its mind-altering spirit lifting and

hails from where else hawaii where it was cultivated by locals for centuries likely from seeds brought from asia in the mid 19th century once the american counterculture made its way to the islands in

talking mother cannabis streams one doesn't often think of mother africa but aficionados and experts always do thanks to the legendary sativa durbin poison a notoriously tricky plant to produce indoors urban poison thrives in high heat high humidity climates similar to its native coastal south african homeland fabled and song and longed for by millions of old-school smokers this ultra-strong

workout it's the only way I get pain since after a workout just regular stuff but I would say this is probably a pretty good painkiller so I would buy this again definitely I put this on my to buy list MK ULTRA is also on my to buy list so this is a 4.9 out of 5 that's pretty good I'm giving it that because it's awesome and I've smoked lots of awesome stuff from dispensaries because I have a medical you know form for my doctor for my doctor okay so 4.9 is what I give it it's awesome stuff I'm gonna buy it again and again and again in the future and that's the same with MK ULTRA they're just really nice it's really nice stuff it tastes fantastic whoops my cat wants to go for a walk her evening walk there's only a couple of strains that I've decided I want to buy over and over and over again this is one of them the other one is MKULTRA all those are the ones that are totally awesome those are gonna be ones that I'm gonna buy you know a small quantity of just to smoke everyone smile but if I want to buy like a half an ounce of this stuff from a dispensary this would be this would be the type I would buy a half ounce you know purple cush and I hope I find more strains that are like this so the indicas are really nice and this thing doesn't put me to sleep I don't have a problem with with um you know indica is putting me to sleep unless I go after one that is specifically grown to put people for you know at nighttime I did try one that worked really good that it was specifically grown to put people to sleep it was called dark Vader like Darth Vader but dark Vader it was really good put put me right to sleep immediately within probably 20 minutes I was asleep so this stuff doesn't put me to sleep keeps it kind of happy in a way and you know you're not too zoned out on this thing well you're not even don't don't you just you're just happy puts you into a good mood so if you want something that puts you into good mood this is the one I'm gonna

infiltration that see like when I when I was over in Hawaii in the in the mid 80s it was the last of the Southeast Asian varietals grown in the cane fields and so I go there and I get to experience some world-class cannabis and it was perfect because the soils the climate all matched up with those type of plants and so you had this incredible combination and then I go back you know years and years later and I got this uh this white kid that's telling me about you need to check out the aloha white widow and I was like that's not what I'm looking for I'm looking for the cambodian that used to grow out here that used to take top your head off make you almost peed your pants you had to sit on the toilet smoking um where's that and they're like oh no no you want the white widow and I'm like no I don't want the white widow I know the white widow is like what I want is the things that were from here did did Africa have the ability to hold material in constant do you still have to because someone whose discover in stock because to me I'm like Afghanistan got hammered all over Asia got hammered from war Africa had so much war and famine and issues as you're mining material you stable to mine some of that killer stuff from the past or is it it's getting polluted quickly it's it really is it's hard to find like I was in this last year went to through Ethiopian than this Seychelles Islands right there and it's even finding these old land races where all of a sudden it's like oh these guys were here from Amsterdam a couple years ago and we have a white widow mango that we open pollinated with all our land rate stuff so all of a sudden is this with what's happening is it's harder and harder to find from from Africa and that was years ago Southeast Asia you know I traveled through Vietnam Cambodia lout Thailand area trying to and then even that was mid 90s and you're still running across places where people had brought other genetics in so this is one thing going back in this diversification and being able to keep things from their from the origin you know in Southeast Asia India African keep these genetics separate and being able to do to do testing and that's like the kind of the back step of documenting this but like yeah Africa it's it's anywhere in the world right now it's like Irian Jaya Papua New Guinea you're going there in these areas people have been there with cannabis or him it's amazing because you know for me for my background from being in cannabis when it was coming over from all these places throughout the year in cycle it just let me experience a range of effects that I don't experience now I called most of the stuff we play with now homogenized cannabis and what I want is I want to be able to have these unique directions to fit what I want to do and how I want to feel and I people try to tell me that you know it's your imagination that you're you're dreaming that things will better at that time and I said oh no they they had unbelievable effects and the directions were phenomenal and they were very unique in the way they sent on how you made you feel and you just you don't see this except in some very rare cultivars so we see stuff that's highly marketable and a quality but like you know you working with some of that stuff that panama's I remember some killer panama's that was just thumping and the the flavor profiles were unique in the way it made you feel was unique and the problem is that as soon as we started to hybridize it down so that it would work in our climates as soon as we started to try to bring it indoor we basically just started calling and out of existence and we dumbed it down do we turn the qualities down and if you know for me when I try to get when I meet people that like you like I've known you for a long time but I know that you're you know you scour in the earth and I'm always like did you find some goodies someplace you know is the goodies still remaining somewhere and and and unfortunately the goodies are out there but they're just not markers you know for though for the most part but the some of these cultivars that take 14 weeks that the flowers still have 14 weeks is like a football and it hasn't filled in but but this is something that it's good to have in the toolbox you know let's not get let's 9 you get let this go and I think right now that's these different unique cultivars that we run into it's keep it alive or share it with somebody else and you know it's like that it's like cannabinoids that feed your endocannabinoids you know everybody's different and that's that's the thing something that one strain it's like is that could be that key that helps you like with epilepsy it's 3 to 5 percent right of people that are affected by say Charlotte's Web but what are they cannabinoids within that cultivar that are accessing your endo cannabinoid profile and that's something collecting big data right now going into this on the pharmacogenetic level is identifying these genetics plant genetics and then a person's makeup and seeing that 80 year old lady that's in Australia that just got help from a certain profile and helped her epilepsy epilepsy and then you have a 3 year old child in America or somewhere else that you'd never know that this particular balance of a one to one fight and that's something working one and was finding these old land races from from Africa as well but developing a full cannabinoid profile you know what I'm talking like 5 percent THC 5 CBD 5 CB n CB g CB DV HCV flatline across the board or these different profiles and then when you identify a cultivar like that being able to put it in vitro and you put that on the show", "IfirM2TEC9w": "[Music] all right what's going on you guys so today we're gonna be going over what three hundred dollars would get you at a one plant dispensary here in Florida I actually have two three hundred dollar purchases that I've recently made here that I'm gonna be going over and referring back and forth to here in this video so we'll actually get kind of a bonus and just see what two three hundred dollar purchases will look like but first I have been promising you guys a 420 giveaway coming up which I'm gonna be giving away this star weed right here this is actually a CBD dominant strain of cannabis and I'm gonna be giving this away as long as it is legal in your state this is gonna be a United States giveaway only if you don't want the CBD weed you can actually opt out for a medical marijuana license that's what I'll offer in return if you don't want the actual CBD weed but how we're gonna go about this giveaway this would be pretty fun is we're gonna whoever can guess the amount of grams in this jar or get the closest to it will get it and that's how it will go so over the next couple videos this will be going on until the week before 4/20 so every video will be a new chance for you to actually comment on a video and we'll leave what you think how many grams is in the jar so make sure to leave a comment in the comment section below on what you think is in the door how many grams so let's get right into it and see what we got here you guys I honestly have only purchased from one plant only three times actually a not I really wish I had purchased from them way before now because they're they're weed is just completely different than anything else I've had on the entire Florida cannabis market so far it's completely different let's check this out [Music] there's there's a lot of plastic waste here that's for sure but you know that's from every dispensary I have about an ounce and pre-rolls I have thirty pre-rolls which Allah gram he's so little over an ounce and pre-rolls and then I have actually a quarter of actual whole weed right here which we'll take a look at in just a minute as well but first let's let's just take a look at some of these pre-rolls I got pre-rolls because I mean honestly for the price you can't go wrong so let's take a look at what I got here I've got ten joints of Mac one these were coming in at seventeen point three eight percent THC now these Mac one joints are really good these are probably my second favorite pre-roll that I've had from them so far really good strain all the pre-rolls themselves have really burned good so far only three rolls that I've had that haven't burned good so far were ones that were maybe ground up a little bit too much and it didn't want to smoke that good nejoy me because it was as I think Darth Raven was one of those but it was just because it was ground up a little bit too much and that was the other gnat although joint actually smoked really good Darth Raven is the other strain that I got it's coming in actually a little bit higher this time because the first time I got it was only at a 16 percent I believe 18 percent this time a little bit higher that's nice and I also got dirty limits and we're gonna smoke one of those joints right now these this 30 lemons joint coming in at 25 percent THC I mean that is pretty good for for them I haven't seen anything felt that high come out of there yep did see blueberry muffin coming in at 22 percent but mostly everything really looks like has been between like 16 and 20 percent but it has all been extremely extremely good wheat I will definitely be buying more like I said it's come it's a totally different ball game than all the other wheat in Florida they're doing something way different I'm not sure exactly what they're doing front if it's in the soil grow or if it's in the cure but it's definitely it's definitely there you guys so whatever you're doing over there don't change it we can we can tell so let's fire one of these dirty lemon joints up I mean this has been a really good strain it's actually really indica heavy for me this is uh this is definitely one of those indica heavy strains for me I found out I should only smoke this strain at night time for me at least it makes me really tired there's just no other better name for this strain honestly dirty lemons that's that's the first thing you take I mean it's it literally tastes like a dirty lemon on the exhale especially you get this real lemony citrus taste huh followed by this earthy dirty earthy taste I mean there's just no other better name for this rating besides dirty linen whoever named the string nailed it for sure and this is just an awesome phyno of it I mean the taste is just coming through it's just amazing the chirps on this is outrageous all right so let's take a look and talk about some of the prices and take a look at some of the weed the first delivery I actually got from them was right at $300 and it wasn't my first purchase my first purchase was actually the Kim D which you guys may have seen that video it's a whole video about the Kim D but my first actual delivery was right at $300 I did get a little bit of a discount you get the 25% discount for your first time for your first delivery plus you get the $25 off if you spend over $125 so that's the goal to me especially because you know everything from them right now is delivery they only have one dispensary so everything gets delivered straight to you straight to your house which honestly I thought was gonna be a real pain but it wasn't so it actually turned out to be more convenient for me than anything which I didn't expect to go that way so pretty nice on this first one for $300 I had one tier one string quarter four to eight I had six Darth Raven pre-rolls I had ten Mac one pre-rolls and then I had Mendocino Minaj that was pretty good it was kind of low in THC 14% but again still it was it was really really good it honestly is better than a lot of stuff that I've had some truly even at those percentages so it just has to do with the terpenes and and how the you know who's picking the fie nose and all that stuff and who bred it that'll do a lot for you so sharp d the tier one quarter at when you're buying it in a quarter and not just an eighth price a Nathan's gonna cost you $68 she has kind of expensive but when you buy it in a quarter it's a hundred and twenty bucks and it just keeps getting cheaper from there you can get an ounce of this for the three hundred and sixty eight dollars it is I believe it's under four hundred dollars but when you bite in an ounce like that you earn excuse me an ounce when you buy it in an ounce it's just it's way cheaper that's nice that they're doing ounce discounts that really can make a difference especially when you're buying like that that is hitting that hit really hard real fast Wow and then you can see on here the Darth Raven one gram joints were eight dollars apiece great price I mean you can't beat that eight dollars for a gram joint I mean I was even taking these things breaking them down and rolling to half gram joints out of it and getting a really nice joint out of it and still you know I was able to smoke a good joint of some organic real organic weed for four bucks I mean not bad at all or smoked a you know break it went down smoking in a ball it was I wasn't doing bad with that at all men devasena Manoj again eight dollars a gram for a gram joint and then Mac one was the only Tier one joint that I had got for that first go-round and that was $10 a gram totally worth it I'll pay that every time so that's what I had got for my first go-round and honestly the sharp deep flower this just that was just amazing let's take a look at that actually that was only coming in at 15 percent THC but I have to give it to to them on this one this was the absolute best smoke I've had yet in the entire throughout the entire Florida medical program of them having a flower this would be my number one all-around best smoke yet hands down good job you guys [Music] I was really really happy with that one so the second purchase that I did was just over actually it was well it was about three hundred and fifty dollars here so $25 off for a delivery because I got over $125 so that knocked a little bit off so that was nice so again Mac one pre-rolls I of course I loaded up on them you can't go wrong with those the Mac one dirty lemons coming in at 25 percent THC of course that's a Tier one strain ten dollars a gram totally worth it look how far I am into the joint and I am just absolutely feeling fantastic I can you can't go wrong with that Darth ray eight dollars a gram can beat us I mean every joint you get it truly biz 13 dollars a gram right off the bat there's no tear to it or anything like that and you you you know you're getting really the same quality of weed let I actually broke one of these Mac one joints open and it's just amazing what's inside let's take a look real quick [Music] [Music] it's absolutely packed with just trichome heads and keep you can see it all throughout the joint like I said I was breaking those joints open and just packing bowls or rolling half joints and I was doing great like that and making this build a long way for the price that's it's um it's one of the probably the one of the best purchases I've made so far - really really good and of course I got some Mandarin triangle cush it's an ethos string I can't you know I can't not fight that I you guys know that I'm a big fan of Colin Gordon and I always have to pick up his strain if it's a hit one of his strains if it's available wherever I go I always try to see what is coming out it's just absolutely beautiful there are some big nugs in here - check this out [Music] [Music] very sweet with some very subtle earthy tones but mostly mostly just sweet you can really smell that Mandarin awesome awesome stuff coming in at 20.4% THC not too bad you know I really think that you know the THC percentages might be coming in a little bit lower because they're of their soil growing everything but let me tell you what whatever they're doing over there soil growing or something with I don't know what they're doing over there like I said but I hope they don't change it because it has been the absolute best flower so far I've had on the market that's no lie I really hope you guys don't change anything over there please so the Mandarin triangle cush coming in at $84 for a quarter when you buy a quarter it's a tier 2 strain but to me honestly all the tiers have been good I haven't had a single bad thing from them yet that I didn't like even with the TAC percentages being low like that it's all just been felt like I said this this herb D at 15% has been my favorite smoked yet so there's there's definitely something to the terpenes and phyno picking and the breeding and all that it there's definitely something to all of that for sure the biggest difference is to me and the weed that I've had from one plant is really the first thing that you notice of course is when you touch it and you break it open and you see it you can visually see the trichomes on this it's not like it's missing trichomes and when you break it apart you're actually left with your finger sticky like you know it's it's actually the bud stick it's cured right there doing a different curing process over there than they are at truly for cure leaf whatever they're doing to cure this bud is the correct way to cure it and trim it it's just it's not lacking and and the stickiness at all it's this there it makes your fingers actually sticky this would pass the wall test and the other thing is it doesn't burn my throat now there's something about all that but this is extremely less harsh on my throat I mean in a major way I'm not sure what the difference is when it comes to that if it has to do with it with the nutrients maybe if a plant growth regulars I really have no clue but there is a major difference in this bud when it comes to that and if anybody has any insight or clue as to what that may be that I'm talking about with the harshness of the bud and smoking it please leave a comment in the comment sections I would really like to do a video about that talk about that more in the future so for a grand total of three hundred and thirty nine dollars after my discount this is what I got a quarter of the Mandarin triangle cush and thirty of the pre rolls which of course is what is you know it's ten nine grams over an ounce that's uh thirty seven grams of weed or three hundred and thirty nine dollars in my opinion you can't go wrong with that so good job you guys at one plan I just I have to give it to you I'm extremely happy with what I've been buying especially like I said with the bud that's it for today's video you guys I hope you enjoyed it and remember to Like and subscribe if you did and remember tried to guess the the grams how many grams are in the jar each video will give you a new chance like I said to actually guess on that and I think that would be pretty fun so we'll see you guys next time [Music] [Music]",

hustling young people you just have to have money situation I see you just pay and you get up so it is the Wild West in Missouri next stop was the market to invite the rest of community to a podcast later that evening so we headed up the mountain to prepare a matzo coin is the general word for ganja so I know I know I've bought an minuti before what what matter Kwame is there what different kinds is really what strange let me try and say to me say it so bad yeah I'm very interested I didn't know there was different strains indigenous strains in this part of the world another thing that is happening with with Europe and the Americas they're running out of strains they've got so many different options and they cross this and this and this and it's like they're all the same so they always need completely fresh genetics from the world so they can start the process again the next morning we left the Capitol Missouri for a three hour drive into the mountains most of the homesteads we saw along the way groom at acquiring these local land races have been growing in the suta valleys for centuries for fodder bedding and fuel as well as medicine relaxation and contemplation nothing we saw was reaching its full potential but nevertheless it was a wonderful sight and a great feeling to have the opportunity to walk through huge areas of untouched land race [Music] [Music] as we were leaving lassoo - a story broke about the Deputy Health Minister being implicated in a five million rand dagger smuggling operation over the LA Zoo - border apparently her husband owns a truck and that truck had a secret compartment in it through the exact border that we had queued in all day to get out of the kingdom we watch the situation with interest and cannabis news network we'll keep you updated with happenings on the ground in the kingdom of Lesotho your source of cannabis news you [Music]", "SC99iukFCgk": "[Music] hey what's up everybody cows coming back at you with a little strand review here for some tangent from Polaris this this is gonna be a little quick review tangey is one of my favorite strains as far as flavor goes it's one of the best citrus flavors in my opinion out there as well you know it's smell taste the whole nine yards so immediately you know let's jump right into you know we got some nice dense kind of fluffy nubs first and foremost this company Polaris they test they shoulders at 25.2% th c8 teach the eight not easy but th CA oh just like CHCA so it sounds good that's crazy okay so realistically it's anywhere between like 18 19 to 20 21 percent THC somewhere you know my husband should probably uh okay you know what it's closer than what they're selling you so but it does look good like blind the guy is there for six [Music] it does have some frosting yes - it looks good looks tasty I'd like it anyway all right so immediately you know the looks I give it a a 8 out of 10 and it's dead frosty it's orange it has the line greens and the light filled vibrant greens that you're looking for the Tandy's note which is a good quality of something that I can it kenji is also known for being a super upbeat happy yet relaxing about hi to it [Music] so you know this is one of my wake yeah this is definitely a wake and bake strain this is one of those I wake up in the morning I love a bullet Angie it's a perfect start the day kind of strength gets you uplifted because you still mellow out you're relaxed relaxed it's not gonna hit you super hard you know even though they do you know like I said there's percent rate shows like thinking you know it's gonna mess you up pretty bad but it doesn't you know it's just real mellow high which is something good okay so looks 8 out of 10 okay go on to the smell now the smell on here is amazing I'd love to smell Tanja's why it's one of my number-one strains it's my top you know top five favorite strings as tangi expel as tangerine jeering I love that citrus you know smells to him you know super lemon haze stuff like that anyways so as far as smell goes immediately it's just a burst of citrus you know it smells like you have just like a whole bunch of tangerines just being torn open in your face at once it's crazy the smell is just so overpowering and just pungent and vibrant it's amazing nine out of ten smell honestly I honestly 10 out of 10 smell 10 out of 10 smell when it comes to tangi because it is such a flavorful smell this is something they give you don't like the skunky buggy you know we smelled it you know we're so used to in a lot of our things this is a strain for you this is one that you know you're not gonna every time you come to smoke you're not gonna be thinking about oh I'm smoking weed that is how vibrant this this smell comes across it's incredible on the taste honestly this is a mouth-watering taste you know I'm not gonna lie I love it it's like I said it's one of my absolute favorites one of my number recommended for flavor for people because you know some people they not only are they looking for medicine but they're looking for taste some people don't like you know the diesel II tasted we get from like perfect example Sour Diesel or the oily kind of a burnt taste you get from someone like like Northern Lights kind of gives you that that kind of an ashy kind of a thick taste leftover this gives you this off you know this amazing citrus smell to just develop your senses it's crazy alright let's take a hit here we go so Polaris I've seen this company a couple times down they've seen that make you know pretty decent products you know if I was to rate the company you know I give them you know they're like a four-star company as far as I'm concerned I haven't had any bad product from them okay so uh man it's good taste immediately the same smells that you're getting you're gonna taste it just citrus I mean almost tastes like you're biting into like a tangerine at the same time you're taking a drink of like orange juice man it's just a overpowering citrus you know I love that it's amazing now I do have to say if if you I don't know if you younger generation may not remember these but out Lloyd's used to make a candy and they were sour and they were tangerine flavored candies there are little circle things in a little silver tin that is what if you guys remember that that is exactly what this tastes and smells like and it's incredible imma go ahead and grab another one like I said it's one of my favorites here we go it's amazing so as far as taste go 9 out of 10 has such an amazing smooth citrus taste to it I love it so now the best part about this is the high the high is a mellow high on it so it's not gonna you know I'm gonna give this a 4 the high I give it honestly like a 7 out of 10 because it's not overpowering it doesn't come on very quickly it's smooth when you as you're smoking or you know even get your hands on some concentrate you know I don't know the concentrate might hit you super fast I haven't been lucky enough to find the concentrate this stuff is phenomenal as far as flour goes so no matter where you go in my opinion if you get a chance to pick up some tangi grab it it's a phenomenal strain I mean who doesn't want a wonderful flavor with a wonderful smell and in a wonderful hi all in the same time like I said I recommend this honestly for some of our elderly patients I would definitely recommend this too because of the flavors it's gonna keep them off that that we kind of you know off off sent that up there you know the G their generation is kind of stuck on so this would help somebody the you know needs to ease into the idea or the concept of smoking medical marijuana so this is definitely something I recommend as far as somebody who's new to this industry definitely something for them to try out but as always you know if you like the video like it down below you know if you guys got any comments questions anything like that let me know if there's a certain strain out there that you just want more information about you know you just haven't been able to pick up or find or you just you know are weary about grabbing it let me know I'm willing to test it for you I don't mind I'll pick it up I'll try it you know I'll let you know what my opinion is on it however as always make sure you guys subscribe and all my gift it out there you guys got a stay lifted guys out", "EqPfb_Pehxc": "what's going on I want to welcome you to and thank you for watching this video I also want to say how much I appreciate all the new YouTube and Twitter followers and remember you can always reach out on the comments here Twitter post or DM and snapchat for any questions you may have in this video I'm going to show you the baldor hybrid strain that I picked up from fluent in Tallahassee this is the version of the blue dream strain I paid $45 for this eighth and this harvest came in at 20 point 17 percent THC looking at the bottle they I noticed it was packaged three days before I bought it which was great and they even give you the actual harvest date which in my book gives you two extra brownie points it smells sweet fruity and a bit earthy to the flavour of it was just like it smelled but the fruity scent turns into a blueberry not a really sweet blueberry just regular blueberry this 8th weighs 3.56 grams the 8th weight being exact doesn't bother me at all since as you can see the dense bullets were trimmed perfectly I kind of did expect them to be this a nice since I bought the ham trend that level which is what they call the premium now now on to the effects I felt it was a faster onset and I'm talking about by the time I had like the second hit I started feeling the beginning of the effects Netflix was turned off and changed into the sweet dance induce the music couldn't stop balancing to the beat and loved it and I have found a new gym strength more than a week from now on the comments I also felt an intense urge of motivated creativity by that I mean once the music was flowing the urge to write this review and take all the photos kicked into high gear and I got all of it done with a smile on my face from ear to ear and still dancing left and right on my share my stress and anxiety were knocked out pretty far into deep space through the duration of the effects ooh ooh how I miss a really well trained well treated well harvested well cured blue dream I can definitely work a lot better on the strain stress from more keeps bouncing right off first their energy and creativity just long delicious I certainly recommend this train for all day and night use I would just try to avoid it within two to three hours before bedtime that way you're not laying in bed looking up at the sky I hope this helps you Medicaid right have a great day", "9AYvLly1isA": "how are you doing today I hope great and thank you for watching this video I also want to thank all the new YouTube subscribers and all the Twitter followers welcome to the family and let's get right to it on this video I'm gonna show you and tell you about the ultra black line 450 milligram cards raised from fluent I paid $60 for the cartridge and it came in at eighty nine point three for two percent THC the cartridge quality is top-notch great airflow and it didn't clog at any point plus the flavor never changed I'm extremely impressed with the cartridges they use I have tried plenty of OG Kush flour before and I must say the flavor on this cartridge is really dead on the flavor was a combination of wood and pine only thing missing compared to the flour was the light hints of lemon but overall it was a great flavor on the cartridge unto the effects the first effect - here was all my stress and anxiety issues melting into a flowing river of inner joy that had me smiling from ear-to-ear then came the euphoric need to enjoy myself and listen to the music and dance all the things I'd like to do the combination of that inner joy and do foria completely eliminated my mood swings for the duration of the effects another great effect is my chronic back pain was lower to the point where I only felt that when I got up from my chair or did short movements like that there was also a strong urge to eat all kinds of snacks which helped a great deal with my appetite loss problem not very long after the effects started I also felt my entire body feel relaxed - this eliminated some overworked shoulder pain that I had from the day before and I am very impressed with how well I can feel the effects of this black line cartridge I can definitely work on this strain it calms me down fills me with inner joy gives me the power to deal with anything my job throws at me and it lowers my pain through the workday so awesome I definitely recommend this Ozar black line carthoris for all day and night use hope this helps you medicate right have a great day", "3Ok2500tuyE": "yo guys what is up we go bags with another cart review today's cart it's gonna be pure earth Harley Quinn sativa so without further ado let's get right into this this challenge for eighteen to twenty one depending on your state you already know the rules I don't make them I just tell you how it is so if that doesn't apply to you you already know what the deal is but there's us and I appreciate it today's video is not going to be quite like all the other ones when it comes to the review it's all the other ones are focused around this the cart itself today's review is actually kind of gonna be around me and then the channel we have right now I'm just kind of in a predicament when it comes to actually you know will drop the channel talk and my personal top so after we take a couple of hits here what into so like I said this is a Harley Quinn pure earth cart I've had this open for a day and a half two days and I just been chugging a lock on it it's it's pretty much gone there's a little bit left I didn't plan on making a video that's why there's so little left there's definitely enough to get like one to three maybe hits but but like I said the reason that I didn't record this video is because know Jesus like no we're not going to talk about why I didn't work what the hell I got ink on my finger but I could talk about why I didn't record this just yet let's talk about the card itself so we're gonna get through the really quick review and then we're gonna get to the talking part if you don't care about that part that's why this is first so here we have pure earth just like the last one but this last one was DJ short which had some amazing strain tastes this one is a very cushy flower taste so if that is a your cup of tea then this one is really good for you I'm a big fan of this one even though I'm not a fan of most cush tastes cuz they kind of hurt my chest which is weird I don't know how that works but whenever it's a cart and it tastes like like kosher flour or anything like that it gives me like this really painful chest feeling it's hard it's hard to explain but yeah I so yeah like I said up and smoking on this first day a day and a half two days whatever whatever it is and I do like this one it's got a nice good I'll happen nice good hi it is a sativa it's just a half gram so you know nothing too special here but pure earth they make some really high quality carts some really high quality wax if you guys are into carts like this I know some viewers are actually into flower a lot more or maybe some learn to dabs whatever maybe but if you're in a carts this is actually a really strong potent one if you like that cush taste which I know some some people do so if you do and there you go that's your cart just to the side here guys we got it we're charging my phone and the battery while we're doing this or make a move um yeah so Shh I guess that's about it this thing cost the cost know this thing was priced at $35 um I got a buy one get one with the first time visit so that's pretty dope I think that's about it like I said Harley Quinn sativa half gram I ripped off the sticker I don't remember if it showed the potency on their bottom sticker to pull it out same thing is the last box crazy you know there's the sticker right there look at that yeah no it's just just the the size of the cart and the name of the strange so 500 milligram Harley Clinton well this is gang I don't know that it's the box box giving off this really weird smell so yeah well that's all that out of the way that's all the talk no way let's go ahead and take this charger off the battery here looking nice and pretty unscrew it you already know the drill I'm in charge of batteries but is what it is I don't really have any liquid to you guys actually I do I'm pretty stupid I wouldn't brought some water just for this occasion let's go ahead and do a little hydration right here Cheers good they shaped my [ __ ] into it that's cool all right guys let's do one hit here and then we'll start talking about the the channel and stuff like that so Cheers let me know if you guys are smoking on anything down in the comments always super hyped to know it's always cool to see what you guys are smoking on and yeah so cheers guys okay so yeah yeah that's a I kind of take back the last thing I said about this card that it doesn't give me that that chest feel and this one definitely does too it's not the card but it's not a pan a pain Jesus I can't speak it's not a pain I think I made enough to seem like it was a pain it's not it is this kind of makes it hard for me to breathe like my chest is like super having I take really short breaths like that because it's just so hard for me to like inhale that I guess I'm not sure but yeah it's very very Cushing no other taste to it just that so if you're just looking for a pure cush like flower strain taste this is really good for it hydration break yeah so now we kind of got the review out of the way we might take a couple more hits here and there kind of want to talk about my channel if you guys are a sub and that's something you care about but if not and the reviews kind of over it might be a little hint sub talking about it here and there but as for the car taste if you like the cush it's like a eight out of ten probably and if you're going for potency is probably a eight point five eight eight point four somewhere in there so there you go that's all you came forward and I appreciate it but if you want to hear the info on the channel and the future of it go ahead and stay for the next couple of minutes so how it's coming down like I wanted to apologize first thing for no strain Saturday or Sunday or whatever I'm making it I'm gonna try to do another one hopefully pretty soon but I'm not sure or the reason I don't want to make a video on this cart was because I already did the last one the hardly or the the pure earth the DJ short one and I mean they're not too much different it will smack me pretty hard trying to taste pretty well they're the both taste really good and I enjoyed both of them but I just don't know one if you guys like sing to the same card brands back to bag maybe I can buy one cart and then hold off on that one I had like an extra one it's so like I do another one like so say if I get two pure earths and then two venom axes I can do like a pure venom X pure venom banks or something like that I don't know but that's something I just been considering too is when it comes to flower I'm not really sure how to review that I'm trying with the strain Saturday one that I did two weeks ago or a week ago or whatever was and you know that seemed to get some decent feedback so I'm like I'm time to do that that's something I want to keep doing for sure so there's one future like set up videos the carts I love the cards I love doing them because they're so easy and carts are just they're awesome but they're expensive they are a killer um $35 for a half gram that I'll go through in two days like a day maybe I smoked a lot so yeah maybe a day a date to three days if I really want to push it on a half gram but like that's pushing it two days is tops I mean $35 every two days that's killer even if I get buy one deals I mean those only happen once a week maybe two times a week of something decent cards so it's just party off and I've used my buy one get one for the most part on mostly dispose they're close to me hydration right so yeah it's it's just kind of coming really expensive so I'm just kind of trying to chill because I go to school full-time I don't really work I work my dad part-time to make some money but yeah it's just kind of rough where I'm at right now so I'm just kind of time to take it slow that's why videos might be a little like the way that statically because it's just hard to get so much cash they keep putting these videos out you know I'm saying but you know I'm trying maybe I'll buy like some booth carts and review those for you guys because they're like 20 bucks and then you guys get a good kick out of it because it's me dying on pesticides and maybe I'll get some views out of it for some like like review comparing contracts I can tell you guys about all that booth [ __ ] I smoked a lot of it so let's go ahead and take another hit I'm feeling pretty good about this I was just about this just feel pretty good in general it's down a little bit earlier to stress like I said other things weighing on my mind so this is definitely relieving a lot of that so it's really nice to have so let's do another one and then yeah we'll see where it goes from there Cheers yeah yeah it's a nice car guys girth definitely some quality are parts hydration breaker um you guys getting my first hits in the bed and then smoked it all the day smoked a lot yesterday I smoked like I smoked a whole half gram cart and then I smoked 12 half Grand Prix rules so yeah I went ham yesterday I wish I recorded that for you guys I don't know I didn't cuz I should've got a little clip or something maybe I could've thrown it in here figured out how to do that but yeah it was super dope I look like ripped four at a time at once and then I just singular doubles from then on now it's pretty so that was cool but yeah I'm just kind of trying to figure out video options that aren't too expensive for me but that will keep you guys entertained I know the cards are like my channel's main focus right now and I'm totally up for doing experimenting like you know with wax like dab wax or maybe like flower edibles I would love to expiry like do for you guys and like have like a dough best vlog where I go out with some friends and that bulls means chill or something that sounds dope it's [ __ ] but edibles just don't do it for me they don't give me high I don't know I've eaten like 500 milligrams and I've eaten five milligrams I mean no no difference to me it's all the same so that's that if you guys have any video idea of Audis the hell if you guys have any video ideas please let me know in the comments that would be massive um whether it be like for like a strange Saturday or like I just even the random video maybe it's like smoke five grams in one sitting I don't I don't even know if that's that's not really that hard but you know something like that even just small is awesome I don't know uh yeah any helps previous I'm kind of just trying to give try to get videos out it's just yeah like I said it's very hard so I'm kind of rambling here I'm a little blasted what said I ramble like a dumb [ __ ] and I stutter naturally I stutter anyway so if you guys hear that in any of these videos I'm really sorry it's not coming stupid I just have a very bad stutter it just it randomly pops up so that's what that it anyway OOP well I got weird real quick cheers guys we're gonna take one I don't know I don't know what's wrong with me sometimes we're gonna take one more hit here and then we will call it there I said this was gonna be a short video just like every [ __ ] video even though this is different we're already at 12 minutes 30 seconds so let's take one more little late and go all right yeah I like this I like your heard $35 not bad for a cart considering all the other prices regards for half grams or something like that so yeah you guys are looking for a really good push cart that hits yeah that gives you that good Kush

guys for for watching oh if you guys are still here appreciate it very much you guys have a good one see it", "9ose8u5egtA": "welcome to Lexus world today let's light a J gather round and talk about the tale of Australian bastard cannabis all the info that's out there on it and whether you can obtain it today so in my popular freaks of cannabis mutations episode which I'll link to in the description I brought up the very unusual Australian bastard cannabis strain or ABC and promised you guys had cover it at length this was a stable strain not just the one-off mutation that grows in the wilderness of Australia and had stayed largely off the radar because to even tell it's cannabis you have to inspect it closely during flowering phase the earliest first-hand reports I could find of it being seen in the wild are from the 1980s and 90s locally in Australia ABC is known as cannabis Australis buying the buds mutant or mangy weed depending on who you talk to sorry if I'm pronouncing any of that wrong Australians but whatever you call it ABC doesn't resemble the cannabis most of us are used to first off the leaves look completely different as you see in these pictures they can't even be considered fan leaves also it grows more in a shrub like pattern instead of the typical Christmas tree pattern that cannabis tends to exhibit and also it's not very tall as a result average height is about two to three feet however ABC is definitely cannabis it gives off a cannabis like smell and females produced small buds with resin on them but the potency is pretty poor well below 5 percent THC nowadays Australians used to 10 to 20 percent THC tend to describe the high from purebred ABC as kind of crappy bit of a buzz and not worthwhile but supposedly if you scrape some ABC hash together you can get 21st century level baked from the plant how it came to exist in the wild as anybody's guess though one hypothesis is that it's the result of some strange cross-pollination with Australian hop bush which admittedly looks very similar but this is a total speculation I mean for all we know this is a cannabis land race that's exclusive to Australia and has been there for thousands of years we really just don't know in any case the truly outstanding characteristic of ABC aside from the stealthy appearance is its resistance to cold and frost supposedly it will even put up with direct snowfall within reason this and other bits of info lead me to believe that finding the strain out in the wild is easiest in the New South Wales areas of Australia as the mapa should imply several growers reported being well-known in the north eastern areas of New South Wales the next thing people want to know about ABC has the strain been bred before to get higher potency while keeping the weird look and what were the results well back in the late 90s Canadian activist mark Emery imported some cannabis Australis from Australia nicknamed at Australian bastard cannabis and covered it in his cannabis culture magazine not once but several times between 1999 and 2005 the articles were actually written by well-known activist Dana Larsen now the folks of cannabis culture didn't have a ton of ABC to seedbank with so they crossed it with flow and distributed the cross as extra freebies in North America calling it simply ABC crossed with flow flow being a very potent well known strain at the time the idea was maybe to create a strain that had the potency of the flow and the appearance of the AV see pretty straightforward but there was a major obstacle that cut off this vision in its tracks growers that got the first generation cross seeds and reported back found that ABC appearance was highly highly recessive so most of the breeding results ended up looking like ordinary flow cannabis only a small fraction looked like the ABC though it did appear that some of the toughness from the original ABC was passed on to the crosses if all that confused you please take a look at my breeding basics video for more information on breeding a link to it in the description as well either way there wasn't too much of this cross created and there wasn't much interest for it compared to regular old flow or pure ABC so that was the end of this improv breeding program but how can you obtain seeds of the original pure ABC today that's the biggest question people have been asking since the freaks of cannabis episode as far as I've been able to determine there is nobody today who has actively seed banking legitimate seeds of this strain and only a handful of low-key Australian regional growers exist who even play with it at all none of whom are interested in selling seeds in general so it's near impossible to get this out in Europe or in North America without travelling to Australia however if you're somehow well-connected with growers in eastern Australia especially those associated with the old medical growing community there there's not a bad chance you can find the seeds just by reaching out to people through their Twitter feeds or Facebook pages because at various points since the early 90s good volumes of seeds have been sold to many people in the area and there have also been odd sightings of ABC in the wild still either way any breeding program that can increase the potency of the strain while keeping the appearance would several generations of careful work to pull off and though you'd get out of it as they tough in the cold variety of cannabis frankly there's easier ways to achieve that so if you pursue ABC for breeding it may only be for the novelty and scarcity of it so there you go if you do want to hunt for the seeds you may want to start your hunt on a little-known Australian growers form called oz stoners cannabis community or any Australian cannabis Facebook pages also if you happen to be from Australia and have additional reliable info to provide on this please leave it in the

here in Arizona today we will be discussing the newest product to hit appearance my uncut pure earth oil distillate cartridge new person dedicated cartridges take the taste of songs you know the things that make the girlfriend and eyes water fortunately pure earnest has just come out in the confirmation uncut distillate cartridges today we will be discussing the newest product to hit secure eternal life what that means is they range from 80 to 95 percent THC ratio and they contain zero sauces but proclaimed by health or polyethylene what makes the parents project so unique is not only that it's uncut and solvent free but the ceramic wait the sense how to prevent naps and burnt taste some patients are familiar with not to mention if you check your local dispensaries for a limited time they will be incorporated it's 20 dollars batteries for free with the price of the 80 million project itself so you're not only going forward in the notice uncut oil to slip but you're getting a three pack and this ain't no ordinary battery ok this battery is a very strong but it may be small but don't let employees in order to use it you just attach to the cartridge itself like I did here you're going to remove this protective seal at the tip because it is top activated when I remove this it's ready to go very smooth one thing I notice about or that stands out the most with this purest product is the consistency that the product is like honey and what that means is when the consistency is so strong like that it really uses the hottest is hydrants for each seed so not only am I getting 800 milligrams of solvent-free uncut discipline I'm getting consistency with products and I'm getting th see what most patients look for we don't want the product that makes us feel sick after we smoked it we want the product that makes us feel uplifted that makes us feel motivate it makes us feel because healing you should never hurts and with Kiera [Music]", "ckXPW3eEDBQ": "killing guys what's going on we are back with another review today's review is going to be on pure earth boom we've already done a few of these but this one's gonna be Jack strong so whole new strain you already know we don't like the review double strains off this [ __ ] cuz that ain't cool I already smoke this one because it's already out you know took that with a friend the other night and we chilled and sure I can beat the [ __ ] out of that one so that won't in school but there's still enough to review so that's all that matters you already know the deal with the box if you haven't you can go look at one of my last ones nice little packaging in there I don't think uncut or pure earth ever says they're THC percent or anything like that far the more I know they do not pretty upset I went and bought a half gram of some sort God my hair is terrible bro I know that's why the hoodies on the hoodie staying on alright so I wouldn't buy it to half grams one pure earth which was this one I believe and then one more pure or one more half gram something else and I know for a fact that I bought two half grams and I only smoked one being this one right I cannot find for the life of me that second half gram I'm so puckered I lost a whole half gram for no reason there goes a video there goes the whole ass just hack for him to smoke you know I'm just upset I'm pretty salty so you know I guess I'll have to work right now I already bought another one for the next video I don't plan on losing battle and so that one's gonna be coming pretty soon cuz this one is almost out so you know we're gonna put out another one and then I don't think I have another card or some and then we'll put out another one for that you know Sanders you know flower video whatever maybe no we're just vibing whatever happens happens whatever gets posted gets post here you go uh well um so this right here let's just stop blabbering here this is I believe this is a sativa to be honest with you it does not tell me and I do not remember for the life of me um ya know and it doesn't say but if you guys do want to know and don't take my word for it it is a sativa or Jack Straw so you can go look at that yeah it's a five half milligram point five milligrams so um half gram obviously you know crazy I think I got this for 35 I believe but like the local one dispensary close to my school they do like they're just let's say Tuesday I got Tuesday carts where every half gram car like pure earth baby pen sublime [Music] Moxie all them they're all twenty-five bucks for a half gram no tax and that's like what tax included or whatever so 25 bucks and you get a whole ass hacker they're not have less but you get a half gram so that's a good deal maybe I'll start getting that so we can review some more but uh whoo all right let's get this on their way let's go ahead and take our first hits real quick I just want to say that this channels for 18 to 21 years old depending on your state you know your laws and all of that you already know the deal with all that out of the way let's go ahead and take a hit number one hit number one let me know if you guys are smoking anything down in the comments so cheers guys see so this is an 80/20 80/20 I don't know if it'll show right there it says the there's nice cloud produces a nice hit so it says Jack Straw right there and then it says 8020 so 80% sativa and 20% indica so there you go that just proves my point even more I could have said that earlier but I'm stupid so no I didn't yeah so if you want to you know put all you if you have a multiple pure earth cards which is nice and you set them down you can tell which ones which just based off of the glass which is pretty stupid cool so obviously I just took a first hit and usually off of one hit I feel like a slight highlight like usually not like super massive but it's enough to just feel you're high you know and with the pure earth I feel like I'm always having to hit it again multiple times after that in order to even get some sort of buzz like I just took a decent head and I don't feel too much at all so we'll try to take another one here we'll see what happens the thing with this cart though it's obviously it's Jack Straw so it's gonna take it's kind of gonna have like a coach taste because doesn't have any flavor specifically he's Turkish added to it or anything like that but it tastes really good oddly it doesn't taste like your normal cush there's a subtle soul into it but like to me it tastes kind of like cotton candy it's it's really weird so I don't know hydration brain it's soda I'm not a fan you know I don't like drinking too much soda but sometimes it's good you know usually water-ski water-ski guys but yes so this is to be honest with you even in my last few videos I've liked the pira's but I was never really like honest honest about him I kind of feel this way about all of them you know is I just I don't think they're that potent I don't think they're that great I mean I think they're good carts that you're definitely better than anything you can get off the street or anything like that for your average like once every few days it's kind of thing if you're that kind of smoker I definitely think this will work you know pure earth but if you're like a constant hitter like like I am or some of my friends are anything like that you know I don't think it's the ideal choice maybe they're indicas might be better like for like a stress reliever I I guess I will say with this I do feel kinda just like relieved I don't feel like higher up lifted so maybe that's where I'm coming from maybe I'm trying to trying to base my high off how like good I feel like all that because it is a sativa but I could be just kind of talking in my ass about that you know cuz I I do feel [ __ ] relaxed to [ __ ] you know so if that's what you're looking for maybe impure Earth's might be the ones for you they don't maybe they don't just get you that that next level higher they just gets you to the life by about you and that's kind of what I do feel like doing so so maybe that's the whole point if it is then come be honest and they're fine do a good job so yeah let's do another here's the wax I mean there's not much left to see but you can kind of see it there pretty like nice color very thick doesn't move much I did I like the quality of the wax le so that's very nice oh I wanted to say you guys shout out to all of y'all for the support well I I think as of the time I'm recording this right now about 92 subs which is [ __ ] massive I think I'd get like 20 because I'm a knowing little [ __ ] but that's cool as [ __ ] so thank you guys y'all or y'all are awesome y'all make me keep let it go so that's cool so I think for a hundred subscribers we'll do like like a whole half gram in one sitting or something like that or maybe like a 10 the 5 gram joint or something I don't I'm just kind of like brainstorming if you have any ideas let me know the only idea gotten from somebody who has the half gram which that is a pretty [ __ ] dope idea I will do that no matter what at one point so that's always coming so subscribe for that but yeah ultimately I just wanna say you guys have been my kill on it I think one video has like 660 views or something like that which is really weird one view video has like a couple hundred a few of them have a couple hundred some still have less than 100 so I'm gonna have like in the hundreds two hundred it's pretty awesome it's cool like look through and see all the comments and like see you still talk and still competent and all that and if y'all would comment in that is awesome I love seeing the comments so hello guys I guess we're just gonna tape down let's do like before yes and the resourceful cheese obviously I am high now this was for this was number four so keep that in mind I was probably high round number two or three probably two three pride - pride - after that second hit I probably got elected going and had a decent high hydration break but once I hit three I think you I think at three for a heavy smoker because I consider myself I'll have these smoked group cards I think at three that would probably got me pretty high there and I'm at four right now so I'm definitely very high see now I like the card bro I have very mixed emotions about this car I uh I just don't know I don't know you guys are just gonna have to smoke me yourselves and try it so if y'all are at a dispensary and they have pure earth go ahead and try one they're not that expensive they should be hopefully opening yeah shoot a try tried there drank straw try dirty Durban poison I think that's when we reviewed if I'm not mistaken I could be wrong but go and look at those videos see what you see what I said about um see thanks I was now correct to you or wrong here all that but uh with that with all that done that's the end of the video you want to say you guys are awesome again", "YT9ErA4iNMM": "I didn't do a video of an either cropping there you go you can see all the carnage more carnage there can't see it very well in the light but there you go we have this one humongous plant here left to go this camera isn't gonna catch us very well in this light but I'll have a go anyway you see she's really ready to come down there's always really nice autumnal colors you can see all the purples and the leaves huge [ __ ] coders what I will do though is I will do a video once I've taken down the largest cola I'll take a couple of big coders down I'll do a video of that so you can get some idea of the size okay there you go"}
