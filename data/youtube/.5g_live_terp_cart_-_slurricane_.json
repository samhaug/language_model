{"VqRXAxmpl-o": "what is going on welcome back to the I smoke Channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene this is episode 5 in our 2020 strain review series this week featuring a strain we like to call slur Akane this is a purple punch cross and it is absolutely fantastic on paper we're gonna try it out let you know what I think of it right now here on the ice smoke channel join me as we talk about the background of the Slovak own cannabis strain so this strain has been bred by in-house genetics dos Eidos crossed with purple punch is the cross that results in the slur akane it is not available as feminized seeds according to the seed find a website and people's reports of it I've read some reviews of it online seem to love this strain as an afternoon even in smoke very indica dominant apparently there's some berry notes that are going to come through as well this is actually in a biodegradable bag which you don't see all the time so it's not in a glass jar but the bag is biodegradable so we're not going to complain there I want a big up right own extracts made some extract out of this but not before I've got to grab a little bit just to make sure that I could feature it in the review video so thank you very much my purple punch and dosa dose I am NOT the biggest fan of dos DOS it looks amazing 10 out of 10 bag appeal and people seem to like it but not my favorite strain purple punch on the other hand I absolutely love Larry og of crossed with granddaddy purple I think it is and that is a phenomenal strain granddaddy purple you literally taste them purple hoping that some of that does carry down into this slower cane I don't know anything about the growing method I don't even know who the grower of this one is really for this channel let's talk about the appearance of this cannabis stroke getting this out of its bag then been a long time since I had weed in a plastic bag I will tell you that usually we're talking glass jars sometimes my lower packs but I like to biodegrade bonus the first thing to mention is it is absolutely caked in trichomes it looks frosty and it's frosty as you like really really strong tricone coverage the buds aren't actually what I expected them to look like and I think that might be something to do with the grow itself the reason being if this is an indica dominant strain so I wouldn't expect these small sativa looking lugs or smaller buds this and this was run into extract which is why there's still bits of stalk it doesn't matter as much when you're extracting it and running it through a Pho other than the bits of stalk I think that the coloration and trichome coverage on this one's wicked it's just the look of these buds sort of suggests that something might have gone wrong during the growing cycle maybe a lot left on when it should have been or come on when it shouldn't have done something like that actually looks a lot like weed you pick up in Amsterdam and I actually did ask the guy was low is this import and is that nice grown in the UK I see this all the time when I go to them this is like haze it's like what the standard damn haze would look like right nuclear green it's got a real skunky look to it but then just full of frost frosty skunky look to it pistols are a muted brown color not even very visible actually looks alright not ten out of ten by any stretch of the imagination not the best looking but still got a nice look to it just hasn't developed in the way I would have expected let's talk about the smell of this lower cane so the online information when you look across multiple website it says creamy OG with an undertone of tropical blueberries now when I'm smelling this slur Akane and particularly this batch of it I'm not sure the tropical is coming through so much it's definitely got a creaminess to it and there it is you've got the gasp of the og and then just a hint of that that blueberry sort of or berry not even blueberries just berry just a sort of fruity mix hint right at the end of the inhalation eat or breathe it nice and deep to try and get that not super smeller like some weight I've opened a bag in a bit like whoa throwing smell up my nostrils like this is not the same even sort of really squeezing it it's not got a lot so that's her potential that is coming out and again put that down to this particular batch don't put it down to the strain itself I'm sure there's some Terp heavy slower cane out there on paper dicey does cross with purple punch sounds great but I do think that don't see those crosses can be a bit watery I don't know about you guys let me know what you think of this in the comments but I really don't like dough lotto and actually smell wise the slower cane isn't really overwhelming we-we've smell so I wonder whether that's gonna translate into the taste speaking of taste let us move on and talk about the taste of the slower cane cannabis strain two methods of consumption for the slower king my trusty chongs Widowmaker bun my mighty vaporizer were smoking it and vaping it should give me a good idea of the flavor that this bud has to offer let's just break some of these stalks out because every single little bud has got a little Stoke attest I don't want to be smoking there this smells like an OG mixed with parma violets or lavender mmm it's really nice actually it's not strong and it's not super apparent in your nostrils this isn't what I would deem offensive smelling cannabis if you don't like weed and someone had this in their pocket you might not even realize but whipping it nice and closely you do tend to get that creamy OG violet pom and violet stroke allowing the types meal we're gonna smoke some we're gonna avoid some we're gonna see how it treats us in this section let's just get everything ready let's prepare our vaporizer and then that way I can turn it on because it's gonna take a couple of minutes and what that's heating up we're going to smoke the bong and I'll see you Oh other side Cheers [Music] that went down really smoothly a lot smoother than I was actually secretly expecting it to go down I did think having a look at the appearance and smell of it that it might not have been the smoothest smoke but that shows me that appearance and smell is not everything that went down super smoothly so much so that we're gonna squeeze another one in and I'm we got to the vaporizers ready Oh got a little bit of time my dad would do it join me for this and I'll see you all on the other side [Music] super smooth smoked cool doesn't really make me need to cough there's not much flavor to it that's what it's lacking in the Turks in the vaporizer it's got kind of an old-school og that's really interesting I had that taste for years what is that it's got kind of like a traditional we taste in the Veda just kind of tastes like like Jim realized cannabis taste but in a nice way I mean I like the flavor of cannabis in general so I'm typing I'm feeling it trying to pick out and see whether that any of that violet or the Parma violets or like the lavender final it's the color not a flavor Tyler what you saying I'm talking about lavender palm of violets is the sweet what flavor it out I'm trying to get that now through the vapor but I can't detect it so much yeah this one hasn't got a lot of Terps in its not reached it's sort of Terp potential and I don't know whether this is me having been fortunate enough to be smoking nothing but no-till for the past I don't know three or four months so I've really gotten a full flavor of potential of the weed I've been smoking I'm not getting that from this so much he still tastes clean that's the really good thing about it it just doesn't taste like much you know I mean and this could well be part of this lower cane flavor so what I want to know from you in the comments if you've tried it because I get wateriness from dalat oh right don't lotto don't doze Crosby gelato this is dosed doze across with purple punch tastes a bit like watered-down purple punch you know I mean maybe it's the dosa doze that I'm not enjoying let's talk about the effects of this slower Akane as I talk to you now and as I grind up for another bomb the effects are starting to kick in this is an indica dominant body lead hi it's gonna relax you it's gonna make you feel good and I'm starting to feel that right about now actually yeah I'm feeling a nice sort of body lead but also slightly cerebral like just nice this just washing over my body and a calm just washing over my mind actually in fact kind of notice in different sounds in the air a bit more definitely kind of it's an enjoyable smoke right from how this high starting to kick in this is the first time I've ever smoked it never smoke slower came before I haven't smoked any in the build-up to this review just read about it I've got no resistance to this profile so it should hit me quite hard for what it is as opposed to think I've been smoking for a week now that being said I'm feeling a niceness just wash over me a mildness a kind of relaxation even in smoke don't turn off and we're done with you and I like to smoke invite one after the other cuz it gives me kind of a sense of you kind of feel it as your vape and you feel the high creeping in if you just vape on its own you don't really feel it creeping in with if you get bummed first and then hit the vaporizer whoosh you get a nice little nice little right maybe sort of a mild tiredness washing over me at this point it's considering it is still or it's just about the afternoon when I'm filming this feeling very very chilled out could definitely sit and watch TV or play some video games and it's a nice high you know it's got that kind of and I guess this comes from the granddaddy purple side of the lineage that kind of like hug hi where you kind of feel like like a warm hug do you not I mean it's a really nice really nice sort of feeling I think it goes all the way back to the Afghan strains and then into things like lavender into granddaddy purple through that and then through the slower okay so yeah overall effects wise I'm really happy with this higher it's a nice distinguishable high from other highs you know it doesn't just feel samey it doesn't just feel like I'm up or I'm really there's a lot to it it's complex you know and I like that about it that about covers the effects unless something's up so today we've been enjoying the slower cane at cannabis Train not sure on the grower of this one but I must say is not the not scored top marks from me on this occasion despite the appearance of it being a little bit smaller and the smell of it being a little bit less chirpy than I was expecting the high of it was still really really nice now flavor-wise a little bit on the wall to reside and I'm wondering whether that's such an egg thing that those dos talk to me about dicing those in the comments come on I want to hear from you don't heed those experts effects wise I love the effect of this one nice warm relaxed body lid - a nice and chill in my mind as well just gonna smoke this bong join me for this one and I'll see you all on the other side [Music] yeah just like watery type you know it could be like literally part of it interest in it stuff I like it but it's not getting top marks because of a

on guys my name is Jeff Austin is popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe got a lot of different videos on the left and today we're gonna be talking about this little guy this is a live resin cartridge the strain is purple haze and it's from Prime Wellness this is the craziest card I've ever seen you guys it is not like a normal live resin cartridge when I posted this on my snapchat last night there was a lot of confusion from people that didn't know exactly what this is this is a live present our trajactory at this is pure live resin when you look close up to it you can actually see little PACA rocks in there like little diamonds floating around it's basically like the concentrate sugar in a cartridge like nice flavorful intense clouds every time it really tastes like a DAB and it also feels like it's AB you do not need to keep cheeping on this like you do some cartridges it goes a long way since the little rocks in there are so small they should be able to just be consumed right through those coils there might be a little bit left over smoking on my Paquito from cloud products I really like this battery it's a magnetic over ring bottom so you just screw a little overhang into your battery plug it in and you hit it I really just like how small and discreet it is I've had a lot of lab resin cartridges before that say liquid lab resin on it and it's like actually liquid it looks like the same consistency as a normal car but this is totally different this is like something I've never had before when it comes to price it wasn't too bad now when you buy a cartridge no matter what it's gonna be expensive when you're buying it legally to restore there's just a hefty price on in my state cards go for forty to seventy dollars and this one was fifty five so it's actually right in the middle of price I know a lot of people are like shocked at how much I pay for weed sometimes it is extensive but honestly like you have to pay for freedom and I'm an estate that just recently introduced the medical bill so the fact that I'm allowed to legally buy this and consume it like I'll pay the extra money I'm happy to help you'll [ __ ] for those of you who don't know what live resin is it's basically just a concentrate that has an extremely high terpene profile the way that it get to that terpene profile is from the way the plant is cured typically when weed is grown they cut it then they cure it in a room and then let it dry and then they process it with live resin once it's cut they instantly freeze it then that fresh version product gets processed and turned into live resin since the weeds frozen the turkeying profiles are way higher think about freezing a banana if you kept it frozen it wouldn't ripen in the freezer it would stay how it is when you froze it so in that drying and curing process there is some flavor lost in cannabis should still taste good but it just tastes better with live resin because it has all the terpenes yet try different battery freshen unboxing got a break it you know this is the poquito push it's basically the big brother of the poquito definitely larger but what's cool about this one it probably conceals your cartridge so there it's like what is this portable charger what the [ __ ] no it's my cartridge if you can watch my videos for a while you know I love my Terps which is why I'll address is definitely my favorite form of concentrate I just love the flavor you get it really can't be lied resin except if you're talking rosin which is super crazy I've heard of some people doing like rosin karts but they are not cheap and like I wouldn't even consider buying one at the price that they are but these lab resin karts are the [ __ ] move I really like how convenient cartridges are which is why I still buy them but I have to make sure they're high quality ones and I just wish that there was a higher standard for cartridges as a whole like I don't get why it's that rare for me to find sugar and a cartridge like I feel like that should be somewhat easy and common of people to do like ethos incarnate oh yeah the beginners that I didn't order crazy how many people were telling me to like take back this cartridge and like this isn't a normal cartridge and that should be concerned as I'm describing it as a languorous and cartridge I feel like a lot of people just thought it was distillate and honestly guys if your discipline cartridge looks like this do not smoke black resin can have a file you look to it but this look and not like they're two totally different concentrates honestly guys just to warn you no matter what company or buying it from no matter what brand it is if you're buying it this little cartridge it's probably shitty even if it's fire like every company I've ever heard of puts their bottom shelf product in their distillate no matter what it's going to be there trim and they're like worst looking nuts the reason for that is all this tool it looks the same when it process the matter what the butt looks like it's clear and tastes like nothing so then companies add terpenes if you're lucky to the distillate to make it taste better for your enjoyment sometimes they don't even have real turf there's so many random ghetto [ __ ] that's been added into cartridges and that's why all these people are dying because of shitty black-market cartridges like dude these hits are so amazing it tastes so good I hate to be the person to say that even the most top-shelf brands of distillate are shitty but ultimately they are even when I'm smoking into the cartridge I know it's the company's bottom to your product if they added into Italy it just has to be there's no way around it every company has trim every company has dirt product that they have and the company's mentality because they're trying to make money is let's turn it into distillate they like actually hit you in the chest like a bat and you have to really think of breath like and it hits you definitely going through this cart look at a little diamonds whoo if you ever get the opportunity to get ladders and cartridges that actually have some live resin in it go for it there's actually like a lot of liquid ladders and cartridges but this is even better this is like a whole nother step ahead I would love that this became the new standard for cartridges just because it's not only a pleasurable experience for like the casual smoker that likes cartridges but it's also an enjoyable experience for the avid smoker that since all the time because I know a lot of people that just like won't even hit cartridges because they just don't feel like they get them high the people that have known that there was something wrong with these that were just like no I'm not even hitting that because so many people have had shitty cartridges they hand me a cartridge and they're like yeah what do you think and it's just moving faster than a lava lamp and they're just like bro what did what are you doing or you just see the tank big box and they're like no it's legit my boy told me I'm like yeah you hit that over there I'll follow the ambulance for you if you got something out in this video hope you guys are smoking with net let me know what videos you want to see in the future make sure you follow me on

to lose the part you know about me hanging out with a thousand kids you know but you still want to be old but you still got to be there that's the way it goes who goes to teaming in a hybrid for the most part is a mixture of both but in this instance you do have indica dominant hybrids and then you do have sativa dominant hybrids or you may just have a hybrid which is a equal consistency of both but in this instance it's it's a hybrid mixed with an indica so that's why it's an indica base hybrid yes sir it is called the slugger can I just did the last video on dosey doe so you know those who throw is a very high strain of cookies um the purple punch purple punch would be the hybrid of it - - where you add it so you add an indica base which is the which is the dosey doe and then you add in a hybrid part of it which is um which is the purple punch so together combined it makes the indica base hybrid but yeah man you've seen the multi colors on it man the colors is crazy colors on his crazy got a little bit of green you got some purple you got some orange you know I'm pretty sure when i crack it open a little pilot the same way - but yes sir 36 percent or y'all runs out there go

lit it up I hit like a champion who and boy did I go down whoo yo this one is crazy like you taste the you taste it though I mean it hit hard like the dosey doe but you also taste the purple punch was have like that blueberry flavor to it too I mean like it's it's crazy to so when I hit it almost died on cam so I couldn't show you all that cuz I can't have y'all and he called me the baby lungs and

this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign", "P38oQYGyOZ8": "[Music] Queen today I'm coming to you with a spring review and today's frame is called slur Akane yes slur Akane sir slur Akane is indica leaning but it's actually 50/50 so it's a sativa as it is indica but most people say it's more indica dominant and you'll find that on different strains so it's a beautiful one I picked this up in my local dispensary Seoul flower and Sun City Arizona really good or just one I mean really gorgeous and what I will say about slurring is that I it's the most gorgeous I Romek smell I've ever smelled as for when we're talking about the world of weed this is my favorite as far as you know the aroma I just when I wouldn't I went to the dispensary and they let you you know they let you smell them or whatever or good ones should I was like wow this is weird cuz it this smells so good that if it they had this in incense form or something like that I would burn this all the time to me it does not even smell like weed I mean this is one it smells so good as far as aromas go you're going to get I get a lot of tropical very fruity overtones coming from this I also get it's not there's just a tiny bit of earth not a lot but it's very tropical and sweet as far as flavors go you're gonna get those same play flavors pretty much spicy let's add spicy to that because I do get that at the back but when I'm you're smelling it it's so like just it's very clean to me aroma but again slur Akane it is indica dominant tipsy levels are anywhere from twenty well eighteen to twenty eight percent which is extremely high I don't know exactly what was on here as far as THC levels sometimes they put them on here let's see if I can get it it wasn't printed on here actually or if it is it's gone but twenty eighteen to twenty eight percent it's extremely high again the aroma I talked about the Roman the taste it's a beautiful one I do get the spicy um more so than some strains that I've had but it's not that spicy that you can't handle it's just a nice little nice little burn that kind of Peters away it doesn't it doesn't linger like you know something that you would eat it it's gonna burn and be spicy it's not like that you get it at the back of your throat and it just lingers a little bit and then it just kind of fades away and sometimes I get these really nice clouds nice vapor clouds with different strains and this is one that really gives me a nice taper you guys have seen some of the videos sometimes it really doesn't look like anything that's coming out but this one huh okay so medical benefits this is abd ADHD migraines and headaches chronic pain arthritis I saw PTSD Oh chronic fatigue is one because it's gonna knock you out I can say what you're going to notice with this rain cerebral high is off the chain this is gonna settle in in a minute I'm like I feel like I'm talking underwater right now body high like a really intense body high you're gonna get you're gonna be you're for you're gonna get that definitely for me there's decadent decadent couch lock for this one but it's a good one this isn't one that I would smoke all the time because the THC levels are pretty high but this is one that the high was like really really good it was and you guys know normally I do high CBD low THC strains I think this is number four I'm gonna just turn it off this is so beautiful I just you kind of want to keep on puffing but no typically I do high CBD low THC strains but since I've been doing these strain reviews I don't limit the THC levels and so my tolerance level is still really low so what affects me one way may not affect you the same way but I can't say and now I'm losing much thought and I don't I don't know what I'm talking about that I try these high THC level strains so they may affect you differently because if you've been smoking longer than I have I haven't been smoking long at all they may affect you differently even though I use we medical cannabis for medical reasons rheumatoid arthritis and that's initially how I began this whole thing and my focus all was always on you know most people don't want to get high they want to they want to be healed kind of thing and I still agree with that but what I find as I smoked more especially the higher strains I have this better appreciation for the high and before it was more so you know it is taking the pain away away so now I appreciate the highs there are some strains I will never smoke again because the highs were just ridiculous and then there's this one that I really like and [Music] when there are moments when I need that feeling anything you feeling of euphoria whether I'm in pain or not because now it's nobody's business and who cares you just want to feel good if that's this is what I'm going to because it's so nice and I think I'm talking slow it's really really nice and the hi to me sometimes is like you're sitting there you're sitting there and somebody hit you over the head with a sledgehammer hi and then you have this one which really eases you into it and doesn't take you too fast so like now I'm like you know just just chill this isn't one that's gonna make you talkative so this isn't one I was smoking go hang out with somebody like a group of people this is one that I was smoking hang out with a friend and just really chill you know and if you talk you talk if you don't you don't you know but there better be pizza somewhere so Larry Kane it is very nice 50:50 sativa and indica pretty high THC levels but is so cute I mean it's a beautiful beautiful smoke like just amazing smoke and I'm a huge fan and I actually I think I've done this this is my third time because there were some smaller little notes in here oh no this is my second time because I did it once and I had done a sentence I'm done cuz I would just you know wax poetically about this damn straight because I'm hot right now so I'm out thank you guys for watching I appreciate you guys all the comments and the lights and the shear and all that thank you [Music]", "n7cP6YWO_nc": "Hey guys, Nick with Precision here and\ntoday I'm gonna teach you a brief overview on how to make every extract\nunder the sun. So what I want to start off talking about is live resin and why\nlive resin is so relevant in the market and why you guys hear this this term\nbeing thrown around rather commonly. So live resin, the entire process really,\ntakes into account harvesting the plant while it's still technically \"alive\". So\nyou're harvesting the plant, you're not drying the plant, and what you're\nactually doing is taking those flowers and putting them into a vacuum type food\nsaver device and freezing them right away. So you can imagine like harvesting\nfresh blueberries or strawberries obviously you want to pick at the peak\nof ripeness, so that you have the maximum amount of terpenes, the maximum amount of smell, flavor and all the positive attributes of that plant. And you're\nactually freezing that in time by putting it into a freezer once you put\nit into the vacuum bag. Now it's very common for some people to deep freeze\nthat could be all the way down to -40C or -80C. I would say most commonly\nit's somewhere between -10C and -40C, so once we have this\nmaterial harvested and we have it frozen in vacuum bags - ultimately what we're\ngoing to do is we're going to extract it and we're going to extract it with\nhydrocarbons. The reason that we use hydrocarbons is because it's a very\ngentle process. The process of using hydrocarbons will actually take those\ncannabinoids and those terpenes out without disturbing a lot of the other\nplant-based matrices that are in there, and our result ultimately is a extract\nthat is very, very close to the native plant. So when you smell the extract of\nthe plant that we've extracted via a live resin process what will happen is\nyou'll actually smell the original orientation of that plant, it you'll have\nthose original flavors and they'll be extremely robust, extremely profound in\nthe way that you're actually smelling and almost tasting it when you consume\nthe product. Now the best analogy is if we keep that\nfreshness preserved we eliminate the oxidation, the degradation, and all the\nthings that can kind of take that \"fresh fruit\" so to speak or that \"fresh cannabis\"\nand turn it into rotten cannabis so to speak or rotten fruit. And that's\noxidation, that's degradation from the environment that could be disruption or\ndegradation from high temperature solvents. So with live resin were always\nfocused on preserving that natural state of the plant. We're focused on freezing\nthat biomass right away, and we're focused on ultimately extracting it at\nvery cold temperatures to retain our terpenes, to extract the cannabinoids in\na very gentle fashion, and ultimately to have a highly, highly desired end product\nthat's artisanal and a vast majority of consumers enjoy in terms of theirs their\nsatisfaction of consumption as well as their ability to just actually taste and\nsmell the product once it's been on the shelf for a while. So that's just an\noverview on live resin and the next thing I'd really like to talk about and\ngive you guys an overview on is shatter. So you may have seen shatter in the\nretail dispensaries and things like that and ultimately with shatter we're trying\nto get that end product from a sort of a plant-based entrapment of those\ncannabinoids and those terpenes to a glass-like finish. So it's very common at\nroom temperature for shatter you hit it and it'll shatter almost like a piece of\nglass. To get that consistency there's certain aspects of extraction, certain\nthings that you want to deal with. Shatter first and foremost is always\nmade with hydrocarbon, and the preparation of the biomass is almost\nalways under every circumstance dried very, very, very, very well almost to a\nfive percent or lower humidity. We want to avoid a lot of that water that would\nbe pulled out with the solvent, and we ultimately want to extract that product\nat a cold temperature in order to avoid a lot of the lipids and fat profiles\nthat you might create by extracting with a warmer temperature solvent. Hydrocarbon is obviously ideal for this because not only can we extract with hydrocarbon\ncold but it's hydrophobic so that the water is going to be separated very\neasily from the hydrocarbon, but in addition to that it's going to extract\nthat cannabinoid profile and it'll extract those terpenes with leaving\nbehind,  because of the cold temperature, a lot of those fats, waxes, and other\nadulterants that we don't want in our end product. So when making shatter are\nultimately extracting the dry biomass with the cold solvent we're going to\ntake that to a finishing process which is called vacuum oven purging. So once we\nhave our shatter and we want to vacuum oven purge it, what we do is we we spread\nthis out on vacuum oven trays and we go into a very low vacuum, very deep vacuum\nwith a mild temperature increase from atmospheric. So a temperature increase\ndepending on methodologies it ranges vary widely depending an operator but it\ncould be anywhere from 75 Fahrenheit to will say 105 degrees Fahrenheit would be\na common operational range, and we're always trying to get to a very deep\nvacuum we're talking about 28-29 inches of mercury - very, very deep in terms of\nbeing able to purge out those residual solvents. So not only do we have a\nsolvent free product but purging out the residual solvents and the terpenes is\nalso going to take away some of that some of that added viscosity and\nreally get that product to the point where it's like a glass-like consistency.\nAnd we commonly call those as they're coming out of the oven \"slabs\", sometimes\nthey look like Swiss cheese, sometimes they'll they'll be you know a perfect\nslab of glass, sometimes they'll flip over. And it can vary between a\ncomplete glass-like type consistency and it can also vary to you know sort of\nlike Jolly Rancher or warm Jolly Rancher type consistency - but the good part about\nthis process is to make shatter using hydrocarbon you can generally\nstill make a very good end product on biomass that's been properly dried\nproperly preserved even though it does have maybe a little bit of degradation\nit does have a little bit of oxidation of the cannabinoids and loss of the\nterpenes it's okay because you can still make a very very credible saleable\nproduct that's widely consumed in the form of shatter. And optimizing that\nprocess as a way that you can create a lot of revenue for your\nextraction company. So the next thing that I'd like to talk about is diamonds.\nTerp sauce. There's all sorts of crazy names, \"the sauce\" -  that they coined for\nthis type of extract and really what we're after on this type of extract is\nterpene preservation. So it starts off very much like a live resin\nprocess in the fact that we're harvesting these these buds or these\nflowers in a live state, we're freezing them, and we're ultimately preserving\nthose terpenes. Because terpenes are very volatile compounds in general. Too much\nheat they evaporate and they get degraded by heat, they get degraded by processes, they\nget degraded by solvent - so we want to use a very light solvent, like a light\nhydrocarbon, and in this case mostly moving towards a propane dominant blend. Propane has a much lower boiling point which means it's much more volatile in\nterms of removing it from the end product - easier to remove from the end\nproduct is another way to word that. So ultimately extracting this\nlive resin like prepared biomass with a propane dominant or a lighter\nhydrocarbon dominant blend at low temperatures and ultimately what we end\nup with is we end up with this extract that really becomes a sort of miscella of the cannabinoids but also a very amount high amount of terpene\ncontent. And as I stated before the terpenes are quite volatile and any sort\nof heat, any sort of degradation, even just being an atmosphere for too long\ncan degrade those terpenes. So imagine this kind of cannabinoid and terpenes\nsludge coming out of the machine because we've preserved them up to that point.\nImmediately usually what's done with sauce and live resin is you're taking\nthe terpenes and generally spinning them off in a classified centrifuge. The\nreason we use the classified centrifuge is because there's still a little bit of\nsolvent in there, so we just want to be cautious, but what that ultimately does\nis it spins off the terpenes and it separates a terpene layer from the\ncannabinoid layer. You separate those two now there's a variety of different\nproduction processes that go back into this. In some cases if you're if you're\ndoing crystallization you can leave a little bit of solvent in there and you\ncan ultimately recrystallize the THC-a through a supersaturation method.\nYou can ultimately take the cannabinoids off from that terpene fraction and\ndecarboxylate the cannabinoids and then add the terpenes back in - and that's how\nyou make live resin pens. So for example you know once that decarboxylated\ncannabinoid profile is there you take your original terpenes blend them back\nin and it's going to give you the viscosity in order for the pen or the\nvape cartridge to be able to uptake and atomized that extract. And make, again\nthis is an extract that is absolutely in line with the original orientation of\nthe plant, the original smells, flavors terpenes, and the uniqueness. It's very\ncool because you have such variety within these plants and to capture the\nnative essence of that plant and to reconstitute it and to several\nconsumable forms is a massive value add for an extraction business. And if you\nlook at some of the best extraction companies in the world that do this, this\nis exactly what they do and this is exactly how they do it. So on the flip\nside of what we've spoken about here which has mainly been artisanal\ntype extracts and hydrocarbon extracts. Let's talk about crude oil, let's talk\nabout distillate, let's talk about the high-value type extracts. So crude oil is\nexactly what it sounds if you think about crude oil coming out of the ground\nin like petrochemicals or something like that.\nIt's an oil that has a lot of adulterants in it. It needs a lot of\nrefinement. It needs to go through further processes in order to be\nconsumable or in a consumable form. So what we're looking for with crude oil\non an extraction is really any type of biomass but preferred dried biomass\nlow-grade biomass that can be purchased cheap and ultimately refined into\nsomething of high value. So if we've got for example you know a thousand pounds\nof biomass sitting it's been sitting for six months, we're not going to be able to\nmake really a credible shatter product out of that, we're not going to be able\nto make a credible live resin, definitely not going to be able to make any sort of\nhigh terpene extract or anything out of that. But what we can do is we can\nmaximize the extraction of the cannabinoids out of that biomass with a generally\nwarmer solvent - of course there's ways that you can do it with a cold solvent.\nAnd this can be done with hydrocarbon or ethanol. This is where ethanol becomes\nreally applicable it becomes really easy it becomes really user friendly and\ncost-conscious. And this is where you can still use hydrocarbon but not as\nefficient of a method as ethanol for bulk crude oil. So what we actually do is\nwe take our biomass we load it in and we'll saturate it with ethanol for\na given amount of time. Ultimately we take that miscella stream is what we\ncall it which is the cannabinoids and all the other stuff that comes out of\nthe plant along with the solvent and we evaporate that solvent off. Once that\nsolvents evaporated off ultimately we have our crude oil. Now this crude oil\nhas got all sorts of chlorophyll and whatever came along with the plant and\nany sort of adulterants in there. Generally it'll have a lot of fats, waxes,\nand lipids in there that generally come out of the plant in extraction. So\nthere's a variety of refinement processes. One of the most common\nprocesses to refine is to get to distillate and that's what I'd like to\nchat about next. So let's talk about guys how that distillate actually gets made.\nNow distillate is a process that's made through distillation so quite commonly\nor to break it down in really simple terms if you're putting a pot of water\non the stove and ultimately that water is boiling and turning into vapor - \nthat's a process of distillation. That water is being distilled into the\natmosphere in the form of vapors. So that's exactly what we're trying to do\nwith the cannabinoids in the crude oil. We're actually trying to take those\ncannabinoids, we're trying to vaporize them, and ultimately we're going to\nrecollect them in a more concentrated form. But before we can distill there's\nseveral other things we need to do. We need to make sure that there's no\nadulterants in that distillate or in that crude oil that are going to inhibit\nmaking the distillate. So those things can be waxes, they can be chlorophylls,\nthey can be fats, lipids, all sorts of weird stuff that can come over in a very\nrough crude extraction. The way that we refine that is we commonly\nuse winterization processes, we also commonly use fine filtration, there's\nguys that use what are called adsorbent - which could be diatomaceous earth or\nactivated carbons in order to clean up some of these undesirables from this\ncrude oil in order to make it into distillate. But ultimately once it's\npassed through a distillation process it's normally used a what's called a\nfractional distillation, or a wiped film distillation process when you're at\nscale. We're taking those cannabinoids and we're evaporating them and we're re-concentrating them. So what happens is we take this very, very poor quality\nbiomass, turn it into a really rough crude oil, but ultimately extract the\nwe'll call it \"the goodies\" - but the cannabinoids out of that crude oil and\nconcentrate them in a very refined format. That can be remixed in and\nreconstituted into several different products. This process is awesome because it can literally take any grade of biomass and turn it into a shelf-stable,\nreplicatable, scalable, repeatable product that has a consistency across the board\nfor end-users expectations. For example, you get Pepsi every time it tastes like\nPepsi every time you don't want it to taste like Coke one time or taste like\nyou know RC Cola the next time. You want consistency and a repeatable fashion for\nwhich to make your product. So last product that I want to talk about is\nisolates and isolates are made from actually in almost all cases distillate.\nSo we're taking this crude oil remember as we spoke about with distillate,\nrefining it into a distilled product. So we have this distilled product and the\npotency of that can be anywhere from say a little very low-end 75 percent on the very high-end 95 percent - but it's not 100% pure. And what\nwe're gonna do with that distillate is we're actually going to go through a\nsecondary refinement process called crystallization, isolation of\nthese individual cannabinoids. So each one of these cannabinoids has a\nmolecular structure and based upon what that molecular structure looks like we\ncan come up with ideal ways to actually crystallize and crash out of solution\nthese individual molecules. This is a very common process in chemistry. It's\nused very widely and it's ultimately how CBD isolate is made, it's ultimately how\nTHCA diamonds are made, it's a process of crystallization. So how we do that is\nwe use a selective solvent the selective solvent most often used is hydrocarbon.\nVery often it's either butane or pentane in order to make these isolates.\nAnd what happens is you actually take your distillate and you mix it into\neither the pentane or the butane if it's THCA depending on what you're trying to\ndo and you have your distillate or your fine cannabinoids back in matrices at\nthat point it's back in that now that miscella of hydrocarbon and\ncannabinoids. And what happens is over time and over a temperature ramp spike\ncurve and over a slow period of time these cannabinoids will start\nto actually crystallize. And they'll form one little crystal and it will grow upon\nitself. As we reduce the saturation of the solvent they actually fall out of\nsolution. So what will happen is you'll almost see like rock candy or crystal-like formation growing. Once those crystals are fully formed they can be\nharvested and once you optimize this process you actually have nearly 100%\npurity on any given compound. Now there can be adulterants you know that gets\nstuck on the crystals that need to be washed off but in ideal state this is\nsomething that you can refine up to say a good benchmark is 99 to 99.5 percent\nif you're a really good chemist you can get it up close to 99.7 to 99.9. This is where that last little bits very, very\nhard to get, but there is ways to do that. So if we look at you know the the world\nof cannabinoids in conclusion. There's several different ways to make extracts.\nThere's a lot of different ways to make very, very viable market products. There's\na lot of ways to drive revenue in your extraction business with these products.\nUnderstanding this knowledge base and understanding how you're going to occupy\neach one of these market niches, what access to biomass you have, what\ndiversity and methodology do you have in order to create these products and\nultimately drive diversity and revenue in your in your business. And then really\ntaking that to the next step and taking the next level of understanding of how\nto create these products. That's something that we do here all day long\nat Precision. We absolutely understand all these processes very intimately. We\nhave a very robust team of install / integrators that\noptimize these processes, so again not just selling you the pieces of equipment\nbut actually coming out training you on these processes, sitting there with the\npieces of equipment with you in order to get these processes integrated until\nyour business is up and running and on legs.\nSo in conclusion, a tremendous opportunity ,I hope

already if you guys are into extracts i would say give this one a try next green wave never disappoints i'm gonna have to give it the seven nine the seven nine it was mighty fine i do um i've had heavier extracts to like put my dick in the dirt so i can't give it anything higher than the seven nine seven nine is still a really good score though i highly recommend it if you guys have not tried anything by next green wave be sure and pick it up next time you see them in your dispensary cheers everybody oh this one's gonna kill me oh ah oh sorry people last couple days i've haven't been

resin vapes what's going on here what's the difference i've had tons of requests so i'm happy to be fulfilling those requests let's see what we got in the uh little handy dandy true buds pack let's open it up well that's for another video i'm going to be opening up this top shelf pre-roll see what we got inside keep an eye out for that video i have the uh live resin from jetty here the unrefined let's go ahead and open this up we got the little satchel in here tastes so good so live resin upon harvest is instantly frozen this is the way that they're going to get the most terpenes in there the full flower flavor that everybody loves live resin is usually extracted with butane and purged in a vacuum oven i'm not going to go too far into the process let me know if you want to see more videos on the actual process now live resin usually on the scale shows it's a little less potent and a lot of people go shopping i want the highest potency i want this and that that's why distillate cartridges are so popular and that's why i'm making this video to kind of educate people because distillate is the bottom of the barrel if you will it's the leftovers the trim the shake because everything is going to be burnt off essentially it's like making booze it's like making a moonshine or ever clear you're going to put all this [ __ ] in and then you're going to be left with the most potent stuff possible basically tasteless odorless colorless and then this is when the companies add in the terpenes if you're lucky sometimes they're delicious sometimes they're not but a lot of times you can taste the artificialness and that's why i think especially after having this live resin i got a live resin from my uh packs the other day from jetty too i think this is the go to from now on i'm tired of these distillate carts when i hit them they taste fake i'm [ __ ] like sneezing that's another video i've been with people when they're smoking vapes i sneeze all the time after hitting this distillate cart like what kind of terpenes have you put in there is it some [ __ ] random flower that i happen to be allergic to like that is the beauty of the live resin is you are getting the live flower if you will the closest resemblance in a nice form that's right there price point price point this graham cartridge is pretty damn expensive i'm not gonna lie i was a little hesitant it was like 62. i got it from ease i'll put a comment down below if you want to order through there for your first time get 20 off but that's expensive sometimes i have people commenting like dude that's some serious dough you're dropping on some carts and [ __ ] but it's convenient it's legal gives me peace of mind i really don't mind actually you know shoveling that money forward people buy the stuff through ease it all kind of comes back but what i'm saying here is i think this has helped transform me i've had other live resin vapes and i've thought the same thing but i'll still buy distillate ones but i'm sitting there i feel like sometimes these like even the circles one like i'll take [ __ ] like 10 15 [ __ ] poles off it and it feels like just now i had like what four of these like this is better so i guess you got to decide where you want to put your money quantity over quality i'll just compare it to like schwag versus fire ass nog you know what i'm saying i would say this is that good nug and the distillery cartridges are the swag so yeah like that we got the unrefined live resin and then we have a distillate like this was like 15 bucks and you can tell so that's my two cents i wanted to break down the difference for you between the live resin and the distillate vapes like i said the tons of people were asking like yo bro like what's the difference man

happy although I did spend a little bit more than expected because I went to fee knows and it's not authentic and authentic when they had it it was $40 but at vinos it's 55 but I really wanted a cartridge so I was like [ __ ] it I'll pay $15 extra and you see if I'm not lying right here I mean the tax is killing me it was the one it's $41 without the tax but then it was like 54 with it so yeah definitely one of the the pricier cartridges I'm actually at a park right now I'm actually gonna hit a few in the car just because you know it's easier that way and then I'm gonna walk around and hit the cartridge - just to prove that I'm in a [ __ ] park okay guys [ __ ] Park [ __ ] park brother so let's just open this thing like I mean you guys already know the deal bros like I've opened this not this one but okay okay [Music] I didn't want to [ __ ] pull out the cap you know accidentally Laureus yes dope or battery I do have my dad's mate and do not have the magnetic piece on it so I'm just gonna use the side where it's cruising cheers boys who that wasn't even a blinker right this is a blueberry muffin in oh my god that show taste a pretty [ __ ] [Music] god damn holy moly cracker mode damn [Music] this is probably the the smoothest cartridge I've hit in a while if not the best or the smoothest the taste is there everything is there like I liked when I tried the first person car it was from the homie Chiron and he had ice cream cake which is a strain I didn't really enjoy as much this one has a sweeter taste of more blueberry taste obviously it's blueberry muffins and it's actually quite pleasant what [ __ ] it was just like [ __ ] the stats let's just read this [ __ ] right here so we got THC we're coming in at seventy two point one two percent it was packaged and manufactured on the channel on January 30th 2020 Best Buy same date but 2021 one gram all that good stuff not gonna lie it [ __ ] this [ __ ] hits so what I am going to do now pocket this water you can see right here guys very nice Park it's very nice outside I was actually getting pretty [ __ ] hot in that car I'm not gonna lie I want to go over there and smoke you see that boys that little stairway [ __ ] let's go there no one there and we can take some hits on the way to boys that's the thing about cartridges you could bring that [ __ ] anywhere and take a fat hit and especially with a cart like this that hits like a [ __ ] dab rig like it's a game-changer it really is you know like I honestly can't stress that enough you know cartridges are getting better just like technology with the mores I believe it's Moore's law where technology gets better every six months and technology is in everything when it comes to vapes computer it's anything you know I'm saying like the hits aren't that fat right now what you just take off let me see if I can take you about that the camera turned off let me see if I can take a little a little fatter hit damn well yeah I wanted to do I wanted to get my own orsa you know after Chiron showed me his I was just like damn there's just no way I cannot just try this muhfuckas and not buy my own it did take some a long time I would say about a month or something but it's only because Ursa hasn't been that much available in my area and it's probably something I won't buy that much often you know because $55 for a gram cartridge I know it's a it's average in LA but in Modesto that's not average that's a above average so you know I do enjoy it though I really really do enjoy it very very tasty you get the whole terpene profile of the of the strain which is good you know I wanna take one more hit for you guys I'm probably gonna call it a video hopefully you guys enjoyed it you and also in the car you could actually see the smoke thickened out here it's very spread out it's not a really good visual representation of actually how much I'm hitting but these are fat hits don't get me wrong but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed this video I really enjoyed hitting this to be honest and making this video it's a nice [ __ ] day outside and hopefully you're having a good day so far peace out expecting company but that's ok cos don't try to prove", "vfbEQNSMFXo": "[Music] so these forms of extraction kind of started like beautiful accidents like a lot of things in this industry being the first processors in the state of organ we dealt with a lot of new products and consistencies that have come about along the way liquid live resin is essentially our iteration of oil that can go into a cartridge we just take fresh frozen cannabis flower extract that here it get it clean and then fill cartridges with it so people are learning about distillate and about fake terpenes are liquid live resin is literally just libraries and it append there's no cutting agents there's it's not like a formulation it's not like I'm a chef and they're adding a bunch of stuff to a pot mixing it together and then putting it in a pen it's literally just live resin in a liquid form so that it can run through a cartridge from there we have innovated ways to then include liquid cured resin and those two products have a serious stronghold now with the demand for quality on the organ market so the difference between liquid cured and liquid live resin is the beginning product that we put inside so liquid cured resin is a cured either trim or node that would normally be made into a shatter and then the liquid live resin is fresh frozen that the cannabis companies will cut down fresh freeze it as quick as possible which gives you the highest terpene rich cannabis that you can have so that's just a differences the starting material as far as effects they aren't drastically different unless you're really looking for that 5% 10% more terpene variation which is liquid live rest when you pull this vape in out of your pocket and you have a drill on it you're gonna have that fresh plant experience just like you're at a farm walking the rows [Music] you", "BOUWQvtjvTs": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to weights the marijuana review show where we help you find folks make sense of your dispensary today we are taking a look at a cartridge here on wheats a good old-fashioned 510 cartridge i've got my trusty battery here nice and plain and then the product we're actually reviewing which is napalm we are reviewing uh our first cartridge anything from the folks at napalm uh and this happens to be their napalm o g um strain so both the company is napalm and the strain is napalm og that we are taking a look at uh so i picked this up at a dispensary in long beach it is 43 dollars for a gram uh which is um about average maybe a little bit cheaper than average uh at this dispensary that i um pick up from um so uh you know keep that in mind with the review 43 bucks uh for a lot of people i know is very cheap for a one gram cartridge but not so much here in long beach um as i said standard 510 so this is no special pod nothing different or weird your normal twisty battery is going to work here uh so i don't know a lot about napalm i know this dispensaries had them for a while i couldn't really find a whole lot of online presence for them outside of listings didn't see a lot but let's go ahead and get this open um and on the back before we really get started here let's go ahead and take a look at the lab testing results if it'll focus up there um there we go uh looks like it's coming in at about 75 thc or so uh which is about average for a cartridge maybe on the slightly lower end but um which is you know maybe commiserate with the price so uh now we know our laptop results we got about our 75 thc let's figure out how we open this somewhat elaborate looking packaging here there are a lot of flaps on it that's glued pretty tight oh we've got a little um authentic holographic sticker here i'm not really sure what they think that putting a sticker that just says authentic on it is going to try to solve but you know i assume anybody can buy that sticker but maybe some psychological assurance uh let's rip that effing sticker off there we go pull it out voila here we are here is our one gram napalm cartridge ooh that is a very different design uh this is not uh this is totally unique never seen anything quite like this i'm not even sure what material this is maybe aluminum some kind of metal here on the tip the oil actually looks pretty good there gold rich um yeah it looks way better than i thought and i'm curious about this cartridge design it's just got the one big intake hole there better than that pretty standard looking heating element all that stuff so let's go ahead and plug it into our 510 thread here and give our napalm og from napalm a try here we go oh wow okay um that is a very different tasting uh strain than i am used to uh it is very extremely piney piney a little slightly bitter earthy um not bad just um a lot more uh aromatic than i guess i was expecting it's quite tasteful uh there's there's a lot going on there um and even pretty robust like bittery aftertaste i'm not usually a huge fan of bitter uh it's not terrible here it's that very earthy kind of bitter taste not sure i love the cartridge design kind of hard to get your like mouth around it it's very short little mouthpiece here uh you know most cartridges have a much longer sorry for the juvenile humor or uh images uh you know much larger place to put your lips and all that uh this is very small it's it's can make it tough to draw from it is unique wow yeah that is just extremely um terpeney there is just a lot of piney earthy bittery taste to it uh i usually like a lot of flavor this one uh i'm not gonna necessarily say it's bad i don't i actually don't think that it is it's just not the kind of strains that i normally go for um and this one is just heavy on the terpenes wow um the cartridge design again a little weird uh the draws are fine i'm getting draws okay but it's hard to sort of get a good seal but in terms of potency no problem saying this is 75 i've taken quite a few draws here feeling the effects quite strong um in terms of the that being the most important aspect is it really going to get you high uh that seems to definitely be true i think this is pretty good oil it's just um you're gonna if you're gonna go for this napalm og you better like the piney earthy tastes of the strains um because this one has it in spades yeah i'm just uh uh so far i would say i have mixed feelings about my napalm og experience let's get another one in here nice hit smooth um you saw i drew for a while excelled for a while and i'm not hacking a lung up which is a good sign um but again that taste is very strong wow uh so uh right now i'm kind of um up in the air about our napalm og experience uh i would say if you really like the napalm as a strain maybe give this a consideration me i'm gonna uh finish off this gram i'm uh looking forward to it actually it's it's a bit of a different strain for me but a bit of a different experience can lead to some fun new uh experiences let's hope maybe who knows um it is different napalm og um let's give it a little bit of a wait and see i'm gonna finish off this gram and then like all our wheat's reviews i'll come back to you guys in the i don't know five days or so it'll take to get through this and i'll let you know exactly what i think of this whole experience i am a little worried about this cartridge design it seems like it might get clogged really easily with this very shallow hole um and there's not like a lot of plastic or anything sort of protecting stuff going in so uh i could imagine this novel cart design having some issues but we shall see it'll take me a couple days to get through it i'll be right back here to let you guys know exactly what i think when we finish this napalm og in just a few days until then stay high stay healthy see you right back here bye guys [Music] welcome back to wheats guys it has been about four days a little over four days since we started our journey with napalm and their strain napalm og uh just a little bit left there so i could have one or two more hits to share with you guys like this one here and well i gotta tell you my thoughts experiences really haven't changed much in four days um i didn't hate it there's nothing fundamentally wrong with it it's just not my favorite cartridge not what i'm gonna go back to um primarily what i found distasteful was the taste um that sort of acrid vaguely burnty piney earthy taste of the napalm uh it just wore on me i never sort of grew accustomed to it as a matter of fact the more i did it the more i kind of didn't want to do it um kind of even had to make myself get to this point to finish this one off i would have moved on to something else um it's not that the oil is bad it feels like the 75 percent as listed it's just not the highest quality the cart design is also so top-heavy i mean most cards are top-heavy by design but this one with this like heavy aluminum tip it's just so hard to keep it balanced um and also if you keep it in your pocket it's guaranteed it's going to turn upside down on itself and it's got that shallow intake hole which got clogged on me more than once had to clean it out it's just not the best experience it's certainly not the worst experience uh you know it's somewhere in that middle of the road and at 43 dollars it's cheap but it isn't the cheapest um and i have had even cheaper cartridges that i have had that i've enjoyed more so i can't give this one a big thumbs up i'm not even sure i can give this one a tepid recommendation uh i do think that there is better stuff out there for you um i may in the future try to review one of napalm's other strains they're not napalm og itself and see if maybe i have better luck uh but that's only if you guys are really curious otherwise there's plenty out there to review we'll take a look at those and we'll take a look at those on our next review whenever that is sometime in our near future i hope you guys will join us for that one until then stay high stay healthy and we'll see you then docs", "1jFtPFQ8z9g": "to the people that are new to dabbing and see all these consistencies and get confused and just don't know which one to try i just say try them all today i'm going to be dabbing on some garlic cookie sauce from grassroots let's crack the seal on this as you can tell it's super [ __ ] goopy i'm gonna try to keep it as level as i possibly can jesus christ dude the whole room just reeks of garlic trying to do this without spilling any there's literally just like a straight up layer of turp juice on top of it we're gonna mix this up a little bit make sure all those diamonds and terps get mixed together nicely just look how gloopy it is you guys this stuff's so hard to handle on a dabber bloop but it's fire i love the function of this recycler that's the perfect little drain let's get our dab ready i'm not kidding when i say this stuff's running you guys you really want to make sure you have a dabber that has some sort of scoop on it so you can make sure you get a decently sized dab all right let's go you guys [Music] this [ __ ] is crazy you guys i know i talk about garlic cookies a lot on my channel but the aroma and the flavor that you get from this is [ __ ] nuts like that aftertaste just stays for so long the dab is gone i've already taken it but i can still just taste that insane garlicky feeling and these are some great effects too i swear to god that one dab does the job but this is some live resin sauce most people just call it sauce though it's a pretty popular form of concentrate there's a lot of different terms to describe extracts like shatter butter batter crumble sauce diamond sugar the list goes on and on these names are used to describe the consistency and the malleability of the concentrate not the quality everyone has a preference on their favorite consistency but none are just bad off of the consistency so just don't overthink it when it comes to quality of an extract it really just comes to what the quality of the product is going into it and the knowledge and experience of the person who's actually doing the extraction process it's not like chatter means bad sugar means good but sauce is a pretty popular form of concentrate if you've been to a few dispensaries you've probably seen it or if you know a few plugs they probably got it it looks like a million tiny rocks swimming in a pool of like yellowy ambery liquid diamonds are their own form of concentrate typically they're on the bigger side and much less terpy where sauce is usually super tiny diamonds sometimes there's a couple big rocks in there but usually it's so small where you really can't even see them mixed with a crazy amount of terpenes but those little tiny diamonds are where the cannabinoids are so that's where majority of the thc is stored and the liquid portion is live resin terpenes so there's a super high percentage of terpenes in there and a super low percentage of cannabinoids which is why it's perfect to mix the two so the sauce might not get you very high alone but when you mix it with those diamonds it just packs a punch you get pretty [ __ ] lit and the terpenes add an additional entourage effect so it really does add an additional kick to the thc but i say it's time to take another dab [Music] uh oh [ __ ] this drink feels so awkward to hold i'm not gonna lie oh my god that train is [ __ ] crazy oh [ __ ] those terpenes are always super [ __ ] heavy on sauce so i usually try to make sure i get the strains i like when i pick it up i know i said that they're all pretty much the same thing but the main difference between sauce and every other strain is that it has like the most intense terpene profile plenty of other concentrates of high terpene profiles but the most overwhelmingly high is typically sauce and the terpene profile on this one is [ __ ] insane it's five point seven percent mercy and almost five percent carry off i mean four point five percent limiting and that's just the top three it's total terpenes is 18.4 if i did my math right like that's a lot of terps sugar also has a high terpene profile but it's a little bit more easy to work with let me open this jar real quick and show you what it looks like for those who don't know all right this is a fresh gram of bubba kush sugar as you can see it's still terpy but there's more of like a solid consistency to it there's still some sauce in there but there's much bigger diamonds that are a little bit easier to handle and work with these two are made of exactly the same stuff but have a completely different consistency but the main downsides the sauce in my opinion or how liquidy it is like i just said you really can't keep it in a hot environment you can't put it on its side for a long period of time and it's hard to work with on a dabber at least if you like big dabs like using a little needle like this would be so hard even using a scooper like this you really can't get too fat of a dab but looks are deceiving with sauce and sugar in my opinion if you're used to just only dab and shatter and you really haven't experienced sauce or sugar like you really don't realize how fat of a dab you're taking if you just scoop up a giant bit of it but again not all sauce looks exactly like this sometimes sauce looks like a mixture between the two concentrates that just showed you where they have a couple big rocks in there but it's majority that like super small diamond but a lot of companies really aren't that great labeling this stuff i bought some sauce before that was just straight up sugar i've bought some butter before that was sauce there's a little bit of like subjectiveness that comes to it where they're like i mean it's sugar but it's super terpy so let's just call it sauce they do try to label it as accurately as they can so that you can get a good idea for what you're going to consume nobody likes pissed off customers so they try to make it as accurate as they can but i'd be lying if i said i've never had it be a little off but to the people that are new to dabbing and see all these consistencies and get confused and just don't know which one to try i just say try them all it's the best way to find out which one you like and which one you don't and it's like none of these are bad technically so you can try shatter you can try sauce you can try butter and you can see which one you like the best but i say we take one more dab before we head out of here this time i'm not gonna use the diver though personally this is my favorite way to dab sauce hey that's fire now that's the right way to dab sauce a lot of people message me and ask me to like clarify what consistency of concentrate they have it's mostly people that get it from the black market because it's not labeled but i feel like i might start a series where i go from concentrate to concentrate and just kind of show them off let me know if that's something you'd like to see in the comments below but click like if you enjoyed this video if you made it this far you probably did and leave a comment let me know if you want me to make this a series and if so what concentrate should i do next don't say live rosin

"790iHK19SlY": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive kind of think of it every day is a good day to be like alright guys thank you for another video your boy Shaka if you don't know who I am my name is Shaka Zulu if you see my videos you haven't subscribed yet please subscribe subscribe and if you're new to the channel subscribe cos right I'm always coming with a good vibe doesn't love my videos mat now you might not love it you might love it I don't know keep watching and you'll find out but today as you can see from the title I bought I basically bought a live turkey and cart and I bought a live resin cart and I thought the live terpene cart was a live resin cart because when I went into the dispensary I went to a dispensary out and I think my desk I can't remember what the dismiss of his name was but when I went out to the dispensary I asked can I get one of your life resin what kind of life resins you got and she showed me the live it was a live terpenes actually it wasn't my present so I decided to do research on it and find out what's the difference between a live resin car in the live terpene cart so that's what you guys are going to get today but before I get into that this [ __ ] truck is made how [ __ ] I hope you guys can [ __ ] hear me but you already know your plea kind of start this off without bond rip you guys [Applause] [Music] buddy you gotta start to vlog off right with a bomb grip diet but yeah I'm probably gonna get out the car actually cuz I want to show you guys you're not wearing that to park that I'm app so cuz if you guys are on quarantine and you're scared to come outside or you just don't want to come outside you want to be extra safe I want y'all to get to see you know where I'm at so you feel like you're outside you feel me so you feel like you outside get your join get your bongs and go on a little walk with me out here and we're gonna talk about this live resin and live Terps guys but before that let me I got one more thing to tell you guys I'm coming off on 400 subscribers when I hit 500 subs I'm gonna do a Q&A video so if you have any Q&A questions put them down below I'm gonna try not to answer your questions I'm used to just answering people's questions so make it a serious question maybe even say it's a Q&A question if you can but if not I'll like it I'll like it but I won't reply and the reason why I'm not replying is because I want it to be a Q&A question for I want to save up some Q&A questions basically for my video but um let me get out here let me get my wax pan get that live resin I'm smoking on the the nut rot live resin it's berries and cream I forgot to say it in my video last time what the strain name actually was but it's berries and cream [ __ ] way go hi guys all right guys [Music] it's actually a good amount of people out here but I'm still working under a willow tree hopefully you can see I give you a quick overview all right guys the first difference is each stretch it's different than like you know your typical shatter crumble turps because it's two different extractions it's the process it's called a freeze frozen process where they extract and extract the wax before they actually care all right so when you chop down the plan you skip the whole curing process it helps preserve the terms and it also gives it that you know that flavor profile that comes straight from the flower that I roam that days you know I mean preserves all that although they do here the plant when they make terpenes on the other hand I'm gonna talk about terpenes now they the turps cards the live turf cards are usually way more fresh and are cleaner and less harsh on your throat because they take out the fats and the lip nodes the lip node another difference also up to is you can see the layer of terpenes in the jar when they make a so like you can actually take a dab of that term because the THC content is way different in fibrous and I think it's a less THC content so it but it gives you more but if I'm wrong people tell me I'm not I'm just going off of what I've been reading about the live resin and in the Terps the live resin turps because I do have a car a live resin Terp cart I got this car is called freak n abisco I think it's called I'll show you guys later but I haven't tried to get live resin nut cart you fit me snot Benz obviously prefer libraries and more than flavors and herbs but imma try both for both II for you guys but that's all I really know know about my present look at the difference between libraries and in terms I'm not I don't know that much more if you guys have any more information for sure put that [ __ ] down in the comments you guys already know I check out cuz I want to learn more about the libraries in interns honestly and the different methods of extracting because I've been one to make my own some [ __ ] to get like a press and make my own I'll be like next level but we'll see what's up but I'm going to show you guys that cart before I go cart it actually looks alright it looks like fish Jilla to me obviously because dish hill is more lighter and darker but it's the terms I honestly need to look up with this still it is someone comment the difference between dis jillion terms in the comments please I need to know all right guys see I'm gonna show you guys in a man let's help Wendy can't get a good like hit I hope you guys can see me it's kind of dark like cuz it feels like it's gonna rain but might not rain just gorgeous [Music] freak a nabisco freak a nabisco [Music] see the live resin is way way more darker than the live resin turps but it's still cool I mean we won't find out if it's good I'm gonna be honest with you guys if it's not good I'm not will tell you guys [Music] don't forget to Like comment subscribe more videos to come if you guys want me to try I guess I am gonna try it but man shout out to whoever told me I forgot who it was and my comments but you told me to try these now that's the reason why I got it I'm gonna try it out for you also I forgot to tell you guys if you made it to enter this video I'm just asking guys you know cuz 4:20 you can't really do anything you can't really go out anywhere I plan to go house somewhere but but you can't even go out anywhere right now so what do you guys want to see for 4/20 I kind of got some ideas got some edibles the con huh I think that's how you say I'm not sure hon huh no cannabis infused indica pink lemonade and I got freakin strawberry ones put all together this is 400 milligrams and I'm thinking about you need on 420 I'm showing you guys like how high yeah [ __ ] so loaded on that day I'm gonna make a vlog for you guys either way but it'll be cool if you guys give me any ideas of what you want to see and I'll try and work it in there you feel me but um thanks for watching the video guys seriously [Music]", "A24Y3JyHLAQ": "this video is made of a user's request today I'm showing you how to winterize frozen in a small batch here I have almost a gram of rosin about a point 8 I made just before this video I'm placing into a beaker and adding 10 ml of Everclear I'm adding the alcohol to the rosin so that I can inter eyes it apply like bleep and mix until all of the rosin is dissolved into the alcohol [Music] here importing the rajma and alcohol into a graduated cylinder this is just for the purpose of the video [Music] I meant place it into the freezer and my cool for about 14 hours [Music] after freezing you can see that the wax fats and lipids have separated and sunk to the bottom [Music] here I'm using two syringes to pull out the fats and waxes as well as the alcohol separately this is also just for the purposes of this video to show you the difference [Music] it does help however to pull them out separately as it makes it easier to filter the cleaner portion compared to the waxy portion [Music] here I'm pushing them through a point to two microns syringe filter the syringe filter tracks the facts and waxes and removes them from the alcohol [Music] [Music] in the end I've caused it in alcohol and it's been winterized and I'm removed of any of its fats and waxes alright once you've done filtering you know how fully winterized rosin you can go ahead and use this for edibles or you can further refine it by boiling away the S&L and using it for bait pens or lowell devs my half plate has a built in magnetic stirrer it's a magnet that spins around and spins a magnetic stir bar this automates the steering process and speeds up the overall evaporation it may take some time for all the alcohol to evaporate keep checking back on it every so often so that you don't burn your rosin I don't recommend consuming concentrate that may have ethanol and then often if you are going to do this regularly you are better off getting it back through the final purge process [Music] after you've reduced most of the alcohol up I'd like to put another beaker on top to prevent any ball tools such as terpenes from escaping that having already in this final process removing the last of the ethanol now you can't truly remove all of it without a vacuum so I went to do this for as long as possible kind of medium to high heat right now it's heated at around 95 degrees Celsius I like to let it sit like this for a couple hours from four I feel it's safe to smoke and the ethanol has escaped [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "WheOc80F8Wo": "so let's start on the left we're gonna make diamonds out of your on the right right now is we are reducing there are extract or BHO extract we like to put it inside of we got this bucket you seen the last picture it's got a little bit of warm water it is not hot water it's just warm water we're gonna reduce it down to for the diamonds we want it to become the consistency of a boat syrup before we're gonna cap it and put it somewhere warm and pretty much forget about it for a few weeks and then for adds or shatter if you don't know how to make shatter we're gonna reduce that down to about syrup then pour it into our back oven onto our patch of parchment paper and then we're gonna let it bubble away and then pull it back on it full30 an inch of warm water and on hot water just warm water in there gonna take a little while through these it's what we want - I'll be 20 minutes half an hour there like that probably have to change the water a couple times keep it warm as the extract is really cold the process to walk you through it oh yeah we can make diamond can make diamond - all right you can see how much we reduced it down your way up here before it was quite a bit lighter we still got some bubbles just good because to make time as you need pressure also need a supersaturated solution which is this butane and THC and yeah time just go wait time so we're gonna we're gonna do is when it's a little cap on this we're gonna stick it up on our clone seedling rack because it's got a it's a warm base which will help with the pressure build up because as the gas or as the liquid turns into gas it builds up enough pressure in here and helps the process take place good no it's not quite at syrup consistency yet which is okay we can just let the pressure build up give it a little burp we do that over a period of a couple days until we get it tell it's like a little run here than syrup and then we're just gonna leave the cap on it and we're not gonna touch it again till we get diamonds you can see now that I burped it there's bubbles from the gases escaping from the supersaturated solution back into gas which pressurizes this back back up again okay so it reduced a little bit more this one here we weren't working with see how runny that is I mean it's still just like water make snake water this is the death Bubba here and see it doesn't splash like that when you shake it it's thicker hard to tell you definitely a sticky substance yeah shake it doesn't splash up the sides a whole lot that's how we like it see the little bubbles coming up pressure up we're gonna leave it at that we're just gonna set it and set it forget it turn it off in the back corner here and we'll come check it in a couple weeks and we've got diamonds in the bottom there it kind of look like little air bubbles when they first start forming but their crystals will show you once we get to that point you [Music] [Music]", "3htTQSwx84Y": "when you look at them independently you'd say that they were both sugar but when you look at them side by side you'd honestly say that they're kind of different looking concentrates [Music] today i'm dabbing on one of my personal favorite consistencies this is called sugar starting to sesh off with this live sugar from grassroots oh god that looks beautiful that sugar is such a pretty bright yellow color all right i'm just gonna dunk it right in there oh ah delicious man holy crap [ __ ] yeah that treyo g is a really dank earthy flavor that's [ __ ] fire got a little bit of sweetness on the back end too it's pretty nice there's a lot of different words that people use to describe cannabis concentrates some of the most popular are ones like shatter sugar butter wax sauce diamonds the list goes on and on these names are used to describe the consistency and the malleability of a concentrate not the actual quality so one isn't necessarily better than the other just based off of its consistency but today we're going to take a deeper look into sugar wax it's a pretty popular form of concentrate if you've been to a dispensary before you've probably seen it on the shelf at least it's created through a solvent extraction process just like shatter or wax but it's not necessarily better or worse than any other consistency it's just different everyone has their preference but personally i think this is one of the better consistencies all around i just think it usually has a nice terpene profile and it's easy to work on a dabber but i don't want to put too much emphasis on the importance of a consistency honestly i've had consistencies change on me before i finish smoking the concentrate honestly if you leave shatter sitting out in the open on a warm day it's not too rare to see it sugar up there's actually a lot of science that's involved when it comes to making concentrates it's a little overwhelming when you just look at it but sugar is really just a term used to describe any sort of cannabis consistency that kind of resembles like a wet sugar there's not just one way to get to the finish line here but no matter how you make it sugar typically has great effects a great smell and a great flavor but it's very sticky and crumbly i don't recommend using your hands on this concentrate i recommend getting a dab tool and scooping it up the stickiness really helps to stick to the tool usually let's just get a nice little chunk on here and get a little bit more than that oh yeah now we're talking i really like this little scooper dabbers i feel like you can get a decent amount of concentrate on them when i'm dabbing on a cloud banger with a turf pearl in it i usually wait about 90 95 seconds before i take my dab we're at 90 seconds right now so let's go for it oh yeah it's gonna be a good tent oh yeah it's perfect god damn i just love weed man it's the best i'm assuming that's something we can all agree on here dude just smoking and dabbing it's just incredible but anyway sugar wax is often found as either a cured or a live resin and the only real difference between live resin and cured resin sugar is that live resin sugar was made with fresh frozen material while cured sugar was made with fully cured cannabis but the main difference between the two is typically with live resin you're going to have a more noticeable terpene profile but it's usually around the same thc sugars usually tend to be around 70 to 90 percent thc sometimes with live resin sugars companies will just get little thc diamonds and sprinkle live resin terpenes on top of that until it's like a little sugary consistency and then they call that sugar there will be a saucy coating over the diamonds it'll look just like sauce just a little more dry it's called sugar as well but it's really not the same thing as sugar wax but sometimes these concentrate consistency names just cover up a couple different consistencies under one name i actually have two perfect examples here as you can see both of these are called live sugar you can see live sugar right there and live sugar right there however this is what was inside of each container as you can see this one on the left is what i was talking about where there's little thc diamonds just coated in a live resin sauce where this one over here is actually more of a waxy consistency but it still is a sugar when you look at them independently you'd say that they were both sugar but when you look at them side by side you'd honestly say that they're kind of different looking concentrates they're not even the same color the saucy consistency is much more of an amber color while this sugar is much more of a yellow color some might even consider this more of a sauce consistency but to me that's sugar you can leave it on one side for a little bit without any of the stuff pouring out of there and live resin sugar and live resin sauce often look very similar to each other the main difference between the two is the thc percentage and the terpene percentage sauce typically has a lower thc percentage and a higher terpene percentage than sugar while sugar typically has the higher thc percentage and the lower terpene percentage but still has a great flavor so that's why i typically like to go with sugar so i feel like you get that nice thc punch while still getting a nice flavor and like a delicious overall experience when it comes to the smell and the flavor but i'm about to take a dab of this saucy sugar now and see which one i like more this drain portlandia is absolutely fire it was actually recommended to me by one of you guys it has a super high mercy level this one it's actually only testing at 2.8 which is still pretty high but i've seen it testing it upwards of seven here's the stats for the portlandia sauce for anyone that wants to see it pretty high amount thc and thca while still having a great terpene profile and i'm actually impressed that the sugar wax had good flavor now that i'm looking at the stats it's over 90 thca but it's still a great terpene profile let me know in the comments whether you guys prefer when it's more of a sugar wax consistency or went into the little thc diamonds with the live resin sauce on top i don't really mind either way i like it both ways again it's hard for me to pick a consistency because really i don't look at the consistency i'm looking at the strain and the thc and the terpene percentages when i'm buying weed and the consistency of sugar is just not uniform in nature it even ranges from like a light yellow to a ambery color like this let's scoop out our dab i think it's almost time to dab too god [ __ ] not dabbing all that i'll drop that though all right wish me luck on this one [Music] huh oh my god [Music] oh yeah killed it oh my god that was a good hit oh my god holy [ __ ] that portlandia is [ __ ] amazing i'm not kidding i'm really glad that whoever recommended that recommended it shout out to you but honestly i just love sugar because of how easy it is to get on a dab tool and honestly i think that it has the dopest melt shots when i'm filming my snapchats however i do feel like it is much harder to do than other concentrates sometimes i think i'm just taking a normal sized dab and then once you drop it in there it just turns into this giant puddle and you're like holy [ __ ] i was not intending all this i feel like when i'm dabbing butter or shatter it's so much easier for me to have an idea for how much i'm taking but when it's those little diamonds and all of a sudden there's just a giant thca rock in there you don't really know how much that weighs and you're like all right well let's find out how high i'm gonna get but i still think that sugar has a pretty nice well-rounded high and flavor no matter what form you have it in and i love flavorful concentrates and sugar is not the terpest there is but i still think that it has a great flavor profile and i think the butter and sauce are probably the most terpy for those who are wondering and if you're new to dabbing do not get overwhelmed if you see all these different consistencies at the dispensary and don't know which one to pick honestly don't even look at the consistency if you ask me just look at the strain and like the thc and the terpenes whatever you're looking for if you're a thc shopper look for the thing that's the highest thc if you like a certain terpene look for the terpenes like when i'm looking for a concentrate i'm looking at the terpene percentages i want something that has a really nice terpene profile most of the time concentrate consistencies are all basically the same thing they're all just different concentrated forms of cannabis it's really the cannabis you want to focus on and depending on the concentrate sometimes it'll change consistencies by the time the company packages it up and it actually gets to you bho does not have the longest shelf life and especially if you're talking about something like shatter or butter they can change consistencies pretty quick so honestly i wouldn't even say that labeling at the dispensary is 100 accurate you really don't know until you see it but that's the video you guys let me know what consistency of concentrates you want me to do next i did this before on sauce and you guys seem to really like it so i'm gonna make it a series so let me know what consistency you want me to do next i can do shatter butter wax diamonds let me know make sure you click that

doing this I can talk which means that I'm in action while I'm talking to say you put ice in the bomb and then you get your lighter out then you break up the bud then you pack the bomb and then there's a big-ass cracking my thing right there I don't know if y'all can see that let's see if we get a clear shot yeah I see that crack some big ice crack right there yeah you can see it now anyway Tommy tuna bowls I just broke one of these just before I started this episode I moved my iPad and it was sitting on top my iPad to hit the ground you know how fragile these are and this one's cracks from cleaning it so maybe we'll get another good smoke out if I still have two more but let's go ahead and get into some slur became you can call it let me stop [ __ ] monetize run my [ __ ] y'all heard me you guys we are so close to a thousand circles let's hurry up and get there y'all then I can do some live videos the only thing about about doing live videos is that they don't have a chance to to go over the videos which you got you know to make sure it's it goes it goes with Community Guidelines so when you do a lot video I can't smoke on a lot of video I can't smoke weed I could smoke a blunt or live video because that's like into a cigar and a nobody really tripping but if I can't smoke a bomb or the live video I tried it before did I try it with I can't remember I tried it with you too but I know I tried it with tick tock I did it with Teague talking while I was in the middle of my video like they was watching my [ __ ] while I'm in the middle of this video the video just stops and it says your games Community Guidelines and I'm like wow what the [ __ ] am i doing just sitting and smoking so if I was sitting there smoking a cigarette it wouldn't be against community Collins if I was sitting there just slamming some liquor wouldn't be against Community Guidelines both of those are legal if I smoke some weed it goes against community college guidelines and it's legal let's get up in here y'all let go very gassy tastes very gassy who slurve okay babies look so good here look at the inside of it did you guys inside stop look at the inside is Bud wow that's just from the piece that I just broke off that is quite lovely looking indeed if I do say so myself don't you guys think that's lovely not at all you guys know what i'ma say huh because I say just about every episode ah I hope y'all slept like kings and queens last night because once again I slept like a frickin King can you guys believe that I wake up like this every [ __ ] morning every morning I wake up like this I mean when I open my eyes up there's no there's none of that when I'm laying in bed when I poke my eyes oh here's me opening my eyes up in the morning oh yeah let's go let's get it brush teeth wash pants come here do whatever else I got to take a piss things shake you know I'm saying I'm just I don't know I guess I'm always excited and feeling blessed to be waking up in the morning you understand what I'm saying so I made a video yesterday in it it sounded prejudiced I made it on tik-tok but it wasn't meant to be sounding prejudiced and I explained it before I said this is gonna sound prejudiced but it's not meant this way I said why is it that black people is always on white people's minds why do why do they feel like they have to always pay attention to us to make sure the see what we're doing with the phone in their hand light up the barbecue it like they're just waiting to call the [ __ ] police owners in this guy came on and said because you guys are known for stealing and killing I said wow that's [ __ ] up you guys know that that's all media propaganda that black people stealing kills anyway I said I said because black people are known for stealing and killing I said white people has stolen more and killed way more people in fact you guys stole a whole race of people but you know the media said oh the only thing you see in the media is black people is white people shooting black people this is all you see man so I don't understand how Caucasian or white people can say that that black people are violent they tell us not to live in the past as far as thinking of slavery and stuff but they're living in the past as far as thinking us as violent you know the biggest room in the world is room for improvement and you don't think that as a race that we have been proved from that stereotypical attitude that y'all have placed upon us as being violent and indeed we're not violent in thieves we're pretty much the same in fact you guys were made from us that medicine [ __ ] the crazy thing is that two black people can make a white baby but to white people cannot make a black baby the original people on the planet were were people of color I'm not gonna say they're black because I don't believe they were black I believe they were like I can't think of the name of it but [ __ ] I can't think of the name of it but it wasn't black there were the closest to black so you know I'm saying they were up there were black people at that time but it's more like Bret to brown skinned people but anyway I got sidetracked y'all I'm sorry it just upset me that the guy hadn't had the audacity to say that we are known for for stealing and killing it just it baffled me it's like wow we're sitting here watching the news of all these people just randomly shooting black people just randomly killing unarmed black people and he had the audacity to say that we are more violent than we still and kill Wow but I'm sure you guys I am NOT prejudiced once a racist because you guys know it'll research yourself I'm not gonna go into it black people by definition cannot be racist we can be prejudiced but we can't be racist prejudice and racism is pretty much the same damn thing but we can't be racist because of our social standing anyway where that sounds like negativity on my page I don't want that [ __ ] on my page that [ __ ] out here we are smoking some slurry cane baby amen you got to get all your homies and all your friends and come on and subscribe to the channel man and hit that post notification bell so they don't miss any of these fire ass videos man because now I'm telling weave right up on a thousand we right there y'all we less than a hundred to a thousand let go tell me what like doing it let go I know you guys are sitting on getting it brother he calls not one time to hear what the hell just happened I'm gonna get y'all money anyway no all right so let's go ahead and give this up a flavor critique because I don't think I need any further ado with that flavor critique so on a scale of one to ten one being that [ __ ] Tim being a good [ __ ] of the flavor critique of slur Akane we're gonna give slur Akane the flavor critique of eight eight it's a strong eight there's nothing to be you know offended about it's a strong it's a nice eight it's two days no it's a good eight men some nice strong eight I would say mid eight the flavor is good it has a there's a slight burn on the back bottom of my throat I do taste a slight hint of berries in my mouth even for some reason the tip of my tongue is feels like it's slightly known that could be from something else but um yeah it's a pretty good flavor man definitely deserves every bit of that ate it's excellent what I've recommended to my friend hey if y'all haven't tried slurring can't go on and get on any she'll get some slur Akane in your life okay this is quite tasty I don't know about the berry taste but it tastes like it tastes like a thousand different weeds to me you know it's saying like there's so many different ways of tastes just like this the berries is so so my Newton so small that you can barely taste it you have to actually you have to actually taste you know get your taste buds in check my taste buds are in lemon because do you guys realize how many [ __ ] exotics I've smoked for you guys in the last three months in the last three months I've smoked no less than a hundred exactly 100 different exotics for y'all that's 100 different cannabis I've smoked over 150 different strains of exotics for y'all since I've opened up this channel and I think that's pretty [ __ ] amazing you guys that's a lot of different exotics you know I've never smoked I've never smoked this many different strains my whole entire life up into this point I've smoked the most strains in my whole life this year between last year and this year when I breathe out my nose is like a diesel II add easily taste like petrol like gasoline you know but it's real mods like almost an undertone it's quite nice still eight still deserves every bit of that eight and it burns slow too you us this is the little snapper bowl there's still a little green in there and I've been hitting this mug y'all I've been hitting this year you believe I do expect more from the hollow perhaps this is a creeper but um I do expect more from him what's the name like slur Akane I mean I should be completely baked right now I do feel hi and I do feel it creeping up and it's right behind my eyes that's it that's crazy because usually usually the high brains hit me right across here but this one's like I can feel it actually in both places I feel it more so behind my eyes but I feel a light bit on my forehead this is my high region you guys you know for um for exotics because most exotics are either had highs or just somewhere in this area for me I've never I I don't think I've had an exotic it's been so long since I've had out of cannabis that make that I got a body high off of I don't really like those I think the last time I had that was with that mango cush and remember I tell you I was telling you guys about that mango cush I don't like that she that she just put your ass to sleep randomly like you be smoking in you guys pass the blunt next thing you know you're waking up like you know what not just smoke it what the [ __ ] just happens that's some they should call that alien weed or so because I feel like I've been abducted every time I smoked that [ __ ] mango Kush dispensary great of course so have they opened up the public with you guys right yet a lot of people think that they opened up too soon but I don't know what what too soon would be you guys gotta realize it's like this um this this pandemic is like let's say it's like a can let your body with like the job situation it's like every day the cancer eats at your body and that's the way everybody not working was eaten at the United States economy every day was eaten at that [ __ ] every day we were getting less and less and less I personally I don't even feel like this is the United States anymore you guys I feel like this is something else I don't feel patriotic I don't feel like waving a [ __ ] flag in fact it's like burning a [ __ ] because it's like this hasn't felt like the United States for me for like [ __ ] man it's been a while man I would have to say it did you had to start before Trump but it really started really started pouring on with Trump and don't get it wrong you guys although I don't like Trump because I told you this before the American did never need a businessman running we don't need a businessman when we need his military [ __ ] running since we always at war [ __ ] but but Trump is like I don't know it seems like he's getting smarter or he's like paying attention more or he's starting to catch on to the presidency because now it looks like he's trying to do his [ __ ] job except for this [ __ ] Obama gate [ __ ] what the [ __ ] is that man this [ __ ] you know what I really think that [ __ ] Odetta Donald Trump is sexually attracted to Obama I swear on everything I think he's sexually attracted to cuz that's all he talks about he up he lays awake at night thinking about Obama man thinking about what he could say about Obama because he wants Obama to see his response is he what he's saying about him he wants Obama to respond back because that's the only response he's gonna get for Obama you guys got to understand Eagles don't don't hunt flies man Obama's the eagle Trump's the fly Eagles do not hunt flies man Obama's just like Nikko here with that shitty head never to call Obama classless you know what I have to say one thing I'm a not a stood behind everything Obama did Obama was he was a snake just like the rest of the other presidents but I did respect him for being the first black president and that [ __ ] was one classy president that you know what that was the most swaggy classiest president we've ever had in the history of presidency he may not have done the best job I think he done a good job but he does gotta realize whenever but he says that Obama's [ __ ] up and he done some fucked-up [ __ ] but you gotta realize is who we follow behind he came behind Bush Bush [ __ ] up the whole country oh that's enough talking baby let's get in here I don't talk so much I forgot to pack the bowl he's going on man you hide that's what it is you hiding that's right peg this really got a few more minutes and mess with job we're gonna put a little so I think one episode I'm gonna have to deal with y'all with me smoking a blunt just to show you all what blunts do to me it will mix it up so we want to do a lot of talking even though I'm doing a lot of talking now we'll mix it up I'm not gonna let the count on the bag because I already got an idea of how the episode is going to go but um it's gonna be when I run when I run out of when I run out of exotics when I don't have any more exotics and I don't have room for another video or I don't have another day's video around so when I don't have another day's video round that's when I'll do it because you know to make a video you know I'm saying I got to make a deal it's my job y'all work with me baby work Whitman that was kind of weak we need to kill her yes how come they're the businesses that they are opening our businesses that I really don't give a damn about I don't give a damn about over up Noah restaurants that made me spend money but I do get there by that goddamn gym open up the gym okay guys we're go ahead on a scale of one to ten one being that [ __ ] ten being that good [ __ ] of the high critique of slur akkanee we're gonna give us an equal amount of numbers that we gave it for the flavor we're gonna give it an eight we're gonna give it a high eight because the flavor is definitely ma Stephanie there y'all we got to get an air game nickel true it deserved every bit of that eight they got a golf clap for the eight even call you devil eight slur claim or eclaim slur Akane oh yeah okay I appreciate you guys stopping by as always to the new subscribers welcome to the family we love all comments we accept all comments and as of now I am still personally answering all comments when I get up in the 500 million subscriber range that I won't be able to uh we won't be able to

than today me if they be bless you guys you guys ain't got to go home but you got to get the hell out of here and guess what stay back", "fVIclho0GoY": "[Music] yeah see i understand the purple lotus was started up you know quite different than i think a lot of other dispensaries and especially dispensaries in san jose were established it was just established by my by my wife and i was in a situation where i had a lot of money that i was coming into this with a huge investment or anything and just lost you know money doing in a business venture um it was kind of my first forte into business that lost a lot of money was credit card debt but we started up the shop with a very small amount of money about fifteen thousand dollars when i opened the shop i had you know just four jars of marijuana about a little less than two pounds of marijuana i mean this this place over here really set us off i mean you would have people flocking from all over this area to to come on a daily basis it became a community of people the landlord that i was leasing from was leasing to another dispensary upstairs so we had we had competition up there and all humility you know they were closed within about three months of us being there um you know we just my motto was to reinvest that product you know i sold the original product and then i made the sacrifice didn't hire anybody i worked for a year straight just myself right there every day all day and just put all the money back in the product and that increased business and so many people were such strong advocates because they saw what we were about which was first of all people love great cannabis they love great wheat so we had great weed at the good price and then we were good people we got more involved in the community and because people came every day we became you know they became part of our lives we became part of theirs also when we first moved in here i mean i would park up here every day and then at night time i would take the bud with me inside ikea bags for the first maybe three months because i didn't really have a good safe situation so i would take it with me at the end of the night bring all the cannabis back with me the next morning i said this was popping up here as much as i like to at the time say that they weren't you know people smoking people you know a lot going on up here in the parking lot we ended up needing to get a guard up here to ensure that everything was all cool everything was all cool but they came from every which way they came by car they came by bike scooter walking because these apartments right here and all this area around here you know the bus stops right there this was a community right here people are proud to say that they came here to jackson you hear people say oh i've been coming here since jackson great great great memories from this place fought hard to stay here you know didn't work out but uh this will always be the original [Music] spot we barely squeaked into our next location over on lundy it was it was a rough move i mean it was not a successful situation at all it's very tough to get somebody to lease to us during that time it's not like now it's still very federally legal and people are really concerned we paid six months in advance and got the place over here and once again from day one we had issues um you know just especially in this place this has a shared uh it's an office building uh as a shared air conditioning unit by this time we were carrying a large supply of marijuana and uh the whole buildings just stunk like even though this is not far away people felt like it was far away so this was always a place where we were waiting for white road this is you know we had white road that we were building out while we were here so we struggled through this place they wanted to evict us from day one we fought through that and ended up staying for six months while the business i don't think grew a lot of customers during that time what we did is we grew a lot of resilience during that time we used to tell them hey uh you'll find this over by the loading dock you know you know that's i believe at one point we ran an extension cord from way over here down to the street just so that we could sit there and put a light out so that people could know that we could tell them that there's a light down there because it was so dark you would miss this because this is a building that closes at nighttime except for if you're selling wheat up here then it closes a lot later [Music] this was the nicest place we had built out beautiful place it was formally been a bar and we just made it really nice restored the bar had it all set up to serve it was really right in the middle of where at that point a good portion of our patient base was that opened up people were lined out everybody they were fighting to be the first person to say that they were the first person to come through the door um you know my mom came to pictures of all of us so happy to be opening up this great location we have been working for months to get it we didn't have a lot of money evicted from the other spot this other spot unlucky wasn't working out so you know we got this set up big day our biggest day ever still had the other location open but pushing most of the people down here feeling great eight o'clock sheriff's come tell us we need to close this it just happens to be this whole area is san jose and this corner right here out of all this area annexed to the county and the city had given us a business license for the address but it still fell underneath the county zone and the county at that time it had a ban on all cannabis activity even though san jose city allowed it this was a beautiful place we put all of our resources into and they closed this place down right here it was a big blow it hurt especially after only being open for about 10 hours [Music] you know 903 was was a blessing i didn't see it at the time but blessings come hidden and you know looking at the spot there's only about eight parking spots assigned to us but see how you can make that work especially with the employees and you know us needing parking we ended up uh leasing a little spot next door for parking um and making it work we put four or five security guards there at about a 50-yard uh uh distance and they just funnel people in and out in and out in and out it was a 4 20 weekend hey what year we moved in over there and uh it was actually it was a convention there's a big hemp con or something in town and uh we did 42 42.8 you know out the door and by that time we had built our our our venue up to 30 or 35 strains good bud 42 out the door and it you know it worked so well that we just kept it moving from there we just decided hey this works and we just kept on doing it and we kept on selling at 42.8 and it became just very popular we got to the point that it was you know we were running five six hundred people a day in through what was a 600 square foot retail sales floor with eight parking spots i'll tell you man one christmas day we're the only shop open man lined up from here all the way down to the head man waiting to get inside the facility we were the only club open on christmas we've been we never closed from the first day we opened we never closed we never been closed for one day we've been open for i think it's coming up on 4 000 days in a row no matter what happened we opened almost 4 000 days in a row [Music] listen lou gehrig type street [ __ ] you know what i mean you started talking about that you know with iron man because iron man [Music] you", "0mFph35MeJI": "hey so i just got one of these fireland scientific live rosin vape cards and i just wanted to make a little video about it as far as i know fireland scientific is the only company that makes rosin carts for the medical cannabis industry here in ohio um rosin is made without any solvent so these cards cost more than a similar distillate carts and you can see the lab info here and the strain on this one is tiger champagne solventless hash oil vape cart and tiger champagne is a sativa cross of strawberry banana and sour apple ibl which is a cross of sour diesel and cinderella 99 and the main terpenes are mercine caryophyllene and limonene so the cool thing about rosin is that it is a full spectrum extract as you can see there full spectrum that means that all of the cannabinoids and the terpenes present in the actual flower is going to be in the concentrate as well the actual cart itself used here is made by avd which is a good reputable brand here um most of the carts here are either made by c cell or avd and they both seem to work just as fine for me the one thing that's kind of strange that i noticed is that fireland scientific recommends a really low voltage with these rosin carts they only say to use 2.0 to 2.4 volts and i tried that but i wasn't really getting any kind of vapor so i increased this one up to six watts which is um it's like three volts or something 2.8 2.9 so but yeah i'll show the a little bit of vapor not much i haven't really tried turning it up much past this uh just because i don't want to burn the oil uh it gives really good flavor i can definitely tell that it has like a nice sweet kind of maybe a little bit of banana flavor um i'm not not sure if it's worth the extra price to get the rosin over the standard distillate i know i've read where some people claim that they just don't get the desired effects from the concentrates that aren't full spectrum so i don't think i've really noticed any issues like that but yeah so this is uh one of the probably one of the top vape carts here in ohio right now it's like one of the top of the line ones so yeah i'm just excited to try one and uh i have also tried a few of the firelands live bras and concentrates and i actually just got a strawberry nana stash the other day so i can put some pictures showing those two you know next to each other but um yeah i guess that's that's about all i have to say the flavor is really good on this i'm i've pretty much enjoyed every product that i bought since i got my medical card um so i don't know if that's just because i'm still pretty excited just to be able to go to dispensaries or what but yeah i guess that's pretty much all i have to say um yeah all right thank you bye", "qsxo1NXdkg8": "what you're about to see is a free episode of grow cast tv now we do this live every single week for our members plus a

the the camera as well just laden in frost beautiful look at that nice bud structure too it's like not too short and compact let's break it open i'll give you a little tert profile breakdown it smells like candy on the outside sweet sweet um kind of fruit juice mixed with candy sweetness and then when you bust it open it's a wave of gas it's like gasoline and candy um and a little bit of fruitiness as well it's like a three layer smell and uh it's really really quite impressive so let's light up this hurricane everybody smoke along with me shall we tell you chad how have you been doing in your grows where are you at in your gross are you about to harvest are you uh gearing up for the next run what's going on twist in the chat what up twist what up joey yes this is the slurricane which is the uh help me out here guys it's a purple punch strain right purple punch uh yeah eleanor just messaged me yes eleanor we'll uh we'll try for tomorrow night late i got some stuff tomorrow but i'll meet up with you tomorrow is prepping mothers for lots of cuttings a sea of green oh nice yeah i miss my old 16 by 16 room sea of green doc alex is about to harvest sinai oh i love it absolutely love it jt just flipped to flower that's an exciting time get ready for that stretch buddy i hope you got room howitzer just dropped a bunch of strains for that first organic run buddy you're gonna enjoy it i'm never going back personally daniel about two weeks of harvest someone retransplanted all plants some weird stuff going on with the lazar huh interesting you know actually oh ross goes into chat i love rosco i want to talk about this one right here two weeks from harvest we got a we got a message in the chat and i thought this was really interesting someone was talking about how they get frustrated in late harvest because you kind of get stuck on repeat you're going in there and you're looking for the trichomes and there's really not much to do you're not even mixing nutrients a lot of the time you're just watering with plain water you're doing a flush the plants aren't changing much as they say and they say that's their least favorite time and someone else chimed in and said yeah i heard dr coco say that i feel the same way i couldn't disagree more i love late flower it's one of my favorite times i think that everybody has their well listen all parts of growing are fun right let's be honest like but i think that people have their favorites and least favorites for totally different reasons even though we all love growing cannabis throughout the entire cycle you know what i mean so i thought that was funny maybe you guys can let me know and chat if uh if if you're down with the autopilot mode where you don't have to do anything see for me that's just i can be lazier um i like checking the trichomes i like forcing myself to not check the trichomes and just watch the plant for a couple days and then be like okay i think i think it's ready and then go check it out my least favorite times what are my least favorite times um probably early flower because i think that's the most stressful for me i'm worried about stretch they're not stinking yet so i can't enjoy oh that's the other thing i love going in and smelling the fresh flowers that's that's the main reason i like light flowers i'm in there whiffing it and stinking like plants all day so maybe i guess i would say early flower you know something else is i don't appreciate the clone stage very much um like you can only succeeding is like the par for the clone stage you can only let yourself down so let's see what chat says doc says autopilot uh can't wait i agree love getting down at the micro level changes happening daily that's why i'm liking the autoflowers we're gonna talk about the autoflowers in a second uh gotta say how helpful this whole group has been for a first time or okay that's great man i love that um david hates waiting yeah totally dude a lot of people would agree the great dr coco agrees it's just funny how everybody has like a different a different perspective on that close to harvest is boring as hell uh i love the last couple of weeks great pictures oh that's a good point too man if you're not a photographer the last few weeks are much i'm you're probably excited for harvest but if you're a photographer getting those bud shots that's a really good point i love all of flower stage auto is an early flower there's the good answer can i show you guys my auto hold on i got to finish this review um it smokes [ __ ] crazy it smokes crazy good it's like um the high is almost lucid but powerful like the key lime pie when i was talking to steve resiner i was kind of zoning out on that key lime pot like the key lime pie is much more uh like almost inebriating this is like a lucid but powerful kind of head buzz so the uh the buzz on the slurrican is great and then let me get a little flavor profile and then we'll pick up the autos welcome to addcast so we'll just start a death star that's one of my favorite strange dark star death star underrated some good humble experiences with those the gas comes through more than the sweetness i think that's one of the people one of the reasons people really like the the gas turps the diesel terps is they don't get lost in the flavor i find that the fruity flavors are much harder to translate once you've lit the i'm sure that has to do with the boiling points i absolutely know this to be correct just from experience right because fruity strains smell so fruity and even when you puff the joint before it's lit i just spit on the camera sorry about that even when you buff the joint before it's lit and you're breathing in you can taste that heavy heavy fruit when you light it it does come through a lot of the time especially those really good fruity strains but i think it comes through less than the skunks and the gases tend to really hit that flavor profile coffee terps also come through with that flavor profile i don't know if you guys would agree with that or not i know we gotta do something about the tp world this is the last time this is the last time all right we're getting the smoke uh smoke trap back the tp roll is is unacceptable the poop tube as i call it uh it's absolutely unacceptable okay let's go to the uh auto tent where we going here six yes there we are there's the golf clap let's upgrade it now i had a potassium deficiency have a potassium deficiency um but you can see that it's filling out really really nicely it says that it's just like 10 days from harvest which i i must have input the wrong date because it's so white-haired still um but what can i say it's happy and i got an oscillator in there it's probably a little bit too powerful and put on manual focus here you can see the deficiency in the tips there but yeah look at how white the hairs are still um but then you can't see it from here but the nug meat is extraordinarily purple there you go you can see the purple you can see the purple kind of black background there very very happy about the anvil now let me be honest the trichome coverage is not what i expected yet again it's got a while ago please ignore the sad tomatoes as well uh it's got a while ago but the trichome coverage i hope it frosts up a little bit more the smell is actually on point it's really like herbaceous and piney and uh the smell is on point so far i'm happy with the smell so i'm actually all i've heard about anvil is how it's so potent so i was expecting a little more trichome coverage and again it's got a while to go so i hope it packs on packs on some uh some goodness there what do you guys think nice looks happy a little small yeah i could have filled it more um but i just kind of let it grow wild i didn't fill the pot very much because i was concerned about it getting too big someone still never tried autos my mandalorian cut just started getting some perp it's in a 10 gallon pot but it's only filled about halfway um it's hard to make an auto big i've seen some pretty big autos buddy especially the the yeah it's a oh no mando cut oh from someone else oh yeah man oh yeah corn coast auto growers you got to get in the auto chat and post some uh post some pics because yeah autos yield incredibly well especially on a large scale too many crazy photos trains always get sucked into buying dude that's how i feel all the time that's why i actually wanted to try these uh auto strains that aren't really available as photos like i had to try anvil so i had to grow autos you know the purple micro dot gets huge joey wants to try auto so you know someone who's really picky about um potency i guess you could say just just like that that photo period [ __ ] fireness like rich is one of those people he won't touch autos and that's why every one of his pictures is like absurd um but we all have different goals and i'm i want to grow different plants that's one of my main things is like grow different plants not even cannabis a lot of the time so of course i'm going to try autos gotta try autos oh wait one second can we go back to the auto tent really quick can we go back there oh we weren't able to get the [ __ ] can you see past those green onions what do you see there we got the pina colada everybody that's the pina colada behind the green onions let me make sure it focuses there you go bring him into focus it's a little stretched i gotta raise it up um it's it's actually not that stretched yet but if i just keep that cmh up high it's going to be stretched so i actually think i'm gonna like stick a little led down there or something for some supplemental maybe but uh it's healthy it's happy it's growing that is my favorite sound effect ever all right great good to know the pina looks great guys i know it's a um white label mosca autoflower you know someone hopped in and i appreciate the person who by the way told me that um and he told me that it was white label so i just kind of the guy reminded me in the chat you know this isn't bred by mosca um so that is important to know but as long as it's fire i'm happy and it has that vigor it has that bigger dj pina in the house i really gotta harvest those onions they've been ready for harvest for a long time do we have any guests in the chat i don't want to ignore if anybody hopped in you know i was expecting a couple of guests i don't think so what up black slow sneakers jesse everybody who i didn't see here toby corn twist shifty sasha um mad farmer is going to jump in one of these times heart and soil is going to jump in one of these times coco said he's going to jump in next week this friday's episode with dr coco is really good it's super entertaining and informative we talk about reflectivity and tent walls we talk about uh like how that plays into basically the yield photon distribution in the yield and what happens when you take away walls or paintballs black it's really really cool and then also he gets into some personal stuff like the strains that personally he doesn't like that are very very popular i kind of bring up that thing i always talk about like the ones that everybody loves but for some reason you don't anyways it's a good episode and it drops friday so look forward to that super super good episode really proud of that one jake's in the chat what up what up jay let me finish this off and uh what do you think i'll check on the photo tent we'll smoke one more i got some stuff on the menu here oh you guys got to help me pick my next seeds i need help picking my next photo seeds i have the dino light here we could check out rich's buds up close that's option number two um or we could also and or i got some pickled okra from bosum shout out to bosum it's already half gone because it's so [ __ ] delicious uh and so i could eat this i'm going to eat this this is happening so what do you guys think where are we headed what do you think should we do a little dino light action do a little dynalite action pick some seeds for the next run let's do dino light let's do some dino light what's an impressive looking one here we'll show off more buds this is going to turn into a bit of a strain review episode i like that why not you never know what you're gonna get on gc tv i want it to be impromptu i want it to be live i want it to be interactive so let's jump down here and take a look at the 10th planet number one wowie zowie they just say wowie zowie now this is probably the most impressive single bud butlet in the whole sample pack i really need hold on one second guys hold on one second i'll be right back and turn another light there we are everybody we're back and take a look at the tenth planet have you ever seen anything so sexy it's got some nice purple on it i feel like the other shot was brighter i don't know if that was cambot who did that or what oh you can tell it's fire though so what kind of terps do we got on this 10th planet now this is a little fresh i can tell instantly that this needs to be cured i can just tell right away and i've smoked his 10th planet before and this hasn't come out all the way so i'm just going to call it like i sees it and then from the outside it smells a little uncured which i'm fine with i love it bust it open bitter like plant bitters kush bitter bitter kush like plant bitters like the wild grass that you break in half and you touch it and your tongue goes tongue goes numb it smells like plant bitters and just that cushy i look at my dirty nails i should have cut my nails before the stream that kind of cushy pungent aroma i guess you could say let's fire it up let's fire it up okay super sticky someone said sticky yes this is by ethos how did i not say ethos ethos genetics um super sticky man crazy what strain are you putting out that crosses of the 10th planet so there is an episode on seeds coming up this saturday that we me and rich finally get to sit down and explain the whole thing in one episode um the 10th planet cross that we're releasing to transitioning grow past members is the lunar lemon that's a super lemon haze male so so technically i believe it would be 10th planet crossed with super lemon haze f5 so that's lemon haze 10th planet that's the lunar lemon super excited for that one and then i believe that rich held on and hit the peach pie to the 10th planet as well and that's gonna be the second pollination please don't misquote me on that but i'm pretty sure he's taking the peach pie mail and he's hitting the tenth planet um please release to everyone not just transitioning members we're giving away all of our seeds that we have so we're doing our best we're getting we're getting more traction than we thought and trust me uh you are going to love the second pollination too i'm telling you man we're literally giving away all of our seats so it's not like we're holding on to anything we're just taking care of the transitioning members first because they've they came with us from grow pass and they've been members for a long time so honestly rich is more excited about the second and third pollinations someone says hayes [ __ ] yeah um gonna be a great year yeah the peach pie mail is very very impressive not to say that the super lemon haze one isn't but the peach pie mail is is insane uh so transition member is getting lunar lemon transition you gotta listen to the episode saturday we'll break it all down transitioning members are getting from the first pollination so that's that super lemon haze f5 male it is random what you're going to be receiving some are going to be more rare some are going to be less rare you're either going to receive a lunar lemon 10th planet crossed with super lemon haze or a citrus bliss which is a key lime skittles bike purple caper crossed with super lemon haze f5 and those are the two more common packs that people are going to be getting and there's a couple small ones because you gotta understand this was a very small pollination and we really didn't know that there was going to be such a rush and then the really rare ones are the f berry lemon that's f berries that's rich's strain and the lemon haze and then the coffee f5 in lemon haze those are the two super super rare ones but guys i'm telling you like rich is stoked on those but the second pollination is where it's going to be insane rich is working some crazy [ __ ] he's working with this hurricane cut right now he wants to do this yeah selective tent breeding exactly he's got multiple tents he was doing he was doing it by hand now he's doing multiple tents with open pollination um and you can contact rizzo rich so please don't don't misquote me but he explains in this episode as well so yeah he's got multiple tents and i'm telling you the peach pie male with the f berry is going to be insane the peach pie male with the slurrican i think he's putting together he wants to do like some sort of purple punch hurricane back cross so don't feel like you're missing out because you're not getting the lunar lemon i'm sure it's gonna be a great strain and i'm sure we can all trade seeds too like you know self it out do what you will with these strains they're auto seeds they're auto seeds they're regular seeds oh my god everybody just freaked out they're regular seeds so you can do what you want with them um and trust me don't feel like you missed out we're going as fast as we can peach pie ex coffee would be dopey right we're going as fast as we can and uh and you are going to get some [ __ ] fire genetics i think we're just going to give okay so obviously some members are going to get members only strains like they're going to be some strains that are only members only if you're going to be part of the community then you should get some select trains we'll probably end up doing some like first dibs type scenarios and i think we're probably probably going to give just like five dollars off for every pack you buy we want to we want to incentivize it and take care of the members so if you buy two packs you do your you've saved your fee sort of thing so we're gonna take care of it not just with member only strains we'll we'll make it nice we'll give you a little discount we'll do giveaways like crazy trust me there's gonna be a lot of seeds being given away but we gotta stockpile these [ __ ] um because you guys came out in force okay i'm glad i didn't over promise because you guys came out in force there's lots of people signing up man i'm really really happy about it so i can't thank you enough i'm supposed to be packing um this hurricane crept up on me 100 it crept up on me i'm breeding i can make some copies so here's the thing like i said rich is a very selective type person but i would love to actually get really interactive with the breeding and maybe start doing some breeding of my own especially when i get into my next place after after this place is up i'm gonna get into a bigger space and i would love to like get really interactive with you guys like if you have pollen we could do mini batches together you know i mean let rich have the fire [ __ ] and then i can really do like an interactive community type breeding thing maybe that's way down the road that was just something i was thinking that would be really cool to involve you guys so that's the idea that's the plan prediction i would love lots of extra seeds kicking my around my house yeah people saying they'd love to cool that sounds it's a no-brainer doc callux is doing breeding we're going to do a release with him i'm sure eventually um it'll be fun but we got to take our time you know i really like to focus on one thing at a time get it right don't leave anybody hanging speaking of which with those seeds i'm also sending out all the founding member shirts i have all you founding members we want to wait till the end of january in case some founding member is busy or who knows and then it gets in at the end of the month but i'm going to start shipping those out anyways appreciate you new members you old members your founding members love all of you what are we doing we're smoking 10th planet we're smoking 10th planet what was the plan though wasn't there like a oh the dino light duh good lord the dino light you guys high how's the grow cast rolling trays coming uh working with someone in slack currently i think it's um canada grower or ceo grows is going to do some small scale printing the founding members we decided to go with the shirt we were going to do rolling trays we decided to go with the shirt just because we already have it all lined up i didn't want to goof anything up why isn't this working it should slide right in i got a very special cooling tray there it is is this gonna work so high oh crap oh crap dude who says that ryan i'm gonna give you a price that's the comment we should do comments of the of the stream i'll send you some coffee this is some good old-fashioned mukbang [ __ ] is bosom even in chat oh he's gonna be so pissed he'll catch the replay buddy you make some mean okra i'm gonna i'm gonna reach in with my dirty nails full of soil and i'm going to pull it out and i'm going to eat it right into the microphone it's so good it's so damn good probiotic as [ __ ] profile this guy's cracking me up vinegar just a little bit sweet and a little bit spicy are you supposed to eat the butts i eat the butts they cut these really short too hmm lord that is some of the best okra i've ever had in my life not too sweet not too spicy then there were only like eight or ten because they use all this other stuff they'd have to eat that jordan area that's in there thank you bosa good lord i love the honest commentary like the caption you left on the gp post apologizing for the grunting listen guys i'm i'm a goofy guy i like to be goofball sometimes and i think that we've cultivated a crazy unique community here grow cast listeners are unique it is like is people who truly want to just grow better weed and help people grow better read everybody always preaches about positivity online and then you notice them attacking somebody in the very next post and it's like this community is truly that's why i put in the slack chat rules our number one goal is to help growers succeed and to share our successes and the more laser focused you can remain on that goal and the less distracted you can get with outside noise then i i'm all for that i mean unless your goals differ then please laser focus on that but for me i want to help as many people as i can i want to educate you guys and i want to celebrate successes together like what we're about to dive into here here here quote of the show i eat the butts correct sir here here all right everybody let's try it let's dive into trichome world [ __ ] a somebody says i know a thing or two about oh geez should i have taken the dino light out oh no because it would take away from the camera obviously oh my god you guys under the dyno light this is a whole nother level look at that it is pure purple it's like uh just completely saturated with anthocyanins i barely see any green you know something rich's weed looks less purple than it is because it's so covered in trichomes you don't see it's so white on the outside geez look at that not very much amber um you know what this looks like to me these trichome heads look withered it looks like i didn't store this very well oh look at that it looks like this this has been in my dry basement and uh in these plastic caps i need to store these testers better you can see those unbroken trichome heads like right there look at that oh look at that see i mean the outside layer is also going to be the one that suffers from the from the poor storage that's a good mix right there you see one kind of clear but dark almost trichome in the back left you got some cloudies and then a lot of amber you can see that the look at the size of the trichome head on the hair are you [ __ ] me what see you got to just get up in it and if you guys haven't seen the the last member trichome exploration where i went down in the grand caper i highly suggest you go back and watch those and i highly highly suggest you get one of these and just take a look at the differences in the trichomes these heads don't look particularly large they look well those kind of do they look like a medium sized trichome head and my understanding is that can affect the type of uh the type of concentrate that it's suited for if you're doing like a frenchy type hashi she's looking for like a certain size whoa look at that thing you guys what the [ __ ] are you guys seeing this have you ever seen a trichome like that before anybody that's crazy look how long those stems are what are the trichome stems called doc alex you in the chat that was the longest trichome stem i've ever seen and the largest trichome head i've seen on coming off of a hair you know what i'm really searching out for is a purple trichome head which i'm not seeing a lot of that's one thing i saw on the grand caper that really got my rocks off oh there's a little bit of blue there's a little that's not a glare no matter how i shift it there's something in that tricom head there wow wow wow wow so this is the 10th planet by ethos we all know it's good i'm grateful to have this bud i'm gonna smoke this tonight i've been saving this for you members oh yeah that's the purple i'm looking for that's just bud porn calyx yeah what's the what's the stem of the trichome saw the stock called is there a name for that we saw one that was insanely long i've never seen anything like it it was it was five times longer than it should have been there's like a long hair purple hair this is the craziest [ __ ] weed i've ever seen this is you guys go back and look at the grand caper and look at how it differed from this milky trichomes i think a lot of these like i said this might have to do with the storage conditions all right one more shot and this is an underskirt into the into the nug that's been broken open so this should be more intact heads here yep this is the inside of the nug and this is really where i see like pgr there's another long trichome stem but not quite as long it was much longer than that this is where i see like pgr dispensary weed really fall short when you crack it open and you look at the outside compared to the inside the homegrown non-chemical pgr weed uh the inside is much more trichome covered the inside of the the commercial bud is just weird that is dense have you seen a patch that dense before my friend wow wow that's a good place and some silver going on there i really differentiate the difference between clear and silver go watch again go watch the uh there's some right next to each other go watch the grand caper video and you'll see some like clear next to some some sort of silver almost cobalt blue wow okay that's enough for now dragon ball i see a dragon ball all right let's bring it back out into the real world we're back everybody what do you think another feature of grow cass tv 10th planet you guys hitting up ethos tonight or what we've talked about it before dense yeah for organic it really is man you know i've been trying to get ethos calling on forever ethos colin plays high stakes poker see you is he a good guy and everything i mean i don't know anything else about him but when i heard that i was like let's do it i don't know you can dm me your thoughts uh let's see what do we got my two-year-old homegrown is still trichome-rich in the nug but this looks amazing nice man yeah the storage conditions for sure right is that my head oh sorry about that let's grab in this uh this box here yeah the storage conditions really do really do matter that's something that i should do better on you know what's interesting doc was doc dr coco was saying how the smaller bud jars are an optimal size and he had a whole reason for it i thought that was interesting all right we got a couple more minutes here let's keep it running i want to go through some seed packs here since we're on genetics you guys can let me know what you want to see me grow so i have some blood king from urban soulja this is blood king and kingpin there's only going to be a few options here of course i'm growing the ice cream wolfman so this is probably going to be two of my three photos one or two of my three photo period plants and then uh so the choices are the blood king the island hopper f gui and kona gold that's by grassmann genetics now defunct grassman genetics supposedly and then the final option which i think you guys are going to pick is funkadelic this is cereal milk crossed with 706 skunk and uh i like i love skunk i talk about it in this cocoa episode funnily enough in a very hilarious way um and i and the cereal milk really excites me the terp drip is getting so frosty you guys and the terp drip is royal goo across with cereal milk so those are my three those are my three options here brett's in the chat what's up buddy i didn't see you hop in there everybody brett brett from uh heart and soil welcome welcome guest in the chat i am you literally popped in at the opportune time because i should only grow out one of these ice cream wolfman females so that i have room for a peruvian punch cross that you're sending me i'm super super excited for that buddy did you want to hop in do you want to chill and chat and just type with people do you want to come on voice video just let me know chat voice video we'd love to have you you know rap or not you can just sit back and chill whatever you would uh whatever you'd like let me know in chat if you'd like chat voice or video hang out grow cast tv no no a bret video uh doc i would love to have you on video buddy it's no doc knf along coming up i'm talking to uh the great brett we're bringing him on video how do we do this how do we do this doc is high but doc is always welcome on the show he knows that hello brett can you hear me let's see he's muted so i think you have to unmute from your end and we should be able to hear you boom what up buddy how are you doing you can't now i can't hear you testing one two can you guys hear brett i can hear brett okay chat brett is live oh someone's saying funkadelic evening brett he's good we're all good can you hear us i can't can you hear me yes now you are good to go how's it going my friend oh good just uh just uh picking some some bad seeds out got a bunch of new genetics that we just got done shucking and you know just a little afghani hindu kush heirloom uh project that we have going so that's what i've been doing all day did you just hold hold that up again i had you unpinned i want to see that yeah man i'm super excited about uh again this is this is brett from heart and soil you recently heard the breeder feature he went to mozambique there it is the afghanistan he went to mozambique went to uh mint gelato let's see uh mandarin skittles came out fat all those are crossed with afghani yeah red-headed stranger oh man uh pink pez um alien apple tropsanto green crack oh no god man just a little bit a little bit of everything thrown in there a little old school old school for the you know for the heads dude you were making my day and my members day that's amazing i'm really when can we look forward to these actually being uh you know like uh yeah for the uh instagram followers or anybody uh listening today they're available right now there you go everybody damn you've been working your ass off man yeah i crushed it today yeah i'm working with my artist um now to get some artwork done for the for the larger quantities but uh but yeah they're available right now nice man nice i would love to get my hands on some of those so tell me about the you know what you got whatever you want so you're amazing man tell me about i would love to talk about the differences in the actual land race because here's one of the reasons i really like you man because we love growers of all kinds here salt growers organic growers land rice growers hybrid growers you kind of straddle land racing hybrid you take these land races where you don't just come and release them and say hey check out this new unique land race which is awesome you hybridize them just enough to get that fire fire type of result but i want to know about the actual heirloom strains and how they differ from mozambique to peru to afghanistan you know uh so the reason you know i've been growing a long time but the reason i started uh this breeding project was i went to peru and i found this really interesting sativa um that you know from peru that just wasn't like normal sativas um so you know a lot of land races you know are wild you know they're lanky they're airy they're you know lower thc you know a lot of fiber going on there um just depends on what on what pheno you find but you know a lot of the african stuff um thai stuff but you know i'm trying to find uh you know in those in those genetic gene pools you know there's there's some thicker varieties you know some shorter varieties and even with the lenkier stuff you know just trying to find something that packs uh packs the punch and or uh you know yields a little better than traditional land races so i'm trying to like work through those land races and find the best of the best um because you know land race can be finicky you know um it's difficult to breed sometimes you know when you're selecting a male you're kind of taking a a big gamble because you know it's an untested male um you know and you're doing a lot of uh selection just based off of feeling and you know a couple different attributes um you know for the first round so um that's kind of the challenge with with land races you know no one's no one i know has grown a lot of the stuff that i'm that i'm growing and and finding males and females and doing the hybridization with but you know that's that's the fun about land races is you know you kind of find something that that you like um but that's kind of that's kind of the idea of these lines you know i do i try to do um you know a pure cross you know in this case an afghani to afghani and then find you know phenos and strains that will complement that afghani and try to bring things out that i i really like you know um you know a lot of land races are you know really resistant to pests and pathogens because they gotta you know withstand all the elements and stuff like that so they're a little tougher where some of these you know hype varieties are a little bit more coddled and you know less vigorous and things like that so i'm trying to you know combine the two so hopefully find the best of both worlds we can find some of this hurricane mac you know fire but also put it on a structure or plant that is you know resistant to pm and you know grows twice as fast as you know the normal mac you know that's kind of the idea there so you know with the blue dream for example i've found that it's really resistant to pm so that's kind of the project that i'm working on with this is you know the uh the land race you know afghani across the blue dream try to find a a crazy uh you know um pheno that's also resistant to pm that's kind of the the idea behind these you know these crosses trying to unlock some of those you know uh maybe broken gene you know gene bar you know gina somewhere down the line so yeah absolutely man that makes perfect sense and combining those two like you said i i imagine that you're looking for the dominant genes that are desirable but if you have some resistant land race train and you put it to blue dream i imagine you never have to worry about powdery mildew again some strains are just basically immune to powdery mildew right yeah and that and then blue dream has been you know in my years of cultivation you know bubba kush is one of the worst oh really yeah it uh for me i like bubba here in colorado it was one of the toughest to grow because it just got pm like a i mean just attracted like a magnet whereas the blue dream would be in the same exact room and you wouldn't see a spot on there that's so i found the old school blue dream that i had back back in the day and um and we'll see we'll see what happens but that's they also look like some of the best seeds i've seen in a long time too nice you can see i'm very very close it's probably pretty hard but they're nice and dark you know big fat seeds that's a nice if you want a nice haul a nice load of seeds you have there pardon the pun doc alex asking in chat do you find it takes a couple out crosses to reach a more modern bud structure with the typical land straits uh land race you know um a lot of the f1s that we did from the peruvian line the original line yeah some of them were a little bit you know um more airy and stuff like that but we found the nancy cut in that peruvian punch f1 line um and that's one of the strongest i mean it looks i mean i don't know if you have if you have a pick i mean you probably don't but um it's you know it's purple it's dense it's cookie it's uh so it's mendo breath crossed a purple bunch across the peruvian heirloom and that you know in the f1 we found a winner that's sitting in uh um in youth flora and they're it's crushing it for them you know same thing with the lares trek alien rock candy um 2.0 basically s1 across to the heirloom and and that one too it's just it's banging out for them f1s you know um f1s from land race hybrids you know in dispensaries you know finishing in you know eight and a half to nine and a half weeks so i ideally you'd want to do you know some some you know some more breeding down the line but um we found some you know some some down-to-earth winners in that in that f-1 um lineage so it all depends really it really all depends yeah so um there's you know there's a wide variety in f1s but there's even more variety and and variants in f2s um i've found um so the f2 you know what sometimes the f1s are even more uh they're more more um similar um to each other than the f2s um so i've taken a few things to f2 um like the peruvian punch being one of them and um and obviously the genetics a little bit thicker you know a little bit uh you know more structure in the in the f2s i'm finding but there's still there's still winners to be found in those f1 genetics so um don't count them out you know hell yeah man all about it uh what's his ig heart and soil project you'll find him on instagram lex lowe with the question do you think tech like crispr could play a major role in cannabis breeding um crispr uh please i'm not familiar with that the answer is yes it's that gen it's a gene editing program but it's something you can actually do at all there's a really there's a really great documentary on it my wife just watched it god i cannot think of the name right now it's killing me but it's good because it shows it's really it's really um even-handed it shows that like some people are trying some things that are really really dangerous and actually hurting each other other people are doing miraculous things and it's kind of all over the place and for sure we're going to be able to edit cannabis like that um i wonder how much of a market there's going to be for that cannabis because i feel that growers are particularly sensitive to that but i don't know right yeah i don't know i think you know you can you can do a lot with you know what gene editing and gmo type stuff but um there's just there's a spark in nature that that we can't ever replicate you know so i i'll always be um i'll always be breeding trend trying to breathe the natural way as much as i can and uh and trying to find that new that that this new unlocked um genetics yeah and honestly i think it's here to stay i think it's going to be another dividing issue and i think it's just going to be part of the grow world and i hope that it doesn't divide us too much it is yeah it's just a matter of opinion and now you got you got you know feminized seeds you got you know you know regular seeds you got and you'll have gene edited seeds you know and yeah and everyone's gonna you know have their opinions and we already have that you know we have the led versus hid we have the organic versus synthetic i just and that's where we always say on this show i just want to teach everyone how to grow better weed and get it out there just like you as long as you're growing something you know i don't care how you're doing it as long as you're you know uh you know playing playing a part and following uh you know your you know your uh your path your desire your passion the path yeah so it's like hey on synthetic at least i'm an organic guy but i've grown synthetic a lot and as long as you're growing you know um we're on the same team you know i love that love that man listen uh this is kind of also what i want to get back to what i said earlier someone's asking what's the key trait of the original peruvian heirloom you smoked in peru that made you want to breed with it and i would like to ask you about the mozambique as well that same question yeah so the peruvian um i found that it had a lot of the same sativa effects you know when smoking it um and a really bright um really bright flavor it reminded me of like a pink peppercorn flavor it was like a spicy but sweet kind of almost almost floral yep spice you know like a sweet pink peppercorn sweet spice you know i like that and it had that you know same sativa uplifting effect without the without the paranoia but the buds were so dense um and it was just an interesting uh thing because all the other you know flower that we had gotten in peru was um just really airy and it was still good but um this was just a unique bag and i just and i found you know i found some seeds in there brought them back and uh and tried to find a fino uh male and two you know females that were especially in the male side that were just a little bit shorter um a little bit more broad leaf uh than the typical sativa um so that's what i really liked about it and just had a um it just had an interesting look to the plant too i mean but the effect um and the the fact that the bug was still you know looked like chunky bud and not just some sativa you know dust um i was like oh this is this is interesting so that was the thing that piqued my interest first and foremost um but then also you know peru is just the history of peru and the history of uh agriculture in peru is really fascinating to me that they have the most uh varieties of corn you know the most varieties of potatoes you know some of the you know the best breeding projects and you know in uh in the world in terms of uh you know agriculture and food comes from stems from peru so what's the diff you know definition or what's the difference you know in cannabis you know i'm sure there's all kinds of uh different meeting paths you know that came from all over the world in peru um so there's a lot of different variants and just a lot of cool history that i found and that's why i started my projects with the peruvian project um and you know then once i got back and found the you know the pop the seeds and i started you know working through the plants just the plants were super interesting and and i'm i'm gonna do an f2 variety of the uh peruvian bunch down the lines i like it so much um the mozambique line um i had a good friend of mine good girl friend of mine uh out here in denver that had family out in africa and i just talked to him and i said um you know i'm always looking for you know good quality land race um verifiable genetics and his family you know i've been collecting some stuff from mozambique and from malawi um and he was gracious enough enough to uh to gift those to me so i could do the project and um you know the more i grew those um you know they're a little bit they're more on the sativa side for sure um but what i really found interesting in there in those was just their resistance and their resilience um you know they're a little a little more lanky but the heat tolerance uh the drought tolerance uh the resistance to you know um to bugs you know um was really was really strong that makes sense i mean i don't think africa is particularly a hospitable climate for a lot of different plants i mean certainly for some you know coffee and certain things do well there but that would make sense and it's interesting because it's always like it's also almost like um it's cool when it's almost like the locals have pre-selected it for you like you had someone there the reason they probably had that accessibility is because it was he probably liked it that's probably why he gave it he doesn't want to give you some [ __ ] he probably was like this is what's special for the region we're really big yeah the guards the spice trader that actually made the malawi across the mozambique um uh it had the fattest seeds that i've i've seen in a long time yeah so i'm not the size of the seed has everything to do with it but the larger the seed generally the larger the fruit and uh you know i'm all about large fruits yeah it's dope dude i love it yeah um i wanted to say yeah i remember what i wanted to touch on you were talking about peru i agree the south american when i was in colombia it's a farming people like it's reflected in the culture it's even reflected in the laws in colombia you're allowed to grow your own cannabis and consume your own cannabis but you're not allowed to sell it at all so it's like it's interesting when agriculture out inside or outside of cannabis becomes part of the culture because you know you're going to find some really special cultivars there whether you're after coffee or a fruit tree or some [ __ ] fire buds you know yeah they're trying to find you know things that work for them and they can support their family with over and over and they're going to be dependent you know so that's you know that's why i like to go to the locals they've been growing things you know over and over and over again so give me your favorite you know and i'll try to um you know spice spice up the the gene full with those uh yeah you're gonna you're gonna have a lot of requests after this so they say that your account is private so you're gonna have to let everybody in because everybody's like a sick convo somebody says as soon as i get off i like breath i'll make sure to let everybody in you know we just ooh we are we partaking oh constantly i smoke pot okay heavy smoker what do you got oh geez see this is really cool guys i i've always wanted grow cass to be like pro oriented and like not too much smoking and stuff but this is perfect what growcast tv is for this is exactly what i wanted brett just bought it i just really did i just really needed this too i was like oh we're smoking i haven't smoked a couple hours because i've been oh perfect light it up man this is this is the new spot this is the perfect place for people to to to light up and talk more about smoking and strain reviews the perfect place for people to just pop in we're going to be live at the same time every wednesday for the rest of eternity you've seen the ads so um yeah that goes for youtube right yeah so i really appreciate the invite and uh i almost forgot i was like sitting there i was literally sitting there picking seeds are you picking bad seeds and i'm like i forgot something what did i forget i was like i thought i thought it was this was thursday but uh it was thursday but i look at my like damn it it's today and i was like so glad to catch you you know what i should really start doing this is hold me to this chat i got to think out loud now because i'm you know self producing here i should start releasing the clips on wednesdays only i need to ingrain in everybody's heads not just the listeners and the members are awesome i send them they show up they're dope but even guests like everybody needs to know grow casts grow cast tv is wednesday nights i'm hitting my thc limit for my threshold of being able to host a show coherently um and i think the audience likes that they like to see me exceed that so all right let's do it i should have got a dab ready everyone's dabbing damn i did my best that was a monster dab double dab chat's getting it dabbers up says chat whoo shaka brah awesome man yes yes we got some we got some oleo rosin from denver what we smoking on i think that's some uh orange sherbet oh yeah oh yeah love it hey we're uh we usually end at the top of the hour here but but it's i do want to get a full answer from you here what's next like you just took down this huge this huge thing of all these afghans do you have anything on the line are you gonna focus on distributing what's next um so you know this new line just is about to drop we're gonna be working on the artwork um for this new line you know all of our stuff is made once never made again in its original form so we like to you know pay it a little homage and and do some fun artwork you know um it's just you know i do it partially for you guys but really i do it for me you know because who who doesn't want to name a strain and who doesn't want to you know come up with some fun artwork for it so we're we're doing that next you know that's gonna be the next project brett you're one of the few people who understands almost nobody's doing original art this is our wolf ice cream wolf man i love your original art for your every one of your strains has its own picture and yeah the peruvian line it's the worst for me we're getting started so we didn't we didn't really do that um but for the mozambique line we have uh you know an image for every strain the peruvian punch f2 we have an image for every strain the second wave we do and we're going to try to keep that going um with the skeleton hand holding up the ruby diamond that's dope as [ __ ] man i really think that that's a huge hole in most breeders game is that they don't do either original art or like coherent art so i always look forward to your posts and i always look at the name and i look at the art and it's enjoyable it's it's tough because you know obviously the you know breeding comes first right you know that the plants have to you know come first and the genetics have to be quality you know um but you know if you got that why not come up with a cool name and come up with some cool art and have a little fun with it you know because it's not going to be around forever you know and uh we're not going to be around forever like let's have some fun let's do this let's do this thing you know i feel like i just knocked you off track though weren't you talking about the next strains and i like instantly change the subject to art yeah but um yeah i think the next the next line we'll probably do you know we have we have a lot of seed stock to work with um we're probably gonna do some f2s um i'm thinking um the mac um we did uh the machu mac which is uh mac cross ii um proving punch that's the one that it was that i really wish i got my hands on when he sent me the list i saw it was crossed out it was sold out in 24 hours yeah it was quick yeah it went real quick so i mean who doesn't like mac so i'm very happy i'm appreciative but that is the one where i might just hurt my heart a lot of people didn't it was hard you know it was hard um to tell people to tell people no you can't have that because it's gone it is tough um but uh so we have some siberian land race um that we that we were working with some siberian uh super autos um so those are kind of interesting we might do some something with those um how would you define a super auto what's that how would you define a super auto so apparently you know i just got schooled up by the uh by the by the russians um they told me that the super auto is is just it's an auto but it grows a lot faster and it ends up being a bit much larger plant than most autos you know so a lot of others you know will finish it like some of them like a foot or two tall you know uh three feet tall max you know for some of them but apparently this one can get up to like five feet tall six feet tall um so it stretches a little more it's a little bit uh more lanky and then also i guess that's the super portion of it uh it's just it's a constantly you know less less lag time you know and more more plant matter so it's a that's a finicky one but that's a real adventure to take you know um this you know auto from from siberia you know it's uh kind of and they're really tiny seeds that may or may not fit our our mold we're gonna do some testing with them uh we want we always want to produce you know quality seeds and quality plants and if we can't guarantee that we're not gonna we're not gonna keep going with a project so that you know that's the idea of the peruvian or the heart and soul project it's like the project never stops you know sometimes um we we never really know where we're going next have you thrown out some things before that's really so to answer your question i have no effing idea we're going to grow these seeds out we're going to do some phenol hunting we got a bunch of different things in the garden from the peruvian punch f2 line or f2 line we're going to probably do some f2s from those so like you know the machu macarin f2 uh the can of banana uh we're gonna f2 i want both of those man i'm [ __ ] ones you know i mean so here's like you know like the artwork you're talking about so these are the stickers yeah you know uh ghost punchers sucker pucker punch just hit me up first when those drop i do not i i don't expect or want charity you've been kind enough already you sent me three packs for free thank you everyone go give him a follow he's he's officially a friend of girl cast i'm gonna give away some of those packs i can't i can't grow all three of them i'm sure so i'm sure i'll give away members let's do something there too um you know the mozambique line i have a ton of stock of um i would love to to donate some and for some giveaways that would be incredible look at that chat look at that what a nice guy so anyways let me know on that mac i'll purchase some from you i need to buy the mac i need to buy the can of banana this is a this has got to be a grocery the next two projects coming up um and we might do one more round with our peruvian uh punch male it's he's so studly he's just so studly normally we like let males go we'll breed with them and then we move on but this one is just so impressive we've kept them around and there's a lot of interesting ladies in the tent um in the 10 by 10 uh room uh with it and um so we're gonna let the plants decide on on who on who gets to go go oh yeah chat's blowing up by the way everybody's saying thank you nice someone just screamed ah another person said hell yeah someone said [ __ ] yeah one person's just literally exclaiming exclaiming exclamation point happy man that's dope we'll link up i appreciate you brett

the show [Music] what's up everybody employed mastermind here in Valhalla cannabis light and we have a very special review today this is the botanist has now put out products and they actually did a project with you guessed it would word make a fire rock and so now they've created a vape cartridge this basically fire rock or woodward flying cannabis flower or trim and they've used this to make TAC baked cartridges so here's some material that I received when I purchased my product and it says here the botanist babe Carter's art strain specific makes feature complex cannabinoid profile is crafted to unlock the natural benefits of the cannabis plant this is a targeted recipe our craft extraction techniques achieve a uniquely potent and truly flavorful product only one ingredient cannabis the botanist cartridge features a highly refined distillate based enhanced with a complex minor chemin of cannabinoids I can never say that right kind of annoys viana TC unlocking minor cannabinoids our distillate is refined using a proprietary post extraction process that captures beneficial minor cannabinoids that enhance the effect of the TC resulting in a smooth and highly potency product mmm purity no fillers or botanicals our base will never use any harsh fillers like vitamin E acetate or I like this one both technical terpenes I learned a lot about those recently our oil contains one ingredient cannabis okay this is single source terpenes stay true to distrain each botanist vape highlights the natural turf pain profile of its cannabis strengths our small batch extraction process gently recovers her opinions truly reflecting the plants full flavor profile in the finished product traceability know what you're buying our oil is made using ingredients that can be traced from sea to sail to ensure transparency testing results for our products are always available ok botanist and here's a close-up of the card now you can get this at the botanist I'm not sure if in a dispensaries had this yet this product costs fifty four dollars with tax in Columbus Ohio I purchased two products I purchased wedding cake cuz we've all heard of wedding cake right and I purchased the sunset sherbert we've all heard of that too also another great fire rock wood wood product so let's talk about the expects here the specifications the total THC on the wedding cake is three hundred and forty eight milligrams of THC 0 milligrams of CBD and then the other cabin noise it says CBG 11 milligrams this was manufactured on April 24th and packaged on May the fifth so this is literally just hit the market so you know today is May the 6th so this just got put in the box but it was also tested back on April 29 so it was also recently tested on the Box on the front it says 348 milligrams and it also indicates this is sixty nine point six two percent THC these are half gram cartridges so basically for $108 you'd have yourself a whole gram and you can obviously mix and mingle that and get a couple different ones now they also had another strain there which is by Buckeye relief called ninety two cookies I didn't try that one yet because I haven't tried to flour yet so once I tried to flower from Buckeye relief on a 90 cookies then I will try the cartridge so I can give you a review on that also one let you know that there are some other products that botanist will have these are the tinctures and that will be in a different video so we're not going to go too far into it now but I will tease that for you my car got a little wet you know how it be it happens when you're trying to wipe it down with with a wipe so you don't get any germs on it anyway so I have not opened these so imma let you guys get the same unboxing experience then I'm gonna have we're gonna experience this together and like I said I'm gonna hold this back so you get a little bit light on it but like I said I'm gonna turn this here and maybe we can see a little bit better and there's a little wood there on the box so there's a tab here and then there's also a seal there I don't know if you can see that on camera now but there is a seal there and so I'm gonna go ahead and open the one I want to open the one I've been rushing to open is the wedding cake so I'm cracking this seal baby doc at this crack with my nails and then I'm gonna I'm gonna pull out this little brown tab here I'm assuming that's what you're supposed to do so we're going to try this together folks and no-knock whoo-hoo now here's a surprise guys here is the cartridge interesting enough they have put a piece of styrofoam in there not sure I think that's just to stabilize it so that it doesn't get moved around I think that's good to keep it from being disoriented up close I could show you check it out now there is a washer on here which a lot of you familiar what this is for a different type of battery that has a magnetic mechanism on it so I'll show that again and then obviously this just screws off okay now it's just a regular 510 thread many of you asking me about that this is it guys this is a cartridge only product surprise no battery oh my gosh how are we going to hit this thing so we have a couple of different options first thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to try to use a battery that came with the Cure Ohio cartridge for comparison here's a cure Ohio oil half a gram and here is the botanist Woodward oil obviously there is a color difference don't let that concern you oops good thing I didn't break that would be all that so many of you know the cure Ohio battery is reusable so I'm just going to screw this on here and we're gonna find out if the wool it's a work for us so here we go wedding cake by Woodward processed by botanist and here we go it does work impressions this is smooth it is not harsh I can taste a little bit of wedding cake but not a whole lot so I like the packaging I think it's smart to have a little styrofoam in there to keep it stabilized so it doesn't fall around in there and maybe get turned upside down the package is designed to hold it so that it doesn't have anything going on with it as far as its orientation I mean there are a few little bubbles in here but honestly folks that's not uncommon with vape oils especially when they're loading them hot so there could be able to few little bubbles I am but it is a very smooth bait but I'm looking at terpene taste and flavors I'm not really tasting any wedding cake terpenes that I'm familiar with and you know just for reference I currently have some wood wood wedding cake folks so I'm sure I'm not tasting turps on this so we've went through that one and you know I don't smell in terms either but what I could also do is I could put this on an aftermarket battery just to be sure and see if we get any difference because those batteries are pre-configured at a certain voltage and I've learned that sometimes having something at a different voltage will affect your experience in your taste so I have to set at three point five volts it's still very smooth it is a very smooth like this doesn't hurt your throat this is very smooth but I just don't really taste anything so I'm set that aside for right now this is a vision to spin our battery by the ladies man these are like tanks the next one we're gonna go ahead sunset server so I again box is the same same packaging specs comparing it to the Woodward let's see the total TAC for the sunset server is 346 milligram point 95 346 point nine five milligrams and also the CBG is 11 milligrams I will talk more about what CVG is comparing to CBD in a later video so or you can just you know look it up we'll talk about CVG and CBN as well okay this one package exactly the same way the oil quality is the same a nice clear gold color and I'm gonna do the same test I'm gonna put it on the trusty cure Ohio battery but you before I do that OPSEC removed a little magnetic adapter which comes in handy if you have one of those devices that has a magnetic battery and I go guys now lift the sunset server I taste I taste it I can taste a little bit more Terps terpenes with the sunset server it reminds me of the flower so I would say both of them hit smooth I would say there's even maybe a little bit more I mean this again maybe a little bit more of a bite then with the wedding cake feel a tickling my throat a little bit but is it art trying to sit on this and hit this all day probably so yeah I'm gonna do the same thing before I'm gonna swap it with my vision here and I'm gonna see how it tastes with the vision like I said and I've got the vision at the lowest voltage was 3.5 volts if you want to know I have no idea what the state has their batteries and hopefully set could be higher could be less we'll have to find out so here we go okay did we get our malfunction well that's interesting guys it's not working so let me try to turn yourself and this is a fully charged battery so let's see okay there we go interesting I had to turn my battery off and turn it back on all right so it's been a couple minutes and let's talk about effects so what did I notice because I'm familiar with both of both of these strains personally overall I don't have any immediate psychoactive I'm not overwhelmingly getting a head rush type feeling which is good I don't want something that's just gonna take my head off and make me feel like I'm getting ready to have a headache so I want a balanced effect not looking to just be you know out of my comfort zone I want something that makes me feel comfortable when I I'm very picky about fake cards and if you know me and watching other videos how many babe card videos have you seen so I don't do very many so whenever I do do one is because I want to find out if things are improving or if I'm gonna learn something about it and so other bait cars that I've tried I don't quite remember them having the CBG in it and so I need to do some more research about CBG before I start trying to tell you about CPG so I'm gonna do some homework on that and when I come back with a 92 cookies fake card that's when I'm gonna have a little bit more information about the CBT other than what I currently know now which is what it says on Wikipedia so I want to know some more about it and I want to have some more experience with this product that way I can tell you a little bit more details about what I'm feeling overall over time but immediately this definitely helps me with a little bit of my anxiety and this is actually a little bit relaxing to me and that's what I'm starting to feel as this video goes on normally I will take a break and come back but the effects are more immediate with this cartridge so there's no need for me to take a break and come back I'm already feeling some positive effects of the product so what I think the feedback will be is that the packaging is great I'm very satisfied with the packaging I think this is just big enough I like the slide out factor you just have to get used to pulling this brown part out to slide it out I think that was smart I think putting a little piece of styrofoam in there was a smart idea guys so if you guys have the botanist owners of the botanist if you're watching this I think you did a good job with your packaging the only concern I might have is that if we have a lot of these stacked up like this depending on where they are in a dispensary that the oil is gonna lay down and then you know I guess we need to find out it's getting this box stand on its own and I don't think that it can and so what I'm thinking is well let's see yes it can't stand us home so part of with for me I keep all my oil Carter just a nice write up so you know the easiest thing you could do you know is take maybe one of your other containers and just take your battery and set them in there and this is an easy way for people to keep your cartridges from being like you know all weird-looking when you pick them up never let your cartridge be stored laying down sleeping so I think botanist is showing me right here as I'm moving them around on my desk that this cartridge box can stand up on its own and so it's a product good idea when you're not using the cartridge maybe keep it stored in a box standing up near where it's not gonna have a lot of activity you know I'm a bum push it up against my desk I'm hitting my desk and the cartridge does not fall that the box is not falling over and so you you're doing better than I thought bottom this with the box I mean because size and dimension matters when you're trying to have something stored and something convenient so the box is standing on its own even though it's empty I have a good thought that it will probably do the same thing even if we put the cartridge in there so my opinion I think this is a good product for you to try if you're a person that likes bait cartridges if you are someone that is looking for a lot of flavors I think there's still some room to roll I think that they should work on adding a little bit more terpenes I want to really get that cake flavor when I hit the cartridge but at the same time I'm very satisfied with the effects of how I feel the house affecting my middle and I'm glad that is not overwhelming me or causing me to feel like I am just so impaired that I can't speak properly and I'm glad that is helping me with my anxiety and also with a little bit of focus and concentration so with that saying I'm gonna recommend that you do try these products and give them your honest review and your honest opinion and you can also send in your reviews to me at Ohio cannabis live at gmail.com or you can send me your videos through the messenger and I will happily share any videos or be glad to do an interview with you / zoom or Skype or messenger so that we can have an honest discussion about how you feel about this product because that's gonna be the new thing now as we're gonna start doing things together since we're all at home or on limited restrictions in some cases we have to start doing more stuff to interact with each other instead of just watching videos on videos are great but just the one sided video can get kind of boring so going forward we're gonna try to have some interaction and have some more people in these videos besides just me and I want to hear what other people's feedback is it's not all about just my feedback but your feedback matters too and that's why I added the feedback section on my website wlky.com and you can go there and give some growers some feedback and let them know how you really feel and I think that's important for the companies to grow so make sure that that like subscribe button I'm gonna go ahead and wrap this video and we'll see you again next time [Music] [Music]", "hdQt-Ej-2Ho": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with tokentim420 this is a florida medical marijuana review for those over the age of 18 and medical marijuana patients all right like say hi to everybody out there if you haven't subscribed hit that subscribe button down there leave me a thumbs up thumbs down let me know how you're feeling tonight what you're smoking on token on what you're moved in um so today we got the token tim's mad scientist lab we are going to be making some rosin vape carts on our own save a lot of money um i will like give a shout out real quick um i got some of that girl scout cookie now this stuff was only coming in at 15 it was minnie's i couldn't see that online um and i'm not a fan of girl scouts but this stuff totally changed my mind this stuff's real good um nice flavor to it nice high to it not quite a sativity ah as sativa leaning as the last stuff i've had that was the girl scout cookie so like i said not bad at all all right so we're gonna make our own rosin vape carts now you guys know i've tried true leaves i just went and got another one we got the skunk ape blue river rosin we tried both of them for cure leaf i left the other box in there from the select um some people was asking if this was live resin or not to me it didn't really taste like that tastes more like the terpene like the cannabis infused terpene vape pens exactly like them so if you could find those vape pens cheaper i'd go with them but we're going to show you a way to do it real cheap and i tell you what they taste amazing all right so we squirted a little distillate in there i got i was trying some of them i got a little tore up had to take a break my water cooled off so it didn't work so this is take two on the video honestly um that's that papaya cake rosin from move or from true leave sorry um in there and then the distillate we're using because it's an indica uh the indica uh bubba kush coming at 78 percent so all i did was microwave some water and a shot glass put it in there you don't want to get it up past the stopper there you don't want to get back in there i want to get this part done before it cools off again so there was probably about three left in here on this syringe it's got a little bubble but it was about at three i put a little bit in there already so when it's warmed up it's just gonna go real easy in there yeah i guess we're gonna use all of it all right that's all of it are all that we're gonna mess with getting out at the moment now if you notice the pad i'm using is that five dollar baking sheet which is silicone so it's the same thing as a dab mat that i got on amazon it was like five bucks or two for five i can't remember videos if you go back as while back i just cut a piece off to fit the table so i didn't have to clean the whole table off so now all we're going to do is we're going to take this and we're going to mix it up now i have made a few of these before i did warm the rosin up on the one and then by time i got out here it was just kind of like a hardened back up more like a caramel just letting it sit out at room temperature seems to work better let me pull it off the view for a second and make sure i got it mixed evenly sometimes the distillate wants to stay on the side but as you know the rosin carts are about 60 bucks apiece and they're only half grams so this distillate i believe was 60 bucks from grow healthy which truly has them for 60 most everybody's around the 60 mark for a full gram so this right here will fill two vape carts um and then the rosin's uh 75 gram so you basically for 135 you're getting two grams um which you would only get one gram buying it by the vape cards like i said these are half gram vape carbs these aren't full grams only half grams if you also notice on true leaves the thc is always really low i'm using 80 distillate and 80 um rosin so these are still up in the 80 percent so we're gonna use our um we had some la confidential co2 cart which i got another one of these so we will be reviewing it later then all we're going to do is unscrew the top here now i will say that it helps to have a decent dab tool the dab tool i'm using is the one i got for five dollars uh from banger supply and if you use code token tim you'll save 10 at banger supply they got these for like 5.99 so try to keep it up here in the camera see what we can do so mainly what we're going to do is we're going to take the flatter end um or either end the flatter end kind of works better towards the end and we're just going to get a glob out there like that this stuff's stringy and looking in the camera is a pain in the butt all right we'll hold that there and then what i do is just press it around the stem and then put it down in there so let me go over here and do this where you guys can still see it but yeah you guys can see it there now i'm gonna go ahead and use the flat end just kind of scoop out a big scoop like that and then smooth on that thing and it's easier just to push it right down in there you guys can see that just kind of pushing it down now it doesn't go real good um so there is a trick we'll use here in a second once we get it pretty blobbed up all right trying to it's hard for me to focus i need new glasses so i keep pulling it off the frame to me to be able to see it now i'm just scraping all the gunk out of the jar real good i'm gonna do the same thing i'm gonna go over to a clear spot each time and just wipe it off on that and then take the tool focus there we go and slide it down that thing it's not wanting to focus if it does go on the outside just scoop it back up all right we've got about all of it now the first one i tried to wait for it to go down and it just didn't seem to go down quick enough so i'm gonna take a little torch and i'm gonna heat the glass down in here i'm not gonna heat the concentrate i'm just gonna do it like that without burning my fingers off hopefully so i'm just going to slightly warm the glass going around you can see it's starting to drip there where we warmed it up so just real quick that one bubbled on me and then it starts to it'll just start to run down in there then go ahead and take the tool and access there's a little bubble there we're going to pop that scrape all that off on there try not to get it inside there for sure we've already got it about half full it doesn't take a lot um a lot of concentrate that is you can see i only had about three in that syringe and i only put a couple dabs in there it really wasn't a lot so again we're going to take a little bit sometimes with this i can just scrape it right across the glass or like i said just roll it around that and whatever's left there the mouthpiece fits real tight over that silicone ring and it just pushes everything else down let's get a real good scrape on this jar real quick and then i'll show you the other ones i made and talk about them a little bit now i will say the flavor on this stuff is just amazing it tastes just like just like doing the dab let's scrape this off of there real quick all right now i could play around and get some more out there but i want with you guys i'll just dab that out with my dab straw later so we're going to stick that on see how it just squishes that on through there and we're going to screw that on now i found with some of them you'll have to go back again with your torch and this one's a little thicker you can see it's still thick so i'm just barely going to heat it if it starts to bubble you want to quit so i have to look at this real good and it'll take a second for the heat to transfer through to the glass still a little creamy there's still some up there at the top there we go this one must be a little thicker glass than the other one i had we're just going to hit it a few times now if you notice when we did that it kind of cleared up a little bit not a lot but so you can see the little holes down in there now where the wick is you'll see how that cleared it up some and i didn't bring the battery out i told you i got pretty medicated all right but we have made a few other ones um so i made one yeah this is it i used the move vape pen and this it worked great for about two days and the battery died and if you can see right here at the bottom it's got little um holes i thought i could take it off with a battery i grabbed it with some pliers and apparently i couldn't so i shattered it what i'm going to do is unscrew the lid i'm not going to do it now because i want the glass to fall off and then i'm going to heat the banger up and i'm going to put it in there upside down like that and just let all that wax come out now this was the um i used the skunk ape and the bubba kush um the skunk ache ape was from move or true leave again sorry i don't know i got move on the head now i did put some of the thca powder in that one also and it was really really really tasty tasted just like the skunk ape tastes a lot better than the skunk ape rosin car which we'll get we'll have a video on that later but like i said really really really tasty um and the thc is going to be up there and it's a cheaper cheaper thing so i'll show you the other one i did but first we got to do it sorry it's alive all right so i did make a live resin vape cart um this is with moves rainbow train wreck and you can see how it's cleared up a little bit more i hit it with a little bit more of the torch um but it tastes amazing there's a little clog there that's why heated this one up it was clogging a little bit but man it tastes amazing and the high on there i'm telling you the high is better than any of these vape pens i've had yet and i gotta write what i put on this one so i don't forget that's the rainbow train wreck which we know it's live rosin because that's all there is um but the skunk ape one i'm telling you you know vape card even these i hit these um you know 10 good hits off of them to catch a little buzz um i was only hitting that skunk ape three three little hits and i was blasted i the dying i made that i rolled up a joint um and after my three hits i had like this much left of the joint and i looked at that i'm like hey no way i'm lighting that thing back up so it tore me up pretty good so if you guys want to give it a try like it's not really messy you do have a little bit of residue left in these so you could either take a bud and roll it around in there and then roll in some keep and make your own moon rock or you could just take your dab straw and hit it you could also take a hair dryer and melt it down so it would get it in a corner better to get a little better dab out of it but if i mess around with it with like this one that has that little scoop on the end i can pretty much get everything out of that jar there won't be anything left and especially it's starting to cool off now because it's getting ready to rain here but especially when i'm working in a hot garage and it pretty much stays warm here anyways it makes it easier to work with it's not coming back up so it's easier like i said just to push push it all the way around to the corners i just take this one the longer straighter one and get the sides like that and what i'll do with this is dab it that's what i do with the other stuff that's why i mark the charge but i think it rub keeps rubbing off with my fingers so that one's uh we just made the papaya cake so that was this one we're just gonna put a pea on the jar so i remember but yeah that's what i'll just use when i come out tonight i'll scrape that again you can see like i said i just got that little bit i wiped off on the edge there just by taking it around a little bit and just keep scraping it back on the side and then when you get enough to take a dab you just take it all off of there and dab away and like i said with the other with the rounded one it works a little better getting everything out there real good this one's not bad but the other one's better so like i said it doesn't take long to get you a dab and then just drop the dab tool in the dab rig and you're good so that's my take on making my own vape cards um the live resin i did use the co2 true clear the sherbert so i figured it'd have a nice cleaner flavor but this stuff here wasn't bad um i haven't tried this one i just made yet of course i didn't bring the battery out um but i used it with a skunk 8 but that skunk cape's got such a strong skunky um smell to it it's hard to for anything else to come through so we'll see if anything comes through on this one but like i said the thca powder worked great in there too it didn't clog that one up that one worked you know it was almost all the way full and you can tell see there's not much left in there i smoked over half of it in a couple days it was so tasty and like i said the battery just quit on me so i don't recommend refilling those the reason i refilled this one and like i said we got it filled with just that little bit i didn't use a lot i'll show you how much i used on that um but this one's got the charging port on the bottom so hopefully we can recharge it when it does die now i only use this was a full gram i did lick a little bit and but pretty much i just used two i pushed it from where it was at the one to maybe just past the eight so maybe three milliliters of this stuff but closer to probably the two because it did fill that pin up and it's only 300 milligrams so like i said it didn't take much of this to fill that vape in and i did dab a little bit in my mouth dabbed a little bit in the banger just to try it the flavor wasn't bad the banger wasn't real clean so i couldn't get a good flavor on it so we'll save that for a review hopefully too well that's going to be it guys if you have any questions just leave them down there in the comments like i said this is an easy way you could also just put the distillate straight into the vape pen without the rosin and just make a bait pin that's what pretty much they're using is distillate but like i said with just a little bit of that rosin it makes it a real good flavor so you don't need a lot of that even you could probably just put maybe two little dabs in there mix it around put one in there see how you like it next time add more if you need to but like i said they tore me up good so i definitely recommend those of you who are feeling your own give this a shot let me know what you think of it that's going to be it guys we do got some more videos coming tomorrow we got a delivery coming and then we'll also do what's new in the florida mmj we got some new things coming yeah so make sure you tune in tomorrow for that one uh make sure you subscribe this delivery should be the last delivery for the giveaway the 420 giveaway um so we'll be doing that one this week too so make sure you subscribe for that turn on your notifications so you don't want to miss that video and that's it guys till next time hopefully you guys are toking on something good um and keep on toking my friends", "qzeEWxC1UQc": "smoking man growin and watch it fall down [Music] what is up DTC's got it real hanging out super psyched to have a new friend Julian from Bab logic over hey thank you for having me really yes yes hey I appreciate you guys blew it up at the deconcentration celebration yeah yeah yeah no it was a fun time yeah you took home you took home I think was third place in there boys what was this again you brought some with you yeah we can each owns the HT batter it's like really high terpene high potency yeah this is oops this is one to remember right here you brought two of them I like yeah I brought a couple kami I brought a truck Korean or trap cookies and so what's your specialty if you guys were dab logic what are y'all known for um we create high quality you know highly purified high terpene solving with hash oils solvent less overall solvent list so we specialize in ninety micronized soil we also specialize in the different types of bras in all the way from our newest product which is like the HT batter's all the way through like the HT show weight HT what's that mean hide your bathing yeah basically anything you know reaching on the 15% you know mark we consider pretty high tech 15 yeah 15% terpenes just pretty freakin high yeah especially for solving lists you know most concentrates are around six to eight percent on the standard market really a lot even less than that most most standard solvent less concentrates that you'll find on the market are probably about four to five even all right so help me out there help me evaluate concentrates what makes a good concert we're going to the dispensary together what we looking for yeah so when I go in and I look for a good concentrate first thing I do is you know you don't get to smoke the product in the dispensaries know you got to evaluate yeah you have to evaluate it either you know through your nose through sight you know right and then through prior you know prior time smoking either something that like that or but they could think about the colors beautiful on that yeah color colors is that you know is that to live or die by totally a giveaway you know I mean if you're looking at something and it's green or it has like you know a really dark amber to it you know it might be dagger dated it might have had heat stress you know something like that or it could be just the nature of the plant you know something like the truck the truck cookies that's always gonna have at least on the phenotype that's being passed around right a lot of the hash and being created from it right now yes it has that orange you know you cue to it yeah it's almost purple in the hue you know and when you press that and refine it it becomes like this orange almost amber like but that's beautiful orange I got a glowing orange I got no problem yeah yes smoked something that's glowing or it's the earth tones that I have a problem with yeah what does it are that's a sign that chlorophyll it's Asano's beat up too much yeah so when a plants cut if it's cut fresh you know a lot of these plans a lot of people are making fresh frozen and for plants cuts cut fresh it's gonna release Greenleaf volatiles which are different esters Josh aldehydes and you know alcohols that are released by the plant those end up actually soluble eyes in chlorophyll chlorophyll has a few different colors chlorophyll can be anywhere from purple all the way to you know the green that we know about well like purple is that like when plants purple up at the end is that chlorophyll that's so yes there's something to do with the chlorophyll and in the biosynthetic pathway that it actually takes right it's either heated or as it's you know matures or ages but a lot of times that's antioxidants is well produced by the plant such as anthocyanin or something similar to that those antioxidants even have somewhat of a smell to them even they're found in a lot of berries they're found in God and things like that so that's you kind of you know start to realize okay the purple plans have this berry-like or grape-like kind of smell to it it's kind of through that anti oxidant pathway and the enzymes that produce those right so and that's all based on the genetic makeup of the plant I have a very natural next question how the hell did you learn all this stuff man you go to school for this are you just a Googler so there's not much information out there there's a lot of there's a lot of people who are pursuing to find the actual chemistry the actual science behind a lot of this stuff right some of that has been published what has been published you know you can find Ethan Rousseau dr. moosh dr. Musallam alright people like that okay they are pioneering a lot of this stuff and you're just reading their white papers and you read then read their work and then we also you know we work with scientists on our team as well we have a scientist from the University of Boulder who worked in the Caine lab and we're so he's an extra he's a expert in genomics so okay bioinformatics and things like that Wow it's so crazy that in the cannabis company have to have a genomics expert yeah you learn how to hire them I mean yeah it's starting to evolve to the point where now if we want to really you know pursue this we have to understand it more solving this hash is something that's kind of coming back from where it was you know in the past that's all there was there were thousands of years ago if you were to look at you know what cannabis crasher from you know it was charas and you know things on the hands it was the right amount of heat and pressure under pressure that you're able to even remove it from your hand or even able to change the right the chemistry of it because they didn't start smoking it you know it hated to be decarboxylated in order for that to happen it had to be left out in the Sun for a certain amount of time or it had to be heated to a specific temperature for a certain amount of time right you know and through this alchemy that you know has evolved I mean they found plants that were more beneficial for those processes you know that's why what we know of today as the hash varieties come from a very small group of plants because those came out of you know Afghanistan and Grammy Hall and you know places like that that we're actually using hash as a resource for a long time yeah makes sense that's pretty cool I'm just trying to think like everybody's got a different art you know growing can be an art shift photography can be an art what's your what you ought man yeah the art so the art really is involved with just uncovering mechana bees resin you know there's so much there that we don't really know about there's so your the extract artists I don't even know what's your title at that company I don't have one I founded dialogic founder - ice that's a great title because you're gonna have to do anything after what you already did your work no I still I still work with hash you know every day I'm still with the plants and every charge in my fingernail exactly no you just don't think yeah but uh yeah I'm still with the resin every day you know I who I started creating who I created that logic with right was some close friends that also still to this day are are doing different uh different extracts and working with the resin so it's a big industry man yeah so I wait how many people is we just laughing but you came to my studio and saw my work yeah about five guys yeah they all stopped and took a break to take it does take a couple dabs from you totally yeah yeah what's your work scene like what's it like to work at dab logic how many people to start with so I have five people on the the actual extraction team my California team is now expanding I have one guy out there right now but we're in the process of getting expanding that team our lab is just getting the CEO so we're just getting we're just able to move in your building out we had to you know gut the whole place and redo it all for insulation and you guys to talk of something logical you know the whole nine moved in a huge walk-in freezers you know cuz we have to we're taking a lot off you know off these mountains and in Humboldt so yeah can we talk about that for a second just said I was asking about your like I was in Cali for the I don't know can I call it Cali I heard that don't live in California called Cali yeah I mean it's humble it's where it's at right here you know Northern California yeah so you were there we're supposed to hang out last week and you're like dude its I'm out here still harvesting yeah and then I'm like alright so you tell me about what you got a 120,000 square foot indoor there is that right so no no no not that quite that big we got 20,000 square feet makes you like a computer we have hundred acres up off the grid and other 600 acres that's being built built out still isn't fully that 600 acres and fully permitted or license yet I'm not pulling anything off it yet but that's a beautiful property that property goes from the top of a mountain all the way down to the valley there's a river there should be good water oh and I make important water as important mazing water there's huge ponds and the property and streams and so that and that's your your founder that's your baby right there so that I'm partnered with the company Verde Verde natural they're out of they were started here in Denver by guy Chuck and he eventually partnered with who now is the main owner of the company Jeff he has expanded this company you know dramatically he's who took on dialogic and we got and flew it up and I mean you gotta have balls or night ball if you have to know what you're doing to first off do a hundred acres some people have success enough with your 100 acres to do 600 acres yeah yeah service schedule for that has to be amazing totally and I mean you know we don't grow on the whole hundred you know there's a lot that goes into actually running these this big of a farms and you're talking you know huge you know ponds and huge almost irrigation lines that are actually sure culvert it into the into the ground I run a 20 acre bamboo farm yeah yeah purty I was like yeah I was like yeah you need water you need a well you need huge yeah you need a water cleaning system yeah yeah yeah and we're trying to you know be all organic and you know the whole soil all that come on let's get into the growth first off how the hell do you do living I okay I got it you find a place with good soil if you're gonna do living soil on 100 or 600 acres I mean we bring in we do a mixture of local humble Mendocino County dirt and then we bring in some Canadian soil as well yeah yeah that just sound great water that stuff's yeah it's amazing that already is microbial active when it when it gets there you know it already has a nice you know uh humic body to share sure it's not ain't nothing sterile yeah yeah you know if it's and I think they do inoculate that would mycorrhizae don't they I know that they pull out of that out of some plots that they have along the old-growth and that God is definitely as major fungal and bacterial actually seen a peat mine or a peat bog I don't even mind yeah back near uh an old growers to have I Drive by it and it was like whoa what is that thing it's just cutting into the earth yeah I know yeah the pits interesting there that's a finite resource in there you know yeah it is yeah yeah I will say Florida peat not as good as a reason they imported from Canada so that's actually really cool that's alright so as long as we're talking grow how do you give quality and quality outs yeah how do you have first off indoor grows got to be tremendously different than an outdoor grow right yeah completely different different processing then on your end here that your the extract you noticed I mean definitely I was talking to somebody I was talking to it was loving in her eyes yesterday and she was talking about how to be I was asking her how to be a you know a really top quality extract artist she goes get to know your resin I think it was friend she can always that originally said it her for get to know your resin you know everything's different you know your room and your resin is gonna be different absolutely yeah when you move from grow to grow or you're starting a new grow and it's new growers its new people it's a new soil mix it's a new everything sure you know it is scary you know you're coming in with varieties you know it's not like we can really transfer varieties from state to state ads so it's like we're having to find and source varieties in California wait really that we haven't ran yet but I mean you can't or you can't uh so I mean a wedding cake can find its way over an account we have wedding cake we have like all you know I know you would never talk about other people no there is there is ways to definitely get them over they audit and through in through tissue culture and things like that we can actually legally do this stuff if we're sending over callous and undifferentiated cells we can actually send that across state lines and technically it's a gray area sure it's not a cannabis plant so they can't call you out on it you know I'm just sitting here being like oh it's so silly you should be able to smuggle stuff anywhere you want but I think about all I'm from South Florida you've got people from South America and all over the place that are smuggling little plants in because it's tropical these plants from their home they are bringing so many diseases literally Jersey palm decline they have straight-up palm decline there because people are bringing palm seeds and growing palm seeds that were laminated yeah it's a huge deal yeah it's scary I mean you know we truly we want to find varieties that we know are gonna work right but we also want to be able to work with as many things as we can so it's really just finding the lineage and delving into where are these plants coming from can i source plans of that lineage from whoever you know in the area that's mainly what we look into do you have any other growers in your area cannabis or hemp because that would be a freakin nightmare if you had people growing hemp for biomass no it's okay in Humboldt County there is a lot of cannabis growing you know there's tea farm everywhere you look is there pollen I'm in there saying if there's pollen in the air and your she gets pollen there could potentially be pollen there could potentially be molds from other Wright farms and things like that so we have to be very careful you know a with who we let on the property be with you know how we filter and maintain the air quality and our property is this completely outdoor these are greenhouses what are we doing with the the big properties are outdoor they're full season that's just right in the Sun you know exposed to as many you know anything that happens yes there's a greenhouse you see matter space in that even there there will be greenhouses there will be all sorts of stuff that I put on those properties it's still gonna have full Sun and greenhouse or full Sun depending on how you grow depending on you know what varieties you're doing you could have very good full Sun that goes well depending you know how your season is out there really it's seasonal you know you could have a fall that's extremely rainy and damages your whole crop in the six-day period you know you could have a fall season that's sunny amazing and warm and there's no rain in sight all through flower and everything was beautiful she kept your dust down and you maintained your property and you did well enough to be able to like oh yeah I can you know harvest these plants that are gonna be very well do very well for you know some of those extracts yeah I mean you're talking about hmm having some problems you know if the weather is wrong mm-hmm or doesn't cooperate you know that basically catastrophic crop failure totally yeah we're doing all sorts of stuff that we can to mitigate that as the season progresses you know we're watching weather we're watching humidity we're watching as things are moving up the coast and into the mountains it's what you do though well we can prepare you know like if if a heavy rains coming you know that's gonna be very damaging the other show if you if things aren't stake properly your trellis properly not like that it's gonna just destroy your field you know just based on that alone so that's um you can do not even though huge raindrops or hail hitting those bus cream yeah yeah and I mean we we're trying to develop different rain protection systems that we will put up once the plans get more in the flour and it'll just be short little lean-to type frames that basically go over and they'll be big but they're only gonna be able to protect a few of the chosen plans right one it's not gonna be the whole thing you know so we'll start going through the that whole property was done from seed so that is also we're doing Fino hunting there so you need that yeah some special ones over there yes I mean there's we pop 2,000 seeds you know so it's a big female hunt we got the varieties from a guy Jesse his company as bio vortex they do amazing stuff at Humboldt Wow he's in another leaf Trinidad area not actually I think his farm is actually really cool know him I think I have run into him before yeah he's a great guy he I could probably swing it his way too but uh he does so many talks and writing and get a home but sure absolutely in a cannabis and absolutely gonna get your culture you know my beef is with everybody that's that's putting their their lives on the line their livelihoods on the line for cannabis is that in Florida if I were to have you know 600 acres of palm trees and they got a disease or they got wiped out by a hurricane you know what happens I get to buy myself a Mercedes man the government comes in it gives me 50 70 90 percent of what the hell that entire crop was worth and I had a check for three million you know I'm sorry if it's that many acres yeah yeah tens or twenties a million oh yeah I just sold my entire inventory before before it was even mature yeah if we get hit with you know as I guess outdoor cannabis growers there's no catastrophic insurance for us I'm sure there will be once event organization happens but kind of gotta be hard to get people to throw their life savings into you know or I should even say it's just an investor and that's and that's the thing and that's why you know we do what we do you know that logic is like we need the best material we you know that when you're getting something from us it's going to be the best because we can't take some thing that failed you know write anything that failed it's it's it's either has to be compost or its you know if if if it can be you know saved in any way from hydrocarbon extraction but that's you know what's scary about that is right people you know lose a crop or something like that and they pull it to that and it's who knows what mycotoxins heavy metals things like that are contained within that yeah how do you feel about BHO you solvent list newt or what I typically only smoke solving this hash um just because you want to solve this company yeah and I'm you know I'm in the industry I see what happens you know with I do carbon extractions and don't get me wrong there are some amazing right carbon extractions out there and it's important that you know that that side of the industry exists in Georgia they're you know keeping the earth clean and they're you know doing what it takes you know I could see one be one type you know blast rooms and things like that and I think it's fine the exist bad promotion for the cannabis industry for extracts of if they're blowing up with Dirk scanning themselves we don't we don't want that and you know a lot of times people don't know the difference between distillate or solvent lives or something like that you know found someone like us someone like us would know because it's its second nature whatever by now but it's like you know when I talked to somebody from Wisconsin or I talked to someone sharing Oklahoma or Alabama or you know somewhere like it's all good there even people out in California you know northern Northern California you know they're there's so much distillate there's so much hydrocarbon extraction everybody's running to ashes big freakin farms up there okay there's nobody that can press come close to processing that size of farms yet which is you know I mean so it's like look like a factory over there Shh I mean they are a lot of the hydrocarbon facilities around 24/7 and yeah I can take on a thousand pounds a day Jesus mm-hmm Wow what do you think you guys's capacity is gonna be in California I mean you're gonna need to have some see you've got hundreds of acres yeah it's an it's not quite that big in again we're selective for solve unless gotta take the best out of these fields we take only the best so it's it's something that when we're doing and we do about a hundred pounds fresh per per wash is what will got we what we do got um so that only happens two to three times a week typically it's something that takes a lot more effort you know through the whole process it's something that we can't really just throw it in the tube blasts it out throw write purge oven and let it sit for three weeks it's like there's a lot of processing and there's a lot of maintaining and being very careful and being you know quick but also you know taking your time yeah what how do you get the young quality and quality out when it comes to when it comes to you know Roz and I guess how do you get it to where what if you have a problem I guess is what I'm trying to say in the grow yeah soil so it's kind of tough to correct that yeah it's some things off balance if there's you know some something that may have been watered wrong or you know fed improperly yeah that a B word what about bugs bugs I mean bugs are definitely a problem you know if you're if you're dealing with large scale cultivation but you know if you're maintaining cleanliness you're maintaining rigorous integrated pest management systems leaving meaning predatory insects very cool in vegetative state never in flower it's also using you know specific essential oil sprays or oil sprays that could be used in vegetative state never in flower beautiful you know one thing that we do is we make sure that our products aren't sprayed if it's coming to me cannot even come close to being sprayed it can't and that's why if a farmer that's why we have to be so selective that's why we have to grow and we have to inspect product you know even if like our own farmers are out there there they might be doing something to save their own crop so we have to go out there and inspect that and make sure that's either not happening or if it is happening we need to move on and get to the plants that you know or part of the crop or even move through the crop altogether you know and only take you know something from yang on their farm I had tasted and by no means a connoisseur I like extracts don't get me wrong but I'm not a connoisseur and I tasted something that I was like this tastes like sulfur like it looks good he's like sulfur like obey me use the sulfur burner and you know a little bit too late that could be you know there's especially you know if you're an old-school farmer right and you're doing things you're trying to be organic you know you could use a sulfur burn you know but that nowadays most people are aware that that comes through a in the cannabis smoke would be way more in the concentrates you know so but there are varieties you can lineage you know coach lineage that could the diesel lineage that could lean towards like that skunky sulfuric almost type smell got a stir so you know if it's important that know your grower it's important to know you're know where your weeds coming from grow your own most importantly I mean that's why we you know it's why we do what we do is so that we can grow something that you can be certain is going to actually be something that you would drove you ain't smoke you know we don't we would never put something something in our products that you wouldn't I wouldn't personally use myself there's so many people that I just let like b-grade stuff pass through just because they're like oh nobody will know what he can tell showing in extracts it's this or that or it's going to this dispensary they'll buy I've been dispensaries and I'm like oh you buy the shift exactly yeah so it's important for us you know to sharing you know relationship with the growers and maintain the relationship with people that were selling to you know yeah what's up with the dispensaries on the other end because you kind of middleman as far you can't go in and actually rep your product during no I mean some dispensaries allow us to come in and you know frame help market help train route kind of create awareness yeah if you come in you don't know what's sitting on the Shelf right why are you gonna buy it you know well like you got this pen people are in the cartridges it's kind of going away from that you know putting your extract in a pen and having to reload it these things are super low-profile super convenient what's the first off go into a dispensary you know be like hey what kind of good cartridges do you have and sometimes they'll go none don't buy them here they're all mix of propylene glycol and stuff like that what's the secret first just cuz I'm in the cartridges because I'm picked this one up so cuz I'm gonna hit it so something like this out what's the secret to make them something a good cart what's the difference in a good part of a shitty cart this has no cut this has none of the propylene glycol MCT oil any bogus food grade this or that else is 100% from cannabis and it's also and lessly made so it's it's a high terpene extract put into a vape cart is what it is it's not something that somebody made to get rich quick it's yeah this is real hash I remember they made more convenient yes something you could melt your hash into and then you could put it in your vape pens yeah and I mean it's terrible there's a little bit of post-process like you you if you just stick show into a cart it's gonna crystallize it's gonna kind of coagulate and it'll be hard to smoke lawyers you know so creating the proper terpene ratio and things like that is very important you know and that's is that strain dependent or that's very strained dependent with us it's a hundred percent strain depending because we can't really manipulate the terpenes too much or the constant we can somewhat manipulate concentration right can't we can't change what's there you know it's like if what's there is there so we're just kind of working with what we have to kind of make this yeah makes sense if you guys make carts you guys make it what does he cause batters yeah the the carts something we've been doing for the past two years year and a half something to make it more convenient sitting so that also somebody who doesn't have a rig and doesn't typically dab right can actually use our product this is super this never really happened before the vape car it was not quality was yeah yeah so it's like being able to formulate you know the get it from this to that was huge yeah it was the game for us and really has made it so that my mom my grandma my aunts and uncle rate of have able to have been able to try my product whereas before they can I get a really good order yeah even though what it was you know couldn't couldn't even wrap their head around it yeah but we we you know what with most hash makers you know the the goal isn't I need my car nice oil you know a lot of times we're taking now because so many people love the rosin and things like that we're taking our ninety micron pressing that right having specified batches that are ninety might come or 90 120 mixtures sure like that the higher grade microns and that's what's getting some that's more often than not that's what we're pressing now because it's just what people are after and water hash is also good side of the market but it's it probably accounts for twenty twenty percent of the actual solving with sales and those riding the whole grand scheme of things seems to go quick do no otter hash yeah it's expensive yeah you know the high grades there's unless you're doing you know extremely large batches there's not a crazy amount of it you know maybe a couple hundred grams you know something like that so it's something that's very limited something that's not you can't take something low grade and make it into ninety micron ISIL it has to be grown perfectly it has to be done perfectly actually washed perfectly so we presented and given you the consumer perfectly as well you know so we have to keep it maintained you know from start to finish you know a cold environment on it you know we have to make sure the people who are selling our product right the consumer are also keeping in the right environment and then we have to let our consumer know and they have to have the education to be able to know to put this in the fridge or to keep it cold they asked something that maintains that you know environment we have a kegerator and we never use it having a kegerator in the house is actually a bad idea so why I started hiding my dad's in there man they you just don't have enough refrigerators once people know you keep them in the fridge yeah they figure it out me yeah every fridge in the house yeah bad hey we're talking about these cartridges you obviously if you were in for a year and a half ago you were getting in the days you were a little bit ahead of the trend ahead look her how they how do you keep a head into curve and what's coming up next around the next curve for cannabis yeah we're always trying to keep ahead next big curb you know we're looking at I see a lot of people are like pushing for you know really like colored high flavor hi hi flavor profile resins like 710 it's white yeah yep yep so it's really it's shooting for that shooting for the holler proper color high terpene me but also still maintaining you know the right you know potency you know because if you're pulling too early on some of this stuff you're just getting something that tastes like cucumbers and like wait up just doesn't even get you that high it's like if you want something that has the full body flavor like you have to take it to its prime maturity you know we we have to get out of the kind of mentality that ambered trichomes like when it starts to amber that's starting to show my maturity cuz that's like that's already overly matured you know like yes we're trying to pull a little bit before that ever even happens before the first amber trichome happens like the day before that would be the perfect you know yeah I'm just saying and this is I mean cuz you're trying to bring something great to your customer something extraordinary so when they try all of them they like to dab logic that's that's the one I like yeah how educated is the customer did they get it a shopping price do you have to it's just like cmed you're gonna we can educate them on that stuff or they end up buying hemp seed oil for you know eight dollars on Amazon and thinking oh everything is good ya know I mean education is huge most people they don't know the difference between like quality organic solvent list and some low-grade hydrocarbon I straight up they don't eighteen dollar shadow yeah and with CRC tech like the color mediation for like hydrocarbons and things like that I heard something about what the hell is color remediation they're pulling chlorophyll and you know oxidants out of out of the hash you know which is great because that leads to a higher grade hash but it's also like discern or both from like something that is high grade you know it's like okay this this just is high grade because I grew it right I maintain it I took care of it I processed it right you know this came from any run of a mill place with who-knows-who doing them whatever and it's coming out looking the same you know that's the that's the thing yeah plastic surgeries you know a couple yeah so it's gonna be then you know now going back through the customer finding you know the nose the trained eye things like that being able to actually understand what what you're getting you know yeah and that's hard you know if we're we're still in the phases of trying to teach people what good genetics are you know and you more if they're not even understanding the Terp why those genetics are good the terpenes that they're producing the cannabinoid profiles that they're producing them we're gonna be like then they're gonna just be sitting there clueless when anybody can call anything whatever they were you know I mean most of the country thinks independence atiba there's two varieties of cannabis one gets you up let me get you down exactly yeah and it's who's that well who's your I've heard I was actually at the dispensary one time it must be right after Social Security checks were issued hmm to what everybody was 55 60 years old so you know I mean they were older yeah I was just kind of wondering like where the growth is I actually was talking to somebody and they were telling me look the people that are smoking weed are already smoking weed you know what we're really after now is the people that aren't smoking weed the other 85% of population we're looking for you guys say you know ever think in that that way or is that why you got stuff like these pens yeah they really make it I think what the vape is designed for its to give it to anyone who can basically take a hit you know if you can take a hit you can try this pen there isn't even a button on it right it's magnetic it's just you know it just slides right in yeah it's so easy to use it's nothing like heating up a nail and take your day about measuring a dose all that kind of stuff this you just measure with the pup knows how hard you're drawing you know so it's it's per a buddy of mine called me I've been talking about this guy because I feel terrible about it a guy knew back in Florida had a stroke and you just case just told me he goes my body's hanging off me you know it's my hair and my leg of my arm and he's like it starts hurting and I was met recommended that he grabbed one of these pens and check him out it's not a cannabis user and magically he got one and he's like dude I like it and it's really cool cuz in the beginning you could take like a couple of one hit and you're like wow yeah I have a friend that has psoriatic arthritis shoutout to Paul and yeah it's really bad man where sometimes he just can't move his hands and it sucks cuz he's uh has like a technical job as well he will take one hit of the right strain and he just goes like immediately he goes I'm all better I'm all better mm-hmm David it's amazing and I was absolutely I don't know if you got any medical cannabis stories or not I mean like that is so inspirational to me totally my yellow rooftops you know my grandma actually has went through cancer twice she has you know used cannabis to help her right through different chemo treatments and things like that she's fully off chemo now and she's only using cannabis and CBD you try to help and you know so that's kind of where she's at sure the whole world would change their mind on cannabis if somebody handed them a joint when they had a stomachache okay know what I mean that's all they would have to do is when he had a snowman somebody joint they got I instantly feel better I can actually empathize with the psoriatic arthritis guy cuz think about having a horrible stomach game taking one hit of weed and being like I can get up off the floor I can get out of bed you know terrible state your intestines I've never been ashamed of cannabis always been me Oh doing what I can to let people know that this legit shouldn't be considered deal with all the other drugs while the other armful drugs know it's a medicine I agree 100% yeah and that's kind of what we do - it's a logic is the reason we're organic the reason we choose solvent less is because we want to give you the purest truest medicine you know we don't want anything getting in the way between you and nature in this plant you know we're just presenting you with as close as you can get to it you know so it's it's then up to you you know to use this medicine however you choose you know whether it's dope and your consciousness or whether it's to heal your ailments or just a plain old you know relax you know like all of those things are so important you know to de-stress and to unwind like it's part of why we all use cannabis and it's so so important you know and that's why I think cannabis users as a whole have that mentality in that mindset of for lack of a better word we're chill you know sure it affects you I think I think it affects your brain you smoke enough weed it shows you out of it that's actually a generalization know some crazy [ __ ] just smoke weed all day they're not the least bit chill oh well yeah no I mean thinking of one that was a pink shirt you know just knows how much weed they use but let me ask you a question so we're talking about the expansion we're talking - everyone should smoke weed all right they everyone should consider it a medicine anyhow so do you want federal legalization that's a super double-edged sword they're super sharp one I mean I don't look at medicine as pharmaceutical in any way you know I hate do it yeah they do they do they think you know put it into a pill or make it something that's completely controllable something that we can maintain and control reacts down to the milligrams same way oxycontin is a molecule that they can control exactly you know and by doing that they take away the whole plan the full spectrum you know aspect of it and using THC on its own I mean all the studies show that it's way way way less beneficial than using in conjunction with Kurt beanies and other cannabinoids that are found actually within those plants so no to federal legalization just cuz just gonna commoditize I mean federal legalization I think will be the last thing that happens what I think will end up happening is states will end up partnering with one another we'll be like we'll see California Oregon Washington State interstate they'll partner what's going in there yeah all of a sudden you know it'll open up other other avenues for other states and it'll be able to follow a trail through our country one way or another you know and as long as that money files which follows a trail the federal government somehow will probably be ok yeah exactly I mean it's everybody knew it was coming you know it was like the Jack Herer initiative of 2012 it was his whole thing you know it's prophecy it's good there's no way you're super you can't win an election by saying that you're against cannabis there's no way yeah once cuz we've been fighting for so long brother kids yelling it yeah I love it I love it worriers boom and we're back and magically we're taking - yo so where can people get this stuff anyway so you can grab it at vert and verts and Fort Collins if you're in this area otherwise if you're in Denver you can always get it at Verde if you're in Boulder you can get it at Verde nice that Verde carries the largest selection of dialogic products overall so deal deal I appreciate it man yeah there you go there you go thanks for bringing such thanks for bringing samples absolutely it is gorgeous this is absolutely growing always glad to be over there [Music] [Music] [Music]", "HjVnvEy-IkA": "what is going on welcome back to the I smoke Channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene today we're going to be covering diamonds and sauce versus shatter two forms of cannabis extract but what is the difference and how in fact are they similar those are the questions that we are going to be answering in today's video remember to hit that like and subscribe button if you are feeling these videos that helps us grow rich even more people and get our message out there so without further adieu let's talk diamonds and shatter I've got my Chuck B glass piece originating in the USA for today's video it's getting out of the Pelle case so I can show you what it looks like oh yes and we are gonna fill it with water you ready and here we go we are ready to kick off the video let's put this pillowcase away the old one 120 Pelle case what you need if you're traveling with your glass let's talk about the difference between shatter and diamonds and sauce we're gonna start with the most familiar form of extract that you've probably come across for ready it is shatter and this has been on the market since at least a few years ago but all the way people have been extracting cannabis going back to the last century recently shatter has become a much bigger thing lead partially due to the advent of medical legalization and recreational legalization in the States that is where this was first super popular and now extracts come in this form so what does she look like shatter can have different coloration but is generally gonna look a bit more stable than other forms of cannabis extract when you get shatter you will know it is shatter because it will literally shatter when you break it you can see from the way that it breaks although some of it may potentially be a little bit more sticky but basically shatter looks like this this is some lovely mimosa shatter we got beer 710 this is what shatter should look like if it is clean it might come in a different color look at the consistency look at the sort of golden hue and just just look at it guys you can see that that is some nice-looking chatter if it's tiny or if it has got too much chlorophyll or aged plant material eg trimming it it might be darker and you might see shatter that's like really dark almost black looking I wouldn't really want to dab that anymore but have done in the past how does it differ to diamonds and sauce well let's take you through what diamonds and silks of Diamonds themselves are almost pure THC a crystals basically 99 point something percent tetrahydrocannabinol where is the source is a mixture of Turks some cannabinoids and the flavonoids giving it this lovely rich flavor profile not being an extractor I don't know too much about the process of creating diamonds in source but the source is a really Turkey volatile cannabis extract that is on the other side of the spectrum to something like shatter shatter has a really nice stability to it although it may degrade into a more waxy like substance over time particularly when not refrigerated as those turps cannabinoids flavonoids begin to break down into a delicious extract soup that's when you'll see shatter waxing up diamonds and sauce basically is like honey sort of looking liquid the diamonds are the crystallization of that so that could happen when the extract has been left in a pressurized compartment over time it begins to crystallize and over the last few years the process has been honed and developed until we start seeing big thca crystals that look like rocks basically and that is diamonds and source I really like the flavor profile you get on this I think it's very hard to replicate the diamonds and sauce flavor profile in shatter or even in fact in other forms of cannabis extracts the more stable something is the less in my experience is the flavor some exploded in my mouth you know a lot whether it's with the Diamonds and sauces so volatile goes turps something which is unparalleled so this is some lemon skittles diamonds and sauce you might be familiar with the skittles strain skittles with that is a really popular Cali import strain lemon skills in their skills cross and this is the diamonds and source of that straight away I can tell you that out the to extract this one smells really nice this one smells about ten times nicer you get a little bit of the aroma with the shatter but with the diamonds and sauce it is really really stinky in a really lovely way for the lemon citrus the skills sweetness you know that fruity pebbles types or a sweetness I've got both of them in front of me I can smell this one and I can't smell this one diamonds and sauce is going to smell a bit stronger because of the volatile nature of the extract you know it's lighter pea sauce shatters a little bit more stable than that stability means that you can pick it up with your hand as you see with this shutter I can just pick it up and hold it and that is because it is nice and stable allowing me to do that without it breaking down I couldn't pick this up and hold it I'd get it sauce all over my hands and that would be a waste we need Abdul for that so that's a comparison between shatter and diamonds and source hopefully I haven't missed much out do feel free to add your input your insights in the comments section I think that people will be wondering what the difference is between the different forms of cannabis extract and Shatter versus diamonds and sauce is an interesting comparison should we dab some first of all we're gonna start with these shatter this is mimosa another really popular cannabis strain that I'm sure some of you would have heard of so you can say this is Shattuck is as I'm digging my dad's hole into it it's literally splintering off into little portions you need to be careful with shatter particularly when cold that you don't accidentally flick it off of your your parchment paper and onto the floor sometimes it can be harder to pick up with a dab tool than than with your fingers as this is proving because it's just not sticky we are ready to go live with this dab of mimosa shatter and I'll see you guys on the other side wow that mimosa flavor is delicious but I do find with shatter he's sort of got a very slight chattery taste to it so you sort of can taste the form of cannabis extract it is now a wonder whether that is actually the lack of volatile Terps meaning that it's not as flavorsome as other forms now there is also something to say about open-loop blasting versus closed-loop distilled butane both of these forms of extract are extracted using a solvent it looks like this it is called butane and it is the same gas as goes into your blow torches your clipper lighters etc obviously handling this stuff in an enclosed environment is dangerous it is extremely flammable that is why it is recommended that if you don't know what you're doing do not try this at home I've spoke to more than one extractor that has told me that they've had an accident in the past and it's not really a little accident when it involves things like explosions and fire so stay safe people there are safer ways to make your own extracts at home just look at rosin all right should we do a dab of the diamonds and sauce and see how it compares to that in the motor shaft that we just tried I think we should it isn't the best shape to dad till family in diamonds and source actually but I think we're gonna be able to to get your nights tab allows a these looks great guys we're about to do this tab right now and I'll see you on the other side tears folks [Music] wowsa oh man all the flavor got me that dad makes your eyes forward sometimes that was intense that was expansive that actually gave me the sweats guys been a long time since I got the sweats doing a DAB the flavor of the lemon skills diamonds and sauce is absolutely incredible through the coffin I was able to get that delicious sweetness you know just as it smells it tastes and I've been dabbing that all yesterday I'm really loving that flavor so which is my favorite out of diamonds and sauce and shatter it has gotta be the diamonds and source guys and girls it is a delicious form of cannabis extracts able to give me the sweat after all this dabbing that's pretty impressive and it is certainly particularly that version of it a winning flavor and dabbing experience shutter is nice but it's got that shattering flavor but I think with the Diamonds and sauce you get this like magical level of flavor that you don't really experience anywhere else saying that though with diamonds and sauce you definitely don't need a big dab those crystals of THC a are expansive and very very strong and I just experienced that from a normal-sized dad got me quite a bit high up and giving me the sweats which I don't mind it's been a while since a DAB has done that to me but what do you think of this video folks what is your favorite form of extract have you tried dabbing it they leave your comments below this has run on to 24 minutes of filming supposed to be in a three minute video that has been the video comparing the diamonds and sauce and the shutter that's it for the moment as always thanks for watching and keep token stepping on here rollercoaster going down but I never felt this high biggest right how the century [Music]", "J_0_qwXlhEM": "[Music] [Music] ah yeah guys what a big Dan over here coming back got you yeah and now we're doing a quick little video because I get a million questions asked about this subject pretty much every day I get at least 10 to 20 comments or emails asking about this subject and the subject is how to make THCA from shatter or wax or pho all yeah so uh there you have it you got some saucy turkey diamonds the diamonds are around anywhere between 96% eighty to ninety nine point six percent THC a and you can see the nice derpy a little bit of Terp sauce layer in there with the Terp sauce will contain random cannabinoids from CB g CB d CB and stuff like that and then all your Terps whether it be in lemon een pining and the rest of a mercy and all that stuff but um yeah this video is in explaining what diamonds are it's explaining how I make my methods of making THC TAC a or diamonds or sauce turf sauce or turf diamonds or whatever you want to call it you can see that the crystallization is fairly big with the strain and yeah you can see the diamonds themselves are nice and clear and the sauce layer is nice and golden okay so let me break it down alright so first step is you got to make your you got to make a BHO pack the columns pack the tubes wait uh this is exactly how I do it I do fresh plant right off the plant right into the two pound columns on a closed loop fold you axis then I go from best value of x mmm I use only try ice I don't use liquid nitrogen right into that I just packed the column the jacket on the column with dried ice I packed the tubes full with my material which is a fresh off the plant you could do it with dried buds whatever you want but I just the best herb profile will come from live plants or fresh frozen something like that and then I do my run just like anyone else I'll blast through the column and then I'll pull the ball valve and then once I pulled a ball valve I will it'll dumped into the dewaxing chamber and then I'll let that sit for a little while let it be wax I'll pull that ball valve and let that dump into the collection pot I will then heat the collection pop however you heat your collection pot I just use a hot water bath and then while that's heating and evaporating back into the solvent tank getting yourself in potty or BHO I will then look through the sight glass and I'll leave a good amount of butane left in it now that's up to you how much you ran in and all that so I'll make sure it's nice and soupy so I could just dump it right out now when it's nice and soupy I release the pressure and then pop the cap and then dump it into a jar just like the bigger the bigger versions and these balls right here the big quart jars I will then cap the jar I'll put it in a cooler that the cooler Pole has some dry ice in it so it stays nice and cold and then BAM I'll leave that there and I'll pop the jars maybe once or twice a day burping them and after about five days you'll see diamond stone form at which point I will not use dry ice anymore and I'll keep it pretty much every room temperature and then I'll perform a two three four times a day I check them randomly and I'll burp the jars just you probably don't have to do that but I just do it to make sure the pressure isn't building up so much that's going to pop the capsule off or break the jars for anything so I check on them from time to time open them up and check on my own see how they're growing after a week you'll see bigger diamonds after two weeks for the biggest diamonds something similar to this now it is all strain dependent some strains have much bigger Terp Terp layer and then some strains have smaller diamonds more turf some strains have bigger diamonds less Terps yada yada so that's all up to the strains but that's how it's done I don't you know pentane wash the solvent I use for extraction is just n butane from best value back switch is 99.9% pure butane medical grade extraction grade comes in the green tank you can buy all that stuff right up best value packs they got a good prices good material and I never did me wrong but out yeah that's how it's done so uh I know I did a video with the robot voice trying to explain this and I feel that video was uh sufficient and I think it gave all the same thing I just said broke it down much quicker and you didn't have me up in there saying and all this shift so for everybody that just wanted a little revamp of the process that's how it's done that's exactly what I did to make these that's what I do to make all all my Terp sauce or diamonds or whatever you want to call it that's how I make it I hope this helps anybody out and if you liked the video smash the like button subscribe

because all this is coming up soon and if you like this you're not going to want to miss what's coming up next enjoy the show hey you welcome to my quiz review a juvenile spells this is what i do smoke push hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them off for you if you like rap you will like my news now instead of show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile styles is coming at you with death bubba live resin vape pen so let's open this up and check it out and give it a nice review so as you can see it has a very nice looking box and if you can't tell by taking a quick look at my channel my thing is kind of skulls i love skulls i got a big old collection of skulls here's just a couple of them but so you know i had to so you know i had to get myself the death bubba fate pen to try out sorry so instead of my ass talking all day let's open this up and take a nice look at it so it is a very nice classy looking vape pen it has a very nice design on it and if you take a look it says unicorn hunter certified so after this we might have to go up and get some unicorns you know what i mean just playing obviously of course nobody call peta or anything like that i'm just playing we're good so let's take a nice puff of this and see how good it tastes so i can give it a little bit of a reviewing so it has like a very nice sweet taste i'm sorry we had a little bit of a glitch there so it does have a very nice sweet taste and it does have a very nice like it's not like rough on the throat it's kind of like a nice like smooth hit and it does look like a pretty nice account nice gram inside so i paid like i think it was like 55 50 or 55 for this so it's not really a bad deal when you usually pay about 35 to about 40 or so for like live resin chatter stuff like that anyway so i'd say it's definitely worth it and i noticed that there's this little hole and if you push that you get like a harder hit quicker than without it it like stops the air from going in it to like i don't know kind of like like takes the air away so you get more smoke i guess so and i didn't mention that it has at the bottom a plug to charge it up if the battery dies on you and you can unscrew the top to unplug it so those are some really good quality features about it as well and it says that it's 93 to 98 percent thc so that's pretty good you can't get much higher than 93 to 98 unless you go to the one something percents just just joke no no so i know my humor is a little lame a little dry sometimes so i hope you all get it just trying to keep you on your toes you know what i mean so what we'll do is i'll give a rating of i'll give a rating of 4.5 for the taste and for design and packaging i'll give a rating of an overall five because i mean come on the packaging can't get much cooler very nice box to store it away when you're not using it so the kids don't get at it or something it's easy to put away without losing the pin itself so i guess i'll just give an overall rating of 4.5 to 5 out of 5 to the death bubba fate pin that is a very good choice and it does taste very good so if you ever get a chance to try it out i definitely recommend it it gives you a nice buzz too i'm already feeling pretty good so i definitely recommend it so if you ever get yourself a chance to try it out go get that and i hope you all have some good [ __ ] to smoke at home and i hope you all doing good and i appreciate everybody that comes and spends time spends time over here at juvenile styles and i hope y'all doing good peace now it's time to end the show i'll be back but i have to go now that we're all getting stoned but i got lots more videos so you can stay for show so bust up some more close to roll and watch another show you", "avlYCguphSQ": "oh gee shout to Ronnie ray and his grandma I love you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or I don't show you my personal information all right yo what's up guys Ronnie right back at you um I have another court review for you guys in this video I'm actually doing a kind live resin again if you guys see my like last review I did a Arnold Palmer this is [ __ ] fire I haven't really smoked on the car too much besides for when I did the review because I'm trying I'm if you got yeah if you guys didn't know I'm going to ET see you in like two weeks like what is it May 17th so Loki trying to save this car gonna feel others for you wanna go easy because this car is like I said in that review it taste so far like it actually tastes like Arnold Palmer like it actually tastes like [ __ ] you're smoking lemonade and iced tea like I don't know it's [ __ ] fire but um this video we're gonna be reviewing true Oh G and this brand I mean not this brand um this flavour or strain or whatever you really want to call it I know it's kind of been I don't know if you want to say it's there one of the classics or originals or whatever but I know it's been around for like a really really long time like I seem like a YouTube video somewhere I forget the dudes Shanno or I would shout him out but um it was posted like literally four years ago and he was a reviewing kind live resin and it was true oh gee so yes that's just like a little proof that the true og flavor has been around for a while but I don't know this is my review so I'm gonna give you my thoughts opinions my honest review everything I had to say about it the Arnold Palmer one was a hybrid I think that was like I said sativa dominant hybrid if I'm correct and then the true oh geez I got heavy indica up here and the guy so just looking at the two parts they can look at the two you can already see you can see huge color difference that Arnold Palmer it's like a lot more like clear a lot more [ __ ] yeah a little gold you know what I mean the true OG is like that darker I don't want to say Brown but like like dark gold I don't know this I know it's throw some fire whatever this lit because I don't know I've known about this brand forever so I know it's a fire this lit the only thing that I don't like about them well I don't know I mean they're a little pricey they're like what 62 bucks for the four grand quarter there's like this brand right here I have some of review out on these like if you wanna go check them out too these are [ __ ] stupid fires but there's $70 for the full Graham Carter so these are a little bit cheaper than these but these are definitely more fire in my opinion there was a those are stupid fire but 70 bucks for a gram I can't really justify buying that you know what I mean the only reason I even bought these was because there was a buy one get one for a book I'd rather because I can get two grams of like actual concentrate like shatter for the price of one of the years you know and I'd rather have like actual wax but I don't know these are just good for like when you're going to raves like concerts or you know what I mean it's not like oh nice but yes you know you see the color difference but if you want to see review on the Arnold Palmer one go check that video out but like I said with the one true orgy in this video so let's just go over the packaging a little bit I can't waste too much time on it kind libraries and Ruo Jie yeah pretty basic the side of it says organic blah blah blah and then kind that's new ritual every video I have to [ __ ] drop something but it's you guys but if you guys have been watching my reviews dude I don't know why but I [ __ ] drop my cards and have you [ __ ] video for some reason but if you guys want to do some more research from the brand its kind concentrate song right there so check them out then it has like that Arizona warning on the side apartment of services coming back I don't mean just all that [ __ ] it has to say to cover their ass and that was it see another sticker right here oh it says uh natural sources supposedly they marketed as natural and organic so that's pretty far I don't know how true that is says solvent free natural and organic right there in the bottom two I don't know one of the one of the cons like that like if you wanted to make like a pros and cons list about these cards I mean I guess it's not really too big of a deal but as long as it's a thousand milligrams you know what I mean but I always loved it one like like I said on this large carts it says the THC percentage on the bottom I always love that these um Clank these cards the kind I don't at least from what I'm seeing I don't see any percentages it doesn't say what it's what it's tested at I mean as long as it's a thousand milligrams I guess it really doesn't matter you know what I mean so also what I not just noticed too briefly real quick I'm gonna get this out of the way and I'm we're gonna open this card of this Arnold Palmer one where's a harvested on for eleven nineteen so this is like some fresh or all right here this is brand new this one right here is harvested on eleven twenty eighteen so it's a little bit older a couple more months old I don't really think that has anything to do with the quality of it but I mean that's just pretty cool know when I got a fresh card you know I mean yeah besides for that let's just hop into the rest of this video so let's open this up oh gee off the top then it comes in these little plastic things not the nose in the box that's weird so when you take it out of the box that's you're greeted with you get this nice nice looking cart also another thing that I really like about these cards I mean I know a lot of cards have them so it's not only just this car like a lot like a lot of different brands do it well I mean I don't know I guess it's just all personal preference and also kind of depends on the battery you have but they're gonna say like the white accidents that use just because like when I put it on them this guy pin that I have just like blue one white I don't know it just looks so sick you know what I mean but um here's the quality the oil real quick so you guys could see the clarity of it in color let me find the bubble so there's the bubbler that you can see the consistency of it right there so it looks pretty thick it looks like it's barely even moving um if you guys haven't seen my past reviews I always say tell me down below in the comments what you guys think of the oil to lucas's even though this is my review and you guys are watching my review I'm like really really interested to know what you guys think of it too so make sure you tell me don't blow me comments what you guys think of it oh I think the other one was a little bit like the Arnold Palmer was a little bit thicker than this one is this one it's actually like moving up slowly the Arnold Palmer one was barely even moving but this is actually slighted input I don't know it's still really big oil that's a really good sign this is what it looks like on the pen it's a pretty big pin though I mean like so yeah this is a pretty big pin that's like the only downside of it like especially when you have a four grand card on it it's like good like I don't know six inches maybe you don't [ __ ] know how big that is but um here's the quality of the oil one more time for you guys stupid clear like you see just a little dark that's literally like the only thing I could say about it but besides I mean like the color that the color has to do a lot of things you know what I mean it could do with the strain a weed they like the strain they used to make though or or it could do it there's so many possibilities unlike what could affect the actual color the distillate you know what I mean so don't really like just use that to judge the so yeah if you guys like to know just don't use that that's like your main source of like judging a car just like the color of it you know what I mean because there's so many different like things that could like affect that like so many different variables I could affect the color you know what I mean so so we got the trilogy no I don't know that is a little upsetting that doesn't have the THC percentage on it to be honest so but anybody from kind is watching this I mean I should say a little detail that I'll really cut like a lot more if you guys add it on your packages but like I said it's not too big of a deal but let's just turn this on and get our first couple hits I'm gonna preheat the battery up a little bit get it ready for us to hit it let me just uh voltage so I have it on like a pretty low temperature like just a little like 2 2 point 7 volts so pretty low so you guys are smoked if I didn't mention it I should have added it into the beginning of this video but if I didn't don't watch this video that's for 18 21 or whatever little you were ages Smokey's in the area or you have your medical marijuana card like I do oh yeah I just have to say that [ __ ] to cover my ass but you should hop back into this if you guys are smoking along with me Cheers um and yeah just get into this true OG client library and choose I definitely add that og wish taste oh yeah all right of it even though I'm not I'm not too old I'm not like a og I'm saying not how old I had a nuttin but I've been smoking for a minute um I haven't had a G cush for a minute so I don't know you don't really see too much like real OG Kush now anymore like in the area that I live there's so much like exotic [ __ ] and like I don't know I just feel like that's a new wave it's like exotic strains and that means you know you don't really see too much of the classic like Oh green crack like [ __ ] ogee curve like you know all the og [ __ ] you know what I'm saying you'd only see that too often no more you just see a lot of the exotic stuff so it's pretty like I'm nostalgic to say the least like the hidden some og [ __ ] like that it actually tastes like some fire oh gee it's some real live resin too which is really really like another nice thing about the car and just like the static of it like especially on this pen I mean you can put it even on like the average loss is my evo labs pan this is like a also one of my favorite pens I love this pin so much even on this pin like this [ __ ] looks [ __ ] badass like just black and white you know and this pen actually has on three temperature settings it has a low medium and hot so we're good I have it on the low temperature right now so I guess let's just move this we're gonna heat it up yeah it's preheating for me right now [Music] tastes Oh fire yeah the taste gets a five out of five right off the bat the way it smokes you see I'm barely ripping it I'm blowing clouds it gets a five out of five for the way he smokes it [ __ ] rips my smoked a little bit before I made this video but I'm definitely [ __ ] like I wanna hit this what two or three times so far I mean I'm already higher than I was when I started this video so yeah I mean it's definitely some [ __ ] hope we're not [ __ ] you know what I mean um so these carts should definitely fire but the price of them is they're cheap within the select parts that's a good thing but there's still a little pricey if they were about like 55 bucks I think that'd be a better price point but 62 was a little bit expensive in my opinion for a ground you guys ever tried on time live resin time we don't blow in the comments what you guys think of it and um I don't know if you guys are liking these like um Medical Marijuana reviews or like we train our views or whatever the [ __ ] you want to call these and you have any other recommendations or constructive criticism or anything like that you guys want to tell me time we don't blow in the comments read every single comment I try to reply to every comment I can or at least majority of them or at least like favorite them or you know let me do something I'm always trying to show as much love back to you guys as you guys showed to me because it's like honestly like without you guys that wouldn't really be [ __ ] I mean I'm not really the biggest youtuber right now but still without you guys I wouldn't be nothing you know I mean but so if you guys ever hit me put my Instagram you guys see I always hit you guys back and show as much love as I can so I mean yeah I really do appreciate you guys showing all the love and support you guys do like it honestly doesn't go like for like unseen like I really do appreciate it I'm not making that up but if you guys like really like these videos um the card reviews aren't stuff like that time we don't blow in the comments I've just been like [ __ ] so insanely busy it's been crazy working 40 hours a week trying to do this YouTube stuff keep my Instagram pages active like if you didn't know I have a page where I resell some FTP clothes in the street like that and there's some other stuff so I have so much [ __ ] I'm trying to work on at once while I'm doing [ __ ] 40 hours a week at work and then I figure I said I didn't know I got a [ __ ] DUI for medical marijuana so I got a I'm on probation for that so I'm doing dealing with a bunch of [ __ ] but uh so I'm just [ __ ] insanely busy right now but these videos are just kind of easy for me to record and get out like kind of fast you know what I mean that's what I've been doing them but um we'll have more reaction videos out soon hopefully so if you guys want to see them and you have any requests for us then we don't blow in the comments but definitely this car is definitely fires [ __ ] if you ever um if you ever see a kind live resin in your area I recommend definitely picking them up definitely if they are and if they have a buy one get one free deal like they have when I got these definitely pick them up because it's a [ __ ] steal I don't see why you wouldn't um don't smoke none of those fake hearts going around that's for sure we're all square I'll give this like a four out of five I mean what I said I meant to say a 4.5 out of 5 so like half a point away from a perfect score just for the fact being that they're like a little pricey like I said if they were around like that fifty five dollar mark that'd be a lot more like I don't know I just think that'd be like a better price point for them I mean I don't know I mean the worth is 662 dollars you know what I'm saying but just me personally I don't like spending that much money on just one gram because like I said I can get two grams of should have it for that price but I think 55 bucks should make it a better deal and I think they'd probably sell a lot more cards than they do now if they lowered the price a little bit but yeah that's just my honest review so four point five out of five that's the overall score pace five out of five the way it smokes five out of five I pretty much everything gets a five out of five except for the price point the price point gets a four out of five so that's the only reason it gets like a four point five out of five and I like I said I still have a couple other cards I could review there's a lot of other like dope dispensaries around me there's actually like a kitchen where they make like edible hamburgers and [ __ ] like that pizza so I can make a video there if you guys want um just really anything you guys want me to do is help me down below in the comments but yeah these carts are stupid fired four point five out of five final reading I know I said that a bunch so I'm in the video here let me hit this one more time to see if I have anything I want to tell you guys before in the video and then we'll just ended off that so the flavor on that is so good though like that it tastes so [ __ ] good just if you ever see them in your area definitely pick them up and if you ever tried them down below in the comments for you guys sing at them but 4.5 out of 5 like I said and besides for that it's been Ronnie ray give the video a big thumbs up comment like subscribe do all that good [ __ ] it slides for that you already know peace out", "7ToVjMC-FlU": "what's going on guys welcome back to my very first video and first review today we're going to be reviewing the new roach pocket vapes these are pretty new from my understanding these are pretty new to the market especially out here in california so i thought we might as well make a video about it um i went ahead and pulled up the page of these new pocket vapes these roach vapes now i have not tried them yet so it's gonna be a first for me designed by tma labs in california tma lapse is a full service vape cartridge manufacturer from concept to manufacturing we control the entire process and ensure results for every client now this is the world's smallest fully disposable vape cartridge as you guys can see now this thing should have a battery and everything i shouldn't mean nothing with this thing so let's go ahead and turn back on the camera here it seems we've got some hybrid sour cherry pie and my addition is up there as you guys can see is two thousand two thousand eight hundred fifty one out of four thousand eighty eight so these are exclusive to an extent there's only about a certain amount per stream that they'll produce so let's go ahead and figure out how to open this up okay it looks like we got a pamphlet here love it toke it fill it pass it plug it sneak it rip it hit it roach it then recycle it okay i'm liking it presentation is good now in california it's not a standard to have a whole box beautiful set up like this but for the disposables i believe they do require it you can't just throw these in a bag now let's go ahead and open this up so as we can see we're going to go ahead and slice that open let's use using a little nail for this all right it's a little difficult to open up i'll say that all right all right now i gotta say that the name kind of throwing me off a little bit you know what i mean like some raid roach sprayer type of vibram you know what i'm saying but wow this thing really is small wow jesus and i mean that is some dark juice right there now i am going to take pictures of this for you guys as well and i'll display them in the video all right that looks pretty cool as you guys can see it's not that dark but it is pretty dark let's see if we can add some light on there wow that is badass and i mean that's battery included okay so we put some light up to the juice yeah it's pretty dark it's not the clearest but that does not matter let's go ahead and give her a taste all right so i guess we just hit it this now you guys may have not seen the hit come out but it definitely felt it definitely felt the peak when they hit flavor wise i can taste the sheer cherry it does take tastes a bit dark though like like an indica kind of heavy which ain't bad but you definitely have that indica taste with it now it is a hybrid we will take another hit for the video's sake but you know give me a minute there boys wow so far i mean i packed a punch in that hit if i'm not mistaken okay yeah this is sour cherry pie all right all right let's get real here one more fire now you guys are probably asking yourself how much i paid for this now these do go for 40 and i believe says 380 milligrams so i think we're looking at a half honestly but who knows how much wax is in this it does seem like quite a bit i will post in the comments how long it lasted me i'm not gonna go ahead and straight smoke this for the next couple days because i mean i plan on doing a ton of reviews for you guys i got a bunch of new stuff i got some i haven't smoked this one yet either bloom imperial extracts i have tried one of their cards pretty damn fire um i got cure pods for days you know we'll give them bad boys a shot it's all right and i'm gonna be honest with you guys if i don't recommend something i'll let you know none of this stuff is sponsored i do get 25 discounts to most of the dispensaries i go to because that's because i have a chronic health issue but needless to say forty dollars this packed punch now is it worth 40 dollars half a gram i'd say yes you know you don't have to have a battery it is portable now i'm not sure if you guys can charge these that's the only reason i never buy these is because you can usually run in the chance of them dying out on you now it is not common but i've had bad luck before but yeah needless to say this is the roach cartridge i appreciate all of you for tuning in to this video leave it a like for me guys and leave a comment down below if you tried this or plan to try it and subscribe to channel if you haven't already um this channel is not all about reviews i mean we're going to be hanging out too so i have a lot of stuff in store for this channel and yeah i appreciate you guys now i will recommend this cart to you guys if you need something quick on the go if you don't have a battery pick up a roach cart i mean you ain't gonna lose 40 bucks half a gram that is a bit steep but then again you got you guys got to think about it it has its own battery and it's the smallest bit we vape cartridge in the world right now come on i mean i say it's worth it let me know what you guys think down in the comments below i appreciate you for checking out this video give me your time and i'll see you in the next one signing out", "SoVy7emFQOk": "you're smokin man growin and watch it fall down [Music] DGC Scottie real hanging out and doing something very interesting thank you for Jason from dialed in Terps for coming in I am really interested in trying to learn what do they call this they have to make these high-end extracts and now I always thought they made them with BHO and whatnot now Jason comes over and says no you can actually make them using real high-end water hash and pressing that into rosin and then you jar it up is that this jar tech is that what they call this yes jar tech it's um it's fresh frozen material that's then turn into bubble hash exactly like you said and depressed in the rosin and at some point you know you have to decide what you want to do with is our consistency goes right why is it look so different what's it start out so it starts out as rosin right yeah it's really suffered rosin okay we got a picture of that Ross and that [ __ ] is so bright why the hell is that rosin so bright white well you know quality in quality out you know you want to start with the best material possible when you're starting with the fresh products and you've matured a trichome to its full maturity right and still hold a nice color but I've seen things that are yellow I've seen things that are a dark almost like a tan brown and by the way it can be dankus [ __ ] but I seem like the 710 labs they do that real white five-star water hash sure and you're saying five stars kind of this five star material yeah I think 710 would probably be doing more if they're selling it they're gonna be doing a six star but the [ __ ] the difference help a brother out man all right six stars as good as it gets six stars as good as it gets no cars both wash goes all right that's the bright whites they all really light do you holo bright whites a full milk bubble hash okay put it on a bowl there's not gonna be any residue left got it and that's what's gonna burn clean right that's really what they're looking for for a full bubble hash by the way that 6r that's just expensive man I don't even know I bought that a little bit $75 a gram and I had like no second thoughts after I went through it or like 10 15 bucks it's just you want to do a few it is delicious I agree so is that what that way you end up with here or that's what we start with most stuff you're president of rosin would be a five star hash and what the difference is starting material yes the starting material is gonna leave a little bit of residue if you put a five star hash and a puff go peak it's still gonna taste delicious right you're gonna really enjoy it it's just gonna leave a little residue at the bottom of the bowl when you clean it you ever smoked bubble hash and you see that that's gonna be a five star hash or a four star hash and again I'm just trying to understood the difference is the quality of the material going in right so six star hash this is gonna be no residue it's gonna burn totally clean Wow just like you know when you smoke a full mil okay so what does this start out as this is five star what do you what do you call this this is five star material for that okay with I work really hard in house to peruse really nice flowers that I've fries fresh beautiful right beautiful you've been here about ten years right no I think we both heard the calling and yeah left our homes to come and be growers be growers out in public I love it I really enjoyed my 10 years in Colorado it's I'm home now yeah you're relieved oh yeah you're right he's right by the mountains absolutely beautiful beautiful up there I'll come visit you can't visit me I'll come visit you next time man all right all right let's get into these jars guru's got beautiful pictures of the jars over there yeah what what are we starting Wesley this jar tech I totally don't actually get to start material over here it's mousey absolutely yeah we got everybody in the shop hey that's I think it's secure I meant to do an AB you take that live you know fresh frozen bubble hash it goes into a freeze dryer okay so this is definitely freeze dryer right huge how beautiful beautiful that's what happens when my friends come over you all right so I've took 56 grams yesterday or this morning actually I woke up early at 6 a.m. right and press 56 grams of bubble hash okay and that's important you didn't press flour you're pressing 56 grams of bubble hash gotcha and that's how you really get the old dry quality Cessna and the bubble has just been dried in the freeze dryer okay and now what's in a freezer until I pressed it so to help me out I understand why everybody wants a freeze dryer why why that's like the key to super high quality okay a pretty dryer really is gonna preserve all the terpenes all the cannabinoids and it's gonna preserve its freshness and make it absolutely just perfect right so what so and your freeze drying the buds the flowers before you or your freeze drying the hash here freeze rather than bullish she's got imperious drying the bullish beautiful without losing any of terpenes right you're drying it at an extremely cold temperature wow what a trip all right I get it now I get it all right so now we got we pony that was a tad a process something like that this came up rest us this morning and if I were to pressed it and immediately it would have not started waxing up I've got it we came up to the show it's starting to wax up a little which is fine it's just a little bit harder to collect right so we're I'm in here and that's gorgeous it is warm by the way the air conditioning broke they're fixing it up we just fell right yeah we had this in the freezer and I already pulled it apart and the cold temperatures a key to this know right even everything cold right yeah so it started tearing the wax of him that is impressive that's the starting material okay yeah so now what do we do it now that to me I'd be dabbing the [ __ ] out of that as a matter of fact so is that dabble yeah you want to try it yes yeah you know we've got these these are called a puff coke peak is that what this is yeah absolutely yeah awesome you showed up with one and guru showed up with one the beginning in a week and they really do hit beautifully I think so yeah it's my preferred way to smoke I was a double uh double press here Yeah right Yeah right see he already turned it on so oh no what your right hand I'll turn it off because these are cold start tabs always for you now I just changed it to you take this more damaged how you didn't even started up so you're doing alright beautiful I forgot it's the right temperature I like to do it on green I think if you have a high quality product if it should burn really well and hey yeah I'll shout out to Stony scholar who was teaching me about this at the last dvc cup and he was probably the first time I heard about cold start dabs Yeah right great once ready deal alright I'll get mine going to this I haven't tried this yet this is star dog I did a full spectrum start up here ok beautiful star dog is it's JJ from top dog is that right really so yeah alright so back from bubble hashes is gonna be the 45 of you for me 45 of you all the way to the 160 you I don't even know how what say you what do you you have it's the micron size of the bubble bag say use it oh sure I know about that sorry so both bags coming about half that you get half a dozen bubble bags they go anywhere from what about 30 or something like that 30 microns 25 micron yeah 20 yep right usually or 220 or 190 or contaminate bags and then your your 160 bag you have some really nice head to start in and get in there yeah what he means by that so that's ones you keep your ear material and your starting material bubble bags all right hang on excuse me let me date with the puff coke peak oh yes let me turn my own give me some small talk here so we're starting off with this and then what that goes in a jar tell me how we get to these I don't understand the jar we smoke the [ __ ] out by the way this is amazing hang on a second smells good I haven't tried it yet this is my new harvest I do everything in-house and you know in Colorado you're only allowed to do 12 plants so it's really hard to have material all the time yeah absolutely you can put air quotes around your 12 plants your church things very interesting know if I did it right I still got some left oh oh I better q-tip it is this gurus you could double click it if you didn't want oh I guess going yeah that should have done that and sometimes you could get sugar done the double click oh good thanks pretty interesting best tastes pretty pretty delicious [ __ ] great it's pretty much cold Karen right here that's what you have here so yeah so what I have no idea what's going on here so let's go for it we got what I would smoke right there what are we trying to make we're trying to make diamonds and sauce with it we're trying to that's one of the that's one of the consistencies you can make what are they tell me tell me what are their Jesus movie it's almost offensive right so this is grease monkey and I took a little cookie pucker from camerado and mixed it in with the grease monkey from exotic genetics okay kind of spiced up the Terps a little and made it a little Wow yeah it's interesting smell yeah Jesus it is weird man that's an interesting smell so okay so that starts with this yeah it starts with this and you have your option of collecting into a ball right you know you're gonna take all these and collect it into a big ball Drazen that's easy I done that yeah exactly and you're gonna put it in a jar and seal it okay you could have options you could go into an oven at a temperature around 220 degrees okay 45 minutes an hour and we'll go over that later just a simple of them like a toaster oven or some convection oven yeah perfection oven okay I used my oven in my kitchen when I first started here thousands of dollars of equipment so I guess you got a couple G's in the freezer freeze dryer yeah so freeze right in a bubble bags the good bubble bags are getting up there and prints really and I love those bubble bags I spent my last dime I was on vacation found out those existed and spent my last dime on them it's like I got this right all right so we got we get it uh like this now what we put a leg ball it up put it in a jar how the hell is a ball of that gonna make that that doesn't make no sense to me it's like I said oh okay they'll go into the oven right 20 degrees got it or about 45 minutes this jar is gonna melt up and it's gonna foam up and it's gonna start 2d carved in the jar essentially what you're doing is separating your using solvent as a using terpenes as a solvent you're separating THC and the terpenes got it terpenes will go to the top THC will settle the bottom that will go on a heat map and that will sit on a heat man anywhere from 12 hours to 24 hours and so far none of this is specialty equipment I've got a seed heating mat right there I used to sprout seeds and and make clones with yeah that's what you need yeah kitchen the kitchen of an oven and a seed mat is all you really need I mean if you know this is all very high-end product you're working with medical medical instruments as much as possible right if you have a nice clean Breville convection oven that you could get at Best Buy or bad bad thing yeah all right yeah but aside from the freeze dryer which you'll make a lot of friends with that at least no yeah a lot of folks come into the house oh yeah and so how long does something like this have to sit after so you you bake it and it's it's ready or you sit what you're gonna do is you're gonna take that jar and you're going to essentially turn it into a liquid and though though it's gonna foam up and the bottom will turn into a liquid the bubbles will start to rise up the jar kind of like a beer okay when is three-quarters of the way up the jar is all liquid on the bottom and the top are bubbles it'll look like a beard when it was freshly poured exactly right that's when it's ready to pull out of the oven you're gonna take that jar out of the oven and put it on a heat mat like that and it'll sit on that heat mat anywhere if I can set from 12 to 24 hours and it'll the crystals will start to collect and form and that's it and how long so after 24 hours it's good like that that's only a process I would think it would take weeks for yeah I remember making rock candy as a kid that shook took weeks man it could take anywhere from 12 hours to 4 days five days goddess I've ever seen a jar takers been six days and does it matter about the quality if there's not enough terpenes and in the material or it always work I've seen some jars not work absolutely right not every strain does work but for the most part if you have a good quality starting material you do your process right right you're gonna you're gonna have good results did you see this is [ __ ] cool cuz you can do it with a convection oven and just go over to nosies house man he just bought a kid you didn't you just buy your a freeze dryer brother yes loving it I'll be right over absolutely okay so what other consistencies do we have man you know the most popular consistency in my world right now and I think a lot of people are really digging on is a cold here which hold you here come on get us get us up to speed I told you I gotta go to the 7:10 cup the concentration celebration in a month maybe get my [ __ ] together man this is the cold care dude so show that to the camera man that is if they had that in the store I might run out with it I have to I'd have to think I have to conscience man that thing is uh insane how many grams is this first of all so that's one ounce 28 grams okay yeah that's fun that's fun to have in my hand so has it been whipped yet this I'm still caring okay how long is the Cure on something like that so this the first stop is there a cure on that you said one to four days is that what you're calling it cure so what I'm calling on that is the separation okay yeah you're separating the terpenes or the THC and forming crystals is that after the cure this is so Karen so this has been this foot into a ball right and put into a jar right that's it all I've done is take that collected and put it in the showcase I love it how long's that after how long does that cure so this has been in a jar now for two days okay I'm gonna let this sit in a jar for a few more weeks God okay that's what I was thinking I thought there was some stuff he did for a few weeks and that's room for 60 degrees for a few weeks the sweat get terpenes will start to rise to the top they'll get softer where do you keep a room sixty degrees if we're trying to be practical and helped a DGC actually do this so you just take a cold basement like a dresser drawer got it and it's in the 60s clothes or it has to be dialed in 60 degrees I would consider a six a cold Kyra's 60 degree room okay you could also do a room temperature here is just just fine and it goes quicker it works just fine okay no reason to not do a room temperature here I'm still obsessed over it why not brother yeah if I cure something up it'll be just a pocket cure yeah I call it yeah yeah a pocket cure pocket cure that sounds like something I would do and when you're ready when it's when it's secured and you feel you feel it it's good where you like it right it's sweating terpenes it looks delicious sweating to smoke yeah yeah you take care take your tool and you go ahead and whip it like mashed potatoes essentially what's that can you do that what's that look like right we'll do it to this one all right so this one is the same material that this was the second press material so we'll show that material first of all all right that's the second pressing it's [ __ ] impressive normally when I would do the second pressings or at least a second run with my bubble bags it was much it was a lot less quality can you say a lot less quality much lower quality that's limit to say manthe books I didn't mean it's kicking it I've never been known for the best grammar myself you can make great concentrates nobody gives a [ __ ] about your grammar yeah all right so this one thing about this is an ounce that's announcer there's 14 grams okay half an ounce an ounce looks like yeah beautiful I put this in the oven okay yeah so in order to speed this process up you could put it in the oven as well and do cake batters what a lot of people are called so that's when I goes I get that a batter sometimes yeah okay so my batter out of the oven is gonna come out dry like this it's this is unlit so what about this moist you do there's plenty of terpenes in there and it's delicious and you can smell it it just needs to be kind of whipped okay that's not a fast profile yeah you know I'm more of like a no-till guy man so this is kind of I don't know man right I know it's actually the same idea though you know you get everything exposed to a more surface area get it exposed Wow okay that's looking like something to get it at a dispensary yeah then you start smashing it down kind of potatoes that looks good you know misty all looks getting wet and delicious already and you know right look at that so Leo is soft and gooey beautiful show that to guru man yeah come on you really get a nice good mash on that you're welcome to stop by the bakery any time so so what consistencies is coming like I said this is the end this is a second press and I did put it in the oven just to speed up the process of the cold appear for the show oven will loosen terpenes I don't know I think you could bring out some terpenes well it depends on the strain you know some the oven will bring out terpenes on some strains of them will destroy starting really fragile terpenes and some strands as well huh yeah absolutely I like to do a little bit of both I wish that's my tournament entry so I'm just kind of like oh yeah they're like that I can't smell it yeah you know the press of that so you know you so the quality is there it's delicious you want to try it yes yeah you probably don't ask me that any other man let me see that let me see the whole jar I got that cheese man right I'm happy today it's a good day in the bakery nice limit limit let me hold let me know yes Jesus what strain is this what do you think hate the nausea will you put this all back in the fridge it's totally waxed up it's gonna be really hard to click now but yeah the key thing is cold cold is the key yeah it is colder the better you're working at home if you could turn on the air-conditioner or open up some windows if I live at elevation so I keep everything really cool does that make a difference oh yeah damn I try to keep miles at 60 you know like I'll let you handle it yeah you know I just I start making pizzas and I'll be damned you got a really a just [ __ ] for elevation I'm sure making that stuff that's way sensitive man you really got to adjust you're a mile high up makes a [ __ ] huge difference especially with water absorption I so dry yeah it's almost impossible to keep up yeah is there any difference if people are trying to do this in you know up in Portland where it's more humid or anything is there any kind of special precautions they would have to take well Portland's humid yes what I'm wondering is such a different client man yes so the probably was something somebody that actually lives in Portland to ask wouldn't it yeah I mean you want to keep bubble high school most people professionally love make pilaster live and work and walk-in coolers so this is all about a walk-in cooler this would never hit this temperature as a professional matchmaker yeah yeah so this for the show it would have never made it this long and started to wax up already right I would have collected that immediately put it in a jar you put it in the oven for Jam put it in a jar put in a cold room for a cold cure and now what's a jam what's a jam so the jam would be you know the the crackles that's why we call it jhanas okay okay I believe olio cause a jam 710 calls it premium rosin and I believe gotcha you know there's different companies call it different things so help me out with these pro companies it's because they're able to do things like by walk-in freezers I think I forgot must have forgotten to turn mine on I'm still trying to help you with that Scotty I'm still trying to get this thing what am I doing wrong it's gross I see him that's I'm on it yeah so you want to click it once I'll get once all right and then click it twice to get it going and concert vibrates you're ready to go all right I like it I like it it's pretty cool man let's see a couple of these at the at the 710 concentration celebration I'm gonna bring mine yeah I think it'd be a good way to hit them I mean how torches are cool but yeah this is a safe little bit and a little bit yeah couple hundred stoners with torches sounds cool that's then I hit my sword on my place yesterday I heard a lady I was reaching around trying to fold the back up of a piece of paper I'm sure and sure hit my plate my will templates not so low-temp what they're doing that dude I use a toaster for like five minutes a week and I burnt myself man all right so did you get yours yet uh not yeah I don't think it's ever vibrate uh I mean I was actually making small talks ah there we go man there we go that just turned off double-click that again it it sways boom boom there you go now good now you're I like this thing but what stop at the learning curve how come I'm the only wall to learning curve it's bold school job school study all these gadgets I took me a while to I got laughed at for not having a filter on my joint last week the filter gets in the way honestly kind of taste taste bad throws in anyway hey okay it's a double quick hit that's what it is all right cool man I think we actually did pretty good man I think we uh I think I learned some [ __ ] man you run out I want to see this guy definitely but I'm pretty stoked that you if you invest in a freeze dryer that's kind of you're good to go you can all sudden start making super high-quality extracts like this as long as you're growing super high quality weed y'all I think so I think the learning curve here would be a lot a lot less than making butane hash co2 hash any of those types of hash it's illegal as a [ __ ] is illegal but you know there's a lot to learn yeah there's a legal and then there's a legal yeah yeah you know in a legal lab it's a lot to learn isn't very what's your brand called again I know you got a hangout dialed in Terps man died on turbulent turkey diving terpenes and ER yeah this is some pretty cool [ __ ] you got Instagram yeah I'm an Instagram that's about interest on Instagram other than terpenes on Instagram all right we gotta hang out a little more man this is [ __ ] cool I learned to hold this is like opening up a new world to me I had no idea actually I didn't know this existed because I would see the six star hashes and all these all these crazy concoctions at the dispensary but I really didn't know what went into him or how they were made I love the fact that there's there's no external solvents into it this is just what the terpenes act as a solvent right yeah absolutely it's cool it's awesome so that's yeah you know making bubble hash water solvent carrying agent you using water and ice to break off the trichomes just the very heads of the little live flower and it's bad acid into this yeah it's badass I still think I'm doing this wrong but Jason thanks so much for hanging out man thanks for making the trek and extra show me how to use this thing well though it doesn't even seem like I put the carbon cap on at this point that in terms out intervenes over on Instagram [ __ ] with a match take it easy brother Thanks crack take it easy oh yeah [Music] little break [Music] [Music] yeah [Music] medicine [Music] [Music] today [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "88WIJ6BvXdI": "there's a little update on our diamond mining process these are the diamond dust Bubba diamonds that we capped on March 11th we haven't worked or anything since then but we definitely have diamonds show you here you can see all kinds of diamonds in there that's a nice big one right there besides that one can't see I don't hard to see because the jar but I'm not gonna open the door cuz I'm still going on with the process as you could definitely see diamonds are forming in the bottom of this solution that we had I mean are we professionals I'm making diamonds no but you know we're learning you know they probably hat is a little more to it with exact right temperature and you know the exact right consistency but we are definitely making diamonds from what we are doing so there's no denying it there it is and you know obviously the more concentrated your solution is the bigger your diamonds well the more more diamonds you'll get in that container because I mean if you don't have much THC in there you can't you're not gonna fill the drawer with diamonds for sure but we're just gonna leave this here and not a carry on I mean we're in no hurry to smoke this and we'll give you some more updates down the road but you know and the job is a big fatty right they're starting to clump up along it so as the process continues they will grow once once you have one diamond forming it's basically the seed and the rest will follow along well that suckers getting big thanks for watching guys and viewing and I hope you guys are having some success at home if you're not feel free to DM me on Instagram what's goes Cup is won or West Coast coppers - and you know we'll try and help you out any way we can thanks for watching guys we appreciate all your views likes and comments until next time [Music] you this time we're making a eight-ball cush run we this one's a lot more concentrated we know because I'm too full of good little small buds and shake and then extract it down to this I'm not really getting many more bubbles so we're gonna cap it at this point and I'm betting that because the concentration is a lot more in that jar and this time I'm using a better jar to be able to see things as well stupid designs around it I'm thinking that we're gonna get a lot better results as far as quantity produced you", "qvv7PvVPbqE": "alright guys we are back and we have a new review a new product and that product is vape meds line of cartridges co2 extracted oil right here this is Key Lime Pie one of the strains that I've really been really been dying to try so when I saw this available I went ahead and picked it up cannabis club a Las Vegas cannabis club Las Vegas cannabis family you can see these things joey dabs he's the one coming up with them right now this one's a hybrid 70% indica 30% sativa some of the specs on the back here as you can see very very professional people what we have here 87% p8c tested all right and it is a half gram cartridge and it is a dis oolitic co2 extracted cannabis oil very very high quality let me go ahead and show you the cartridge itself very pretty pretty pretty golden cartridge golden oil and we're going to go ahead and take it out and we're going to give this bad boy a whirl my my cart maya my batteries are all charged up cars them yesterday when I picked up this thing I got the I'm gonna put this down for a second don't worry screwing in the cartridge while the point said my closet all right here we go we have it screwed on here nice and good I have it set on a three point eight is where I like mine set voltage wise and like I said we're going to go over again key lime pie is the strain bait met is the manufacturer Joey dad's is the one you want to hit up let's try it out oh yeah oh oh man oh that hit like a DAB Oh has that definitely that distillate co2 taste words where the flavors not strong but it rests in the back of your throat and it's like a sweet taste has a limey sweetness to it like a salary sweetness it's just very very good it's very good I was a good hit it's a very quality cartridge I would say hit wise I would give it a say man I want to give that like a nine point two nine point three maybe even yes yeah no you know what I'm going to say yeah nine point three we're going nine point three and cartridge wives very good it's a solid solid like like put together very nice the price is good the price is nice you get it delivered if you need to to the local so that's very very good look if you're like you know if you can't get out you know maybe you know maybe have some sort of a condition that doesn't allow you to move around but you still need your medication you can go ahead and get you can get that delivered to you really really awesome I guess it does have a good flavor it's really really good flavor-wise I get I mean to dis lit so I'm a giver like a like a nine I mean with this lit because they are you know they're more reintroducing the terpenes after they extract the oil it's always going to be a fainter kind of lighter taste but like what you like like you might not have that strong earthy green taste but you get like a much more concentrated of THC level and a bigger hit you know so at least that's you know the tale of the tape as we speak and something is really really good like I said for the price it's a really great deal um I don't really know if there's much more to say like I said yeah I want to say that's uh that's the ticket honor she's uh they've got more more they've got tons more flavors like I saw Apple Jacks there was a lemon cake which is one I'm going to pick up for sure they also had like man I forget I forget all the other ones but they look really really good like really really good so like and I'm going to try them out you should try them out because the oils good it hits like a champ tastes good and and it's all like put together really nice I've checked out vape meds they're [ __ ] good quality people doing good quality work so hit him up stay medicated stay blazed and if you feel like this video helped you out go ahead and like subscribe comment let me know that I'm helping you out you stay high stay medicated have a good one", "uz4hfUiGDY8": "[Music] hey it's mad at roughout studios now welcome to cannabase ecstatic oak shatter tabs and wax today we're going to look at several ways to smoke shatter wax and rosin along with the pros and cons of dab rigs and nails dab pins vaporizers emails and nectar collectors you can find all these products and more at the wizard puff com online head shop and you can save money with the code roughhouse I'd like to thank wizard puffs for sponsoring this video perhaps the og of ways to do dabs is the trusty dab or oil rig fitted with the titanium nail or quartz banger and is truly one of the most effective ways to do a dab you'll get a huge hit instantly and usually get the most out of your wax - as it's fully vaporized in seconds dab rigs might be one of the most effective ways of doing dabs but there are drawbacks such as needing a torch and gas to heat the nails and also a recovery time to reheat it now for the next tab also when you introduce open flame and exposed high heat into the process you also sacrifice safety to some degree dad pens on the other hand are probably one of the safest ways to do dabs these types of pens usually use quartz ceramic or metal coils to heat the wax enclosed inside of a sealed glass or metal cap these types of pens can be effective and give big hits but usually will take several puffs to smoke the same amount of wax as doing a single dab off of a nail another common drawbacks to wax pans is that the unvailed wax builds up and they require constant cleaning to keep functioning properly some vaporizers that are made for dry herb can also be used to vaporize wax to these devices usually provide a cup or pod that inserts into the dry herb heating chamber to vaporize the wax these types of devices can be very convenient but the cons are that they often do a mediocre job of vaporizing wax as they lack the heat that's required and the small pods can be cumbersome and leaky so it can be hard to keep the heating chamber clean for dry herb nectar collectors or vacuum systems could be considered the Dark Horse of DAB methods these types of devices use a heated tip on the end of a handheld device that you dip directly into the wax there are both electric collectors as well as those requiring external heat sources such as a torch one big advantage of the collector type rig is that you can get huge hits when you're dipping the tip directly into the wax but they can have a bit of a learning curve and a little bit awkward to use perhaps the biggest favourite among divers is the email emails are very similar to the standard titanium nail on an oil rig with one key difference the emails have an electronic control center to set a precise temperature and a heating element that will keep the nail continuously heated and ready for a dab the pros of emails are that it's ready for a DAB any time that it's on and you can set to precise temperatures and you also you can do back-to-back dabs without having to reheat the nail they may also arguably be safer than using open flames and are clearly more convenient than needing a secondary heating torch cons are that they usually require a power source to operate so it may not be as portable as the other methods and it's also very convenient to use so you might find yourself smoking through your wax very quickly and passing out on the couch very early whichever method you choose dabbing wax or rosin so long as it's free of impurities is actually healthier than smoking cannabis flowers by not smoking or vaporizing the plant materials you are clearly putting less unnecessary chemicals into your body and by taking concentrated doses you're required to smoke less frequently not to mention that the time it takes to do it to have is far quicker than the time it takes to smoke a joint bulb or especially a blunt but if you're an everyday diver like myself a nice email setup likely be the way to go but if you only occasionally dabber prefer to vaporize then a three-in-one vape pen that does wax too might be satisfactory or any or an inexpensive wax pen might be even better or perfect for the beginner just looking to dabble in wax shatters and rosin concentrates again I'd like to thank the guys at wizard puff for sponsoring this video you can save money on a lots of the products that you saw in this video with a code roughhouse and wizard puff comm I hope you enjoyed this video on how to smoke shatter tabs and wax if you did please visit Rafal studios.com for hundreds of cannabis culture videos made just for you this is matt from ruff house studios thank you for watching [Music]", "uWELXO1__xI": "what's good guys um good to see you again sorry to take a little break i was going pretty hard need a week to just chill but anyways i got a special review today we're going to be going over a 10 cartridge versus a 50 cartridge i know a lot of people they just want to they just want to get high they just want to get high really quick discreetly um and for cheap which is understandable that's why these 10 cards used to be really popular back in the day i was even hooked on these 10 cards for a while just because it's it's it's cheap it's cheap cheap to get high but that has changed now i don't cheaply intoxicate myself i smoke the very [ __ ] best best that i can find so first off let's give it a look it has this um kind of like iron type titanium look to it some ridges um looks cool distal it's flat not moving let's get a little puffer nothing to really complain about i mean ooh this is something to complain about cannabis extracted with butane so i don't know how many uh ppms is in here i don't know how many parts per million uh is left over of butane in this in this cartridge but that would turn me away and that's probably one of the reasons i don't buy these i didn't actually know it was extracted with butane but now i do but yeah now we got uh some dab logic um that tasted okay there wasn't really too many complaints about it it's not like i full on tasted butane dab logic nice little uh laser laser print around this um it looks like it's natives or aztecs or something has dab logic written across the bottom take this off and snap this on now right off the bat i can it can automatically taste a more it's a more natural taste uh you're not gonna be really be able to tell maybe if you're like you know not used to knowing what quality tastes like if i were just a noob coming in here these would both taste very very similar it's not like you can taste heavy butane in that or anything it's just me knowing that this was processed with butane what turns me away but that's you know it's ten dollars worth of butane now what makes these so different why is this ten dollars why is this fifty dollars a big part of this is gonna be extraction these guys oil they're in the market for wholesale they make most of their money off distributing large quantities to dispensaries they're targeting the market that you know is wanting to and toxic intoxicate themselves for a lot cheaper now these guys these guys are marketing more towards the connoisseurs uh this extraction this was not extracted with butane uh there's a process i'm not too sure how it goes down or how they get it into cartridges but i know there's lots of ways to uh extract and get solventless you can do a fresh chop wash that in a bucket of ice water extract those tricoms in a ice hash then press that and then here comes your rosin i don't know how they liquefy it or what consistency and uh temperatures they do to get it to this consistency in this cartridge but they do and it works so what you're mainly paying for right here and why this is so so much more expensive is that is that when people are washing this and uh when they're extracting uh from this method you yield also a lot less from just blasting a can of butane through a whole bunch of weed this process you actually your yield is a lot smaller um but you have a higher quality so that's where the 50 dollar price mark come from but you know a lot of people really don't care but a lot of people do care and this is this is the main differences sorry you can't see the table the camera's up a little too high uh but yeah anyways uh i hope you like this video i hope i covered everything um and there's like a lot more there's like a lot more there's a lot more labeled on this solvent-less solvent-less vape and for those of you that don't know solventless i had a friend ask me i've explained rosin to them but sometimes people don't remember solventless is processed without solvents like butane co2 what else do they use um that's all i can think of out of my head those are the main ways that people use to extract those are solvents this is solvent less solvent less is the way to go your lungs are going to be a lot happier your high is going to be a lot better and you might say well [ __ ] i don't want to spend 50 on a cart i'm going to stick to 10 that's ok but also you have to keep in mind this is going to pack a harder punch because it's way more purity in this than that other cartridge i didn't mean to be a dick i shouldn't do that i'll [ __ ] it uh but anyways i don't even know where it went it wasn't too far anyways it doesn't matter but yeah those are the main differences a 50 card versus a 10 card i know a lot of people see it in dispensaries and they're like why the [ __ ] is that cart fifty dollars well now you know uh glad i got to do this video a lot about to see you guys uh subscribe uh i'm gonna be doing some merch drop soon so you know stay tuned turn on those notifications uh and i'll see you guys soon uh probably my next video i'm gonna be comparing some of the weed i grew and some of the weed my friend grew and we're gonna put it up against some dispensary weed and show you why potentially home growing could be better than commercial growing that's not always the case but for 99 of industry it is um peace out guys take care let me know in the comments what other videos you want i love uh i love getting suggested new ideas because sometimes i don't know what are good ideas and i just go off top but thanks guys for watching peace out", "dQO7oqdzNfA": "but this you guys is what I'm most excited to show you I've never had one of these before it's a rosin cartridge what is going on you guys my name is Jeff also known as popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe I got a lot of lip videos on the way like today I'm gonna be showing you when I picked up from silver stem cannabis in my last video if you missed that video I got to tour their entire dispensary bring you guys with me show you what it's actually like inside of there it's [ __ ] sick make sure you check out that video a link to it will be in the description but right now I'm going to show you guys what I actually bought and what it looks like because there's some fire ass products there when you buy weed legally it comes with a receipt I spent two hundred and seventy seven dollars it would have been two twenty before tax but there's some hefty taxes in Colorado but it's worth it because hey I can [ __ ] buy the [ __ ] in the store I don't need to have a plug I don't need to fly with my own it's nice just being able to go into a store and pick out some [ __ ] and even with the tax it's so much cheaper than it is in Pennsylvania like you don't pay taxes when you buy weed in Pennsylvania but the growers and the processors and the stores are definitely paying a lot in taxes and that goes down to you so you might not pay a tax but you're being taxed alright let's start with these I picked up these little tablets just cuz I've never seen these before they're called pressies they have desired effects on them like sleep energy focus they only have like five or ten milligrams of THC in them so they're not very potent but they come with some other stuff that are supposed to actually help increase the desired effects that are labeled on the package I try out the focus ones just see what it's like it's literally like a little tablet and says a little THC mark on it's pretty cool I know if you're supposed to chew it or pop it I'm really glad I read that it says right on the bottom swallow don't you alright guys I'll see if that 10 miligrams does anything to me but I'm gonna be smoking a lot on top of it so I probably won't even really feel it you know I get high as [ __ ] all day and I get distracted so much stuff this could actually like help me focus real a little like that'd be kind of cool now let's get to the live rosin you guys picked up some olio I picked up the strain tropic sunset its a mix between slur Akane number 4 and papaya punch number 3 I didn't even smell it honestly like the name just sold me if you watched the video yesterday though you saw him open up a package of oleo they have such beautiful packaging man it's really [ __ ] cool they definitely take the extra step to make sure there's a great presentation with the product and the products really good so you really can't go wrong with them and just like the homie said it comes a little dab tool I didn't let it sit flat last night so you can see a little bit dripped onto the side but that's not the end of the world oh my god you guys this [ __ ] looks so good I was sure you're gonna close up for this if you guys can see that like it's just a beautiful yellow has a very nice consistency to it it's like a liquidy sugar and that's what's so cool about rosin man there's so many different consistencies that it ends up being just loaded up the puff coke peak I hope you guys are smoking with me let me know in the comments what you guys are smoking on every go you guys man I just like flew away and went to heaven that tastes so good [Music] my god you guys even when I look on this you guys truly [ __ ] beautiful job if you guys are ever in Colorado pick up some holy Arase Jim I really like this dispensary you guys they have some top-shelf concentrates there flowers amazing that's what I'm about to show you next but just like with over 300 dispensaries in Denver it's hard to find like all the good ones so as soon as you find one that has like great prices and great products like I just wanted to keep going to it damn I picked up two strains I picked up at indica and sativa flower this is the mimosa this is one of my favorite sativa strains I love smoking joints in mimosa if you've had mimosa before you already know but if you haven't you got to try it man it's some great [ __ ] weed and this is a shame that the budtender sold Deon he was very helpful this [ __ ] like I usually don't for whatever reason strains that have the word silver in it I don't like I don't even not like them I just like tend to just like not look at it because I'm like in my head I'm like gold is the best of silver my aunt but this is called silver OG and like I don't know if we get much better than this like it is a heavy indica it is like that deep green with like bright white trichome still so it looks like it has like snow on it this little it looks like the Tegrity farms Christmas snow weed and like if that was true that would be very concerning I don't know how good the shots do it for the weed but oh my god you guys it is a fire I honestly think I'm gonna go back to silver stuff before I go home and get some more flour because they had some great strains out there I just started with one indica and one sativa preheating the peak right now cheers you guys that was a nice reheat what I really like about the earrings is you can put a decent amount of wax in there and like if you take a big dab it's not all wasted like you can just reheat it and keep smoking it but this you guys is what I'm most excited to show you I've never had one of these before it's a rosin cartridge I paid too much money for this but I had to do it I said I wanted to try some cool cartridges while I was out here and I mean it happened this is from olio I don't want to skip over how great their packaging is they do such a good job on it that I feel like it deserves a little second I love you can kind of tell it has a little bit more of a foggy hue to it than a normal cartridge it's really cool how it says the strain on it too because sometimes you forget what strain you're smoking or if you have a lot of cartridges you can get them confused again using my cloud products rio+ different color but I just love these batteries they're one of my favorites cheers you guys wow that is one of the best AC cartridges I've ever had it's papaya punch that's gonna taste [ __ ] awesome but if being rosin versus actual distillate holy [ __ ] and like I can feel it like I'm getting really high off this like I can feel it on the face in the eyes this is not your normal cartridge this is crazy holy [ __ ] this is like one hit and you're high and it literally tastes like a rosin dab this isn't saying you guys the future man they can work on the price a little bit it would be way more feasible but what a great experience like I'm [ __ ] ripped I am so happy I got this this is the last thing we got through the liquid live resin cartridge I picked it off the name and the package honestly the [ __ ] is really cool and having a garlicy cartridge I've never had that before and it sounds pretty interesting chum the company Green Dot it's a [ __ ] [ __ ] to open here's the inside packaging cartridge is sitting on the side to push right through here to get the cartridge out then it gives you the stats on the back just peel here and don't use this if you're pregnant okay that this cartridge has a little adjustable air flow filter I don't really like these what it does is give you either more or less airflow I'd rather you just like tell me what's good and stick to it I'm gonna try minimal air flow and see how that goes Devlin gives you a hard hat doesn't Asus goes the rosin cart but still a good tasting cartridge well it's actually like kind of bad to the place garlicky it's not like sweet like that's why I prefer but it's like a very dank weed eat aced it's very heavy on the garlic I'll tell you that it's not even really a GMO taste it's definitely just more straight garlic it's a garlic explosion definitely prefer the rosin cart over this I'm going back to the rosin cart I need something with a better taste [Music] much better I think that's what we're gonna wrap the video you guys super pumped to try this for the first time way too expensive but definitely a cool experience that is so amazing this is probably the coolest thing I picked up in my opinion click like if you enjoyed the video let me know what you thought the coolest thing I got was subscribe for more videos I appreciate you watching my name is Jeff beaks", "ZuWVasICekc": "[Music] what's going on guys welcome to the channel my name is Jay and today we have a couple of goodies that we're gonna be checking out we have the a BB C battery got your blue Ripper logo right there as well as your truely blow go right there so this battery is actually really really good I'll explain a little bit more about that later but we also have two different variants of the blue river browsing karts this is the puck yeah and I also have the paradise weights so your indicas are gonna be the red crimson I guess you could say all your hybrids are gonna be the yellow and your sativas are gonna be the TLS green blueish or whatever you want to call it yeah I mean anybody who's been to true leave knows that those are the color codes but I just wanted to let you guys know for the folks who are newer to it but anyways these carts right here guys I've been hearing some negative feedback on them but me personally I really really like him I like him a lot the pokey ax especially I had a buddy he got the Paradise weights and he said that it tasted like aquarium fish rocks I don't know but I didn't get that vibe off of it personally I enjoyed it it tastes just like the rosin did from paradise wait so it was like the buttery one last batch super super flavorful turkeys hail it's just this is good man so but anyways jumping over to the ABDC battery this is gonna be your box that it comes in comes with your little directions on the back so what's gonna get in your seed battery box is gonna be your battery as well as your magnetic ring that goes on the bottom of your carts it's a 5-10 thread and you get your charging cable just a little mini USB so there's a couple little things about the battery that I don't care for too much this is the bottom hopefully you guys can see it a little bit so that's your mini USB input right there to charge it and goes to a regular USB I think it's 2.0 maybe 3.0 I'm not sure but you got a high and a low setting on it the low setting is a lot morter be super duper flavorful but it takes a lot longer of a hit were straight in just a second but the hits are a lot better on the low for me like flavor-wise you'll get a lot more clouds out for the high one but with the low one you kind of got to hit it for I would say around seven seconds seven to eight seconds straight for it to be a full one I guess the ceramic coil inside of here is a little different than the wick coils are so it takes a little bit longer to heat up as you would be like taking a DAB or something it's very similar to uh I guess you could say puff kopeeks ceramic it just heats it up so this is gonna be what the actual carts look like they're not too big they are half grams but it is less than a half a gram because it's 400 milligrams um it doesn't matter too much I mean you get your money's worth out of it in my opinion the effects alone are where it's at to me I'm gonna check out some of the percentages for you it's a little different than Vista Lydia's guys it's not gonna be as concentrated so this right here is more so for like full-spectrum and completely solvent list will jump into the process of how this made and stuff in just a minute but I wanted to read out some of the percentages for you so THCA it has 7.5% regular th see it has 41.1% CBD as at 0.3 percent THC v is at 0.8% zero CBN we have 5.3 percent CBG that's was so so it pretty much has an active THC count of two hundred and thirty eight point four milligrams active CBD is one point five milligrams so it's a little lower than like the distillates are because it's not as concentrated but I think it's great and the effects hit me just right I ended up getting a couple more coming so they'll be coming today I wanted to see how this sativas hit so I did order some green crack in it so we'll see how their sativa one hits - a little later on but yeah see me personally I haven't got to try the flower in PUC yeah yet so trying this it was just phenomenal to me I enjoyed the fix from it Puck is definitely an indica that I recommend so this one's pretty much empty I'll show you guys where the empty ones look like they do run out fairly fast that's the only bad thing about it it does run out fairly fast so anyways guys let's open to a hit of this real quick so to start you're gonna take your ring off the bottom I'm sure that anybody who's had like a drop-in vape knows the magnetic little ring that goes on it don't lose that you can't get more of them but just don't lose it I'm telling you this is hell if you lose it you can use it on a regular battery and it works fine this was actually made for these ceramic coils in here these don't have a wick coil for it they actually have straight ceramic in there and it takes a little while to heat up and it literally burns like a dab wood in my personal opinion I definitely recommend getting the battery the only downside to it is it freaking vibrates the whole time you're hitting it which I mean you're only hitting it for about 10 seconds so you only got to deal with about 10 seconds and it lets you know that it's on and running I guess that's a good thing but I just wish it didn't vibrate the whole time or I wish there was like a switch you could hit that turned the vibration off anyway so this is a brand new puck yeah I'm gonna pop this bottom off I'm gonna screw this bad boy on and so pretty much you just screw it on and drop that back away in now you can loosen this a little bit to get a little better airflow and that's what it says on the battery box also so if you loosen it just a little bit you'll get a little better airflow not too much it's a little jiggly when you do that so I don't like loosing it too much I'd tighten it all the way and then I pull it like a tiny tiny bit off maybe like 15 degrees barely so we're gonna demonstrate for you guys how it hits on low and type of cloud production it gets like you do have to hit it a little longer when it's on low to get it heated up but I think personally that the flavor is just so much better so here we go we're gonna demonstrate the puck yeah guys Cheers so that first hit it kind of warmed up the ceramic so now when you go in and take a second hit there will be a lot more cloud smoke so cheers for the second one that one got me oh man the pokey is just so flavorful it hits so good on low in my opinion I don't know I like a I like to get stoned of course everybody likes to get stoned but if you're really trying to medicate and you're trying to actually get the flavor and kind of get access to those terpenes that would otherwise burn up at higher levels the low is definitely a good setting for you so we're gonna switch it over to high and demonstrate that all right so now we got it on high but then last two kind of got me a little bit cheers guys here we go on high put yeah super super hits oh man so with this better when you use it on high you still get decent flavor in it in my opinion but as opposed to if you were to go throw it on another battery like say oh if you were to go buy the little stick battery from truly the one that you hit five times that turned it on the clouds would produce great on the lowest setting but I don't recommend using it on the highest setting because I did it the first day I didn't have these batteries in stock and it was just too hot I could taste that it almost like burned it a little but when not where I threw it back in here it didn't have any problems and the taste was back right so I think that they are specifically designed for this if you use it on a lower setting on another battery that's fine it works just fine guys don't go being like oh they don't have this so I can't give the rosin cart you know what I mean but if you do get a chance to get this with it I recommend it personally just because of the flavor alone and the discretion of it this is so little man it's almost like skinny as hell could go in your pocket nobody will even notice it and if you want to take a DAB this is literally like taking a quick dab so if you want to take a quick gag you just grab it out look around and it's wonderful the UH the hide definitely hits really good guys but it's not as flavorful so I always like keeping it on low personally because I like to taste the flavor that [ __ ] that's because I really enjoy the flavor of them we're gonna take out the paradise weights the puck yeah though is literally one of my favorite indicas now I can't wait to try it in the rosin I want to try it in the rosin so bad they just now get the Skywalker rosin backing guys so I ordered two of those and I ordered the Green crack rosin car and I got the LA Confidential so we'll be reviewing those soon I'm gonna drop that one and we're gonna throw it on this one the I'm gonna put them next to each other hopefully you guys can see it if not out there are some images up on the screen but the one on your right is gonna be the pokey ax and the one on your left is gonna be the Paradise weights I think the Paradise weights is a lot lighter you can't see it too well right now like I said I'll throw it up on the screen for you but the Paradise weights is a lot lighter it looks beautiful though like there's no kind of weird [ __ ] I didn't know if like you know mold would grow on it or anything like that because I've seen with like diamond type carts and stuff that have extra like diamonds and [ __ ] and juice in there they've actually molded in stuff but I've had these for around two weeks and it hasn't molded at all I literally got it on the release day so there's no mold no kind of buildup no weird [ __ ] going on in it and they look great to me anyways let's try this Paradise weights out guys and try it out on low get a good flavor for it Cheers yeah it tastes just like that rosin did I like when you close your eyes and if you really sit back and try to like think of what I guess aqua fish tank rocks would taste like it kinda could relate to that mmm I don't know I don't know it's weird but in my opinion it tastes just like the paradise weights rosin guys super duper great effects I'm already straight laid-back chill that's from the puck yeah though this [ __ ] right here whoo I really really enjoy that book yeah I wish I would have got some more of them they're fired guys closest thing you're gonna get to taking a DAB in a carp right now here in Florida is gonna be this guy's so I've heard a lot of people say that they really enjoyed the live resin cards from purely better than these it's a whole different ballgame guys the library of cards from purely our live resin but it's reintroduced to distillate so it is a distillate car guys it's completely different ballgame these right here though guys are fully solvent lifts so you don't have any kind of chemicals none of that [ __ ] going into it they're not doing anything I mean obviously it's safe but if you really want to get closer to taking a dab in a Kart these Blue River karts it's gonna be where it's at guys truthfully I personally enjoy them a lot so this is what its gonna look like coming straight out of the dispensary these four little parts pretty similar to all the other cards guys but you got your big all Blue River logo on there this right here I've been waiting for something like this for a long time I'm just happy that we are actually getting some type of variety here in Florida I just check that [ __ ] out it's so pretty guys the smell alone of that puck yeah man it just hits you some good stuff so jumping over to the Blue River site guys I'll put the link in the description they're actually called rosin sauce karts played pretty much read a little bit of an overview the best way you could describe the process of it being made is that while they're making the THC a squishing regular rosin and making the THC a powder the juice from the rosin is what this is so pretty much it's like a squish of a squish of a squish you know I mean so you would take your plant you would squish it then create rosin and you would take that rosin swish it then create THC but the juices from making that THC a would come out and it would be this rosin sauce so the potency is usually going to be around 75 to 80% overall the THC is anywhere from 40% to 50% and in that range and and that's not a bad batch guys that that means it's some good [ __ ] that's pretty much what it's supposed to be at it's not supposed to be in the 90s it's not an actual full-on concentrate it's just sauce from making that THC a the THC a comes in around 25% it's got around 3 to 14% other cannabinoids and seven to nine percent terpenes it is strange specific so that's a good thing if you guys like a certain strain you'll be able to go try that strain if you've gotten good results on it with like vapes and flour and [ __ ] like that it's a hundred percent cannabis derived true full spectrum it is mechanically extracted which means it's not washed with chemicals or anything like that it's just straight-up squished that's what a mechanical advanced mechanical extraction process means if I bring you for free right free Frankie together and it has the ceramic core that's what I wanted to focus on earlier so these bullet tips this is what is called the bullet tip that top little area and then down in the bottom here you're gonna have your ceramic core and like I said earlier it's not the wick style that soaks up the oil it's just a ceramic core that gets hot and vaporizes the oil so that's why I say it's good to use this type of battery instead of like trying to get super duper big clouds burning the [ __ ] out of the whole of the oil because if you turn it all the way up and you [ __ ] try to get a huge one out of this and you sit there and pass it around it's gonna end up tasting like [ __ ] guys I promise you but to each his own everybody does it their own way can't tell anybody how to do their type of smoke and you know what I mean I think it's about time for another hit ooh tasty super tasty yeah this [ __ ] got me like poop so my rating for the rousing cards guys is gonna be about a 8 out of 10 I really enjoy the whole process man the flavor is great you get to really taste them Terps if you throw it on low it's new you know it's a new ceramic core you gots bullet-head tips new batteries stuff like that there's some neat little experience to have I enjoyed it some people might not you know it's a it's not everybody's cup of tea but for me I've been looking for something like this it's completely full spectrum solvent list you can't be this for blue river guys and everybody who's a dabbed in Florida they know blue rivers where it's at in my opinion but thank you guys for watching and all the support guys if you hadn't check us out on Instagram check us out at underscore tree show we got pretty much smoke sessions I'm about to be back fully active just had a little week where I took off cuz I had a couple medical issues but we're fully active on there guys will have some smoke sessions new video release drop page stuff like that I'll even go live every

with another one and this one well it's different i'm honestly not sure if i have done a vape pen review on this channel um if i have i completely forgot but it was probably on this same exact strain because well this is one of my favorite strains but before we get all into all that guys this is a medical marijuana channel i'm a medical marijuana patient here in the state of florida and this channel is designed for those over the age of 18 if you're under the age of 18 grow the hell up each day shut up so here we go guys this video is probably going to be coming out after the how to clean your glass video so if you haven't seen that make sure y'all go up here somewhere go check that out but long story short guys if you've been paying attention on instagram at the real marijuana mic or you just been paying attention here you know that a couple of weeks ago i ran out of my allotment when i went and picked up that ounce of weed a couple weeks ago i had already used up my concentrate allotment that's why i actually got that ounce because i didn't have any concentrates so when i picked up that ounce i used up the rest of my flour allotment now people can ask me what the hell is allotment allotment is just the amount of marijuana i'm allowed to purchase for instance every month i'm allowed two and a half ounces and i'm also allowed 14 grams of concentrate i've already made a call to my doctor to get that from 14 to 21 so that's what's up it shouldn't be a problem anymore plus i got that nut smasher machine coming so i ain't got to worry about them i'm going to be pressing my own concentrate soon and i will be making plenty of videos with that machine guys so stay tuned for that i also have an email that should be coming here today um so be on the lookout for that as well but topic at hand here this fake pen so long story short i woke up today i'm like dude i need something because last night i scraped all my bowls i smoked all my resin i woke up dry today so i'm like do i need to figure something out here uh just because honestly guys i've been smoking for so long without a break that it it already in the few hours that i hadn't been smoking dude my anxiety and anger level just crazy so i love mia indica this is a hybrid but still either way so i woke up on like dude let me try to see if i can get a couple of carts you know so i put two court two two orders of the mimosa and so and i'm looking and then then somebody hit me up and i was like oh [ __ ] that's right this falls under inhalation so inhalation you know like smoking all that i already used up all that so i was like [ __ ] what am i gonna do i'm like screwed i'm just gonna show up and maybe they can help me out so i get there i'm like listen i have an order for two cards i don't even know if i can get them my allotments up she's like listen you have about point five four of you know allotment left i'm like oh i bet so i went to the back long story short guys i ended up being able to pick up just one of these cards okay now the vape pen that i'm using is an open vape oh oh pan vape the letter o the word pen and then vape oh pen vape all right this is my go-to vape honestly guys i i haven't really experimented too much with vapes i usually just find a product that works and kind of just stick with it to be honest um but i'm not sure if i did a review on this if there if i did just go look it up try to maybe type an open vape but i don't think i have if i haven't i will make sure to get a review up on this soon but uh i picked up five grams of mimosa which is honestly guys i have not tried every single card i've tried maybe a handful if that's mimosa is by far hands down my absolute favorite card in the world i don't i'm sorry but the flavor on this is just nothing but sweet sweet juicy oranges like the taste it melts me bro every time i taste this and i know that sounds really weird and [ __ ] but i'm just keeping it a buck i honestly guys could suck on this all day pause i'm not trying to be like your girlfriend but i usually put this this has three set up though i say that for the review so as far as the mimosa goes guys this was coming in at 86.7 something percent and i'll tell you what i like it i don't like okay about vapes and why you don't ever really see me vape okay and i'll just give it a book the thing the number one thing i don't like about this is this it's right there at all times okay so wake up out of bed gotta take my morning piss damn that piss has turned into a [ __ ] time for breakfast [Music] oh that was good need to smoke i just smoked after i ate but i need to smoke like that's the issue guys it's just all at all it's literally here at my hip at all times i'm at work i'm in the bathroom at work i'm talking to somebody at work like that's the only thing i don't like bro i'll fly through this thing okay like these are good like if you got a low tolerance and you just don't dab and [ __ ] portable dab right here but if you're like me you're diving every day you're smoking every day like you're going crazy ballistic i'll fly through this it won't last me long this is a half gram and this cost me 48 okay but i will say this i love these for the convenience and i more importantly dude i love these for the flavor okay if you smoke for flavor and you don't do vape pens bro you're missing out on a ton of terps okay i believe the terps on here are like four and a half percent okay so it's just flavor every hit now i don't really draw too long because as i said i'm out of my allotment so this and the uh syringe of true clear which i'll be doing a review on as well stay tuned for that um this has got to last me till the 23rd which it probably will obviously but i want to keep that mentality so i don't burn through it regardless keep that tolerance still kind of dropping a little bit you feel me all in all guys mimosa is the way to go if you're looking for just taste on a vape pen man that's the only one i go to bro i don't really trust nothing else you know i was gonna try some sunshine cannabis but the flavor on this bro i can't you know i can't give it up i'm hooked but i love y'all i appreciate y'all like i said if you haven't seen that glass cleaning video go check it out and i'll be putting out that banana kush true clear syringe video as well and i just appreciate all the support guys 600 followers on instagram organically is crazy in a three month period to me and uh almost 140 already on youtube real crazy so i just appreciate it man don't forget i got that nut smasher coming so

follow kind of it's live and we're back with another review video make sure you like subscribe and watch the end for a chance to win a free grinder piece another mastermind head [Music] what's up everybody boy mastermind we're back with another video I'm here live while kind of his live and today we're talking about a product from Wellsprings Fields this is a live resin crumble the name of the product is train is called snow Ripper tested at five hundred eighty seven milligrams has total CBD of six point five two and does have a terpenes here check that out there on the bottom there and it comes in this box this box you got a peel the sticker off here and go through all this the box is just too much and inside we have a little stick and we've got the product here now in order to get the product out there here it is here's the back of it you have to turn this one and this is I don't like this you turn this really hard and there you've got it open you can see the product how does it obviously this is like I said a crumble snow Ripper and smells amazing what I'm gonna go ahead and do is try some in the packs which guys and like I said whenever you're doing this you know you just really need a small amount for your packs you don't need to you don't need to overload very small dab here in the oven you can almost not even see it it is in there and we're gonna go ahead and heat up the packs see what happens let you know what my first impressions are there's a bird flying around out there so you might hear a bird an eagle or something in the background the video I don't know what's up with that so yeah but yeah my thing about the packaging is the box is too much and the cap is too hard tool those are my main things about the packaging so let's see how it tastes that we're almost here to our temperature here you know here paksas I have mine on number three on the third light so that he was where I keep mine at for me but you could run it on 420 and get a little bit hotter but I don't really feel like it's necessary and so I have a green light now I'm gonna hit it the water test I would say is doing great underwater guys still hitting lots of vapor still coming [Music] all right now I'm gonna stop the video for a second and I'm gonna come back in about five minutes and let you guys know what I'm feeling you ride that alright I'm back so you know it's been about actually ten minutes and basically the bird is still crowing out there see my store a bird in the background you know I feel any relief predominantly in my back and in my knees positive energy so I think it has a little bit of effect on my anxiety because I do get anxiety and that can be kind of tough for me to do videos I feel a little bit of relaxed let's look at the chamber and see how well it vaporized see if we saw anything then left look at that look at that folks there is nothing the chamber is empty so that's back to what I was telling folks before is that with concentrates you don't need nowhere near the amount you would use even if you was to do flowering in the packs or even if he was to do your pin you would still not need a whole lot of concentrate for one session for one person now maybe two you might add a couple a little bit more but again it's really the key word is dead just a little tiny bit but concentrate will go a long way so a lot of people I think will go through the concentrates thinking they need to put a big bunch in there or maybe that'll make it last longer but really with its oil based in a lot of ways so oil burns for a while so you don't really need to overload your pass if you do you really is going to end up with a lot of extra in there and when you think it's going it's not gonna be gone and you know typically with the packs if you you burn it all the way dry you'll notice too won't me vapor come out of it but the most time I never really do that I mean usually there's a little tiny little residual left but when you dead when you get the right dose in there you will find that you were able to comfortably vaporize the entire dose and won't really be nothing left for you to clean out all your deal just really wipe the up and out and what I do is wipe like Hex's I take an alcohol wipe like this one here these are just the ones you get at Walmart or CVS and then I take it and I just go in here and I clean around my going around the inside of my oven and that gets any oils it may have spilled inside there out and I've also taken a little plate it comes off it's down in there out and that's most helpful now as far as cleaning the oven it's so all you have to do is a sticker you're - stick in there preferably while the oven is warm just take your cut your alcohol swab whatever they call alcohol pad sorry we're a wet alcohols q-tip will work as well but I feel like this works better because I could take my - deep and kind of you know roam around in there until I've got any a little bit of oil out of there and I have like basically I like to call a brand new oven and that just means that when I put something else different in the oven it has no other contact cross-contamination as far as flavors I want to make sure I'm tasting whatever I'm tasting you know something else you do because you can go on Amazon and buy you know extra ovens there knock off others that are not as nice as the ax oven itself and what I mean by that is they're just coming they slide out of here a lot easier and that's not great for me because when I'm cleaning my turn upside down sometimes and this will just fall out hot you can burn them in so they're only sixteen dollars for two it comes in a nice little case little metal case you get here you can put them in there and I made the extra hole for my other evidence like I have all three of my doses now I'm gonna have three different deaths three different flavors I can use this you know to put them in there so it comes in really handy so with that I'm gonna go

welcome back to a TC spot Here I am bringing you a half gram cartridge Himalaya life resin sauce cart yeah you heard it tonight resin sauce car gelato 33 recommended by my boy triple7 - looking for letting me know about this brand bro and anyways so yeah here we go this one doesn't contain no PG no EEG no MCT no artificial flavors no synthetics no synthetic turf beans so when I have food great stuff just all solid so I'm really looking forward to trying this my boy told me gelato 33 was the one to try they range from $30 to like 35 grams not bad for some knife resin sauce and yeah this one's a gelato 33 hybrid 84 percent total cannabinoids I believe the Teague's he's like yep 78 THC a two point five zero point three cc so yeah no pet no fillers we're gonna go in and slap it on the on this new friendly farms battery low temp to make sure we are tasting the full flavor of the terpene so you know here it is packaging is dope right off the back the Millea mission statement we started with single strand cannabis frozen fresh at the farm and carefully refine it to craft terpene rich full spectrum cannabis sauce look what the packaging is like so there's that little half gram it says cutter Mayberry that's understandable because my rink is out of service so I've been taking dad's we're named after the highest place on earth for a reason crafted with all the good stuff oh hi majesty see our full spectrum extracts higher than what we got it open well that's amazing that is amazing I've seen other life resin sauce parts they don't like this one this nice I won't say the brand but it's pretty dope with Malaya they got the little emblem on there nice color trying to get you guys to see a little bit of butter but it looks good for sure nice beautiful so now you know we're gonna go ahead and put it on the lowest setting there's your model 33 I'm really excited to try this is your average csail cart for your 510 battery take a turkey go dry eight okay I hate that artificial stuff so I'm glad they point that out these you know so enough yapping let's be a little nifty I haven't smoked for a good like three four hours or so let's check this out that was the first hand I'm where's the first hit I do have it at a very low temporary pasty that's for sure that's facts very tasty very very tasty it has a very pleasant gelato flavor doesn't seems like candy I love that the fact that it doesn't taste all artificial instead you know [ __ ] that [Music] so yeah this cart definitely tastes like some sauce I feel like if I'm hitting a puff coal or a rig on very low temp settings I can taste the gelato very good flavor no breath inhale very smooth I'm not sure what I caught I think that was just mean but very tasty pretty pretty pretty good head high pretty click that change sorry yep I can see the cloud because of the way the cameras position I'm getting some crazy clouds imma turn it up to the highest setting and we're gonna wrap it up real soon right it's getting up in here all crazy oh that's all bad there we go I said he was definitely stronger on that higher setting tastes like straight sauce I like it live resin solace cars check them out in Malaya good head high this is a hybrid gelato 33 doesn't taste like frickin candy straight taste like flour oh yeah for sure job can't see the cloud I like the fact that tastes like I'm Annie no [ __

Himalaya get yourself up there high in the mountains all right that's core beats to see spot thank you for watching peace", "dkVXBlWhJcQ": "what up YouTube issue boy dmt back here with another video today in this video I got my vape pen wax pen a battery my pen whatever you want to clothing use I call them pens on wax attendance that's just me that's what my channel is about my wax pen or my feet like I say babe oh yeah bust it out brass knuckles pin just pulled it off of the wall so it's fully charged and I want to bust out got the lighter because you never know all these cartridges sometimes they're a little too thick you got to heat it up just a little bit to get it to get into the wick now there's something about these cartridges that most people don't know and it's called priming the cartridge before you actually use it and I never really knew too much about that and so I saw someone do it before what I saw someone do it and I actually do my own version of this but I didn't even know that it was actually a thing like I didn't really know for sure what's up and he said priming so I'm gonna show you guys what's up with the priming how to prime your own wax pen and I'm using on let me actually do a close-up what I'm using today is a premium oil lemon of G not from any specific brand it's just I guess some people just make it for themselves which I actually wanted to do a video talking about that just have like a question or answer or just a rap video on the whole thing about packaging and how some of them aren't even actual companies it's just people who make the packaging so to be anyone using the packaging making their own cards so babe carts and just sign them as like that so the shop that I go to though they're very trusted so the people who make these for sure trusted like they were the people that of the shop wouldn't be accepting them and so it did get dissipated and didn't really meet standards of most cards that they have there and I'll do some future card videos of actual friends that you exist but so far right now we just have a lemon on G and it's a hybrid do a close up right now one gram but specifics are different lemon OG got the lady just looking down looking nice and blissful packaging is nice everything's they got the whole silicone rubber pieces lemon energy like I said premium oil flip it around has four watt max mmm don't really know too much detail about the watts I just know that the voltage that my pen has it goes up to four point eight so I guess what it means is for voltage maximum if you go any higher than that and I'll burn it but I believe that it's 3.6 3.6 you don't want to go any higher than that because any burns the cursus it doesn't actually [Music] California representing various bystanders 510 threading hybrid let's get back into the video and let's go ahead and test this bad boy out but you guys could know how I feel about it and maybe you guys can get a better idea on what you guys okay [Music] [Music] okay let's get into it [Music] battery is off lay do five legs one two three one by this is that it sir class now the trick is that you want to see the bubbles I'm just gonna do right here I'm pretty sure you guys so as you can see [Music] so there are no bubbles what's the letter [Music] I have to make a lot of bubbles come on what you do is as soon as you start closing the button-down you breathe in suck in blow out suckin blow out and then the third and sucking let go of the button and then sucking as much as you can and then blow up and you're gonna see a bunch of bubbles come up and then after that you're a probably wanted to suck in without you can pressing the button one more time like pretty hard I will demonstrate and after that you'll start seeing that levels are just showing up better priming techniques but so far that's what I use and after you do that you get fatter if you get super fat rips you're not really waiting on anything and if you start it off not frightening when they may just get that there you go now hold down [Music] [Music] probably the best part [Music] that's not hard [Music] you can try that process one more time if you don't see too many bubbles coming up just Paul did suck hard and then some hurt again usually it should be good I'm gonna go ahead and start over times to make sure he's good [Music] there is no more bubble chilling here there's actually one little baby one Miche butt [Music] hitter repeatedly and then soak your wish and you should be good to go [Music] [Music] [Music] I kind of want to see cuz 3.6 is when I actively affects the terpenes or whatever their strike I think that's what it is the turkey [Music] pretty fabric without burning the church too much you still get a good taste [Music] [Music] [Music] good [Music] [Music] but I would love to know if you guys [Music] this supported EMT but that's what that's it that's all I have for you guys today this your boy DNT back here with another

fall down [Music] butas up DGC scotty real and hanging out today have my buddy Damien from natty REM show up and man thanks showing up the bakery brother yeah no problem yeah actually thanks for showing up at the concentration celebration you know that was so much fun thanks for having us hey guys [ __ ] crushed it over there man has some beautiful contact UK cheesy all entered yeah that one's a great one it uh it tastes like a blueberry muffin and it's about like a like a 50/50 hybrid yeah it has us just [ __ ] is this man that's the banana couch livers and cartridge yeah this thing's fruity is all hell yeah that's why I invited him over I asked him he's got a fat has anything interesting going on and he says you got to taste the live resin cartridges and I've actually recently gotten into these I started buying a few different brands auditioning them but it's just Turkey as a [ __ ] and thank you so much as I'm surprising because I don't normally get super high off these and unfortunately I got super high before we're doing our interview so yeah let you know how it works but yeah delicious man the libraries and then that is a hundred percent pure uncut we don't put anything in it and we just keep it that way I'm gonna try to match like the turkey and profile as much as we can it didn't help me out with okay so the first cartridges that came out I completely dismissed them cuz I tasted on my taste propylene glycol I was at an event last night down in Denver and people were showing off their their new technology and I tasted a cart and it was just it tasted like bait juice it tasted like you know and I was just like dude I don't think you know I mean I don't want that [ __ ] yeah unfortunately like when when vape cartridges and pens are getting really popular if that's all you were tasting this PG and then people start cutting with dislike because of it cut similar right it was not as like harmful to your body as PG but now it's the point where we can have libraries and cartridges and then our next step personally is going to be a solvent cartridge as well all right interesting now now sama I hear these solvent lists newts all the time man that will only do solvent list and everything yeah I like them both I really do we do - honestly well most of our lives smokes butane or not butane but BHO and then a lot of us also smoke live rosin or don't let me hit this I'm gonna be I'll be too [ __ ] all right so what's it explain to me just because I'm trying to learn about cartridges I'm sure other people are what's the difference between the cheap cartridge at the dispensary in the AO and the $50 one it's all about quality there's a lot of companies that are more about quantity so that's the peak those are the guys that are cutting it would probably glycol and that kind of stuff yeah it's a lot easier it's a lot easier for your resin to get into that liquid form when you're cutting a PG or distillate so I could smoke it without it buttering or sugaring or crashing Lots inside the cartridge but we found a way where you don't have to mix it with any of that and you can just literally pour the live resin right into the pin and close it and give it to the customer a sick and that that's when these things have really evolved now I went to a concert recently just two nights ago and I'm normally used to having a bowl or a one-e-and and some container for flour or even if I have one of those pins you know if I got like a goby or something like that I got to go be I got the shatter that I'm loading it with I got something to get the wax off my fingers yeah these are [ __ ] easy and they're a little too easy but I just thought I was gonna hit one now I can easily smoke one of these cards she's just like sitting at home or right if it's the Durbin poison and writing like all the dishes in my entire house or love it you know all the tours so so this is just terpenes you get to like get to back to my education so when they when you distill or I'm sorry when you run something through a column you get what the I don't know how to like what they pick the Diamonds out of the terpenes and then they use the terpenes to make this sauce is that right or to make it live these parts with the with the live resin we're able to pack the column the shoot butane through the column right so what you get is the butane the cannabinoids and the terpenes and then you pull that butane out of the terpenes that cannabinoid right so then that's what we put into the pin so you're getting everything that you would get if you sucked like the diamonds and drank the sugar if you salt the butter anything like that but it's all in a cartridge now Varian just okay I love it I'm starting to get an understanding here so you said pull the butane out what's that wood residual butane and all that stuff is that something you got to worry about it's nothing that we have to worry about too much we've been in the game for a while over a century now and so we have over a century over a century and we're there for a hundred years no not centuries I told you these things it was him and Henry Ford it's our decade yeah no we actually have been in the company for a decade now and what we've been doing is like fine-tuning that tech so now we don't have any of those issues that's cool I mean it doesn't taste like anything but but turps honestly thank you yeah it's actually we try to match the exact terpene profile that you would get with the actual cannabis plant interest like a banana cush there's the Michelle gross banana that's what the banana cush is actually tasting like 1980s that's when the plant was produced and so that's why they named it banana cush because it was that banana that was hard to find at that time and when you say matched herpes I don't understand what that means um so when you smoke the plant or when you smoke the bud and it's like even from like the from the original breeder you're still gonna get around the same terpene profile sure and so what you smell in that grow is what we're trying to capture and keep inside that cartridge is what it's like a recipe um it's not a recipe it's like a it's like a natural recipe that the plant produces okay so you thought we're trying to keep it the entire time while preserving the terpene profile I'm not adding terpenes no just now I get it don't add anything yeah excellent makes sense man so we were talking about the big word the buzzword in our industry is vertical integration are you vertically integrated men and all that means is that do you have everything from your own grow to your own processing facility I guess sometimes it means your own dispensary right yes we're completely vertically integrated we do have outside processing on the side because you've good adding yeah so what doubt side processing means some growers ask you to process their [ __ ] yeah so we have a lot of companies similar to like it cut above where they will give us our fresh frozen and we will process that fresh frozen for them right and send it back to them so they could sell out their store but at the same time we also process our own in-house and that's about 95 to 90 percent of our in-house or all of our processing is in-house and so with that in-house then we sell all that wholesale throughout Colorado God so if I wanted a natty Rams cart I should ask for him by name though if you want an atom's car I suggest following us on Instagram you can sign up for a newsletter where we drop every week where we drop all the cartridges that's enough for a newsletter to get one of these made come on you got a store fine or something we also have a sore point deal that makes all right so as far as managing a grow as far as managing quality control I'll be I want to tell you a story that I got some edibles I've been getting into and actually going back to the dispensary recently got me some carts and got me some edibles and I tried this I said what's the most bang for the buck for edibles like 2000 milligrams in this tincture well I tried and it's bunk you know I mean just had nothing going on it and I'd [ __ ] drink half the bottle there's actually frightened for the first hour thinking it was gonna kick in I never did yeah it's all about quality control but I mean so and actually I went back to the dispensary who's my local dispenser really cool folks and I was like hey I want to show you guys this stuff seems like it's bunk no you can't even bring that in the store holy cow I can't give you a refund and it was like you realized what a yellow hour our hands are tied on doing business you know even the advertising credit card processing it's so difficult in business you know definitely well even as far as quality control how do you guys handle that well from grow all the way to selling and processing and getting it out the door there's always quality control so we start from the clone as it's growing there's always people checking it right and sure all the plants look good then as it's getting harvested and getting frozen there's another quality check and then as it's getting processed and then as it's getting created and then that's getting packaged in years out the door there's always the quality control check it's just even kind of corporate here man do you got white lab coats and stuff no it's not it's not very coke right it's more just the whole team cares like we all look at it we're always inspecting it even if we're not told to so you're hoping that we're just like naturally looking at smelling it making sure it's like the actual thing and it's not that we have that issue but there's so many different strains and there's there's always like different phenotype we'll checking making sure it's like everything that we want man I'm thinking I have a bamboo nursery a 20-acre bamboo nursery down in Florida can we do like 20 different varieties like I'm 20 different strains and I just think about the quality control that we have and what it really comes down to is if we lose a thousand plants that's a thousand plants you have to fungus or something that's a thousand plants that those guys work their ass off on it's also a matter of pride they're actually producing something so there's a you know it's just a inclination a pride to actually produce something amazing yeah we try to keep that tegrity and we tried to did you say tegrity yeah I love it a farm no but there's a we always try to keep that Tiger tea and we always try to make sure we give the love that each plant deserves just as if it was one of six plants in a basement so I guess it is but as you expand it's like you have to make sure that you are that efficient precise and so then you can slowly grow with the rest of the company yeah yeah you say slowly grow as the rest of the company yeah I know a bit gonna dunk your time I know about growing but I'm always interested in what's going on with this industry as far as what's going on like I don't know as far as I see Oklahoma blowing up now there's all the Michigan blowing up I'm a little bit confused about the state of the industry nobody gets to do interstate commerce anymore or ever I should say what do you guys think about that where do you see the industry in five years so they gotta open that up and I kind of national legalization what do you think I think it's gonna take around like three to five or even more years just for like that to switch over and basically because of the tax code that's with federal government right now is that way you know the more I think about it and the more I study it the more it just has to do with money or how they collect the money you think it'll take that long they're pretty good at figuring out how to collect money I don't know it's like since the beginning they always had a way for them to collect money even if we thought that all of our money was going to the public and it was going to for Denver is going to the homeless look even if we think all the money is going towards that they're still making good amount of money she's messed up in the in the system or in the industry then you get a fee and that fee is like out the door grabber aegis yeah yeah I've heard stuff goes yeah I've heard stories so a bedroll legalization who still stinks five years away four or five years away um I mean we're not holding our breath for right now right um it would be great if it did happen you all were looking forward to it yeah most companies I talk to her like hey and I'm doing just fine in this in this niche I just had a lot of money to get here yeah I'm not looking forward to competing what sold out what do you think about competing with I'm pretty confident that we can compete with them as we're growing we're getting more excited and our coffins is getting like bigger and bigger and it's been more than 10 years and we have just been sitting back and like making sure everything is exactly the way that we want it right we're out trying to jump a gun too quickly and in the next six months or so it's gonna start building a little bit bigger and then after that then I would in about two three years we plan to be in multiple states so yeah that's all it takes that long to [ __ ] expand huh yeah I mean I guess you got to get a grow set you got to get a location you gotta get like successor is that what the big the big hang-up is licenses yes they give you a license you can [ __ ] hit the ground running yeah it's just one of the first tube so you have to jump through just a interesting man so a dude if so if you could change anything if you were in charge of cannabis policy man any ideas man could you fix this get any big ideas if there was one big change I would try to have like all the companies in the cannabis industry try to work together cuz right now it's a lot of competition right and if we all actually work together and talk together then I think it would be easier for all the companies individually and how do you do that one it's such a hard product of just English you got such an that's hard it is tough I mean we try to set up as many meetings as we can with different companies and try to collaborate with them and like become like one solid team the beer companies do it though yeah the beer companies aren't all at each other's throat you go to a tap room and there's 25 different taps from 10 different you know 15 different breweries so here we're figuring away everybody's got to have their niche these are interesting it's y'all's niche yeah uh yeah I think I like it yeah yeah he's a nice easy chair everybody like said there's not even a button on it it's just one pole it's easy to get in man it's easy to get into a show or something like that anywhere you want let's go for concerts and events yeah obviously as a as a professional company because it's just that like you bring into a concert or anything like that but like it's the perfect thing all right I gotta ask man everybody's always even dreaming in prohibition land if I could just go to Colorado or California Michigan and work at a cannabis company man that'd be amazing that'd be living my dream almost like like winning a lottery don't yell don't uh don't wish for things that you don't understand yeah so is that something that if if I went to a cannabis company do I get to just smoke all day do I get to dab all day is it [ __ ] yeah no tell me about it first and then dabs later okay um we we always go in like early in the morning hit the ground running um just so we can get as much work as we can right into the end of the day and then after that you can relax and you can like with that we usually hang out with each other after work sure um but yeah we can hang out we could smoke and all that kind of stuff but yeah when it comes to work it's very straightforward we get stuff done he makes sense she just fired up what time you guys fired up in the morn then I got enough I was talking to because I was talking to an extract artist yesterday just ten hour shifts [ __ ] yeah our shifts on the rig this for personally for me I think I wake up around like 3:30 4 o'clock in the morning such as that and then guys are dedicated oh yeah yeah I start checking my email probably like around like 5:30 all right get into the grow around like 6:00 6:30 and then I'm there and sometimes until like 7 8 o'clock at night Jesus Christ man what happened out yeah geez how do you keep motivated like that it's insane well just like honestly it's great working in like our facility because everybody is like integrated so there's wrong in the lab and everybody works together around the same place so like if you look over and you see like a seven-foot plant I just got chopped down that goes by the harvest sure then like obviously like that's gonna get you hyped up because right oh man that's going straight to fresh frozen we're just gonna concentrate which might go on are these pens so is it ironic but you have to go into the bathroom and sneak some cokes to the pen then no just [ __ ] yeah kind of like the office with how many cameras are set up at the Grove for like yeah yeah oh it's actually some place so actually somebody put a meme up that was like you know back I deal 10 years ago I was hiding in the woods to try to smoke a you know a bowl with my friends yeah and now it's like you know 2019 it's like should I hit this pen and target yeah I love it the Internet is just probably like I'd say like the Internet is thriving just as much as the cannabis industry is right now share this from the tools we get are absolutely amazing you know like that you know being able to use Instagram being able yeah was that a kind of professionals association I don't know how they that man knows a bunch of cannabis professionals and I didn't have any business cards so just like nah just follow our instagram oops I need to do what's your Instagram I'll catch you there yeah mine's actually digital about sushi that's my personal llama but then I also run the natty rooms underscore Colorado beautiful Instagram page beautiful man beautiful so it's [ __ ] cool Manfred enjoy hanging out thank you though thanks for having me I got the chief on one of your pens all in Oriya delicious man I'm gonna go find one of these brother you can have that one deal I'm gonna go find another conclusion it'll find that part now I'm gonna go find another good hanging out thank you for having me so much goes for a rat natty rims yeah [Music] little break [Music] [Music] it says to do [Music] true medicine [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music]", "aEaoDC2EwM0": "it what's up guys it's your boy master blinky back again with another video today what we're gonna be taking a look at is this live East Coast cartridge cart I haven't really seen these around before I recently got one and I've been really excited to try it for you guys it says that it has one point four percent CBD eighty-two percent THC and six percent Terps I like that it has the stats like that and they actually seem believable real cards shouldn't really test above 85 percent if they have Terps in them um and having some CBD in there is cool too apparently it's supposed to give you forea um and give you an energized mood and it's a sativa hybrid so yeah let's go ahead and get into this card so opening up the cart we pull it out and we see that it is AC cell atomizer with a white ring on the bottom a lot of people says that that means that it's a fake atomizer but I also want to think that maybe it's because live rebranded at C cell atomizer they also put their logo on top of the mouthpiece which actually looks pretty legit not gonna lie so I'm hoping this car actually hits pretty nicely and tastes good as you can see the bubble is actually pretty slow it doesn't move too fast at all so I'm definitely definitely having some high hopes for this cart so let's go ahead and get into my first puffs of it alright y'all so I'm gonna take my first puff off this live mimosa cart I'm using my C cell m3 battery because that's the pretty standard battery that most car companies will sell with cards so either way let's actually check this card out Cheers [Music] okay feels very smooth cheers again [Music] when it comes to the potency of this cart I am already feeling effects I'm already seeing the flash very weird it looks like a star in my vision taking that blinker straight looks a bit rough on my lungs Matt go lie well I'm sorry I feel very warm as well I think I'm gonna be a fan of these cards oh of course I can't give my full opinion yet I always want to wait at least a day to tell you guys if these carts are good but before I go for right now I'm going to be taking a hit out of the damn cap so Cheers [Music] but I tell you that this part feels a little different um it's slapping a bit more than I'm used to not gonna lie like I'm for sure gonna take a night to review these and then tomorrow I'll tell you guys that these are actually yes but as of right now I'm like a hugger home it is just [ __ ] awesome all right yeah I'll be back tomorrow B's all right hey guys again I forgot to record a hit from the CBD [ __ ] battery so I'm gonna do that real quick I already preheated all we got to do is hit it Cheers this card produces such thick smoke oh my god bro also what you hear in the background is me about to record another gaming video in case y'all are kid get hip to my gaming videos they're actually kind of funny like what the [ __ ] are you doing also subscribe to the channel if you're not subscribed and leave a like I'm really high right now I love this cookie I'll get back to y'all tomorrow see it alright hey what's up guys I'm back so I've been smoking on this car for two days now and I think I'm actually a fan of it so after two days I've only used around 1/4 of my cart which is really good on those TKO cards I two days I was around halfway done this I definitely still have a good amount of uses out of as far as the highs go I don't think I could honestly get over 10 hits of this thing without having like take a break for a bit because I was just too tired or too high when I say too tired I don't mean like this car put me to sleep or gave me a headache or anything like that it's just after 10 hits I was like way too far gone to even know how to like actually function it was pretty awesome not gonna lie another thing about this card it's starting to get a little cloudy which doesn't worry me a little bit but I tried to do some research on it and I've been seeing that some extractions or like some people who extract their own oils end up with levy oil - and I don't know if that's something to do with the plant that they start out with but it has something to do with the extraction process but either way I'm not tasting anything odd that the current hasn't become harsh and it hasn't become less potent that's something that I do notice with other card brands that I've tried at least like dab was TKO sometimes even dank vapes sometimes after you get around half to two-thirds of the cart done they start to hit a lot harsher and then they sometimes change color actually with that with the dr. zodiacs bait card I reviewed the bottom of the cart started to turn a little black from where the atomizer was so those are signs that I look forward to seat bag carts versus this one which actually does feel like a quality and good kart I massage with it a little bit just to see if like maybe the wax is getting a little cloudy because of it just sitting so maybe after heat it up a bit it'll be fine so I'm gonna take around three puffs on it and then I'll do a wrap-up Cheers [Music] [Music] just a little - coughs from that but very nice vapor and very good flavor on it I forget what I said it tasted like last time I'm gonna take another hit right now just to see you again but it definitely does still have a very consistent flavor cheers again [Music] I really can't get an actual like opinion on how this car tastes it's so odd because I really can't like pinpoint the exact flavors of this cart I know that it had a around 6% turps in it so that's probably why I'm not getting like super strong flavors versus like other cart brands where they actually use like flavoring or they use a lot of Terps and that's why they're very runny this car isn't runny at all it's actually very slow-moving and it feels like it is I really think that's why I'm not really getting super strong consistent or super strong indescribable flavor simply because distillate doesn't have flavor um I'm gonna go ahead and hit it out of a rig though and see if that helps Cheers [Music] [Music] all right so we got a good amount of calls from that hit but I'm not gonna lie I don't know if y'all have ever smelled play-doh like if you had a little cousin who like played with it around you or you have like siblings but this cart tastes house this cart tastes just like how play-doh smells um I don't know how y'all will take that I think it doesn't actually taste that bad I'm not gonna lie but I've also never eaten play-doh so if anyone in the comments has tried play-doh go and let me know if it tastes good either way if I had to give this Curtis or I would give it an easy eight out of ten the wax did end up getting less cloudy once they eat it up a bit so I think that that's not really a sign that I'm gonna be worried about if I should be let me know though but yeah this card gets an 8 out of 10 potency easily a 9 to attend this cart is amazing I don't need to hit it a lot to get high it lasts a while um and the wax feels quality when it comes to taste I'll give it a 7 to an 8 out of 10 because I cannot really exactly describe the way it tastes other than how play-dohs smells or however I described it in my first it's a bit the atomizer is a real C cell so it tastes good it hits hard and you get good hits out of it versus seven tens which I don't think hit as hard overall I have never heard of live East Coast cartridges before getting this one but after getting this one I would put these above tank vapes or even kingpins king pens in my opinion are a bit overrated this is what a cart should actually feel like if you're buying it especially off the black market this is amazing so yeah 9 out of 10 this cart is great it's consistent and I would definitely suggest it to y'all if you see them around you um good job live East Coast cartridges so I'm in the video with two blinkers from the CBD 5 battery if you guys enjoyed the video please leave a like and subscribe check all the links in the description if you like this battery which I would highly suggest as well check the affiliate link in the description below it helps out the channel I'll put either way I'm master bling see it's been a pleasure I hope that if you guys can see these hurts and you try them out you have good experiences with them let me know but uh either way Cheers [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "nkLla_V-vmA": "[Music] what's up I simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title already we got that buddies let's just do a quick little thumbnail hopefully it's good I know you guys have been requesting for me to try the buddies cartridge for a while now and I finally located one in my local dispensary I actually picked this up at a dispensary that I've never been to before well that's a lie because it's a franchise there's actually another one that I've been to with the same name but I haven't been to the newer store which is located on McHenry and yeah I mean it's called people's remedy as you can see right here you see the little QR code all that stuff and I bought this for 43 bucks originally priced at 37 but you know tax and all that stuff so $43 for our gram cartridge not too bad but yeah I'm excited the image up here it kind of looks like the Select cartridge the same cartridge so yeah should be pretty interesting it says seventy-three point zero six percent THC and as you know buddies they like to show their terpene profile as well which is so dope I feel like a lot more companies should do this because terpenes have individual effects and it's good to know what's in what you're smoking like there's probably other stuff that they can mention on the label that's in there that that companies don't even so or maybe they don't even have terpenes in them you know so as you can see it says a pioneer four point six one beam murder scene four point four eight and then beep I mean one point something and this is the string and lucid blue guys buddies and it is a sativa so it should get me getting me to wake up you know I'm saying so we're gonna open this is I'm gonna take good care of the box so never [ __ ] it ripped off the stick little lever to pull out okay Wow okay even has the buddies logo in there noise yep same type as select [Music] very very thick this is liquid diamond sauce liquid diamonds live resin boys so not the best smell like this citrus we're gonna be using my chill battery for this one very very good battery it's a good truck alright buddy Cheers it's a it's dark it's what what ten what you tend to see when you get a live resin in your cartridges other than raw garden I don't know how they get there so light but you know if it's their secret they're gonna keep it to the grave with them but as you notice just like the Ursa this one's very very dark just like that not as dark as the Ursa so I'm interested to see how this is gonna taste so Cheers [Music] Wow not gonna lie that did taste pretty [ __ ] amazing things I've noticed not as Turkey it could be the strain it's not as chirpy as the strain that or is it used but it's not as chirpy but still really really good and for $10 cheaper you really can't complain about that it's just minuscule you know it's still um when I'm saying it's Lester P that means like just a little bit you know I'm saying I'm not saying that it's like one level down or anything but this is pretty [ __ ] good I'm not gonna lie you know I bought this myself so this is not in a way like a paid review or anything I bought the Ursa one as well and Wow if I had to choose which one to get no I can't take another hit oh the cloud production is there ooh the taste is there ooh the potency is there holy [ __ ] that [ __ ] really hits so just like the Select cartridges it just hits just like that it hits just as hard as the select cartridges I would say it's a lot better in taste than the Select cartridges because the select cartridges all taste the same to me this one although I haven't tried other strains I'm sure they taste according to string and not just some generic co2 distillate tasting oil but and I'm liking it I'm gonna take one more hit for you guys and yeah this I'm probably gonna enjoy this behind-the-scenes you know I am Cheers maybe I'll do a blinker for you [ __ ] it I don't know how with this shirt off time for this is but [ __ ] it I feel like this buddy's cartridge hits harder than the earth cartridge but the Ursa one tastes a lot better and I feel like they just switch those two around it's like vice versa you know this one the taste is a little bit less but the clouds are a little bit more what the Ursa it's the clouds are a little bit less but the taste is a lot more there but overall pretty good you know this is only ten dollars cheaper than the Ursa cartridge which is pretty [ __ ] good in my opinion yeah I don't know I think I got to do like another top five cartridges of two or just top a top five cartridge list you know I really like I'm sorry like I haven't been getting too much cartridges lately it's just that most of them are a pretty pricey and I have a wax pen and usually just a grandma wax just will last longer to me than me having this at my disposal cuz I'm gonna just be [ __ ] hitting the [ __ ] out of it you know like if it's there it's there you know it just makes me want to hit it hopefully you guys enjoyed this video would I get another buddy's cartridge yeah definitely like I have nothing but good things to say about this other than maybe like the Select cartridge being like a plastic mouthpiece you know maybe a ceramic one would be better maybe I'm just spoiled from the earth one who knows you know but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video peace out [Music]", "DGgLALjkyLs": "hey what's good everybody jay ping here checking in respect my region.com here today with a quick west coast week 2 review featuring alpine vapor and their gmo times bp9 hybrid live resin cannabis oil it's a vape cartridge it's a one gram 1000 milligram vape cartridge and my oh my i'm excited to try this i vape live resin every day i dab live resin about every other day and this is a limited edition run um from from alpine one of california's premier cannabis uh extraction companies and so i'm going to read a little bit about the packaging and kind of share some information i've got a battery here um we're going to dive right in so it says here our limited edition cartridges are craft candidates at its finest they're made using only pure live resin from sun grown cannabis these small batch releases are true to the natural aroma of the plant and are an exploration and taste outside the norm instructions you our cartridges are designed for use with 510 batteries inhale for two to four seconds for maximum flavor use at the lowest voltage setting on your alpine bakery now unfortunately on a previous review video i did use the battery at the lowest setting and it wasn't powerful enough to really really give the car what i would consider as the best representation of itself so i'm going to honestly move it up one twist on the voltage here for the battery so that way i can get slightly slightly warmer than the lowest temperature to make this really rip in terms of the gmo times the bp9 i do have a little bit of information it says gmo times banana punch number nine a true hybrid cut with cannabis cup lineage of purple punch banana og and gmo so this is going to be punchy og and gmo it says this cultivator yeah this cultivator is a great blend of sweet and sour with undertones of gas tropical fruit and curried spice that's a big claim so we're gonna see if i get that earthy spicy punchiness here we go how do i wanna i don't really wanna i don't really want to open it up from the top and ruin that beautiful stickers oh came right out there we go check it out all right so we've got we've got some terps in the jar here and the two i like it when it comes to the cartridge we've got a white ceramic and glass cart i love it we've got some nice chunky holes on the bottom right here that's where that pull is going to come through and be kind of sucking in the oil for lack of a better way to put it 510 thread brand new battery here literally brand new not even using the one that i used the other day this one is quite literally unopened all right beautiful packaging nice chunky battery here all right so one two three four five hits to turn it on branded it's on the lowest setting now i'll rip it just to show them that i just don't believe this battery is the right one at the lowest setting for this cartridge so i'm gonna do it it's not on too tight but it is sealed here we go chris you ready moment of truth absolutely nothing yet one two three four five try it again all right that's a five second rip right there kind of light in terms of the vapor and the flavor although it was there i didn't actually get enough of an inhale to really taste that much terps and so i'm going to go a seven second rip again on the lowest temperature try to give it another chance at 2.6 volts here we go all right so on that one a little bit more turks a little bit bigger cloud and what i'm really tasting is this light floral spice i'm getting a little bit of pine and a little bit of berry flavor the fact that i can get some actual good flavor on this lowest setting without a major cloud i think it's impressive um i am going to twist this over to let's call it one line two lines we're gonna go up to three volts here and we're going to see what that does maybe it maybe it burns it maybe it doesn't here we go it's definitely a different flavor and taste experience in terms of how it ends up in your mouth i feel like at a slightly higher temperature it gets a little bit more on the earthy spicy side comparatively to the light and floral so we've done three hits here i talked about that on the first hit you i gave it a second chance with the seven second uh blinker right there and then on this last one we turn it up to three volts three hits let's see what i'm thinking here for a score out of ten presentation appeal color taste potency i think this is really coming through and hitting nice um what i what i'd really like to see is some of the genetics information that's on you know the piece of paper need to make it on this i want to see the terpene profile i want to see some of that strain lineage and information it helps the consumer know what kind of high we're about to experience um in this box the presentation is very attractive i like i like the sticker i like the label i like the black and the shiny metallic i'm really attracted to this the color of the oil looks great um is this the best battery for this cartridge i don't believe so um the big my least favorite thing is the battery it doesn't match i don't think it powers this vape cartridge the right way um i've had better experiences with c cells classic just draw and pull on it um and so all things considered um would i recommend it yes more information there's solid information on here i'd like to know more about the genetics and the lineage and the terps um but with all that said i'm sitting here thinking this is an 8.75 it's a very solid high score i definitely believe that this is 100 sun grown flower cannabis you know pure live resin there's no distillate there's no popcorny experience to this no taste no that kind of flavor um but yeah the battery in my opinion is just really holding this experience back and so um we'll use this we'll use this battery again for the next review and i'm going to bring another battery on again to see if i get a better or different experience but for now let me know what you guys think 8.75 is my score big thank you to alpine vapor for working with this on the respect my region west coast we tour and don't forget to subscribe to our youtube channel y'all i'll see you all down the road appreciate you guys peace", "HPeCUvEf2XA": "I have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually I've been smoking on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up its up everybody youtubes and really busting my balls about their Community Guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks oh yeah what is going on everybody and welcome back to another episode of free [ __ ] / I've been asked this question like a million times over the past couple days because of my most recent video so knock him out both in one episode you know what I mean before we get to that this video is sponsored by my goddamn self so a lot of you guys have been asking for merch specifically merch that doesn't say hey I'm a [ __ ] pothead on it because I understand that right you guys are like yo man I'd like to merch I want to support you but I don't want a pot leaf on my back and I respect that so just for you people I've dropped a piece drip tea it's pretty much the peace tea that we did before it says peace right here on the breast and then a peace sign on the back but it's like dripping it's like liquidy it looks really cool it's probably only gonna be available for two weeks let's make it two weeks so if you guys want to check that out link is in the description make sure to check it out by yourself one two weeks very limited they're [ __ ] awesome doesn't really scream that you smoke weed and yeah pretty cool so ever since I released that video a couple days ago which by the way he's doing very well the most common question that I get asked is Erik if you're not smoking these boo fast carts then what are your favorite cartridges if you know anything about the channel you know that these have been pretty much my go-to for the past couple weeks couple months I don't even know how long but it's usually the Moonrock carts which this one's empty and thus tizzy I found that these two right here are kind of the cleanest high and they give you the best high for sure like one or two hits out of these I'm not gonna lie that I've tried plenty of carts have tried kingpins brass knuckles like legitimate kingpins legitimate brass knuckles and there's a whole bunch of different brands out there for the most part it takes you like what two three hits and then you're like all right now I'm feeling good but with either of these with one solid not even a blinker with one solid hit like five six seconds I'm feeling it and that's that's kind of tough to do with a pen for me right cuz you tolerance just goes higher and higher and higher after every time I'm not sure how much is left in here it's a strawberry Nana car it's pretty much done tastes very good no best thing about cz see like a not a lot of pins make me cough bro I'm not gonna lie after a hit like that but the thing about susie that doesn't make you my daily driver is one it's only available in california and to its proprietary little battery so if this dies i don't have any other device but i have like a million 510 thread battery so that's mainly why this is nice don't get me wrong and they recently remodeled other package its new packaging it's higher THC percentages and there's no pesticides so sissies your thing then go ahead and check it out man but because of those two things it really just i don't really hit it every day you know i mean i don't get the opportunity to smoke bcz every single day however alright the game has changed man dr. zodiac who usually makes the moon rock cartridges said [ __ ] that i want to branch into other things [ __ ] the moon rocks and we got ourselves i'm not sure he's coming out with anymore but we have ourselves six different cartridges six different flavors six different strains from dr. zodiac himself the maker of the moon rocks and they hit the same bro and it takes a lot for me to say that about a cartridge bro there's not many cards out there that hit like a moon rock car but from the [ __ ] himself obviously it's gonna be pretty dope man have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually i've been smokin on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up i actually gave Kyle one of them which is why one of them is missing so it gives me an opportunity to open it up so packaging is on point first of all you have some crazy I there's so much going on right here there's like a lion's a spaceship in the background there's like a little spiral galaxy right there like this is tight I've got to open it up and inside you'll see a battery a charger and your one gram cartridge I think they also sell them in half grams yeah yeah I've never seen him in half grams but there's a little spot right there for a half gram so I imagine that they do now the [ __ ] cartridges a low charger and we have ourselves right here what is this one the Lion Heart clear so a lot of these don't have the strain actually on them I'm not exactly Lionheart distrain I've never heard of it but the other ones I'll go through and tell you what I think this train is but I guess that's part of the fun man little guessing game so very first hit off of this cart by the way as you can see right here we got a little bubble right there and as you guys know I said in my last video I said hey the bubble moves it's bunk so let's go ahead and see if that bubble is moving I'm not even seeing it but I know the bubbles not moving beautiful beautiful man let's go ahead and just give this a nice low trip blinker yeah we'll get a nice rip and then we'll give it a blinker [Music] goddamn bro [Music] [Music] I couldn't even blink it man okay mm-hmm so I'm not gonna lie Lionheart was my least favorite which is why I gave it to Kai but after that hit man I don't know I might have to reconsider lion-hearted clear very fire next one up I think we're going to go through for my favorite to least favorite right now just as we got that one out of the way my very very favorite out of the six new ones that he has is called this Linwood lemonade clear this pen right here straight up tastes like I'm taking a [ __ ] dab bro it's ridiculous like it tastes so much like lemon like I have lemon gene aemon's right now and I think it kind of reminds me of that but every time I rip this it's flavor town and it's high town baby [Music] that's not saying that's insane man I can literally rip these off a pro I mean that would probably be really bad my tolerance but dude god damn I'm eyes and look [ __ ] all right yeah Lin would absolutely fired next up we have a Bobby blues clear which I believe is Blue Dream or something of the sort tastes very much like Blue Dream and it is the second most delicious one oh yeah that's blue dream for sure next up we have the silverback clear which i think is the best look and artwork in my opinion it's my third favorite and this is guerrilla glue like I said these are just assumptions I could be completely flow going wrong about all these but this is this is generally what I'm tasting what I'm getting the effects that I'm getting from these pants man every single pen also has the little logo or the little artwork on it instead of the little doctor zodiac bunny but we do have the bunny right there and we got the bunny right there as well mad goddamn I love these bro I don't know there's just a look about these you know I mean like every single cart looks the [ __ ] same man and at a certain point like when you're getting really high off all the cards still you look for a little something extra right you look for a little pizzazz you look for a little like all the cards are the same I need something that stands out oh wow all right that second hit was a little different hang on that might bump up man I don't know that might bump up to number two right there goddamn that silver bag is why you're next up this could actually this is up there man I'm not gonna lie next up we have the razzle dazzle clear there's a little berry hitting a cartridge right there which is very clean this color is nice I don't know there's something cool about all these like it's one thing to color one things the flavor when things like the plugins and say you should make it I don't know man one's a real bright pink with all the colors on it I think this one really reminds me of an actual moon rock cardiguez which is like a berry flavored moon rock art tastes very similar to that it honestly tastes like a DAB like I don't know man like not a lot of dab cards sometimes dab cards will just be Tudor P if that makes any sense like oh dude this doesn't even taste like weed this just tastes like like a [ __ ] candy cart or something you know what I mean and I don't really [ __ ] with that but these have like it taste like wheat like you know you're getting that wheat I don't know if all of you are under that there's probably gonna be some people that bro I just smoked with a flavor like alright these cards aren't for you then I'm not gonna lie these cards are for getting extremely [ __ ] medicated and a hint of flavor that's like enjoyable but not too much I don't know but it's some good stuff now this last one here is called Frosty's snowcone again don't necessarily know if that's strain or not um but this little it's a little Frosty the Snowman guys looking evil on here what is he I like that a little logo man it's looking [ __ ] cool there's color by the way purple is probably my favorite color like probably a lighter shade of purple is my favorite color but this is solid right here Wow okay wait I feel like I'm cleansing my palette between each of these hits it's kind of a long time and usually on the streams I'm just like so I'm getting a decent amount of time to actually taste these do why is it so [ __ ] hard to rank these bro that's unnecessary like these are all fire five had however much these retail for like fifty sixty seventy bucks I don't know how much I I wouldn't pick one [ __ ] wait hang on if I had people are gonna ask me but they're like dude I only have enough money for one which one should I buy hey I think I'm buying the lemonade yeah that's a no-brainer I think the lemonade ones like no-brainer no-brainer kind of number one there and then number two bro it's like but just pick your poison yeah I mean goddamn everyone's probably gonna ask for this part no we're okay there you go durability tests on the spot [ __ ] beautiful everyone's gonna ask for it Oh first of all we need to get this thumbnail hang on let's get a bang and ask them no going right now oh not today son not [ __ ] today try to do this on stream and it was rather difficult so we're gonna see what's good right here it's just a little difficult because like it's hard to create a seal around so when you're inhaling you're just getting a lot of air all right so if you're not in a state where you can get dr. zodiacs and Moonrock cartridges and you're like damn I still want to have a little so wanna have a little swagger so we'll have a little what are your favorite batteries Eric I can get my own cartridges what do you like to smoke the actual cars use em so great great move question bro I actually have a little something right here it's like a part to a cliche bro personally I like batteries that don't have a button I don't know what it is but like yeah it's an added luxury that you can change the temperature but give a foot most of the time like I just want to hit it take out of my pocket inhale put it in and then we're good you know I mean I have to like click five times turn on and then like one two three and like change the temp and then like all right you know I mean it's just like those added seconds it seems like some [ __ ] but it kind of matters I mentioned this battery and all of these batteries made by Batman on a video before they're on the one gram in one sitting video but their website only sells wholesale they only sell like two dispensaries and stuff you know what it means so you couldn't buy it individually however I've helped you out don't even worry about it we have found an online head shop that was willing to work with us they even gave us a discount code so head up J vape industries it'll be in the description down below and you can use code Eric 10 for 10 percent off I have this battery and all of the magic Bab ballad batteries they're [ __ ] late all right I got you guys don't worry I got you guys take the lemon one of course slide in there and they both have this magnet [ __ ] that's like I don't know why that's so sexy like I don't know why I meant these are both the same color - damn in here I like this little midnight look look that's not coming out man you got a oh you know what I mean like that's [ __ ] tight you don't getting the only gripe on the see cell palm that I like the VAM on better is obviously this one's smaller this one that's a light so you know when you're heating it you know what I mean this one oh there is a light on this one never mind [ __ ] I don't know man look bad the stick one might hit a little harder than this I'd say if you're buying a dr. zodiac pen and you got the battery with it there's no need to upgrade but if you in need of a new battery these are the movement especially if you don't have a proper battery and you have one of those stick low eight dollar ones at the local smoke shop get rid of that [ __ ] it's gonna die in like a month month and a half get either one of these batteries men Eric 10 for 10% off by the merch first but like a if you want to check these out too if you need a battery a go ahead and check them out man I hope you all enjoyed hope you all learn something this wasn't a drugs 101 I don't know why I said that but like I don't learn something about batteries or card in my favorites hey you know what I mean let's get let's get a solid little double hit here going both batteries actually get something cool willing you know yeah when you have three you can actually like hit it properly you know what I mean I'm like yeah look at this cloud that I made my opponent it's just like alright you won't turn it so I have to do it like this I got to hold it that's gonna be the video guys I hope you all enjoyed make sure to check out all the links in the description make sure to share the social media do all that [ __ ] like the video comment a subscribe do all that [ __ ] I'll see you in the next video we're just gonna be on I'll see you in the next video which is gonna be on Wednesday maybe even sooner [Music]", "Q5xorweaNTU": "So you want to add terpenes to your THC\nproduct. Well how much terpenes do you use? That's called the dilution ratio. My name is Drew, owner of MrExtractor.com, and\nI'm here today to tell you the truth about what dilution ratio you should be\nusing in this week's episode: \"Terpene Dilution Ratios\" from The Terpene\nInstitute. So you want to start mixing terpenes in your product, and you don't\nknow how much to use, and your products are expensive, and you don't want to mess\nit up. I totally got that, all right. So what I'm gonna do, is there's a whole\nbunch of different products that you can mix terpenes with, and I want to do a\nvideo on every single one. I'm gonna give you a tutorial, whether you already make\nproducts, or you're just thinking about it, on how to make every single different\nproduct with our terpenes. But the fact is, I just don't have time right now. So\nI'm gonna give you a basic understanding on how much you should use with all\ndifferent products. And I'll skim through it, and hopefully this gets you going, and\nlater you can watch a full tutorial on each individual product. I'll just give\nyou a walk down on how to make it. Make it, sell it, knock yourself out, alright? So\none of the main things that people are doing right now is they're taking our\nterpenes and they're mixing them with distillate and they're making a vapor\npen. So how much do you want to use? Now, always, every batch of distillate is\ngonna be different. And all terpenes are a little bit different, but they're all\npretty much the same. So I tell everybody; no matter how professional you are, no\nmatter how big you are, no matter how small you are, you always want to do a\nsmall batch first. If you have a thousand grams of distillate, and a big jar\nterpenes, don't just mix the two together because if you blow it, then you're\nscrewed. Start with the 1 gram batch. Get your\nratio- I do that on every product I ever make and so do large companies. Small\nbatch testing, that's the term for it. So what I recommend is that, well first off,\nyou need to understand that the ratio between terpenes and your product is\ngoing to differ every single time, because your distillate will always come\nout a different viscosity and it depends on what pen you use every different pen\nand cartridge that you use has different hole sizes in there and burns\ndifferently if it likes specific viscosity that it works best at\nknow your cartridge first and make a few different samples and see which one\nactually tastes best and smokes with the biggest clouds in the cartridge that\nyou're using and then don't switch because you're gonna have to do it all\nover every single time so basically with distillate you want to start out at 10%\nof terpenes no you take your distillate say you got 100 grams of tur picking a\nhundred grams of distillate 10 grams of terpenes now you're gonna want to mix\nthat heat does help the smallest amount of heat quickly mix it and make sure it\nemulsifies all together now if you heat something at a low temperature for a\nlong time at darkens I've personally found that if I heat it high really\nquickly and stir it and then cool it down I have less darkening because it's\nreally like a baking effect in my opinion high heat doesn't always like\ninstantly flash it everyone's got a different opinion on it so whatever you\ndo you have to heat it up a little bit make sure that it emulsifies in and take\nthe heat away from it and then you want to let it cool down to room temperature\nbecause your client is gonna be using that pen at room temperature you want to\nput it in the pen while it's still warm check your pen at room temperature not\nhot see how the bubble moves see how it smokes and if I were you I'd make a\ncouple different pens at different rates and find out what works best for your\npen like I said it's gonna be different there's a million types of pens out\nthere you may live in Arizona where everything's 100 degrees you may live in\nAlaska you're gonna want to make it a little runny or in Alaska and a little\nthicker in Arizona so all custom work here so you've mixed in 10% this works\ngreat it's probably not gonna be too runny I could pretty much guarantee that\nbut if it's too thick still then you can just add a little bit more terpenes and\nstir it in being that the terpenes have already emulsified in your distillate\nyou don't need to reheat it at that point it will mix in just by hand just\nfine now if you've made it to a thin add more\ndistillate in there stir it back up until you've got it the right way you'll\nnever really ruin a batch if you're doing that ballpark ratios for\ndistillate 10 to 15% is what we recommend now like I said we work out of\nLos Angeles we supply some of the largest pen companies in the country\ndown in Los Angeles and we always talk with their R&D teams what they're\nfinding is you can get the amount of terpenes to make it function in the pen\nbut customers are actually just getting more flavor they you know they\njust really want to taste some things and that's what we're just seeing across\nthe board always work with what your clients want because that's your main\ngoal not what you want nobody really cares what you like just remember that\nyou got to keep it in perspective you may be the owner of a company nobody\ncares customers want what they want so make sure to give them choices and let\nthem choose you know it's one of the fallacies that we all have as\nmanufacturers that everybody thinks like us so give them a few options let them\nchoose if they want a more flavorful pen or a less flavorful pen cannabis\nprofiles flavor profiles whatever remember 10 to 15% is a ballpark in Los\nAngeles in the major areas we are finding that they like a little bit more\nterpenes for a more robust flavor in their pen thistle it tastes like crap\nanyway I think it tastes like plastic and I don't like the taste of it I'd\nrather have a little more flavoring a little weaker pen and take an extra hit\nof something I liked then one less hit of something that I don't now when\nyou're dealing with shatter and hard extracts you have to remember there's a\nwindow here the scale you've got liquefied oil down here you've got solid\nshatter over here you are taking either end of this spectrum and you're trying\nto get it into a liquid obviously this oil over here is closer\nto a liquid already so all you have to do is add a little bit of terpenes if\nyou're over here in a solid state you're gonna have to add more terpenes so on\nthe hardest shatter we've ever seen just like some glass the most we've ever had\nto add was 50% by weight cool thing about my products which makes them\nbetter than other people's products as other companies give you a max dilution\nratio of 5 to 8% because they do not know how to blend their terpenes watch\nmy other videos on how to blend terpenes and why our products are better\nscientifically our products will taste fine at 50% you try doing that with\nanother company your throats going to get all jacked up because they don't\nknow how to do it they're just reading a piece of paper from a lab we don't do\nthat we handcraft our blends so that regardless of what product you're using\nit's gonna taste good and it's gonna taste the same and it's not gonna be\nharsh so for BHO some solid shatter you're gonna want to use a up to a 50%\nratio we can pretty much guarantee that all of our products will taste good up\nto a 50% ratio and it's kind of unheard of other companies require the use of\nMCTS or polyethylene glycol as a cutting agent I don't like it it's not how we\ndeveloped our product so one gram of BHO shatter 2\nthe half a gram now our terpenes are about 48 drops per gram so if you don't\nhave a scale and you have a gram of shattered what does that 24 drops will\nliquify that down so what about wax isn't crumble well that's just in the\nmiddle of the scale so you know you've got 10% over here 50% over here you\nwaxing your crumbles are going to be at about 25 to 30% those things usually\ncome out fogging when you stir them up if you have an extract and you mix them\nterpenes and it's kind of foggy hit it with a little heat those are your waxes\nthat are showing the waxes loosen up they melt and then they emulsify\nthemselves back in there and then it stays clear it's a really cool process\nso what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do demo videos on each one of these I'm\ngoing to take some distillate I'm gonna mix it I'm going to show you the\ndifferences in everything I'm gonna take some BHO it makes it teach you how to do\nall that and another time right now I've just got a lot on my plate so hopefully\nthese basic ratios help you out in your products and go try it out start with a\nsmall batch always make sure it functions at room temperature always\nscale yourself up there's companies out there making millions of dollars that\nstarted in their garage and so can you alright so thanks for watching the\nterpene Institute was created just to give you a simple common-sense\nunderstanding of terpenes and the cannabis industry make some money help\nsome people trying to help you guys out alright thank you for watching go to mr.\nextract or calm I will see you in the next episode take it easy", "9-BDZv8wZC8": "[Music] this is highly active on this is highly active on this the place that we go up and ask synthetic supplies the living organic imagine ADA would nature in that what is up wonderful and amazing human beings smokers growers that was kind of sewers anybody watching this video I hope you I have a one hell of a day my name is Terrence I would highly active farms and today I'm with my really good friend Brian what's a Brian is the host of a brand new podcast I'm gonna check out called don't hide the mic that's right he is interviewing some really know people from athletes to artists to me actually so you can even go check out our interview I'll make sure the links in the description and all that and if you want to learn more about me and the other awesome

have like a free-form conversation and just share ideas and you know half of it is we just talk [ __ ] and have fun and the other half is you know we get down into some serious thoughts and it's a lot of fun not having recommended you know my episode accused one of my favorite episodes I'm gonna do appreciate ya oh yeah you wonderful show I've been watching every episode I can't get enough of it it's definitely my new favorite podcast and I just so much man yeah you absolutely and yeah without any further ado let's go ahead and get into this official highly active slurring changed rain review [Applause] so tell about this lurking in this trance Larry King if you're wondering was bred by in-house genetics and it's a cross of two of the heaviest hitters in the game purple punch and dosey doe so these are already some of the strongest in the game you may have heard of them and they were pressed together by your house to be this train called slippery cane which we got from purple City genetics and this cut in particular is the cowboy way so can you explain what the cowboy credits the cowboy cut means that of all the seeds this is one particular seed that was selected for its traits by Grover called cowboy buds and you can rub up on Instagram and stuff sweet but yeah so this cuts pretty phenomenal in roid out in organic living soil as we always do here at Ivy active farms and without any further ado let's start reviewing this first we have to do the aroma test yes and I do want to say to our pets Larry came before from other Brewers and crazy experiences but I've never had it from my boy caning right here and I know my Candy's met these they're just look like fantastic oh my goodness II did not look this good that smells fantastic it's got a nice light white frosty coat a lot of the orange hairs I don't know the specifics about what contributes to it so penny do you want to get into that like teaching some things oh yeah so uh all that Frost is seen those are the trichomes he's doing up with the magnifying to look like a tiny little skinny mushroom you basically as kind of the shape they have oh what the hell you guys are like long and they have like heads at the top and at the heads of all the cannabinoids and therapies are nice so uh that's when you look after maturity and stuff and that's also what's getting you the nice stone and we like to get from this sweet nice medical buzz and all the medical benefits also it's all coming from those Franklin's recently nice yeah good I'm excited to try it out so if you ever seen really frosted bud you notice it was a little bit better that's why my fingers are still sticky and it's nice and sticky oh yeah that's just I think for like two seconds yeah I'll tell you right now hands now I think hurricanes the frosting is frickin strained I've ever seen as far as the buds for sure I mean it's just ridiculous I'll be honest I'm a little intimidated to having tried this thing yet I tried all the other everything else that I received with this one I've been waiting no dissipation with you I'm so happy you said that because I'm also mean can't even smoke in but for a while you know we smoked a fair amount and slur Akane's one of those strains that just like leave an impact on like your stoner permanent record welcome absolutely it's a it's something you don't go into lightly you know me I have but throughout the day it's good stuff but this one is an experienced hunter well I'm expecting that on the side yeah also be reviewed so far and this harvest has been an experience so without any further ado is a you think about the arrow yeah that smells great it's almost got a wanna see almost like a hints of orange I can I read hints of orange maybe a little piney we didn't and it's crazy it's a strong smell it smells like hash it almost smells with some of those orange ease and fruity I just wasn't really good yeah as I started you ever smell sort of strange like damn I could have a candle about this oh yeah absolutely I think those drains this is one of that super delicious not only is it fruity but it's like big bank and kind of smells like - a little bit I bet those orange serves like you said also some a little bit of berry in there it's just I mean it's got a lot of everything kind of hits every note and here we go the flavor test all right let's do it and see how she delivers something tells me she's gonna deliver granda yeah all right I'm gonna get to those greens sure being on it and you always get the guest opinions yeah very gently and I'm pretty intimidated to be honest I'm excited to see you sir you know you know what I can taste it that's an interesting way to Dan [Music] I do not have lungs like whoa it's interesting what do you notice about that to be honest I actually definitely do think well I didn't have a strong case I get personal for me it didn't taste anything like how it smells that's what I noticed by just a taste it's like it I want to say it's almost very smooth and you play smooth like it it's it feels like air like oxygen and but it doesn't have a lot of flavor to it like I mean it kind of what do you think a lot of thing I definitely feel you it's so smooth that's kind of why I'm taking the degree yeah because I don't think that big agents but I know it's not the highly active organic cooking so around but like you said that organic that I'm so or with he brings out a smoothness to the point where it's like air yeah I said I'm what am i reviews I said it's like better than air technically means oxygen get your social slur Akane no but really that but I'm not that it feels good to breathe in it yeah I just like food like when you eat food and you're hungry like I don't know my lungs are wanting they except it wasn't me yeah I know you don't you don't really drink but least for me it's like having like that that really nice like hundred dollar shelf-life liquor the one you sip on as opposed to getting that like a little cheaper must here one like it's really smooth it just goes down the pipes really nice yeah I really want to aim to the flavour because I feel like getting taste too much as far as the flavor I'll say I got a pretty good pretty good job of that flavor god it's already hitting me man I said okay but as far as the flavor goes it was a very very like compassion a lot of itself very I want to say it was more cakey and gassy than then fruity ok smelled more fruity but I had more of a cakey gas Mexico absolute you mean second time around no I feel a cakey feel almost like just a typical white cake but not really powerful just like incident and I wasn't expecting that because I didn't smell it so much it smells a lot like fruit yeah the thing is it tastes nothing like how it smells if you've ever had some like it I mean it really can taste like top-shelf wedding cake if you've ever had really good wedding cake I don't know if it was just me but I was surprised at how much of that flavor and I think that might be that hashey flavor just a shit-ton of trichomes but my parents are kind of all the trichomes stacking up when you're tasting kind of the THC return something like that I don't know sorry I got distracted by the high-kicking like I'm sitting here and I feel it physically making my head lighter it's it's interesting I gotta say immediately it feels pretty dreamlike like it's the first thing I forgot I forgot what was happening for a second I was sitting here just enjoying it like oh we're recording a video that's right minute and this thing keep some money real quick like it does not take long to do this how to hit you at all that's that's that's true as [ __ ] I was not expecting it to happen that fast yeah which tell which makes me think like does that I hit you right away or am I still gonna get a lot higher I'm about to another good question some of these reviews we've given a review but after the video I have gotten way more stuff than some of these I think the mochi is been emoji both of those after the video I was a summer else I might add me right now they do I've already feeling if every quick I'll also that word oh now mr. berry oh okay all right here's what I'm getting for the flavor bearing on the hinge now literally like a berry pie but that k-keep high flavor on the exhale the kind of gassy vanilla frosting we got going in definitely feel another [Music] definitely in the very notes in the end oh I might be somewhere else' this is that take you to Mars type stuff this is really make if you're somebody who's just like getting tired or not getting enough time I'm not getting high enough yeah you know like you did tolerance is too high this won't mess your tolerance up no matter where you tolerance is this will definitely break that yeah I'll just say I'm like four hits deep and it's already hit me like I'm just comfortable to myself yeah I'd have to say that the it's so strong that the highest concerning legend fear if you're not a veteran this is gonna be like like she wants like you know it's you probably think this is very jean like very strong doesn't take much one hit you let her feel at it pretty quickly I don't know about you you know what I'll stand by that was Hurricane just like I said this will be my second time having this letter came this woman is definitely already stronger than the first plant for her shirt Butler Cain is not like it's not like it's not your your daily like smoke you know before you're about to go be productive like I know this Bishop will hit you hard like like I said roaming yet you hit Steve and I'm already like pretty [ __ ] tonight yeah basically like you saying you wouldn't use this in the morning before starting your day is like that as a pick-me-up you can't microdose with it no there's only one hit and you're there so it's definitely like after work you trying to relax maybe you've had a party II try to impress people something like that or somebody suffering from very strong PTSD I think this would keep a lot of those all out of those I can't remember anything so I think a lot of the bad memories don't fade away I think it would be great for family you know I could definitely see the pain relief because my my body for sure has like this relaxing sensation rolling through it like everything feels relaxed actually honestly stretching sounds great right now I can I get second name and I wanted to test the pain relief a little bit I didn't go her and myself for nothing but last night I training really hard at your concession Thanks I was up doing a lot of flips and a lot of hard landings and I really put my all in and I was hoping to get a little bit sore today and I'd I got a lot sore I got very I woke up in a lot of pain after the training session and all that pain is gone right now I completely forgot about it I forgot that extra class name nice I'm saying this and I feel like I'm talking about a book I read like this is some really take you somewhere else type stuff it's like I've never seen this room before it's continuously growing - the more we talk like legitimately the higher getting yeah I said good man yeah I'm almost waiting to see where it goes but yeah overall I mean this is I think it definitely deserves what are the most potent for sure well one of the most potent one of the most potent but my issue with calling you the best strain is that it's almost too strong man yeah there's the exactly that happens at a point and there's so many different uses there's so many different it's the too good at reasons it's too good at its job it's overdoing it yeah I feel that yeah that's definitely best it definitely has a lot of subjectivity but as far as one of the most potent it's one of the most potent for sure for a share to be hard to find her tomorrow motion I think this would be a great strain for me personally link or something like stretching any sort of like going to the movies playing some video games anything that will keep you seated or like not to mobile for me I feel like this strain would really I would really enjoy that yeah that's really good that's really good way to put it yeah I don't think I could be doing anything that's important I just forget what I was doing in the middle of it you know but when I say it's going to relaxing what a save me miss or I could do something before my relaxing is important not that too important though you know like I'm not doing taxes on this oh yeah like honestly like like you know I like to like do a bullfight before I get to work and everything so you know I'll write down the whole I gotta do it but how about this one man this one is after yeah even for me even for me this is wrong you know what this will be organized oh yeah this would be a great strain for right after a workout that's a really good way to put it oh yeah Oh like Ruxin I'm thinking about it right now just like you go to the gym like or like you go to practice you have a kicking section of people recession you get a really good work done you're exhausted after your shoulders you're dead if you like to take a few bits of this get a little stretching in do you like it also now that you've made some little accent creativity I mean this is great your creativity just the fact that I feel like I'm at a whole new perspective and angle on things that kind of seeing things from only manual and sometimes that could really help with creativity whether it's overcoming problems or just artistic creativity maybe not accomplishing the whole task of getting started and that gave me some really good ideas honestly yeah overall I mean wonderful strain superb own anything else I mean it's strong it's a commitment as the shoes I got to say it's all the boxes as far as growing it goes before I forget super big fielder and super vigorous grower movie hits all the boxes for growing too and obviously super take and try growing these things mugs beautiful or just others hits everything just honestly hard to put down anyway unless you're not looking for something too strong yeah too strong oh and I don't want to like to deter people from you like it like it's too strong don't try it it's a great hi it's wonderful it's a wise thing going to put its lights we're not getting paranoid if you're not mentally wonderful soothing Hannah it's just it's just got its purpose it's it's really good at getting you really high don't get you up there really fast so it's like it's not it's a great time and it's really feeling good creative time anyway yeah super super vigorous guard wonderful wonderful bro you see Brooklyn City genetics the area definitely pick up some slur again because I think she's the best out there in terms of potency in terms of quality and yeah that's about it yeah so until next time don't forget to stay high stay healthy and always stay active peace everybody [Music]",

let's get it peace y'all", "e8amMJehvCo": "all right this is just a live resin review no i don't do it at the beginning of the cart because i like to see how the effects are first before i say anything about it kind of a mango pineapple puffs now what i really like about these is how [ __ ] strong they are they don't they look like distillate but i can assure you that's live version that's the color of moving all your shitty distill it will be like super dark so yeah this is just an uncut video just to show you what a real life resin car looks like and i got this little battery pack", "xLuO9hF25fA": "yah what's going on people it's time for new video in this one we'll be teaching you how to dab without a know this was gonna be directed to the people that wanna Tory dabbing that want to press out their own roles in but don't have either add a break or a nail that they can put onto a bong and dab with that but we get into this or do you need to see these videos were intended for people they're 18 years and older and they're made for educational and entertainment purposes only now it's gonna be quite a short one today is it gonna be anything too crazy there's one method that I do want to go over there are a couple other methods that you can use however I feel that this is probably the easiest and the most foolproof one because if you've got some oil you know and if you're used to smoke an oil you know how precious the stuff is you don't get much of it and wasting some of it is a [ __ ] nightmare so what we're going to be doing is known as a cherry bomb now if don't know what cherry bomb is it's where you get a bowl of weed in a bomb you torture up and then you dab on the cherry okay it sounds a little bit weird but when you go through it name so I've got my daily driver bong here and I've got my bowl now when you're doing this you want to be prepared do not fumbling about trying to get things ready while you're hitting the ball first thing you want to do is pack a bowl of weed nice and tight make sure you get that really nice and compact you're probably gonna need a torch or a form of jet lighter in order to get this going hot enough to be able to dab off of it properly I'll tell you why you would doing everything this specific way as we go but basically when it comes to packing the ball you want it to be as dense as possible because you want it to stay in the bowl for as long as possible because your focus isn't gonna be hitting the bong your focus is going to be vaporize in your oil and you're gonna just be using the weed as a tool to do so so having a bit of weed in with there here is a bonus but it's not what you're focused on so make sure it's nice and packed and you've got a lighter that will get it hot as [ __ ] that we just got your bong ready make sure you get yourself a nice little dab ready we've pressed actual rolls and earlier I hope you can see that that's gonna be our dab for today now my recommendation with a dab some people like to get a nice little glob on the they're dubba regardless of how you want to do it make sure that you've got it nice and stringy you don't want it to be dense pieces of oil but they'll take a lot longer to vaporize off of the cherry so the thin area is and the less that's all bunched together the easier this is gonna melt and burn and you're not going to end up wasting any because at some point or another that weed is gonna pull through and if you haven't finished all your oil and it hasn't completely vaporized you're just wasting your dab I'm gonna show you what that looks like does a [ __ ] up doing this video as you can see the oil just wasn't melt in it was staying in one big glob and then you end up getting all the ash just attached to the oil itself so you can't even dab it after so it is literally just a waste of it so like I said make sure is straight so soon this is a completely [ __ ] it the first time we're gonna do it again properly I've made a couple changes I've change the bond so it's an easier angle also got myself a different daddy this one is a lot prettier it's definitely smaller but this is purely just for an example so you can see exactly what you're doing where is it there we go so as you can see we've kept the dab a lot stringier than the last one did the problem with the last one was we left it too long it was just chilling on the side of because it's hot where I might name it just sort of collapsed on itself so we've managed to keep this one nice and space tight waiting the wasted of all time we ain't gonna [ __ ] up any more [ __ ] we're just gonna crack on and do this oh Jesus well I say throughout the making of this video I have set a trend I've just [ __ ] everything up that's no different for the last clip the video that recorded basically forgot to zoom I so literally it was just this part of my face on the screen and that was it [ __ ] stupid software I just come back and basically say what I said but in a better version though the whole thing that I wanted to get across is the fact that this is a legit way to dub it does work and after I'd hit those I did not feel like I just smoked balls I definitely could tell that I've had oil so if you do want to dab either on a budget or if you just haven't got a rig you haven't gotten there or something that you can dab off of this is definitely a good alternative so not quite the same as hitting off of of course bang on or something but it's a good middle ground and it is the best way to experience your first stab should you not have the right tools also I do want to say one thing it's not only to this video but we are approaching 420 subs now I wasn't gonna do a celebration video and 10,000 subscribers but then I finally realized well I've got in for 420 I know it's a wee Channel so that's what we're gonna be doing I ain't gonna give too much away just though it's gonna involve edibles should be quite good video so if you're new to the channel and you haven't already subscribed please do subscribe if you want to see that video anyway but that being said I'm gonna wrap this video up when I finish editing I can upload a few guys hopefully I'll see in the next one soon", "f-zCVt_jgh0": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary today we are taking a look at a new to us vape company and that is ocean cannabis co with their live resin uh today we are going to be reviewing their straw nana strain uh this is the one gram variety rocking 84 thc and 90 and a quarter percent uh total cannabinoids in there uh you usually see that big discrepancy in thc and tac uh when it is live resin because it has all those other cannabinoids that are usually lost in the process uh theoretically should be in here um so being a live resin cartridge uh it was on the more expensive end but cheaper uh than most live resin i've seen uh this one gram cartridge cost me i believe 63 dollars with tax in long beach california which again puts it on the uh more expensive end for a one gram cartridge but on the cheaper end for a one gram live resin cartridge uh so what are some other cool things about it well i really uh am kind of i was intrigued by their whole sort of marketing pitch and the reason they're called ocean cannabis co it seems like a pretty admirable goal to me uh they say on the back that they use all recycled materials in their packaging uh including plastic that has been pulled from the ocean uh so i looked at their website it's a husband and wife combo duo who are uh the head of ocean cannabis co uh and some percentage of the plastic that is in their packaging is pla comes from plastic that was uh extruded from the good old pacific ocean uh which is replete with plastic debris um i'm guessing you know it's probably not a whole lot of pla it's um hard to imagine it's made any kind of a dent but you know it's an admirable goal nonetheless uh so let's go ahead and get into it here this is standard 510 thread stuff so just your normal battery uh ah and here is that plastic that i was talking about that has uh some of it is uh ocean garbage which is again pretty neat i'd love to know the exact percentage the little press release i read online was pretty uh you know a little self-serving and smug but uh it's a cool again i do not want to dilute the coolness okay uh so we've got some different kind of child proofing here that i've not seen uh a line leaf with dot and push up okay so we're gonna line this leaf with these dots there's a little leaf there at the top it's kind of hard to see and it looks like it's lined with the dots and we're just gonna pull off perfect easy enough and there we are i found it curious that their website doesn't focus so much on the actual uh it focuses almost exclusively on their packaging and very little on the actual oil itself their their um their product they're trying to get you to consume uh but here it is and it does look fine that is some nice looking darker oil not as dark as some of the live resin i've seen out there but uh nice looking color nice consistency materials look pretty nice like that ceramic uh tip nice glass base and yeah looks like actually pretty decent materials all around let's get it on our battery here set the voltage at 3.3 ish and let's give it a try so here we go here is our first hit of our ocean cannabisco straw nana tasty it uh has those very strong nana e terpenes very sort of fruity and um uh yeah just a kind of a a sweeter tasting strain uh very delightful um i'm i don't necessarily doubt that this is live resin tastes like the strain there um i know live resin in terms of uh there have been some instances where companies have gotten in trouble recently for sort of deceptively labeling things uh live resin when they're not really uh that is a subject for a whole other video i don't know how to tell myself without having basically like a spectrometer um but uh i can tell you that this is still pretty quality oil uh whatever is in there and there's no reason to doubt you know they say it's live resin i'm sure it is okay well this is pretty quality oil and it's pretty strong i'm feeling it pretty uh pretty acutely after just a couple of hits there uh 84 thc so it is a high th c live resin which is nice taste is nice uh let me get another couple of hits in here i think this battery in particular has weaker draws than some i'm going to try turning up the voltage just a bit which don't necessarily do especially for live resin i'm not sure why but i've heard people say try to vape it on the lowest temperature uh you can but just to see if that'll help with the draws oh yeah there we go that helped quite a bit wow that is quite tasty quite potent let's get one more in here before we say goodbye for the moment yum wow ocean cannabis co uh this is a pretty good product i'm um more impressed than i thought i was gonna be uh i really you know i admire what they're trying to do with their packaging uh and the affordable price on this live resin especially for one that's as potent as it is uh makes this a pretty good value for a product um that uh you know the live regions usually come in that exuberant exuber oh i forgot how to say that word exorbitant exuberant no exorbitant [ __ ] i'm high [ __ ] 84 thc that right there guys is proof in the pudding the pretty the proof is in the pudding some kind of proof pudding situation it's all here uh big thumbs up from ocean cannabis co wasn't necessarily expecting the greatest things but uh really pleasantly surprised so far however like all of our wheats reviews we're going to review the whole thing all one gram here it'll probably take me about five days or so to get through it uh and once i do i'll come right back here and give you all of our wrap-up thoughts make sure that this straw nana is as fresh and tasty on the day we unpeeled it as the day we finished it that was never going to work but what will work is hopefully this for the next five days until then stay high stay healthy we'll see you soon goodbye hi guys welcome back to wheats it's been a little over four days since we started with ocean cannabis cos live resin straw nana this one gram cartridge you can see i've got a little bit of that live resin left in there not a whole lot it's actually hitting just fine i was just already out here at the ocean and i thought to myself what better time to finish our review uh our first half was really positive you guys remember i know i did really liked this stuff especially for the price and i also found their sort of recycling gimmick to work pretty well too or to uh to be um at least a a cool idea uh i'm not sure how it well it's sparing an execution but that idea of using ocean plastic as packaging is neat but the more important part is that the actual live resin is good stuff um and at that price i think it was what what did i say 55 something like that um not a bad price at all it might have been a little bit more for live resin which usually is like about 20 more or so than standard distillate so this is gonna be a big thumbs up for ocean cannabis co and their straw nana like uh pretty much everything there is to like about it um and i think maybe in the future we'll take another look at some of their products uh and then anytime guys we have one of these reviews that we like this much we like to give a little cherry on top dogs kicking up sand on my camera person as we speak how stoic is she any time we ever review that we like this much cherry on top i'm going to give you a perfectly perfectly paired cherry on top i don't know i hope i didn't mention this in the beginning the first half i might have if so that's okay because it's worth being brought up twice that is a twofer and the twofer is uh pbs's frontline documentary series all of them uh they're all amazing they come out with like 10 a year of all different kinds of topics but very specifically plastic wars from this year 2020 frontline documentary uh that is about plastic and plastics in the ocean and uh this sort of uh unbelievable fraud that is recycling plastic and how heartbreaking it all is uh but it's actually a wonderful documentary and has changed my views on plastics that is front lines pbs's front lines plastic boards something i highly recommend along with the ocean cannabis co live resin straw nana and that guys is gonna do for the cherry on top and the review efficient one today while we're out here at the ocean thank you so much to anybody who's made it this far until we see you for our next review that tractor says stay high more importantly stay healthy later you", "qRC5ONbUjE4": "[Music] [Music] all right what's going on you guys so the other day truly came out with their newest product a collaboration between them and blue river extracts THCA snow otherwise known by a true blue river snow is what they call it probably a couple you guys know what this already is but for those of you that don't know this THCA snow is actually a byproduct of the rosin that they've been making at truly recently this is what is left behind in the little mesh bags after they pressed the rosin or the hash rosin there are the hash to get the rosin and this is actually what is left behind in the little bags it's actually a byproduct of making rosin so just a cool little fact but this right here is actually 100% pure THC a isolate and it takes on a powder form for the most part but it can come in a couple different ways just depending on how the product ended up curing so let's go ahead and take a dab of this just to see how it burns there's a couple different ways that this can be consumed but probably the most preferable or one of the most preferable ways would be to dab it so let's go ahead and take a DAB and just see how it burns real quick [Music] so Melton hits pretty good it maybe doesn't quite produce as well as maybe rosin batter because it takes a little bit more to puddle up and get an actual a little bit of vapor going like that but it still works pretty good like that not too bad let's go ahead and take one more hit of that it's really fast and I'm pretty sure it's not just the strain it's just the kind of the product it is it's really fast not much taste really or smell actually either but it is definitely a very very fast worker it goes to work very fast oh so this stuff cost the same amount as the rosin batter it's 75 dollars a gram so the other way to smoke it is to use it as a topping unlike a bowl or a joint or a blunt or something like that nature that is definitely a quick way a strong way to spice up your bowl or joint that'll definitely give it a really good kick so let's go ahead and roll up a joint and I'll put some of this in and try it out it is stronger than the rosin batter it is a little bit stronger than that but it doesn't quite last the high doesn't last as long as the rosin batter especially if you just smoke it by yourself by itself in a banger like that the the high maybe only lasts for like an hour - or well maybe 2 hours and as opposed to the rosin batter I feel like that effect can Rath blast me up to 4 to 6 hours if I do it right so today I'm going to be mixing this with some member berry and this is coming in at a total of 23.9% and this is just always a good strain to get you can't go wrong with member berri it's a ethos calling strain and you guys know I'm a big fan of his history as he's just everything that guy puts out is just amazing you can't go wrong but with any of that [Music] so I want to know from you guys who's gonna dab it who's gonna smoke it out of a joint and who's gonna do both let me know down in the comments I'm curious what you guys how you guys like to smoke it or we'll smoke it like I said me myself I'm probably gonna use it more of like you know topping on like joints and stuff like that just you know on those days when I don't want to do dabs or the flowers just not strong enough or something like that or I just need real quick relief you know fast that's that's probably what I'll use it for it complements a joint very nice it actually it doesn't make it like real harsh or anything like that like you know if you add shadow or something to it's going to kind of make it harsh it doesn't you can't even really tell it's in there and it's it's it's really a good complement to the joint so not bad I mean not one of my absolute must-have favorite products but not bad definitely add and stuff like that to the menu doesn't hurt so that's gonna be it for today's video I hope you guys liked it please like the video if you did and subscribe for more also I got some great giveaways coming up for 4/20 that you'll definitely want to be a part of so subscribe for that and watch out in the next videos for upcoming

liquid thousands of videos coming up court judges", "8GgqsLxL6yw": "what's going on guys it's looney coming at you with another video welcome back and as you guys know i got a cartridge coming up if you guys watched my last video you guys knew that it was either this coming up or um the other ursa so i decided to go ahead and try the fields fields extracts i'm gonna go ahead and try their garlic cookies out give them give this puppy a try and see what see what it's like it's garlic cookies if i haven't said it already one gram one full gram coming in at 82.4 percent 1.9 milligrams of total cbd and it is manufactured out of long park california all right so this is the little sticker that keeps this top uh sealed so i'm just gonna rip it completely just bust it open the box ripped before the sticker that the sticker is really durable actually so you open this up and oh wow so here actually you guys let me show you guys this they when i bought this cartridge they gave me a mask this is the mask they gave they gave me even has field on it really i love it i love it it's a dope looking mask and the mask is the same design that they have on the box which is amazing i think that's [ __ ] dope excuse my language all right so they got the field extracts they got their instagram right there instagram handle field extracts um inside is just a little cartridge oh wow that's nice man that's nice uh look at that so that's that's their little design although the garden all the plants flowers i like that it's nice looks cool it's a little different so cartridges in here obviously push down twist i really don't like these i'll be honest so push down because they're kind of hard to open push oh [ __ ] my hands are freezing right now it's really cold where i'm at so this is actually kind of hard to do wow this is really bad i can't even push it down all right there it goes push it down oh my god dude this is actually really hard all right so terrible um this is that's what i have to do right there is absolutely terrible dude that i'd never ever want to ever have to do that ever to open a cartridge and wow i'm completely shocked wow that smells like that actually smells like garlic i'm really shocked it has a hint of garlic in there okay i thought the cartridge was gonna look totally different i thought it was gonna be a lot thicker a lot bigger the tip i like the tip oh wow okay i was expecting something totally different guys california sticker on there it's uh embedded in there so you can't take it off wow really nice looking oil really nice looking oil beautiful wow it's going to be amazing airflow i can already tell i'm getting a bunch of air going through i'm gonna go ahead and try this uh try this out man garlic cookies i'm super excited i thought it was gonna be like super dark ugly looking uh live resin and the reason why i thought it was going to be like this because i spoke to so uh field extracts on their instagram oh look they even have field right here i spoke to whoever runs their instagram and they told me that this is a true representation of full spectrum live resin they don't add anything they don't add no extra terps no any no additives no distillate and when he told me that i was like damn they don't add terps i was like uh in my head i was like i instantly assumed it's just gonna taste like [ __ ] but we'll see right we'll see if it does so field extracts full gram cartridge beautiful looking oil live resin let's go ahead and give it a try i'm excited oh my god yes that's garlic cookies that's that's gmo wow field you guys you guys hit it on nail you guys did a good job so i smell the onion i smell the garlic it's very herbal it's very skunky musky it's very similar to the gmo from stizzy very similar but i gotta be honest the smell the aroma you get out of the tip of the pan after hitting it it's very it's it's it's a it's not as strong it's not as strong as a smell but it's the same smell and it's similar it's the same thing it's similar it's a similar smell and it's a very similar like it's literally the same exact aroma from the stizzy except not as strong not as powerful so that hit right there so that first hit got me you know it got me a little uh got me cool got me buzzing i'm not really feeling much from it to be honest so i'm going to go for another one and let's see how that first smoke in the day too so i would uh i would probably expect a little more from that but here let's go ahead and go for another one this is on 2.8 this is the lowest voltage i'm gonna be trying it on i could probably raise it just to see if i get a bigger cloud but we'll see right now big hits i'm gonna raise the voltage 3.3 because it's tasting amazing but i'm not getting the vapor i want well in terms of taste it's perfect and what i mean by perfect i mean it's not very overpowering it's not faint enough to where you don't pick it up you definitely pick it up it's definitely there it's in your face but it's not it's not like uh it's not something where it's it'll linger in your mouth like the flavor's already gone by the time you're done hitting it pretty much as soon as you blow all the smoke out you pretty much the flavors gone inside of your mouth head the headspace is good i like this i like this head space look at that very full cartridge this cartridge is very full i like that they're barely missing anything that's what you want to see all right so i'm gonna go ahead and uh they did recommend me to pre-wick uh oil so i'm gonna go ahead and double tap i'm gonna let it do its thing i'm gonna hit it while it's doing that wow that was super [ __ ] tasty and i wasn't even supposed to be a hit that was just to prime the oil just to warm it up so oh that took on my throat a little bit all right duh okay wow i might have spoke too soon when i said that this i didn't really feel anything because i gotta remind myself i'm always ten you know for the most part i'm reviewing live resin and live resin affects me differently and in that you know there's probably some of you guys that are similar or the same but live resin doesn't fully hit me right away like it takes a couple minutes to kick in and it's it's definitely kicking in now so this definitely hits this definitely uh definitely feel the 82 it's definitely in the 80s i'll tell you that i feel it's it's a nice feeling it's very relaxing very mellow [Music] a slight head change but it's mainly uh body go ahead for another toke at 3.3 volts see if this gives me more vapor see if i get more flavor uh wow definitely more vapor i'm gonna take it back i'm gonna take it up to 3.7 just to rotate it back to green wow so if you're looking to get a big cloud raise the temp they did field extracts they did recommend me to use the lowest voltage battery i have which is the ursa one but i'm gonna save that ursa battery for the ursa cartridge so i wanted to try this on a 2.8 just because i feel like i i in my opinion it would have been good enough just because the 2.8 did a good job for the ursa and they recommend nothing above 2.0 so this you know i assumed if it works for ursa or definitely if it doesn't burn ursas terps it won't burn these terps wow i just can't get over the the scent the scent of of the you get out of this the tip of it after and after taking some hits is amazing it smells just like you get you pick up garlic first thing you do first thing you pick up is garlic second thing you pick up is marijuana that's crazy but you get both of those things at the same time like right away and it's like uh it's not order it doesn't smell like artificial garlic either for anyone wondering it really smells like a real ass garlic wow tastes amazing the the the flavor on the 3.3 volts was it was more heavy of a flavor in terms of i got the garlic but i got so much of it that it was more spicy than it was garlic but when you smoke it at a low temp you get more of a garlicky that rather than a spicy but then i get i feel like the spicy could be also a lot it's just because you're getting a lot of vapor a lot of smoke so that's that could be what you're feeling as well just a bunch of a big hit so but in terms of medicaid medicating this was a 60 cart for four gram live resin so [Music] medicating wise medicated wise i can't even speak already so this is definitely getting me there where i need to be but high wise no complaints everything i would want from from gmo specif specifically and everything i would want from a live resin cartridge it the live resin taste is there it's not overpowering it's not very little it's just the right amount it's there for you to be like oh yep i got you i i'll taste you i see you you there i see you so i like it a lot i like first first impression for field extracts is of big thumbs up enormous they are on the same level as a stizzy might even be a little better i might like this a little bit more than just dizzy has me more medicated than this dizzy did i'll be honest i can't lie about that this cartridge has me more medicated than this dizzy one this dizzy one is so smooth where i did that tickle i got or that that i got from uh that last hit i i can't get that from this dizzy i don't know if it's because if it's a very old pod but this field if you guys can have this anywhere around you guys you guys got to pick up a field in your favorite strain so that way you can give it its best you know you can give it its best uh chance at what you think about it you know because you're gonna no one knows you no one knows your favorite strain better than you you know so that's how i feel about gmo so when it comes to gmo since i know gmo so perfectly garlic cookies in terms of scent medicating uh how you feel medicated wise when you have to vaping it or smoking it how it smells how it tastes all that all the all the pro all the um details about gmo i pretty much know i know them all and it's that makes it so much easier for me to point out any little any little critiques or any little problems that i'm having zero problems with this one there's a bubble you can see the bubble doesn't even go up the oil is so damn thick that's this just everything around this car this is a amazing cartridge i like it wow this is crazy so as of now just from those hits because those hits have me really medicated usually usually i feel this medicated after i'm done recording and i'm like damn i'm just sitting there after done after i wrap up the recording and i turn the video off i'm sitting in my car i'm like wow i'm really hot this is how i feel right now and i haven't even finished my uh the last hit so for the last one i'm gonna go ahead and go back to uh i'll go back to blue because that was a really good vo that was a really good voltage for this uh 3.3 i feel like is where you would want to be at because that that was just that was perfect right there that hit was perfect so i'm gonna get some water clear my palette anyone wondering i want to um i have plans on trying heavy hitter necks uh distill it because i've had uh two people already uh two people in the comments have recommended me that uh to try our heavy hitters already so i'm gonna go ahead and do that so expect that uh coming up after this ursa one after whenever i upload that one and yeah i'm just sitting here waiting for this bubble to go up i don't know about you guys but as you guys see there's intake holes there's one right there right where the bubble is there's another intake hole another intake hole right there another one so there's about one two three four there's there's four intake holes and one of them is completely opened exposed because of the air bubble because of the oil in my opinion i feel like when you hit the pan when there's an air bubble on an intake hole you don't get the full experience just because you'll get a slight burn taste because that part of the wick isn't wicked like you know there's no oil in it so if anyone so like for example um if i'm sure a bunch of you guys have tried select i used to try select all the time you know they're pretty fire they still are the one thing that threw me off from select the reason why i still don't buy them to this day is because they're famous for this bubble after your every hit of your select you're going to have a bubble on the intake horror like this probably on two of them and it'll literally sit there forever you would have to literally i would have to hold my cartridge like this in my hand to so that would you know doing this for like five minutes or like a couple minutes well he well like your hand gets really warm just doing this and it warms up the oil and it doesn't warm up the oil enough to burn it obviously it's just body temperature so you're just warming it up and warming it up you know after you'll be surprised how warm this gets so after a couple minutes of holding your cartridge like this it gets super warm and it i would have to do that in order to get the bubble to raise like it'll raise up slowly in order for me to get a the hit i would want because every hit would be burnt would be burnt tasting and just bad tasting and and it would be a full gram but it's just because there there's no oil in the intake hose or so that so i don't know if you guys have had that problem but comment below if you have wow this has me feeling amazing so uh med um i was gonna say medicate like and subscribe medicate comment like and subscribe um i hope you guys been enjoying the videos you know this this cartridge exceeded my expectations a hundred percent like i was i did this one first because i wanted to like kind of get it out the way i was not even gonna taste like garlic cookies it's not even gonna be a good one just because i was expecting it because when to do it when did when their instagram uh uh when the person who runs their instagram told me they don't add no terpenes i for some reason i just assumed that it wasn't gonna taste good i thought it was gonna taste like nothing but flour just like the straight plant soil like the friendly farms i thought was gonna taste like straight soil and just water and just oregano and leaves that's what i thought was gonna taste like when he said there was no terpenes but i don't know how they can i'm you know i'm not going to complain but however they whatever they do it in order to get this exact flavor and consistency of oil and just everything about the oil looks amazing it looks this oil is amazing like it looks for them to get it looking like this tasting like this smoking like this filling like this and they don't add anything it's like straight up from the plant boom to the cart that's crazy either someone's lying or that's just some magic you guys understand what i'm trying to say that's crazy but um yeah so right off the bat i mean i'm extremely biased because this is my favorite strain right here i've never had nug in i've never had gmo in a nug cartridge so this is why i this i and i say that because i'm about to say that i like this more than nug and it's hard to say that because i mean it i totally i would 100 pick this cartridge up over any of the net cartridges that i've tried in the past but i've never tried nug as nugs gmo version or garlic cookies version so if they ever cam came out with one who knows they might their [ __ ] might be the same it might be even better you know so that's the thing you guys got to keep an open eye out uh for there's always more product let's go ahead for this last toke i'm feeling amazing i hope you guys are too let's go field extracts highly recommend highly recommended if you guys can pick them up look the oil still the oil the bubble is still there it hasn't moved really thick amazing oil like it's just everything about it the viscosity everything just completely exceeded my expectations i'm not gonna lie go to their website field extracts and these cartridges for some reason there's no information about them on their website so when i went to their website and i seen that they had the saucepan and it was like a fat small little tank and they let the oil look dark and which nothing wrong with that there's nothing wrong with that just all natural i like that i like it when it tastes good though you know but anyways they on their website if you go to the website field extracts um online you'll see that these cartridges they're not even on the website there's no information about these so when i got this cartridge i didn't think it was going to look anything like this i didn't think it was going to be i thought it was going to be that small fat tank with dark oil and i was like ah man i was kind of you know i was excited to try it because it's garlic cookies but i was like i would had kind of like i was wasn't i didn't have my hopes too high because i was expecting it to kind of i was expecting to have a kind of like a shitty experience with it so when i opened the box right now completely surprised me i'm so happy that this is what they got and this is what they're doing really uh really stoked so let's go in for the tub guys cheers uh you see that that that intake that bubbles getting foggy because there's nothing burning there so it gets foggy wow i tasted oh man even with that bubble there it still tastes so good wow my only complaint would be the tip i don't like that uh material the plastic whatever it is in my opinion just that's just my only personal critique and then but the only the good thing about the tip is it has amazing air air flow like it you're able to like inhale and it feels like you're not getting anything but then it hits your you know you get the lung expansion you get the you get all that so it definitely lets you know that wow this is this is like uh every toke i take it's like you know you it's like i'm getting you know i'm getting up there and higher and higher so wow so i'm definitely going to be giving field extracts a try again in another try i'ma go ahead and see what else they got see if they got any um anything that catches my eye and they also have pods but i don't want to have to buy the pot system and in in order to try the whole pod i would i will do that though if any of you guys are wondering how the pod system and the pod works just to so that way i can give you guys a good review on it and give you guys my thoughts and and everything so this is field extracts garlic cookies like comment subscribe let me know what you guys want

cartridge on Sunday Sunday like I want to save Sunday afternoon and man that the times I've been hitting it [ __ ] dude that this this our partner here oh gee cush probably has to be the cleanest the the cleanest by far the cleanest cartridge or the cleanest flavor I mean because man like this thing like it literally gets you [ __ ] stoned out of your mind like a rot away like that and then so we're gonna get into this review guys and then we're gonna hop into a quick hotbox this is just a short video guys nothing too long so um you got the Alpine right here alpine battery you already know and then so I'm gonna read you guys some [ __ ] right here 700 45.02 milligrams of THC and 24.4 milligrams of CBD and this was tested by CW analytical safety quality science so if you guys want to keep that right there oh gee cush and man uh actually I've actually never ever in my life like had OG Kush like over the original strain oh gee coach I don't think I've ever had that [ __ ] like I see how the people talkin about oh gee this OG that but like I know it all stems from one specific og strain it has like ancestry and all that [ __ ] [ __ ] but I don't know I've never smoked some some real OG [ __ ] to be honest the only oh geez that I've smoked papaya B bubba kush OG and then Trudy those are the two the two only oh geez I really know there are the only ones that I really [ __ ] with guys so let's get right into this review guys because I'm trying to hotbox his [ __ ] gets [ __ ] hot in here fia's live in Southern California he has no it's been the weather's lately been [ __ ] hot like it's been hot as [ __ ] like this whole this past weekend that just passed by I think it was like 100 and 506 the whole weekend so [ __ ] man this weather needs to dip out right now it's actually pretty breezy it's weird man this Cali weather is [ __ ] weird bro cuz I like like I said it was hot it's been hot the whole week like blazing how I'm talking about you go outside your didn't get [ __ ] burn so and then right now it's [ __ ] windiest [ __ ] and not the helicopter day and it's been hella like musty there's been hella [ __ ] like humid it's been humid it's been humid and it's useless it's been smelling like it's gonna rain but it hasn't rained at all so it's kind of weird but whatever so right here guys one gram oh gee Kush Alpine live resin right here let's let's test that [ __ ] out oh the wait don't forget guys if you guys are eating over 21 in some states make sure you're smoking along let me know what you guys are smoking on comment it down below and let's get faded together boys Cheers this one hit so right away man this one hits quick hits quick guys I don't know it might be that's that's why I feel like that's why they call geez oh geez not only cuz you're their originators when it came and comes to eat but I feel like cuz this [ __ ] [ __ ] you up this she gets you it she hits you right away man this [ __ ] doesn't play any games man it has like a really like like a lemony like a lemony taste to a like when you hit it you feel you feel the lung expansion you feel your lungs expanding inside of you you feel the heat being trapped inside of your chest man you I like I'm naming a lie couldn't even keep it keep it in there like that long but [ __ ] man like I'm already faded I haven't gotten faded since I want to say twelve o'clock it's already about to be eight o'clock so I've been sober for a cool eight hours man like like I said guys this Alpine is [ __ ] good so make sure you guys go cop when I like cop [ __ ] I write this [ __ ] tenant attend to be honest man like I'm not even gonna do [ __ ] around and just say like oh this shit's good this [ __ ] that but man this no one no one does it better than Alpine ever I have yet to come across someone who has done it better than Alpine and the only thing that sucks man you could get the syringes too but I don't really see the syringes lasting you that long cuz the syringes are mostly for dabbing and refilling and honestly guys I don't recommend refilling your your these cartridges right here after you run out of oil I don't recommend going and getting another syringe and injecting it because the the coils inside of these they're not meant to last over and over they're meant to last so after one or two uses maybe but from my experience every single cartridge that I've tried refilling they all burn out after a couple hits after a while it doesn't taste as good as it should so in my opinion is just better to go with the brand new cartridge with the brand new flavor you know whatever the deal is I don't recommend getting a syringe because you do not get your money's worth it's the same amount as a brand new full gram so might as well just get the full gram and it's all about saving you know why waste why waste the same amount that you would that you would on a cartridge with with a syringe like it makes no sense so well that's another topic one quick topic I want to chop on today guys cartridges I've seen a lot of people commenting saying they have leakage issues saying they have this aim to have that and I want to make this video to basically like give you some tips on how to save and the wax from these like as much as long as possible so let's go let's get right into it number one would be try not to try not to let it go outside down try not to let the wax touch you this very top part because some wax I don't know if you guys see right here but so Mike's get stuck on top of that and it's it's [ __ ] hard to get it down like even if you try using a lighter it gets stuck up there I'm not sure exactly why but yeah that wastes like either your waste like point 1/2 of a point like you know [ __ ] like that but it's not too much but you definitely don't want to be losing any of this wax cuz it is expensive my bad guys it is expensive so and we don't want to waste any of that my second tip would be the most obvious tip that anybody should know anybody should know that B should be vaping this they should know not to leave it in the heat do not leave it in the heat I'm talking about like if you go to work and you take these with you and your skin you don't keep them in your pocket while you work or if you're at school you keep them in your car don't keep them in your car man don't keep them in your car cuz he shits will leak guys like they've leaked so many times on me I like I've wasted so much wax but yeah they leak from right here on the bottom and when especially when they're extremely high temperatures like they'll like that guys so definitely don't be leaving it in hot places don't really mean in your car don't be leaving it in your room if it's ha anywhere that could be like that can cause damage this don't leave it in there and then also don't don't leave them on the batteries or whatever battery you guys use whether it's like one of these or whether it's a [ __ ] Ave battery I don't recommend leaving it on there for too long because it does spill even though even though like it even if it's not in the heat it does spill sometimes so I don't recommend doing that the third tip I would have for you guys honesty the final tip would probably be moderation man moderation is a big key when it comes to these when it comes to these [ __ ] pens because I feel like I know a lot of people that go out there and they go throughout their whole day just hitting it hit after hit after hit after hit even after they're high and I don't even know if they realized that they're hiring up but like that [ __ ] kills your wack so fast look at this I've had this one full gram for almost four days almost four [ __ ] days and I'm still I'm still above half a gram I'm still above half a gram I'm chilling you guys have to e like you have to make sure when you guys are using these don't be up here [ __ ] hitting it like over and over men just try to [ __ ] get like you're high to to ghost in hell and you're [ __ ] good to ghost in hello guys if you guys didn't know that's supposedly a lot of people say that that's the fastest way you can get faded would be to just double ghost in hell if you guys don't know what that is I'll show you guys right now just for the purpose of the video just for educational purposes [ __ ] it we're about to get faded so here we go guys to ghost inhales these are what these are try to hold them in as long as possible if you want to get the most out of your wax try to hold them in as long as possible I'll make sure to make another video on how to get the most out of your product out of whether it's bud whether it's waxed whether it's edibles I mean I don't really [ __ ] with edible so I mean mostly just bud and wax but I'm gonna show you I'm gonna make a video you soon on this [ __ ] so here this is what a ghost inhale these guys right in the chest as long as possible that she can see feel like that I don't care how much of a tolerant you have I don't care how [ __ ] bad-ass you think you're to go she nails especially with some [ __ ] lie resident [ __ ] you up I'm very faded as [ __ ] yes can't really see I job something but yeah guys man I'm [ __ ] stoned as [ __ ] I'm gonna go to the gym right now stoned just [ __ ] I mean I do it everyday but whatever so I guess we're coming to the end of the video guys we're not gonna do a ha bucks like I said earlier in the video we'll get to that another time maybe next week we'll do a vape / a vape and vape hotbox vape and vape so we'll probably do that next week guys sorry for cutting you short but gotta get this workout in I hope you guys had a good day I hope you guys enjoy the content I hope you guys are enjoying all my [ __ ] that I'm coming out with I'm putting in effort guys if you guys recommend me doing some other [ __ ] let me know in the comments below and if you guys enjoyed the content make sure to leave a like make sure to leave a subscribe make sure to leave a comment you guys know I like interacting with you guys the people that leave comments and I interact with you as you guys already know man I like I like doing that [ __ ] I don't know why it's fun to me like interacting with people online like like it's kind of weird if you think about it interacting with someone like you don't even [ __ ] know how they look like and but whatever that's we're living in 2018 right so yeah guys I hope you guys had a good day make sure to hit that sub button and Cheers lates", "EdoUnJuENuQ": "I'm gonna meet up with John Dawson from kung-fu dates to make some custom flavors of hash oil but the guests can consume music bait pens this is what we call soil tool rental product and what we're doing here is instead of taking oil and putting it on a hot nail and ad average or digitally dabbing write this is the wave of the future well let's make some vape pen cartridges dude let's do it awesome I can't wait to mix and terpenes so give you some blanks all right so this is my blank right here Glo empty cartridge right and this is called a removable center post and urine and screw the top you find your favorite oil people go with some raw okay great I just want to fill it up to this line right here right sure okay so looks like that's almost up to the line there don't want to add terpenes what flavor do you want to do so let's try Wi-Fi OG yeah sounds good to me so for that amount of wallet you need such a small money like a half of a micro drop okay gotcha I'll just put a timer all right okay so I've got that in there and yeah so I could feel from this arrange that that wall was pretty warm so that'll mix up quickly and sure I'm already getting a crazy amount of aroma Wow yeah that's incredible so now I stick my plunger stick your plunger in you kind of move it around you're gonna tear that shirt and just push it down it screws into the bottom there we go how many hits of cannabis are in one of these so you figure when we're at a half you're looking at 500 milligrams of THC now 500 milligrams in the cartridge for average everyday users that'll last a week let me say this real go sit with epic hits man I mean the flavor on this is uh it's pretty epic yeah but like I said we're travelling around the city where we're going to and from this is how everybody's going to be consuming thank you so much for showing me this up I think it's gonna be a great complement to the dinner party absolutely [Music]", "r0an08pfcCY": "hey what's good everybody j ping here checking in respectmyregion.com here today to do a quick taste test review featuring the live resin cannabis oil from potter's cannabis here in california i'm excited to check this out because i actually haven't tried potter's cannabis in over a year it hasn't been since one of the first few hall of flowers events that i've tried their stuff this is labeled as a high potency live resin cannabis oil and then on the back it describes it as all natural whole plant extraction the way nature intended excuse me a tribe called potter's from the farm to your fingertips for the connoisseurs and the raccoon tours we wander the world on a soulful quest towards self exploration and elevation we connect material with spiritual and we believe in healthful healing we leave things better than we found them and we don't take shortcuts the journey is our destination join us and live higher all right so they definitely put some money into the branding that's for sure ingredients this is cool single source live resin extract terpenes derived 100 from cannabis high potency cannabis oil they are covering the bases y'all uh in terms of total cannabinoids 84.78 total cannabinoids we're looking at 80.25 percent chc 0.16 percent on the cbd 0.29 percent on the cbn 1.5 percent of the cbg a and then 1.08 on the cbg total terpenes also listed so the cvgs are listed and the total terpenes are listed four point five nine percent total terps terpenoline is at one point eight six mercene point five nine limonene point four nine so potter's is invested heavily into the terpene information the t the cbg information they've got this crazy poem basically on the back shout out to all those things now the one thing that does sketch me out a little bit is that the original sticker that's on this has different information listed on it there is a different sticker repackaged over it definitely leaves me a little to be conserved so other than that i am quite excited jungle spice is the strain you guys we've got a vessel vape battery over here big shout out to vessel uh how do we get this open ah all right here we go see if we can these these these labels sometimes man they kill me all right here we go so the packaging is tough it should be perforated edge it's not that kind of is troublesome to open for sure if a customer is gonna have difficulty getting into the item it just starts to decrease the chance that they're gonna buy it again and again this is difficult to get into and i don't like that why why is it so hard there we go all right you guys saw me trying to get into that having way too much trouble we finally got to the oil this is what we're looking at for the cart this is definitely looking like a disney car but we shall see it says high potency live resin we shall see i know a thing or two about live resin cards y'all all right here we go vessel one two three four five it's turned on one two three ah here we go we're on green this tastes like this tastes like distillate with fake terps i'm not even gonna lie jungle spice earthy and calming is what it's described and then the total terpenes on the back 1.86 on the trapinoline i don't know to me it's just not making sense the flavor profile with this trapinoline mercene and limonene and look at the color of that oil you do you see this gold this is insane is it live resin is it distillate i don't know do i need to do i need to pull out i guess you guys are gonna have to stay tuned in the description i'll let you guys know uh i'll i'll check out the coa that they have listed here with the qr code i'll see what happens when that comes up but i just want you guys to see this just so that way i can just 100 be transparent with you guys there are two different testing stickers on this one thing okay i just want you guys to see this i'm putting there are two different ones so the one that is on the outside layer okay the one that the one in this hand uh says 84.78 total cannabinoids um and 4.59 total terpenes the one on this which was the original sticker that's connected to the strain type says total cannabinoid 71.8 thc 66.45 but it says total terpenes 16 so it's just interesting to me what is it is it this one is it this one what's the issue um i don't know just a lot to really be desired uh in terms of that i am gonna hit it one more time and i'm gonna give my official score because if you took away this all that matters is the quality of the oil at the end of the day i don't know man this just tastes like dizzily with cannabis terps uh it does doesn't have that live resin uh type of vape hit i guess i've tried select i've tried prescott tried buddies i've tried stizzy i've tried alien labs this looks like dusty so potters let us know what's good comment below if you guys have tried the jungle spice cartridge let me know what your guys's thoughts please be sure to share your opinion if you want to go buy it yourself go visit mother nature's remedy in woodland hills show them some love make sure you follow them on instagram send them a dm and i will of course see you guys in the next taste test review but before we get out of here my taste test score for this is an 8.75 my official score on this is an 8 flat because i don't know what it is it looks like disney it tastes like disney it gets you high like cannabis terps but then you've got two different stickers over here on this packaging situation and so there's just a lot of questions going on i'll see you guys in the next review love you all peace", "5A6FVP904R8": "if you are not a cannabis patient or of age please click off of this video yo guys what is going on ethan here today we are going to be smoking and reviewing these wave cannabis carts so i already cut the tip off and i've already hit this one a lot as you can see but when they come they come with this hard thing to open so i didn't even know how to open this so i'm not gonna lie just kind of cut it off but we're gonna take a couple hits off this i've already hit it a lot as you can see but i'm going to tell you how i like it so let's go ahead and take a couple hits so the flavor i have right now is the um london pound cake so it is pretty good there is the website there and then the batch number and all that here so um it does give you a nice head high um i wouldn't take too many hits of this because it will get you a little too baked so i would say just a couple and you should be fine but this is how it comes wrapped i don't really know how to like unwrap it it says press in and then slide but it wasn't really working for me because i've never seen someone else open this so i don't really know how to open it but i'm going to go ahead and take a couple more hits and end off the video because just a little review but yeah there's a nice card this will be the last hit and i'll end it off the video so this is a nice cart let me know if you guys have seen them around i haven't seen too many around but if you have let me know and if you tried it let me know what you guys think about it but that's gonna be it for the video thank you for watching and this is ethan signing out peace [Music] you", "Y3vRyew74g4": "[Music] what's up Isaac Lucic here back with another new Intel entitled this is going to be another cartridge review and this is a pretty new company I've never heard of but this smell free cannabis company and they were kind enough to give me a voucher to purchase one of these for $2 and they actually let me try some of their stuff to they have live resin cartridges and they also have cured resin cartridges and her cured live resin cartridges mind you man from what I remember when they let me sample both of them I definitely remember that the cured lie breath and tasted so so good I believe this one's going to be there their live resin one another thing that they mentioned to me which was surprising was that that they're live resin cartridges also has distillate in here so I'm not too sure I mean I'm pretty sure they said that about that but I could be wrong so correct me if I'm wrong the free canvas company but we're gonna be using the pocket you guys already know I will have the link and the one description below if you guys are going to check that out this is a pretty expensive batteries so please check your other alternatives or other options before you finally decide on this because what I like does not mean you like it you know I'm saying I like it because it's a very I it's just a smooth sleek design and build it has a nice feel to it but it is pretty pricey so like I said please just uh know what you're getting into know what you're buying I'm checking all other alternatives because this channel is cool about cannabis content and all and stuff but it's also you know save you a few bucks let you know about the products and always trying to save you some money guys always at the end of the day money is how you gave [ __ ] so I'm trying to hit you I'm trying to help you guys get the best [ __ ] that you can possibly get but not to talking this is going to be strawberry [ __ ] guys very very good stuff [Music] yes I do in a car cut and yes this is the new bandana I'm actually washing the other one so like I got sick of the skull the skull is actually better than polka-dots only have this one because it's black and a black bandana is less is non-threatening at least the gang members you know if I wear a red bandana I could get a shot blue shot black maybe not so much you know so I'm going to open this by the percentage of THC is 86 percent guys you can see right here I'm going too fast and I am sorry right off the back they use the same as select you can see very similar to the select plastic kit from iceless leg and right that kind of smell strawberries so this could definitely be mixed distillate [Music] good yeah [Music] before I get into the review or talk about that hit you might be noticing a faint man noises because I got a fan outside the window so it mentally it's better my room has been getting hot lately it's just because there's probably a lot of electronics there's a lot of people in my room constantly so a fan that attaches to the window is pretty good and it's actually going outward so it's sucking all the hot air out and uh yeah getting into the cart it taste like strawberries not too much I can say about the flavor other than if it tastes like strawberries not too overly powerful you know I do it does fade away quickly just like this lid does you know you but this Li exhales you get that full flavor boat it goes away pretty quick I'm not sure if it's just this lip [Music] so free cannabis fun so like I said earlier there live present and then have cured live resin and their live resin is mixed look a little bit of distillate is what I remember them saying and let's be real like come on this is the way and it tastes like strawberry I mean like live resident tastes like strawberry there's got to be some sort of like terpenes or strawberry terpenes in there that they put in there you know that's definitely not from the plant that I feel like you know some people like the discreteness of oh this guy's just smoking strawberry vape or whatever you know but yes it is good but yes guys this is a legit company okay I actually went to come all the flowers and picked it up I will post their information right here also in the description below and I'd like to mention you know guys just be careful with the cartridges that you were smoking I've been smoking cartridges for a while and nothing has ever happened yeah I always buy cartridges from the dispensary never have I I mean I've tried a few but I don't really buy them like I've tried my homies he usually goes to the sessions and I'm not gonna like I've tried you didn't really like it but I've tried you know yes free cannabis company guys I really really am enjoying this cartridge I'm not gonna lie but you guys already know me I like that I like the cartridges that taste like so but like I said they're cured light resin has that taste so if you do see this company try their cured live recipe try both it does matter try them next to each other and you can actually tell the difference because that's what I did at the booth and yes hopefully you guys enjoyed this video this brand is not bad I don't know the pricing of this I actually have not seen this at my local dispensaries or on weed maps and malls are selling it pretty cheap at the Hall of flowers by a walrus it won't reflect what you're going to be seeing at the dispensary so I can tell you the price $20 for a program $15 $15 I believe it was $15 for the regular live resin cartridges this year and then $20 or the cured live resin but like I said these prices won't reflect what you will see at the dispensary but I am liking this definitely like the cured resin better but I'm not gonna clean about this one if you guys like strawberry taste water looting stuff I really really would recommend this we'll take one more and then [Music] [Music] and there's cloud Stephanie cloud but yeah other than that I'll see you guys [Music]", "t0TTu14UqeA": "how's it going YouTube keep chronic here with another cannabis related video today I'm going to talk about these select dabble products from select most people in legal states will be aware of what that is it's coming these nice little syringes here it's actually what the description is is a 100% activated THC and flavorful cannabis terpenes extracted from the very best Oregon grown cannabis so you get some pure distillate whatever percentage here we got some well this is some Purple Haze sativa eighty two point nine percent THC one point zero three percent CBD so what I'm gonna show you guys is you can just add these just squirt a little bit on a dab whatever it has these little caps it's just like that and it's one gram a distillate or one milliliter now what I'm gonna show you is what I do with them there are these nice little glass vials makes it very convenient for different things one being filling your own vape carts which I'll do a video on how to fill a fill your own vape cart with your own oils and since this has terpenes we can take whatever extract and go ahead and mix it in which in this case it's already mixed with some distillate to some advantage I don't like the distillate by itself it's almost flavorless that's why the terpenes are added so what I like to do is make a sauce and that's what this video is about is how to make your own sauce so what I like to do is you need a little bit of heat so here I have my email here within reach you can see that I got the coil right here and I got it on my normal but you just I just lightly heat the outside you can use a lighter if you need to and it makes it easier for the plunger to move around and you can get the oil to move around as well so anyway I want to pull it out so I'm gonna go ahead I want the oil to run towards the cap actually good its distillate in Terps so you don't want it to heat too much see it's already pretty much there you can see all the distillates there at the bottom that's not a full gram it's about half I've already mixed up some different sauces so I would use about a half to a grant a half of a beable with whatever percentage terpenes and distillates in there to a gram of your favorite extract in this case I have some nice Amsterdam Medi Terp sugar it's a nice orange color already and what I like to do is I just take my dabber after I heat this slightly at the top around this edge now it's it's glass it can take some heat it's actually scientific grade glass medical grade whatever and you know that it's gonna be alright I've heated these actually pretty hot make some different stuff up in these so I'm go ahead and stick the whole gram of concentrate into this vial you guys will view that just a little bit their stuffs pretty good it has almost like a obviously kind of an orange tangerine flavor it's nice to Teva so we got a purple haze sativa dabble which is probably just some type of distillate maybe it is extracted for Purple Haze mixed with some percentage of cannabis derived terpenes obviously for purple haze and it is a really flavorful one I've tried quite a few there different products from a granddaddy purp - pitbull banana tan jeez one I just recently had it was really interesting dogs you've just going off I can see this it's all solid still so you just slightly heated as you go Oh light heat is everything so you'll start melting into that distillate and the Terps I'm I'm really not sure if it's the terms that start breaking that stuff down or if it's the distillate you can see that a satisfying comes a sauce I just and I'll cram a whole gram of this stuff into it easy I mean I give it a little taste test first you can just have a little dab and squirt a little discipline on you'll know what it's going to taste like but man when you make a sauce it's just really versatile you take these little dabs of sauce so yeah I don't know maybe a third I'd say it's maybe a third of a gram of the distillate was left that I just added in here so to a hologram of a fresh gram of Amsterdam Medi here Terp sugar I go ahead and heat it around the brand get all that stuff below the brim so you know when you put your plunger back in there into your syringe you'll know you don't get no oil on the outside go ahead and heat the whole thing up just a little bit you really don't want to heat it up much you'll start losing those Terps try to show you guys that makes it just give it a little swirly there you see it become a sauce really it's it was pretty satisfying yeah it's good see that mr. saucy yeah you get a lot on the dabber but afterward that's just gonna be a nice little extra dab of the stuff man so yeah keep the sauce just kind of warm it'll it'll bond better that way just warming this vial the emails just optimal for this job of having these syringes and everything they just they get stuck with the oil and they don't want to move so you gotta heat the outside around where the plungers have to get it to move afterwards and that's just a tip for using these and you know it's a bit of a mess it's a bit of a process getting these filled but it's definitely a nice little thing to have if you're a dabber you you know a nice little dabba sauce in go about your day just a nice nice little product and it's it's dual purpose as a vape filler is just awesome for the vape cards so you'll have to check out my future video on that got a lot around the brim right now I'm gonna go ahead and melt it in looks like that was a pretty good consistency maybe a quarter or a third of a gram probably a third of a gram of the dab of wool - a gram of extract it makes a pretty thick sauce depending on what what cart you actually have if you're filling a vape cart that's going to depend on you some can be thick some some have to be thinner so you'll have to check with your manufacturer on that so I'm have to be really thin I know that and I want to do a product review on my favorite vape cart that I like to do so as you can see everything's coming along pretty well it's good to take another diver and go ahead and scrape any excess off you want to put in the syringe she's my finger now go ahead and just stick it on the edge of the thing melt it on in and and the distillate is just really tasty to have a little little taste that Purple Haze distillate it tastes I don't know I can't really explain it tastes like candy though that's all I could say these Dabba bulls are really good products I'm sure the price of berries in your area I get it for as low as you know $30 $35 and I've seen them as high as $72 you know it's depends on your dispensary and all of that so but select I think they definitely have a somewhat of an integrity their business it's a new way there you go that's the that's the sauce you can see it's kind of separating a little bit there at the top give it a little mix you know let's then give it that mix there you go ladies and gentlemen that is a nice delicious sauce good old sauce for you to dab on I'm telling you it it really is an experience compared to smoking the dabble bulls by itself I'm sure a lot of you've done that think you know well I just dab it right on well I don't know for me distal it doesn't have enough of a punch by itself I mean yeah you can just squirt a little bit on each dab but it's nice just to have this mixed up I'll show you a little trick May everybody might not know about them so come on sick the rest of this oil off the edge one little trick everybody might not know is you must flip it like this and let all that oil kind of settle before you can take that cap off and actually when you're putting the plunger in this is the hardest part you know put the plunger down and just let it run to the bottom let everything run to the bottom because you can't push up through the oil the cap on there's no air there so you have to hold it and this is just part of filling these things see all of the liquids gone down now you can it's kind of it's it's a process like I said go ahead and take the little cap off now you can just gently push down until your oil level gets pretty close to here you want to leave some air so you see it's bubbling you don't want to push any out when you fill in these left a little bit of room for error see we got the sauce before your hands are really sticking a little bit of distillate on there there you go that sauce is good to go that one's really fool it's a lot further than I normally make them that is a good sauce and yeah I have a little bit left on my dab take a little dabs a whole wafer everybody kind of the Green Goblin here hmm it's just citrus whose this is a carb cap - hmm very very tasty so yeah that's how you mix up the sauce from a select dabble bowl everybody and another little secret I'll show you for you divers out there you take this off if you want to just dab from the syringe and not just squirt a little bit on your dab we cater like this yeah just normally I'll just take a little squirt and squirt it on the dab locator got yourself a nice little dab there my tip but better yet and always pull back on the syringe after you're done using it or it'll automatically squirts them out that's that's how a suction works my friends pull back all the liquid comes back if it's pushed forward like you were just dabbing and you leave it forward it'll probably over time it was out the end so here you go see this little cap on the end the actual caps and then you got nice little glass tip to dab off I mean to squirt that right in there move it around your quarts no good to go thanks for watching everybody I'm gonna go ahead and enjoy myself a little bit more in this session thanks for watching keep on cryonics channel it always dabs ahoy everybody", "0EW65sp5ePg": "hey what's good everybody jpegming here checking in live respectmyregion.com here today with a west coast suite tour review featuring the cure companies diablo og one gram high potency thc distillate cartridge so we're looking at 98.22 total cannabinoids on this product 94 thc uh specifically 94.7 percent thc delta 9 at 94.66 so high potency high potency high potency that's what this product is all about superior quality cannabis goods i'll show you guys some of the packaging here it's cool black white logo got the extracts added in there to stand out diablo og is a classic og strain you can get some of the testing information there on the back we've got this pretty cool reflective superior quality cannabis goods thing there and a bunch of information on the back i'd like to see the genetics i'd like to see the terpenes but they're not listed it does say that the ingredients have 100 premium cannabis distillate extract so i do like that um are the terpenes botanical or the terpenes cannabis who knows how to use attached cartridge to 510 thread battery take three second draw exhale repeat as needed so today we're going to use the vessel battery i've got um it's set on the lowest temperature we're going to see if that's enough to get the distillate to fire up um child proof packaging is currently working on me though let me try to get this open ah there we go all right so check this out you guys beautiful got this white uh ceramic tip the glass window here to see the actual oil that we got clear rubber coverings and stoppers on the mouthpiece and on the coil down at the bottom where the connector meets the battery so i'll kind of show you guys this a little closer check that out it's a beautiful product i can't really smell anything through the tip it does have a little bit of red ringage going on the top so looks like the terpenes have definitely been doing a little bit of reacting but we shall see how this tastes you guys can see that color a little bit there at the top a little bit concerning so here we go one two three four five oh one two three four five turn the vessel back on beautiful there we go all right one two three here we go one hit review talk about it i'll do a second hit give you guys a score out of ten we're supposed to do baby let's go it rips it's smooth it tastes good i do love the branding of the car i love how the cure company put their logo on the actual glass of it i think that's super dope but taste wise it's pretty decent earthy sweet spicy not a little not too much pine there's some lavenderiness with some linalool in there for sure i enjoy it i enjoy it i'll need to do a second hit to see if it's really going to be at this 98 you know total cannabinoids i'm not super duper high right now um run it here we go again i'm tasting that little there's a nice soft lavenderiness to this got a little bit of pine on tiny bit on that last one but the most part just getting that earthiness just getting this spice tiny tiny tiny bit of floral pine and a lot a lot of lineal in there this lavender-ness and so i really enjoy it i am concerned about this ring at the top when you think about the packaging date it was back in it was manufactured in january 21 2020 the date of the packaging of this product so when they stuck the card into the packaging um what was it july 16 2020 so there's a clear difference that's that six months difference i don't know what happened here with this but definitely concerning [Music] you know cartridges are tricky um but i definitely feel like merchandising and making sure that you know the product quality stays consistent i feel like that's totally achievable but as you guys can see there is some really strong discoloration let me pull the sticker off here for you guys there is very much a strong discoloration um at the very top of all that distillate and so because of that i'm definitely gonna have to give them a score in the low you know uh between a five and a six to be honest i think the product quality when it comes to the flavor the high the way that it's branded and packaged and the high thc nature i think all that adds up to an experience that should be very good um but we definitely want to make sure that we're keeping people safe and or making sure that their questions are uneasiness uh those kinds of things are not you know taken care of and or these kind of problems are just non-existent so because of that and this specifically five to six out of ten super rough score but you know like i said uh just make sure you guys talk to the bartender always ask to see the packaging day always ask to see the harvest date for a lot of things that'll help you guys avoid getting product that might be bad expired or going bad or whatever it is so jfing here coming at you guys live man west coast week 2 review we keep it real we keep it honest it's not always great but it's good feedback so i love you guys i'll see y'all down the road 5.6 five to six five point six whatever y'all want to do out of ten care

respectmyregion.com here today with a quick taste test review featuring jazzasaurus butt tender from mother nature's remedy in woodland hills and the buddies brand cannabis distillate with cannabis derived terpenes vape cartridge so we'll be doing a review on this vape on the buddy's brand seesaw so today's strain is the three bears og this is an indica it's one that i personally am a fan i'm a fan of i've tried it in the live resin form i've tried it in the dab form but i have not tried it in the dissonance so i haven't tried this either um 91.98 total chem cannabinoids eighty-eight point fifty percent thc zero cbd and it has beta-mercing beta-carothylene [Music] we'll see okay i like these chirps i think i'm gonna like this one should be good three bears og pop it on open let's see what it's like buddy's distillate features the cso vape battery the seesaw hardware on the cartridge single source distillate and they do use cannabis derived terpenes which means that the terpenes comes from cannabis not some kind of all-natural or fruit or veggies or something like that three four second hit what are you tasting it was something sweet and earthy i don't know i really like it oh it does have that good like earthy og it's earthy sweet terps it's slightly sweet and it's smooth oh are you gonna get a turf sneeze no sneeze it's always good when the turkeys happen that's pretty cool that's a good idea potent flavor-wise you get a little bit of citrus on the end or kind of in the middle of hitting it on the inhale on the exhale you do get this sweet earthy oh genius i like it yeah i really enjoy this one 90 91.98 total cannabinoids this is considered hypodecy uh what are you thinking for a score out of 10 and why um 9.2 9.2 um i don't know i don't really get like a body height from this it's just i think it's a head high i think it's gonna become a creeper because og kush is always creepable creep on you a little bit if they don't hit you right away they're still going to get you higher still on their jeep um but i feel you it's really it's really earthy for me but i think someone who enjoys earthy will love this yeah there wasn't a lot of pine on it but there was definitely not like piney and sweets it's mercy so it's going to be more that sweet sour the caryophylline is going to be that slight earthy spiciness and then the osu moon is going to be again a little bit of citrus so i'm getting at least all those flavors which is nice manufactured on october 28th so it's still relatively fresh distillate the color is pretty beautiful i mean my score doesn't necessarily matter because i work with buddies but 9.2 from you 9.2 i feel is pretty solid i get it i'd give it somewhere around the same um this is the best strain i've ever had no but i feel like a lot of strains that taste the way that they're supposed to taste and they give you the high that people have said that they usually give you yeah whoever likes these turks is going to love this if you like oh geez this is going to be really solid for you it's probably going to be closer to a 10. i for one though marathon reviews my that's my favorite so i like the dream so i'm pretty basic i feel that i feel like well appreciate you guys for the love thank you jazzy for your review jpeg here coming at you guys live respect my region taste test review a whole new series dedicated to

being said this right here is some amazingly delicious hash rosin some really really good stuff i made it myself actually i'm gonna have a video coming out pretty soon about that whole thing holy crap my glasses are crooked there we go even more crooked um i must also apologize for the delay on how long it took me to just make episode two of this dab school um i got stoned on the first one and completely forgot yeah you don't believe that either do you okay uh would you believe i just got lazy and just didn't do it and i apologize but better late than never am i right so don't forget to like the video if you do enjoy this kind of content it lets me know whether or not i should continue to make content like this or not let me know in the comments below if you've got any opinions based on this video and i'm sure you do oh this right here is the brand new dab blaster uh it's got my face on it look at this i can't line it up very good somewhere around there anyway the other side has me beautiful bunny wife on it and i'll have a nice big fat dab of this at the end of the video so uh let's get on with the lesson and then we can get on with the uh the fun anyway roll it now before we get too deep into this rabbit hole i need to just cover the very very basics of what concentrates actually are now cannabis concentrates are just that concentrated cannabis when you smoke flour a bud a joint a bong rip whatever um you're getting between somewhere on an average between 15 and maybe 25 percent if you're smoking some really hyped flower um but that's your average there's a lot of that leaves you know between bad math here between 85 and like 70 odd per 75 percent um uh uh plant matter that you need to smoke to get to that 20 percent concentration of the cannabinoids that we're after now when you concentrate your cannabis into any of these new concentrates that i'm discussing here um you're looking at more of a 80 thc per volume ratio versus approximately of a 20 let's just round it down to 20 um so if that makes some sense concentrations are getting upwards to 80 to near you know you can get isolates up to 99 isolated uh cannabinoids but 80 is a good sort of discussion point here now that the stoned numbers are out of the way uh let's get into the other side okay if we're going to get into the proper definitions of what extracts are we kind of need to talk about their history for a quick second and where well extracts actually began um a good portion of why we have extractions period is just through the sheer need to minimize the amount and more concentrate hence the name concentrate our cannabis and just get a better stronger stone as well as advancing medical uses of course now the modern form of like dabs and rosin and stuff has only really been in the the limelight if you will for the last maybe 10 years or so give or take now we've had oil that dates back uh into the 70s we've had hash and hash oils uh as late as the 70s and then going back even further than that we've got hashes just straight up hash and and and what do they call um uh cheris cheris i believe um it was more of a hand pressed hash from way back way back but realistically here today when we're talking about dabs we're mostly talking about solvent-based concentrates uh as opposed to the more non-solvent-based concentrates and actually there is some crossover when it gets into the hash rosin it's almost the same thing rosin um is kind of in the same category of smoking however it's a well solvent-less you know one one this whole category uses solvents such as butane propane um even uh h2o h2o and innovation h2o oh come on sitting here after the fact editing it uh i meant obviously co2 anyway and uh innovation is constantly finding new ways to extract concentrates whether it be solvent-less or solvent-based or new types of things i can at least discuss the basics here with you today and categorize and make hopefully make some sense out of the different categories of extractions here and make it a little more clear so i am going to start however with the non-solvent-based concentrates and we're just sort of going to go through the basics here um first off there's like keefe you all know keefe uh it comes out of uh the bottom of your bud buster um it comes out of uh uh your trim trays etc um now you can press this into homemade hash um there's also straight up normal hash that's been made for probably hundreds and hundreds of years i don't actually know how long this has been around for but it's been around for a while um and then there's uh cheris i'm probably saying this wrong but from what i understand this is a basically a fresh hash that is pressed from pushing uh sticky live plant matter together a lot of harvesters will like um bat it uh bat fresh buds against their hands and then scrape off their hands and uh it's kind of kind of gross a little bit but it's a it's a method of concentrates anyway moving on uh we have the modern a little bit more modern bubble hash and this is a really pure clean way to wash your weed it's really good for washing outdoor weed that might have uh pollen or other you know tree particulates and stuff from just you know nature floating around in the air uh it helps wash some of that out um and then here's where the crossover happens if you take a rosin press and press bubble hash or keef you can get rosin uh hash rosin pardon me and hash rosin is borderline shatter it is very similar in uh consistencies to the shatters the waxes crumbles butters etc um but that's a whole different story like i said these are non-solvent-based these are water or uh uh just natural condensing methods for concentration okay now you got to bear with me a little bit if i say things a little strangely you got to remember i just had a big fat dab before i started doing this so uh i'm trying my best to be clear and concise considering how high i truly am moving on so now we're going to talk about solvent based concentrates now obviously these are extracted using solvents such as uh butane or propane or a co2 um there's a few methods like i was saying there's lots of new methods being developed constantly i'm not privy to all of them but i'm going to talk about what is the industry standard for the time of making this video um first off the on the list here let's talk about the most popular the most common shatter now shatter is kind of an umbrella term that really kind of covers a lot of these things most people just call everything kind of shatter or uh or like a butter or wax or something and that just sort of encompasses everything i'm about to talk about but for specifics shatter shatter is generally made with a butane or a propane and is sort of the industry standard like i said when it comes to this kind of a concentrate um it's sort of well known by its glassy type texture that when you bend it it kind of shatters um and that's sort of where it comes from realistically if you want to know what shatter is in a really really dummy kind of uh term maybe not dummy term but layman's term let's say um shatter is extremely clean cannabis oil that's really all this is all of these things are extremely clean cannabis oils when it comes to the solvent based now next we have wax now i'm actually gonna lump butter butter wax all into kind of one category because if i'm not mistaken it's kind of the same thing and it's just sort of the matter of dialect um anyway let's move on uh wax butter whatever um is basically the result of making butane hash oil or propane hash oil bho or pho but not d-waxing your material um and d-waxing is a long story but it basically means separating the fats and the waxes that surround the cannabinoids from well the cannabinoids it's one more filtration step when you don't do this you leave sort of a fattier richer creamier material when you take away all of this uh fats and waxes and stuff you're left with a cleaner material that tends to lean far more towards a shatter another telltale consideration when making butters and waxes is generally this is whipped like like honestly like with a whisk or something like that and because air is whipped into it you get micro bubbles and it just kind of creates a different consistency at least that's one of the ways from what i understand how you make butter um as far as smoking purposes it actually smokes very similar to shatter um maybe leaves a little tiny bit more residue into your uh nail or or like banger dab bowl whatever you're using receptacle system to freaking smoke it with um it can leave a little bit of residue uh compared to shatter just due to the fact that it's not quite as clean but it tends to have a little more flavor now crumbles uh sugar crumbles and things like that are actually kind of uh the same process again it's very similar to your original shatter one of the things that can happen from what i understand again is depending on the terpene value if it's got a high terpene cannabis that you're using sometimes it's hard to really stabilize that into a shatter again i could be kind of wrong on this one so uh i hate to be teaching you wrong but that's my understanding of uh what a crumble is is it's just a terpene rich shatter that won't quite stabilize part way between a crystalline uh format and more of a sauce format sort of right in the middle now live resin is another really good one but requires a lot more process um a lot of these start getting pretty complicated from here on uh live resin is basically the process of flash freezing live material generally within hours or less of being cut down from your medium like soil or hydro or whatever when you cut it down it is immediately going to start to die so they immediately flash freeze it and use a subzero we're talking like 60 below temperatures uh to freeze the water molecules in the plant solid so that when you're using a solvent-based extraction this is the solvent section um the cannabinoids and stuff can be dissolved into the cold uh solvents that won't freeze at these temperatures whereas all the waters will freeze so you can separate the cannabinoids from the wet weed because it's fresh and in doing so you preserve that amazing fresh smell you know how if you've ever grown weed you know when you first cut it down it smells so good and you wish you could taste that well that's what live resin is you can taste it with live resin but it's kind of a complicated process and you need like you know liquid nitrogen or dry ice and some specifics other things that i'm not going to get into here to do it but uh that is the basics of what live resin is and let me tell you if you ever get a chance to try some do it now next is diamonds diamonds diamonds well what the heck are thc diamonds [ __ ] man they're pretty weird looking things um honestly they're a bit of a fad if you ask me i think they're not really as awesome as people make them out to be um however let's discuss what they really are basically uh thc diamonds are when you take a very high quality concentrate and uh basically through using a variety of methods that i'm not gonna get into because i don't fully understand them look up jar tech and some other things uh but basically you crash the thc into itself where it concentrates and starts to form crystals within the the sauce that you were using um it's a big long drawn out process there's a lot more to it than that and i honestly don't understand much of it very clearly so i'm just more talking about what it is basically it is a true diamond is sort of thc a in a pure format that has been separated from most of the terpenes and other things which is why it sort of crystallizes into a rock salt looking chunk of what they call diamonds um again i don't understand diamonds thoroughly enough to really get too deep down this rabbit hole i just wanted to sort of cover what they were they're also some of the strongest uh form of cannabis concentrate that you can possibly smoke so uh be warned okay and as we're saying here we got s f e or a co2 extraction this is quite commonly one of the ones that is used for a lot of the vape cartridges that people are smoking these days those pre-disposable vape cartridges and stuff quite often these are uh full of co2 extraction hash oil um now i got to be 100 honest this is a really complicated one this is one that's very difficult to explain um it's on par with making diamonds as far as some you know discussion complication and i just don't know enough about it to talk very clearly about it but know this it is a cleaner uh form of extraction it is still considered a solvent even though it's not considered like a gas solvent it's co2 it is literally a what they call supercritical co2 which uh uh again i don't want to get into this um but um mostly because i don't know what i'm talking about but know that this is a considered clean method of extraction or at least a cleaner method of extraction than uh the butanes and propanes now finally we get into all the weird acronyms now i'm talking about hittissophy and jessifiki or however you pronounce these things h-t-f-s-e and h-c-f-s-e um what the heck are these things well high terpene and or high cannabi cannabinoid full spectrum extracts now if i'm not entirely mistaken which i have been in the past but these are basically a combination of the previous mentioned uh uh diamonds and terp sauce that has both been kind of mashed back together so this is almost a combination of the diamonds with the sauce been mashed back together so you actually get the full spectrum again and that's where i believe the full spectrum comes um again i could be wrong please let me know in the comments below if i'm missing some major uh acronyms here or if i'm uh if i missed a whole type of concentrate for that matter let me know because all of the new methods and things that are being developed are only going to get better and cleaner as science and research start start to catch up with all of the years of uh uh uh years and years of suppression that have been uh uh uh just well the weed's been suppressed what do you want me to say uh we've been told that it was bad for us for so long and it's not so cannabinoids are our oyster now and we're just starting to discover them there's some serious magic to be had in pairing certain terpenes with certain cannabinoids and when we get into concentrations we can really start separating the things that truly matter away from the things that don't matter like the pulp of the plant we just don't need that anymore uh you don't need to smoke 80 plant matter to get stoned anymore folks times are a change and i swear and there we go that's at least the basics of what cannabis concentrates are in their plethora of formats um i know i've got some of them a little bit wrong um and uh uh uh there's probably a lot that i've neglected or just certain things that maybe i didn't mention that you think that is important uh if you would like me to cover this any of these topics deeper in higher uh uh concentration unattended um let me know in the comments below and i'll see what i can do about it hopefully it won't take me a year to make this next video anyway if you like this dab blaster concept

in respectmyregion.com here today to do a quick taste test pre-roll review featuring the cure company and their 100 premium cannabis pre-rolls lifts so today's string is going to be the cure lotto this is a strain that we've reviewed in flower form as part of the west coast we tour was actually one of the top strains and top products on the entire west coast today's batch comes in hot at 23.46 on the thc not exactly high thc but terpenes and gelato and curato are always pretty high so good flavors pretty much guaranteed total cannabinoids at 27.2 percent cbd at .05 this was harvested and cultivated on january 29th packaged on february 17th so this is very fresh so the cool thing with these packs is that it has instructions on the back as to how to open this is considered a hybrid pre-roll the ingredients is rolling papers and premium california indoor grown cannabis so in terms of opening the packaging you've got a button right here on the back you're going to push that take the top i'm sorry the bottom right part right here and push it forward and then you're gonna pull it back out just like that so this pack normally has five pre-rolls been sharing them around with the friends to get their perspective and overall the feedback from the roommate the girlfriend a couple other homies that came through is that the the pre-rolls just don't taste as good um as the flower but that's to be expected you know a lot of companies are using many buds smaller buds lower thc buds than the tops of the plants so we shall put it to the test one hit talk about it two hits score out of the ten three hits score out of a hundred let's go you all know the rules man one hit two hits three hits scores let's go show you guys the joint future roll of paper there first hit mainly tasted like piney sweet weed and then the harshness from the paper i don't know if that's a good sign or a bad sign about the paper but it is what it is here we go here we go first it got me hot we got special guest over here mr shangul he's the compound kitty he's over here wandering for breakfast oh wow all right that second and third hit was really good you guys can see a little bit of that ash color there not exactly white but definitely darker i'm sorry lighter gray almost to the white with a little bit of darkness in there uh could be from the paper could be from some organic plant matter again when you're working with littles it's it's kind of tough there's a lighter color when i think of a taste test score this is going to be this is going to be an 8 point this is going to be room 8.5 you definitely get the pineness you get the gelato taste but it's just not as good as the flower form and so if i had to pick between the flower pack or the eighth definitely gonna go with the flower uh i'm sorry if i if i want to go with the lifts pack versus the flower i'm gonna go with the cure lotto flower um but if i'm gonna go to an event or go to a party i definitely have no problem buying these lips and pulling them out and sharing them they taste great people would enjoy this is it the best joint in the market no is it the best joint pack in the market let's say it's a top ten the strain of cure lotto makes this a top 10 joint experience overall i do enjoy the packaging i love the the uh the information the little directions on the back packaging can sometimes be kind of difficult to use and confusing there's five servings in this the directions include remove pre-roll from packaging light inhale deeply then exhale effects may be felt immediately and vary per user new users should start with one two three puffs and increase as needed so you know i really enjoyed that they put all that information on there the little directions i all i'm really missing in terms of the overall experience is the terpene profile um and i don't know maybe that's that's really about it i guess a qr code for test results could be could be crucial um and because of that i'm going to give this pre-roll pack a 90 out of 100. i think that the overall taste could be better if you think they could stick some better colorado flower in here but i'm only saying that because i've smoked so much cure lotto i've smoked so much marathon og that i know what the best of the best looks like from the cure company and so 8.5 on the taste test 90 out of 100 overall and when it comes to the would you recommend i would give this a 95 out of 100 on the would you recommend mainly because it's a pre-roll pack you're going to be able to share with other people it's going to give you some of the best flour in cali and price point wise at city compassionate caregivers it is a great deal 20 off typically first time patient discount so be sure to tap in let me know what you guys think

teletv on youtube and uh me black underscore along we got plenty of content for you guys uh as well as the florida uh florida dab crew which we'll get into later yeah we'll talk about it but today we have a delicious variety of live rosins we brought the terps yeah we're gonna have a couple different reviews going on this week a lot of them is gonna be just one plant though uh yeah we're really hitting on the one plant because um we've already reviewed a little bit of one plate but we we've become more accustomed to the fact that one plane kicks everybody's ass especially in the extract game man game is hard we're going to start this week off with one of i think one of the best live browsers we've ever had uh honestly and that is the mac one agreed highly i started mac one right here and i just knew that was the first one we rolled that one is it most definitely the [ __ ] tell them what mac one is uh mac one if you don't know it's miracle alien cookies uh the genetics behind that is the alien cookies f2 and miracle 15. um so that's super dope sounds great i've never had a miracle 15 but i have had alien cookies before yeah i've never had alien cookies f2 f2 by the way is just when like uh the f1 genetics like of a plant itself pollinates so it creates an f2 genetic pretty much like really yes good to know i didn't know that yeah but um the we've tried alien breath as well which was uh an alien og mixed with that one peanut butter breath by itself is delicious it doesn't i wouldn't really call it peanut buttery but it's got something you know it's like a nutty flavor a little bit of sweetness in your mouth how about that all right thank you let's move on to what we got man show them a picture of what we're working with um we gotta show them the multiple stages yeah how this works here's the fresh press first of all when you first get it beautiful stuff nice and clear you see it's wonderful yeah i know it's got those little bubbles in it it almost looks like super glue to me oh like yeah hot glue yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what i thought too i was like this kind of hot glue and then um once you cold cure it doesn't it doesn't change color after a few days of cold for me it always just goes straight white or some of the strands go a little bit more yellow but it looks as i held mine in the fridge mine stayed clear but as soon as i left mine out it did what they call i guess oxidizing which we've talked about before we got picture that right yep right here and that's what happened to it so i mean not a bad thing on the part where it does oxidize it becomes a little harder to work with it's not as taffy anymore like so when you go to dig in it you kind of gotta you know cut it and then pick up these kind of like crumble or i don't know you know it's kind of like cool it's just like a butter more like yeah like you pick up your little chunk and it's real real crumbly like you know when you pick it up so like but a little bit softer than crumble you know a little bit softer than crumble of course but dude this stuff is super gas uh i've already smoked pretty much a whole gram of it me too i had three of them yeah me and dj both went and got uh the whole five deal where you spend more than 500 and you get 35 percent off yeah it makes like 340 125 for uh five grams of eyebrows and so that's so that makes each about 67 dollars yep six seven eighty three seven eight sixty eight that's gonna round up but uh we're about to get down on this man by the way if you guys have stuck around and stayed subscribed the whole time we haven't been making videos we really really support we help we love the support and we appreciate you guys sticking around yeah sorry for the sorry for the delay and content guys you know life happens man and we're really glad y'all stuck around um we got plenty more coming so you know yeah just keep tuning in dude don't forget to go check out that instagram um i want to tell them about our other uh [ __ ] yeah man um we love thc we always push thc but some people like hemp and cbd we do now have a very needed i use cbd for my uh treat my um epilepsy exactly and uh we're not big fans of hemp bud but this company that we're about to mention that actually came to us and wanted to help promote has this delicious cbd isolate and uh plenty other tinctures and all kinds of stuff but that is industrial hemp farms um and they're pretty good i've ordered from before i got like a half pound of blood from them and uh it was pretty good for some for some hint bud um i i'm not gonna knock it i even and i hit the ball on the low end and it was good it treated my symptoms like i needed um i pressed some remember and we made some uh yeah we had that from yeah and we had that and that was good um and then they came to us with this and so i guess we're gonna be trying some of their products as well so if y'all have any questions on some somewhere to get him products we're thinking this is gonna be one of the best ones so far we also have a discount code um the discounts uh vary depending on what type of products you're getting or the amount of your cart uh but if you do want a link for cheaper cbd or hemp products please hit us up in the comments section or like in the dms definitely the dms on instagram or gmail like for the discount um we just don't want to put it in the description or the comments below because they banned other people uh aka harvard 420 for things that seem very similar to you know for posting the same links and we would hate to you know have to rebuild as well yeah by the way if you guys do rock on uh hurban 420 by the way please go check him out give him a subscribe yeah if you don't mean already i don't know what you're doing here i have to give this uh a little mention too if you guys do have youtube channels vape links uh anything to like vaporizers anything like that that will get you instantly cut off youtube man i'll get you [ __ ] up yeah yeah we're man we were going to post links too to a bunch of [ __ ] and we were and that happened and we were like whoa yeah we had a bunch of promotions that we actually couldn't even use yes but it happens so i got this mini now hooked up dj's all torched up we're good to go yeah one man turns down yes sir it's like i had that [ __ ] in my back pocket or something took so long to get the cats damn turf's down for sure bro dude i want a lord man it's good to the last drop too man you can reheat like i'm about to do right now and it still keeps the tart man just make sure not to burn sugar it has such a pungent like sour flavor pungent yet prominent like it's a very specific taste and very satisfying i can't even classify this sweet piney or i was like i would say it's like a sweet enjoyable virtue sweet maybe sweet sour because it kind of bounces back it has like a earthy sweet taste but a little bit like a bite to it and i love it right i don't even know how to explain it tastes so good you know i mean it's just a there's a multitude of good and almost no bad there is a little bit of like a little bit of that kick you know kind of like um like a peppery taste but oh we kind of had that you know i mean it's nothing to really worry about but it's worth mentioning one of my favorite effects of this mac one too you ever have those dabs where you hit them and they [ __ ] close your eyes and they're you're just like sitting there like oh this is this is good it's like this just got interesting i love that yeah me too and this one hits the eyelids you hit the eyelids immediately like i'm feeling it already yeah that was my first dab move like a while and you don't have to take fat globs to fill the effects that's the best part right i took kind of a fat one and that one but a fat one on that one but it doesn't take much stuff's really good yeah and it's in a 68.5 percent yep 68.5 all right but um overall this is this is definitely 10 out of 10 when it comes out to a lot of rosins um you can't get much better and you can't change my mind on it like it's just good [ __ ] yeah and now that we've actually been able to acquire mpx uh and every other live rosin that is available in florida we have to say this is by far the best probably number one uh i'd say probably because we still have more there's some mpx we haven't had that we we believe may touch that level you know that's above this and that that's definitely coming in on the on the what we hear on the quest we also haven't tried um in the silicon valley i heard that this jam that one plant has coming out man the different strains that they have it is it's live resin jam it is amazing we're going to have a review on the fish whistle coming up as well um yep we got the job oh i'm about to have some jam then [ __ ] yeah all right sorry don't cut us off youtube hell yeah man dude [ __ ] you anyways man tonight gen product go to your local most definitely and i highly recommend you buying in bulk buy in bulk it's i know 300 something no it's hard to fork up you know i'm one of them guys but think about it i'm telling you every time you made five trips there for a gram and spent a hundred and freaking 24 or 525 dollars i mean yeah that's very true but um for those people that you know have to have a uh certain you know they have their budget for marijuana i feel like if you invest this this will last you weeks how about five grand left me two weeks thing never happened yeah as i'm saying usually this is from two weeks ago any other extract i would say like even shattered crumble i could smoke a gram of day i will smoke a gram today of shatter i've had these two grams for about four or five days high as [ __ ] this mac one's got me sweating let's get the [ __

introduce overlay i'd like to introduce luke that's luke he is the ceo of owls and me i'm steve and we're here today to talk about fake carts when i was discussing this with you and just like fillers and anything to do with like you know make fake and you were but you you had a pretty good uh question to me you're like what do you mean what's a fake what's a fake card like a card like a cart that doesn't have anything in it you know what i use hot dog water yeah hot dog water so i mean that's a good question right so what exactly is fake so i suppose i'm i i suppose what i'm doing is i'm putting together fake bootlegged whatever because you said bootlegged is more like hey we're pretending that this is like an hour's product are we getting black ops yet i know we won't get knocked off that's that's something that's the beauty of ours because of this because of these labels here it's actually impossible no one can knock our stuff off and also it just takes too much work it's too much work like everyone they have to order everything they have to it's not something they can just do overnight at all and they have the etching on the carps and it's just like but what kind of business model is it to say i'm going to go into the fake cart business you know there's lower overhead because you don't have to pay for product you just send fake cards so well yeah i mean there's definitely money in it well i've been hearing already about fake cards for a few of the different brands and uh it's going to contain something well it does right so but i think okay so first things first what exactly is a fake card or a bootleg card so basically that is a cartridge that is not actually made by the the manufacturer right so it rather than it being like hey our carts cost this price because we've got all these employees staff marketing all the work that we put in for years this is what it is someone comes in and goes well damn i can order this packaging from china and i can do this other stuff here and i can just basically piggyback on these guys without putting in half to work and i can give a subpar product and uh i know i know the difference and so i can collect all the money now how do you spot a fake well first things first is always look to the test results uh test results is always first a telltale sign uh are the test results uh when you scan the qr code does it have the company name does it or does it have a different company's name does it have uh how many tests does that have as well if you see something like a 99 it's just [ __ ] i mean it's just they don't i it might not be fake but it's it's [ __ ] uh wait let's stop here we've already done a video on this i don't want to get into it again uh but basically there's no real 99 cards out there because you would have to you always put in terps stardudas it's not possible but anyway um so typically you you the colors are off the colors are off um the oil is off i mean you can look at a cartridge and they'll have a similar looking cartridge but what will happen is is that uh you know you'll see the oil inside and the bubble will move and if the bubble's moving it's typically being cut right again save cost say put a little bit of mct oil in there that used to be the thing in the day that people would when i get when we started with carts i mean pg and vg vegetable glycerin and propylene glycol were standard they were standard and i mean now even on the nicotine side i know that people uh still regularly use propane glycol with nicotine or vegetable glycerin or peg400 and uh i just want everyone to know that we actually had a customer that asked us like hey what exactly is this in the cartridge right they didn't it's so distal distal is in the cartridge and terpenes that's it we've never any fillers there's no no other crap in there another thing you'll see with the fake hearts too was i remember the whole scandal with all the vapes and everyone's getting sick because everyone was cutting their stuff with vitamin e acetate and vitamin e was basically looked the same your oil would be hard so the bubble didn't move and then people were just vaping junk and that's the other thing that's scary is like if you buy a product that you don't know uh where it came from or for instance somebody calls up a store they say hey i'm with owls they're going to send you some for free you want to place an order and then they end up getting subpar products there's no regulation around it right because it's fake and so you don't know what you're getting in there and especially it's not like you're buying a fake bag right you're buying something that you're going to ingest and put in your body so the last thing you want to do is to buy a product that is is not from a reputable distributor or wholesaler so i think the advice would really be to only buy from like us either direct from the store or make sure that your brands either have some way to tell you how to differentiate yours from others that's why it is to make sure you buy your product from your store yes i know it's also to wait lives it's also to where to live people who i know yes and no i mean that's not really the main thing the main thing is they want all the money i i i think it would actually be better if er taking away from the vape that you could actually just order cards directly from the the provider and know that they're legit i mean i don't really know how you tell if you go into a store and someone has like a product unless they said and i'm not trying to to their own horn here but unless it's owls you know exactly what it is there's literally no one else that even has any sort of tracking information on their products there's no way to differentiate any of them so i don't really know what other people do i mean yeah i don't i don't really know but uh there's definitely a bunch of fakes going out there and it's just important to always stay safe and that's why i like i like the amount of work that we put into our products this is the reason i'm here if you look we remember when i was working with the testing lab that's why i met you you kept doing all this testing i said this dude's legit he's legit he does more testing than anybody i know on his products well thank you thank you steve i'm impressed and that's and naturally and i think you look at the ingredients right because it comes from the start to finish right it's like like if you have good ingredients it means you have a good product made you care but that doesn't really correlate back to fake products at all so it was i went a little off there but overall i think look the most important thing here is this is that there is a bunch of fake products out there i'll tell you this delta nine on the delta nine side there's just like oh my goodness like if you have any of your friends and i know the people you at home you have you know people trying to sell a cookie's car all that stuff is absolutely a joke any black market stuff any carts black market i mean no testing it's junk i would not believe a thing i would not touch a black market card i mean if you could get a delta eight card why would you ever buy a black market brand again really i like i i i don't really know why you would take the risk when you could just buy it uh a delta a cars in general but um that's really all i gotta say on on our carts on on fake carts in general uh just be careful out there there's so many shysters and uh make sure that you either reach out to your provider and ask them always ask for owls or yeah just save yourself a hassle just ask for owls instead and just know you're no you're good and look for the testing look for the testing scan the qr code be safe everyone adios and what is a fake card i think it's good it's not fake it's not fake it's a guitar branding oh it's no brand it's a bootleg it's a bootleg and then i suppose fake", "ittK3XCDMTw": "what's up you guys it's alyssa here for another video on the king cali channel today and we are going to go ahead and try another gram of rosin by callia [Music] i think it tastes like weed [Music] thanks for watching guys this is a live rosin here so i've kept this in the freezer at home i have it on an ice pack here because i'm visiting lizzy and jesse today i kept it in a little ice pack bag today so that way i could come down here and now i've had it out for a few minutes i'll open up the gram here we're gonna go ahead and use the popco this isn't the pro this is the original um puffco but the tropical rainbow colored one and we're gonna go ahead and use this one just because i didn't have the other one with me this one we're gonna go ahead open brand new now if you look this is ice cream cake this is beautiful i personally love the strain ice cream cake in flower and almost in basically almost any form of cannabis that has been coming and i love the live rosin smell because it's going to come off super sweet inside the dab here i'll give you guys a little info as well on the ice cream cake as i usually do in my videos now for thc it comes in at 69.5 activated chc it comes in really high at 78.84 it has 0.25 cbd and 84.18 cvs let's go ahead and open this up for the first time on camera here and try this out all right it's super pretty super beautiful [Music] oh this is gonna be good let's smell it when you smell it it has a really strong strong cake smell to it just really strong there oh super sweet are you guys our other friends are coming over so i'm trying to film this little video real quick i'm gonna go ahead and get into this who's making some sound we have some puppies in the background now i got this new dab tool i ordered it from gypsy stixx online on instagram it's super cute i did a little post on instagram of it if you want to see it a little more up close there's some rhinestones up here um there's a pointy side and then a little flatter side i personally for rosin do like the flat flat edge side which i'll show you guys on another dab tool i have here oh this one's going to be a little dirty but um this dab tool is a little flatter on the bottom i'm kind of like how a flathead screwdriver would be but a little thinner than that that's really usually nice for rosin and we really hate to break this up but we're going to go ahead and try it so that way we can take a dab of it in the puffco okay i was worried if it would come out too much like a shatter and just break but it doesn't it came out really smooth we're going to get a little bit bigger of a dab here and we're going to go ahead and see i can just get this straight onto the puffco right here perfect now the puffco hasn't been warmed up i haven't taken any dabs just so that i could do this dab and not worry about it melting on me as i put in the puffco and let's go ahead and set the puffco up here we're on white i'm gonna double click it so it heats up and it vibrates we're gonna let it vibrate again because this one is pink at the bottom and i have like pink accents on it it does make it kind of look pink when it lights up but it's not like the puffco pro that lizzie's here watching me film it's not like the puff gopro where i have it set up where it actually lights up pink which i think is my favorite thing but i do have it all set up here it's cute it's little we have the pink accents what more could you ask for let's go ahead and try out this ice cream cake it vibrated it's ready to go what that's really good okay at first i didn't know if i would cop or not i think man third try i'm gonna cough it's gonna make me cough um i really like this this ice cream cake is strong the aftertaste of it is really super strong you really taste the ice cream cake there it's a really strong sweet cakey flavor tastes a little cloudy and i really like that kind of just tastes like i said i like ice cream cake i like gelatos um i like wedding cakes and all that that's something that i personally prefer so i really do like the flavor of this i think that ice cream cake is really nice as well um and yeah so thank you guys so much for watching this is just a quick little video i wanted to do a review as far as the high i get from it you do instantly kind of feel like a nice little head height especially when you use it on a piece if you have it um set to go a little hotter or if you use it through a piece of glass you're going to feel like an instant kind of little headbrush from it but it's nice because it does mellow out it does smooth out it is something that um you will make you feel high for me personally when i take a dab for the next hour or two i'll feel like the main major high of it and then it'll die down um not like a blunt where it can be super instant and then it goes away or an edible where it hits you like an hour later and just stays there i thank you guys so much for watching this video if you have any questions i'll link my social media down below and thank you guys for watching this video alyssa is out bye guys", "F438gDUlCWU": "[Music] while dabbing cannabis concentrates does certainly give you the biggest bang for your buck accurately judging how large of a dollop you should dab or how much chatter you should share off remains an ongoing issue and will be the stoner whose jar of bubble hash opens in their bag or whose vape oil canister breaks in their pocket luckily Portland's Iowa vapor has devised a really clever solution NAB taps each of these little ceramic pellets is infused with 50 milligrams of cannabis concentrate they won't break leak sweat or spill their THC rich contents and they're extremely easy to use simply drop a tab onto your dab Briggs nail or set it in the heating crucible of your preferred vaporizer and heat it up as until it warms the concentrate trapped inside will slowly boil off for you to inhale and since each tab contains five standard doses you'll have enough for a full session in each if not just add another tab plus while the pellets released their THC cargo they visibly char and pit making it easy to judge how many draws you have left before they're fully spent the real genius of DAB cabs is their portability and versatility they're functionally inert until you heat them up so there is effectively zero risk of them spilling or leaking what's more they can be used in any vaporizer that accepts loose-leaf or wax based concentrates during my testing the tabs work smoothly with the puff coke peak the Storz and Bickel mighty the PAX 3 and the vape exhale cloud Evo heck you can even put it in your pipe and smoke it if you're off in mind I especially appreciated that I could start and stop sessions at will without repercussion with conventional rigs if you inadvertently use more oil than you meant to or have a bigger hunk of hash than you can handle your stock muscling through the bowl until it's either cashed or you're left to stone a useless heap on the couch both dab tabs which can be subjected to repeated heating and cooling cycles without any noticeable change of taste in the vapor you can set the pipe down and back up off it at your convenience this combined with the tabs set 50-milligram can ability all contents makes monitoring and managing your dosage a far more simple affair than with existing concentrates the rule of what you scrape is what you vape thankfully no longer apply though they're quite handy dab tabs are not perfect for one you're gonna have a heck of a time trying to find them before next February ILO is partnering with local concentrate suppliers and it's soft launched at select dispensaries throughout Oregon they hope to expand distribution to California Nevada and Maryland early next year what's more since the infusion process requires extra labor and materials expect to pay a premium on top of what you normally would for that gram of hash still you can't put a price on convenience and boy are these ever convenient [Music]", "BL60ox4I_Kw": "[Music] ladies and gentlemen it is time it is time that you found out if the new cartridge brand that you purchased is a real company or just a package supplier [Music] so this information comes to us through DAP connection comm none of these are of my own investigation unfortunately so thanks to those guys who have no idea I'm doing this so forgive me and I thought it would have been a good idea it was too good of information and just kind of let go and doing my research on these guys that seems like it's pretty legit info but before we get started consider subscribing and punch that like button in the face if you end up staying or half of the video at least so that a deal deal okay so I'm not sure exactly how to do this [Music] you know what I'm just gonna the bran heads roll well I do a little ranting stay hydrated look I'll tell you right now that I've tried spotting faked packaging and it's always like the Mandela effect sometimes you're just like one comma away from being right and one comma is too big to risk a dead cart so I'm happy that these social medias are getting ahold of testing and sharing the information that we need plus a lot of companies are putting QR codes on packaging as well so you can see that they're legit also most legit dispensaries are posting QR codes of their license so you can check to see if those legit yourself as well the bottom line here is that anyone can make counterfeit carts anyone can make counterfeit packaging it's our moral compass that's the problem why are we gonna be lured in to buy something just because there's like a cute 4/20 nurse in front of us and we don't want to look poor there needs to be a change in the system to help professionals and everyday users identify and trust the brands no one seems to own these packaging companies like Mario karts or dank vapes the trail always seems to end somewhere in China it's too bad because there's a lot of great growers out there who make top-quality stuff if you want to feel safe and you want to be able to trust your purchase then I wouldn't buy from anywhere that isn't regulated I'm seeing way too many people unaware of information that's out there I seen the comes below that people just want to learn and grow and then comes another person it makes fun of them for how little they know this is a time for justice a time for parler everyone should be on the same level of information when it comes to legitimacy so as a bonus I'm gonna show you a few brands that pass testing now I'm not here to say that any of these are safe but they did pass phase 3 testing so do your research and what I mean by research is you know go to the brands website they should have authorized retailer on there and is that place that you got your cart from is it on their authorized retailer list and if not email them or message them on IG you know that's what I did with this cart you know this is a the Jade cart and you know I asked them if you know I got it from ie twin palms and the Inland Empire it's it's definitely a little cheap place to go but you know I mean I'm just that places license you know Jade Jade is licensed too so it's just like I mean everything's everything smells like like like a legit brand you know so plus these insights that display test results helps as well but what if research on your particular brand hasn't been posted yet just because it's a new brand doesn't mean that it's not legit you're gonna start seeing new brands popping up in the next few years a lot of older dealers are gonna start going legit with newly formulated newly tested and labeled content I want to make a video on what to look for when you visit these regulated dispensaries I'll have one coming soon but until then I hope this video was helpful things seem to be getting bitter and more ways for anti counterfeiting is on its way like share subscribe for more videos like this and as always stay safe do research and never babe underage peace", "rC0Xju8XQ70": "what is up guys it is joelle again back at it with another review you guys know what it is we lost some of you we gained some of you

condone the usage of these products and we do not sell anything on this channel as well got milk rod art and vs. bar garden video once again you guys really enjoyed the first one and you guys know me man I'm [ __ ] I love raw garden man rock garden is like my top right now this brand rock garden is amazing but today I feel like we already reviewed this one the key lime honestly I to be honest with you guys to be honest with you guys I don't remember but this one thing oh [ __ ] gasps berries and cream and I'm kind of just sick try this one Oakland but you guys know man got the v-model got this the Ease battery out it's been a minute was good with the blinker you never had a blinker and this part has to be like my favorite shirt honestly but we got the key lime pie ladies and gentleman was good you know let's check it out ooh okay okay this one's looking nice and clear I want to compare some of the flavors because a lot of people say that this [ __ ] all just has the same taste and I'm like you know that I don't disagree with you but at the same time like there has to be like a little hint of flavor the gasps berries and cream I think this one's gonna be gasps so everybody always asked me how come I never hit blinkers and well you know what I got iron baby lungs and the reason why I keep myself the reason why I take such little hits and I don't hit blinkers and uh that's just because once I start hitting blinkers I've said it before my tolerance is gonna go up and then I'm out to start taking blinkers like all the time just to get kind of let you know and then just it's just not and that way you know every time I take little hits I'm always lit and I don't have to take off I hate to get lit you know I think this one is the guy's very soul oh [ __ ] okay I gotta restart that actually I'm ready to go oh this one oh this is a podcast I do not condone the usage of these products this is literally just an educational review you know just kick them back but all right I got you guys for shading this time shout out to the whole world shout out to everybody watching this video that what you guys wanted whoa I was only off by like two three seconds but I felt like that shows gonna blink and oh that one hurt gasps berries and cream at 81 percent THC the key line the key line is at a key lime is that 89 percent THC damn this was pretty much 90% maybe this is the one that I hit right now sheesh god damn yo I swear it let me know the comments down below if you guys are able to hit a legit raw garden blinker bro [ __ ] bro that [ __ ] is tough let's try the beam on Wow I can only imagine if I hit it on the B want dude I even hit that [ __ ] out of loli sensitivity - I got so Pete decide everybody the reason why alright so I don't really be smoking out crazy like how people think you know people think like I'm probably I'm probably stoned all day but now I'll probably only get lit you know when I'm recording a video or maybe like a nighttime you know when I'm doing my [ __ ] but I always had this like theory in my head where if I don't hit anything too hard or if I try not to get my turn it's like super super high up I'm gonna remain a lightweight when it comes to smoking but at the same time it's just like how do I see it like the amount of either like wax or like trees that I have to smoke to get lit is so little compared to like all my friends like I thought all my friends these guys are like everyone has like a really high tolerance and I feel like my tolerance is low just because you know I kind of take like controlled hits if that makes sense you know I'll tell I'll take enough for me to feel late if that makes sense I mean I'm still getting late I'm still taking [ __ ] hits you know but I don't be taking like big ass hits because that way you know my thoughts is just low and I'm getting late cuz I'll stop [ __ ] it bro oh my god I'm [ __ ] zooted right now whoo yeah yeah and I got you guys a in the next video get into the cartridge I'm gonna try another blinker you know until we finally got it for the video but hey you know I'm just trying to keep it real with you guys you know like [ __ ] that regarding who you know it's pretty little - I just recently just saw the 710 pods like I think that's literally gonna be like the next video I make right there just the 7/10 pause Allen ooh I didn't see it like til I was walking out the door like you know I was just walking I was just looking at the club I was just looking at the selection I was like on my way out what the [ __ ] I saw like you know the 7 10 11 spot it was like 75 bucks and I was like you know what this [ __ ] must be so far you know you know so especially with cartridges there anything else like I just be taking like the littlest baby hits I get it lit but it's just like my tolerance is just stays low you know so that's I wanted sometimes like like right now [ __ ] died right now holy [ __ ] let's shot both [ __ ] oh [ __ ] late I know you get that thumbnail going you know me yeah so stay tuned everybody for a seven-ten labs review cuz I'm for sure gonna cop to of those I don't first you're gonna do to 710 labs and one sitting [ __ ] am definitely gonna review those I'm gonna review a couple more studies to that keyline is just fired I think this is the key line hmm just like [ __ ] which is which vitas Aquila is the gas right here the gas berries and cream oh [ __ ] I heard both these flavors were like really popular but I can see why like gas berries and cream sad catchy name but the key line is just pretty much 90% THC almost all of them have like the same flavor would like a little extra policy look this one does look a little bit more yellowish than this one but they're both cleared I think I'm just tripping I'm [ __ ] tripping they're both the same color so this company and viral cleanse um hit me up right so they have like little like like mini AC filter machines where you can just put like you know connect it like for example you can put it in your living room you know your bathroom or like your bedroom for example for me I'm gonna put in my bedroom and you just connect it and you just like powered it up you power it up and it kind of just filters like everything you know it's either smaller if it's like an at your room just kind of smells like a nasty room that doesn't get opened you know like the what you guys don't open the windows I'm not saying you guys though but I'm saying you know there's people out there that don't open windows keep the doors closed and you know eventually the smell I starts to get kind of nasty so this machine right here right it's like a foot it's an air it's an air filter so once you turn it on it's like it starts it's suck it starts to suck I like especially if you're burning too if you're smoking you could literally like [ __ ] have them like you could have like a smoke get sucked in and just everything like you know your entire room is just [ __ ] filtered so I was just thinking I was like BAM and I've seen this [ __ ] on YouTube I've seen other youtubers have this um this air filter right there just smoking a joint whatever you know they have that [ __ ] on and I'm like bro once I get that [ __ ] I might have the role of enjoy I might have to test it out oh damn because if I dab it in my room just a little bit of it like the smell leaks a little bit just a little bit but I'm just like doing if I have this little [ __ ] this AC air filter machine chilling you know in my room and I'm smoking a joint I'm like Bravo see you know I'm just going back and forth with the company right and pretty much [Music] anyways I just like also what would you think about um doing with what the product right and I'm like you know what I'm just gonna do that I'm gonna smoke one of my products inside my house inside my room and I'm gonna just turn on the AC and I'm gonna make a video like a little vlog and we just smoke in the joint and seeing how good you know it sucks the air in and like the smoke and then you know my just wait then I'm gonna go out I'm a glob Tom my fam like a like does it stink or anything like that you know but it's not gonna stink because I know that [ __ ] I seen that machine it's really [ __ ] high quality it's like oh it's like almost like eight hundred dollars and I'm like damn they're hooking it up with one so well could stay tuned you guys cuz [ __ ] that be sick I'll be able to just smoke a little joint in here dad that's like that's okay and then I'll probably have like other like more people come through you know we could review the tree inside my house switch up the scenery you know cuz I got I got my green screen on all the time well you're not gonna I could do I could do other [ __ ] shadow rock our man anybody out there watching this [ __ ] was good this monster KOCO hast will cut the check not playing shoes guys man this beam on to is [ __ ] great I'm not I'm out the drop overview on this beam on to not gonna like cuz ha still has this [ __ ] history March so we got a nice little video coming up you know I cop so much earlier with that off that little mini blinker you could say but what's good doing guys man let me know the comments on below where you guys from you know what time is it right now and again YouTube if you guys watching this [ __ ] man this is an 18 another educational podcast you know we do not condone these products we do not condone the cells and we do not sell anything on this channel will promote nothing neither you know it's just like but just how educational you know it's all edge of it it's not educational you know we got a site we gotta say yeah we gotta stay hydrated or Alize just me but it's like this [ __ ] dark you know what I'm actually really juiced for for that 7:10 pod let me know if any of you guys ever tried it you know it literally just dropped today you know just like an hour ago the guy said as soon as I came in he's like hey man there's like a new drop right there in the corner you know but I didn't pay attention I was like [ __ ] I was I looked at it and until it's not when I got out and I was like on my way out I was like oh [ __ ] what the [ __ ] is that 7:10 pod and you know everybody just telling me to try that one out you guys are telling me a lot of cards you know it's a child but the thing is like right now I feel like there's a lot of like I feel like where I live there's like a limited amount of brands you know there's only like there's ease 7-10 those pause now they have select raw garden Moxie I think yeah Moxie and then I think there's like another one other than that I don't see the ones that you guys like be asking for them something like you know what I think once I start traveling I might have to start hitting like clubs you know especially what I'm trying I'm trying to hit Universal Studios Oh [ __ ] Universal Studios that place is [ __ ] sick I think that place is [ __ ] it's a nice little place to go you know maybe like once every three years you know last time I was like good three years ago so that's just about to be sick I'm tryna I'm gonna see if I'm gonna try to find a way to just like you know bring in a car you know just [ __ ] maybe a joint you know I don't I don't know maybe an attaboy I don't know I have no idea I'm just going through [ __ ] Disney that should we say damn I like both of them they're both [ __ ] fired and this should be catching you on the look should be catched like hits this [ __ ] hits you like after I'll just be chilling I'll just start choking out of nowhere damn anyways everybody I hope you guys enjoyed this video make sure you guys drop a like the comment subscribe down I am [ __ ] on another planet right now [ __ ] these were too good ass flavors goddamn alright so I figured it out alright so this is the gas berries and cream cuz it should taste like cream legit damn this one actually has a really smooth taste yeah this one's good the [ __ ] the gas berries and cream and then the key line was just [ __ ] just strong it sounds like a low-lying taste and it just packs a punch because it's pretty much 90% THC so that's my final verdict but hey everybody gasp a reason for you damn that's [ __ ] delicious", "trHOBJti3bQ": "if you another cannabis patient or the age juice icon for this video yo guys what is going on Ethan here today we are going to be taking a look at this true leave mimosa cart so trying to get a good angle for you guys but there it is right there and it has 85 percent THC and 0% CBD and it's called like an open from true leave and this is the mimosa so it's a 400 milligram cart and it cost $55 so it's an expensive half gram that's for sure I've already smoked a lot of it but we're gonna smoke some more for you guys so I just got this new battery this battery has been out for years I just never had it and it's it's a good battery it's playing simple let's go ahead and take it I like the tip on this battery because a lot of smoke comes out so that's I mean that's a plus for me and it's just like it doesn't feel weird I don't know some tips feel weird and them off I guess I like this one and flavor on it it does taste good taste like @anjghie so can't go wrong with the tangi flavor thing you can't go wrong with is a price and like I said it's eighty five point nine percent THC obviously depending and guess on the batch it's gonna be a little bit different but let's go ahead and get another rip but this thing hits you right away she's just off like two rips like you got off two rips to be honest for the price it's kind of expensive but I just kind of want to try because I had never tried this type of pen that they have cuz Shirley has like a bunch of different type of pens so I want to try this one this is like there's a old pen but they have other friends like I said so you could check out the website if you want to go ahead and do that but here is the open date now that I'm in a good angle let me try to get a little bit of everything I guess okay so I want to take some pictures or something yeah the box looks nice so that's how it comes and then outside of that it comes in like the actual - so this has like the expiration date the batch number the THC percentage so but that's all there so yeah I picked these up myself so you don't need to worry about these being fake but uh that's gonna be if the video hope you guys did enjoy think guys for watching subscribe comment leave a like if you guys enjoy and this is Ethan signing out peace [Music]", "o7yToj8NgbU": "yes i am going to be pressing two strains of flour today picked them up at the healing center in monroeville big shout out to them and what we have today are some really nice strains i hope they press out really well we're going to find out because we're pressing 180. first one we're going to press is the cresco this is the pineapple express ringing in at 30 percent it has been rehydrated with hydrostones i'll take those out now and we shall get this ready to press hope everybody is staying safe staying medicated and being good to each other out there if you are a medical marijuana patient the pittsburgh area and you would like to have your dispensary flower pressed into rosin i do that for free for patients right here in penn hills at asher's finest rosin world headquarters it's been a long day folks i am so glad to finally be getting down to getting some pressing done uh so that's that's it that's our quarter and let me see that these new uh press bags okay those are not the right size all right here we go i do believe that that should handle i could have sworn i got three different sizes nope just two okay because here's the size difference from a seven gram bag right there so let me see if this more suitable now this is what happens when you go live stuff happens and not everything is perfect those are the wow i am just having a heck of a day today it has been pouring down rain almost the entire day today okay so that's the one closest matches the size and so these are made by gutenberg's tank pressing and they they had those custom made to emulate as close as possible a nug smasher seven gram bag and i think they got it down pretty good but let's take a look and see how these hold up under the press my crd 30 ton rosin press so there's 120 micron bag we're pressing at 180 degrees uh this is the i haven't pressed pineapple express from cresco in probably two years so we shall see what it's going to do hopefully it's going to press out well at 30 percent i'm really hoping it will but you know as well as i do sometimes the thc level does not equate to a larger yield if the plant doesn't have the right wax and lipid profile so just trying to let you know what happens in the real world we're either going to get a really good result or not and we'll see what the quality of this flower is for the price i really hope it's good because quite frankly it i've gotten surprised by some of the flower lately that should have been good producers and were not but i give everyone their chance i try not to pre-judge anything uh this is really really sticky uh especially now that it's been rehydrated which is a good sign this all tucked down in here nice and tight and we're gonna get it all folded up here and we're gonna move the lights and put it on the plates and see what she's got for us hope she gushes that would be super nice get a really nice happy happy squish out of this we shall see this is video one of the two video series today pressing dispensary flower pennsylvania medical flower from our local wonderful dispensary here the healing center in monroeville i'm gonna move the camera now move it into a better angle for you to see what's going on okay let's let's get this here blow there we go put you right in here and focus is right there all right let's start dropping the hammer on this and see what she's gonna do like i said if you're a pittsburgh area medical marijuana patient you have dispensary flour you want to press bring it over to penn hills that's where i live real easy to get a hold of if you hit me on a private messenger i give you my address and i will do this for you for free because that's what i do for patients is my outreach helping patients who need better medicine and can't afford dispensary concentrates at the price level so i'm just doing this real gently given that heat because i'm pressing at such a lower temperature than i normally do takes a little longer for that heat to start working its way in there [Music] but i'm hoping on paper it should be a gusher you know 30 that's that's the magic number for the gushers usually but sometimes it'll surprise you you won't get the yield that the uh numbers said you should based on what it's telling you and that again goes to my point this is a variable plant it's always changing and as a result it's kind of hard to get a handle on it sometimes and figuring out what you can and can't do there we go there we go you should be able to see that nice cool here we go drop the pressure more now this is going to disappear from your site okay these plates are very deep and the lights will not penetrate past a certain point so once it gets to that point i'm gonna move the camera back out because i'm gonna need to pay attention to what's going on with it and when i pull those plates back apart you should see something really really nice but that's what's going on in there right now and now come right back out here focus right there keep this thing up to full pressure where i want to be don't want to risk a blowout so we're going gonna really go gently on this especially with a bag that i haven't used before too it's always always something new that gives you that learning curve all right we're gonna let it sit right there and at 180 you can let it sit on the heat a little longer without degrading it at 200 you have to react quickly but you can get amazing results at 200. some strains of 200 degrees though will shatter up on you and turn into ground glass and you definitely don't want that so i dropped my temperature profile to 180 and i am getting slightly smaller yields overall but it's not as much as i anticipated so it ended up being a much more acceptable range than i was thinking and you know so now i'm pressing at 180 this year and if i have to make adjustments next year to see what maybe 190 does or 185 then i'll do that but i'm always trying to to do better each year better quality because i'm a quality over quantity guy every time i promise you that okay so i believe we are almost ready to pull these plates apart and see what she has given us as we showed her respect you know that's the thing you show this plant respect treat it with respect press it well and it gives her soul to you you know that's what it is at least for me that's how i approach it i approach it that this plant has a soul i'm bringing that soul out making better medicine so give me a moment we're about ready to open those plates so i'm going to give you a nice view of that ready to see it let's see it pretty oh yeah i don't know about you that's looking pretty to me huh you liking that because i sure am all right so let me get the camera moved down here so as you can see the goodness and stay tuned for my next video where i'm going to be pressing moxie's viper cookies which is another heavy hitter not over 30 percent but absolutely gorgeous look at how beautiful that came out you can't even believe how it smells you know what i'm saying it is just filling this room with the dankness and i did it i got a tiny little bit of a blowout right there okay so i took it right to the edge and got the most that this flower was able to provide now it's time to find out what our yield is because my my own personal scale that i like to use is i want to see a minimum and that's minimum of a half gram per ounce per eight pressed okay minimum i'd like to get a gram per eight and some strains give me that and most of them don't so let us see what our jar ways i'm gonna back this back off now you can see everything there we go okay i got my scale i'm going to tear my 17 gram jar there we go and taking my tool down see how it picks up i did not put this on the cool plate because it's about 65 degrees in the room and cooling it too fast leads to shattering results i like the way this is picking up is sticking to itself it's very stable didn't crystalize up which i believe the last time i pressed this flower was 200 degrees i do believe i had an issue with it turning into shatter on me if that's him so i'm much much happier with what i'm seeing here right now for sure let's get this stuff off here and into its jar it's your home that's where you want to be other than my lungs look at that look how pretty no it doesn't want to focus but it's got a really beautiful color just gorgeous loving it let's get this stuff up in the jar give you guys a yield well tomorrow starts the weekend if you don't have plans get some dispensary flour if you're in the pittsburgh area come see me i'll have a present sesh love doing pressing sessions right now my wife is not in the house so i am going to be able to have people over and we can hang out got a big screen tv and lots of equipment to dab on so if you're thinking hey i want to go party in a safe secure environment where can i go well you can come see me bring some dispensary flour let's have some let's make some good medicine have a nice session you know the social aspects of medicating are every bit as important as the medicine itself in my opinion so anybody who's just sitting around medicating in isolation that's not really very therapeutic but you get it you get yourself around some other like-minded people have some interesting discussions maybe watch some tv or a movie or stand-up comedian or something that is just as therapeutic to me as hang on just a moment i got a visit all right sorry about that folks let's finish gathering this pineapple express up like i said i don't press a lot of cresco flour because i've had some had some bad results from some of it and i always found them to be kind of higher priced than their quality would seem to indicate but in terms of this pineapple express yeah i'm pretty pretty happy with it all right now we got it all in the jar try to get in the jar and not on my hands so much so that is 18.73 when you take the 17 grams for the jar away that's 1.87 no no it's 1.73 my bad 1.73 that definitely falls within the acceptable range for me so thank you for joining me for this video here's a good look at some really really beautiful rosin this is from made from cresco pineapple express premium buds so thanks for joining me on this video i will be seeing you very soon because i'm going to turn right around reset up and shoot viper cookies so stay tuned folks i'm out of here", "nV3AANNkuM4": "okay so this is my ejuice that I make with terpenes and extract liquefied er you see it's pretty fluid it's very cold out here in the garage too soon oh oh head up so you can see it it vapes pretty good - 2.7 seconds hmm and it tastes delicious best way ever to make your own vape juice", "kTGQsPVB-68": "all right uh welcome back you guys loony with another video i am [ __ ] excuse my language i'm pissed i'm pissed so i uh already opened up the key lime this key lime pie and this shabbat gill and i literally was doing a comparison and this key lime pie 79 percent tac and the cherbacho alien labs coming in at 68 thc 71 cannabinoids got the key lime pie i was doing a scientist i was doing a comparison in terms of potency how it smokes how it feels and everything and eight minutes into the video uh my silly ass didn't have my phone on uh silent so someone called me and it literally screwed up the whole video i got to start it from the beginning so here i am reviewing these products again for uh so um which is you know i guess it's a blessing in disguise i just sucks because i didn't get i opened up on camera and now you guys don't get to experience that with me so that's that's the only thing that sucks and you guys didn't experience my first hit uh with this which also sucks but this key lime pie tastes just like pie just like the pie dough it tastes uh very uh it smells very leafy which is weird it doesn't smell how it tastes it's very dark it was made on the the second this uh this uh zero two of 2020 which is crazy that's like so long ago so you can tell it's an old batch because it has an old sticker and so all in all this is doesn't feel this one doesn't feel as potent as the 79 percent as it claims to be and i've had th thcs i've had i'm high because i took a a lot of pus i've had stizzy's at lower percentages that hit harder so i don't know what it was to do with that but this is the only life resident so far that i would wouldn't really recommend key lime pie it feels like it feels good don't get me wrong the high feels good it just doesn't feel as good as the previous ones i've had and i still have a lot more to try so i'm excited so so far this key lime pie i wouldn't recommend like i said earlier just because uh the smell is weird it doesn't smell very good it smells like it's uh smells like uh smells like smells bad like you just someone with someone else who's less who doesn't have much of a vocabulary will probably just say it smells like [ __ ] but i would agree you know sorry about that um let me guys let me show you guys the view where i was where i'm sitting here enjoying myself smoking doing this review with you guys reviewing this product so all in all key lime pie not a fan sour diesel the one i was smoking earlier yesterday i reviewed this one yesterday i'm not a big fan of it either because you know i'm not a big sativa guy a lot much i like uh hybrids a lot more i want to apologize for uh yesterday's video it was kind of bland just because i wasn't fair i wasn't feeling very well i had a headache and i shouldn't have i probably should have heard off held off on the video but either way i'm not i knew i wasn't going to really i went into that kind of like uh you know because i'm not a fan of sour diesel like that i just trying everything just so you guys can you know get a sense of how every product is for the most part so this cherbacho this [ __ ] alien labs in general i love it like this oil is so much so much more clearer than this dizzy will like this dizzy almost looks black look at that dude it's crazy like i don't know this it might just be this batch specific batch that is just not that good but every other live version from steezy i've had was amazing like i mean the high is good i'm not gonna lie the high is not bad it's just not as good that's all i'm saying it's just not as good and it's 79 almost 80 percent thc that's high percentage for a live resident i'm like let's be real this [ __ ] is coming in at 68 tc and it smacks me way harder than this so you know it's it's something you guys got to look out for but this is a lot more expensive to 60 and a half grams so you know i just picked it up for 40 uh 40 for 45 i mean because i was on discount but let me go ahead and try this one for you guys i'm trying both again and then i'm gonna try to give you guys another uh flavor profile let me cleanse my palate though all right try the stitchy one first yeah dude this smells bad like it makes me want to pull my nose away from it it's like uh you know that's that's i know you guys are not going to want that so unless you get a key lime pie that's a brand new batch like recent like last month couple months ago and it's you know the oil is a lot lighter it might be better but i have no idea they might all be like this let me go ahead and try i might even try another key lime pie in the future just because i might because you never know you can get a hit and miss it could be a duck just like edible eat a hundred milligrams for some reason now it hits you and then you eat 100 milligrams uh another time and for some reason it doesn't hit you and it could be the same brand so who knows it could be like that with these cartridges but we'll see let me take this hit see i'm kind of upset because [Music] i think that's the first time i've ever coughed from a hit as of yet and that's why i said it makes me upset because it feels good going down like it gave me lung expansion to the point where i actually took on my throat made me want to cough like in a good way like i feel good i like that and it tastes good but it's just the smell i don't know why the smell is not coming through oh see i'm not gonna lie you take a big rip of this it's actually uh it's actually good like i'm not gonna see it like i'm it's hard to uh it's hard to judge it now because i've i was i took like three hits of this uh off camera on camera but you know i had to start all over all over so i took three hits of this and i had took one hit of this and then that hit you guys just watched me do that so that's my fourth hit of this it was a and that was a you know that was probably the biggest hit i've taken so far so it feels good like it i'm not gonna lie it feels good but like i said it just doesn't feel as intense as the other ones like the other ones like the gorilla glue number four if you go to that video i had to close my eyes for a second like that's what i'm saying like right after the hit i'm like i'm like oh trying to catch my breath that's what i'm talking about that's that's the intensity i'm looking for you know but i'm gonna go ahead and try this one for you guys actually tastes amazing chewbacco tastes amazing i taste the gelato and i taste the sherbet because that's what that's what makes chabakio gelato 41 and sherbet and i taste both of those crazy in the in the in the flower version strain version live resiny it's amazing it smells great too like i can i can just i can leave it here and enjoy it myself while like you know smelling this wonderful marijuana aroma but this on the other hand when i smell it it makes me want to pull my nose away from them like you know it's like that's that's i don't like that because it kind of like kind of ruins my experience especially if you blow out the smoke i'm so i'm lucky i didn't i'm surprised i haven't smelled that that smelled that blowing the smoke out i don't even think about it god but it tastes amazing though like it tastes good well still i feel i feel really [ __ ] this shits when you combine them of course it's you know you never can never go wrong but obviously this one's gonna you know hands down is better than the stizzy but there are some stizzies that hit just like this one so it's it's hard to say so for the most part i will still stick with your stizzy live resins just because you got to just make sure that before you cut before you purchase them which i should have done just look at the dates because you can see that you can see the percentages on the boxes before you leave which i do all the time so as might as well check the dates i don't even know why i didn't check the dates but that's something that's a tip i'm going to give you guys and that's that's gonna be it for this video i still got two more uh still got two more uh stizzy's to try the super green crack which i'm looking forward to forward to even though it's a sativa and a silver line just because green cracky masquerade crack it's iconic super which is a super silver haze and green crack makes super dream crack so that's for just what you guys know if you guys probably don't already know and then i got the other one which is a chem reserve and uh forget what it is right now because i'm pretty stoned but when i come up with that uh hybrid it's a hybrid live resin i can't wait for it it's brand new so look out for that one and yes that's it for this video so i hope you guys enjoyed man i'm sorry you guys uh couldn't uh i pretty much went over everything i said in the last video if not i said more so if if anything is blessed in disguise because i just kind of because there was a lot of things i said in the other video that is pretty much doesn't even isn't even necessary you know some random high comments some are rambling and stuff but i hope you guys have a great day enjoy the rest of your day and like comment subscribe uh share all that your boys out peace", "OaR1b9gzESc": "hey guys welcome back to another video i got something special alien labs disposable so this is my first time ever trying anything from alien labs this is a half gram live resin pod 100 live resin gelato 41 is a strain you are not alone says on the side of the box just kind of dope and then all the [Music] thc and all the information is right here it won't focus because it's annoying so i'll read it total thc is 72.52 total cbd less than two percent and then total cannabinoid 78.43 yes ingredients just cannabis nice all right so it just says pinch on both sides right here says pinch on both sides so i'm about to pinch and i got two of oh wait i gotta rip the stick on the top so i got two of these actually i have cherbocchio and i have gelato 41. this gelato 41 is a higher in thc than the cherbakio so this is why i'm trying this one first but jesus yo this sticker is a it's no joke all right perfect let's get this open oh oh okay so i'm having quite a difficult time opening this box to be honest i don't like that very unnecessary but it's the sticker the sticker is very hard to rip off very cool no oh my god this thing is pretty uh insane like it doesn't want to come straight out i don't want to break it there it goes jeez yo this box is ridiculous i do not like alien labs is uh i don't like their uh packaging i love the packaging let me rephrase that i don't like how difficult it is to open the packaging this thing is dope what the yo this is dope look at this gelato 41 is engraved in the pen now it used to be a weak ass sticker from the reviews i've seen look it looks like a real half gram nice man i'm so excited to try this smells just like gelato oh my god this can i remove this oh yeah this is a sticker right above oh no this is a it's gelato is not engraved that's a sticker the indent i don't know what that is let me take a hit for you guys though it says alien labs on the side dude this thing is tiny like this thing is tiny look at this look at this this thing is tiny dude i like it comparison to my remote all right comparison to the box this is all right let's let's try it out first smoke of the day so i'm excited all right let's go it smells good i think the light this light supposedly turns on as opposed to from what i've seen i couldn't i couldn't take a hit i couldn't take my usual hit where i dragged him for two puffs for a long time oh wow that's intense that's intense you know this this thing smacks right away instantly high feel it in my eyes it's going through my body it's i'm sweating like i feel like i'm sweating it hits it hits it tastes just like gelato it tastes just like the strain tastes like just like live resin tastes amazing i [ __ ] i love the flavor i love the flavor and the high is really good i mean it's my first smoke of the day and it's really late so that's gonna you know obviously lower my my tolerance a little bit to make this hit much more enjoyable but if uh we'll definitely see how i feel about it smoking it more so we'll see with this next hit and uh yeah i just got stuck there because this [ __ ] i was just focusing on the high a little bit and yeah it's nice i don't i d i don't know if you guys can see that but those two dots up there those two are bubbles and they were there before i took my first hit so i don't like that because you know i want my full half cram what i'm paying for you know i don't want any missing product like that's never a good thing especially if these go for 60 a half gram i got them 45 each got two for 45 because they were on they were discounted at the dispensary i got i got them from my weed maps i'm really digging how the pen looks it looks beautiful i really love it like it's it's amazing like the alien on the back how the light so bright okay so this is one thing i gotta bring up the lights actually so bright where i can be i like i would almost be concerned that the light is consuming battery because you know this is a one-time use there's no charger once i'm once the battery dies regardless of how much oil is in here if there's any oil left i have to throw it out there's it can't burn in here because the friday is dead the battery's dead so let's i'm hoping this battery lasts me until all the oil all my product is smoked you can see the oil a lot better right there look at that it's a really amazing color for being 100 live resin let me show you guys the box from this position so you guys can see it yeah see if it reads a lot better when it's like that all right take another hit to light them yo this [ __ ] is amazing i would pay the 60 for a half just from those two first two hits i know this is gonna be a wonderful experience throughout the whole journey of smoking smokiness i'm sure you're in the tour because of how how much it's kicking me it's feeling it fills up your lungs like some real gas oh this shit's amazing oof this shit's amazing i'm not disappointed whatsoever i can't wait for this to uh really settle in because as you guys know live resin doesn't hit you like a distillate or a dab would as in it doesn't hit you right away like as soon as you're blowing out the smoke you're already like stoned out your mind it's not like that it'll take like damn near 10 minutes for the full effects to kick in and that's just the entourage effect that's the although the cannabinoids that you experience and it's it's really wonderful but especially if you're someone that consumes this kind of product for the medicinal benefits then this is wonderful like i'm gonna have a bad shoulder right here due to a lot of training my left foot is hurting due to a lot of sprinting and running i run every day and um when i hit this i forget about the pain is gone like that just that little micro dose of cbd and all the other cannabinoids just have my body feeling so good that i don't even really the pain is like diminished like 30 it's crazy that's how much that's how it feels and um yeah this alien labs this is the gelato 41 amazing amazing i give it a this shit's uh definitely a four on the on the scale from five it's a four out of five on a four high and um in terms of looks just five out of five like this is amazing this is amazing like i love the look if i could keep this battery and refill and just remove this after if this was removable and i could just refill other half grams i would do it i would keep this it looks awesome i like it a lot so it's five out of star five five out of stars he's has me twisting my words now that the high's kicking in five out of five on uh looks and yeah i got a whole bunch of uh oh by the way if you guys are still watching i got two two more st i got four more stizzy pots two silver lines two gold lines i have a super green crack that i'm i'm gonna review all four of them super green crack sour diesel for the silver line the cannabis derived terpenes and for the live resin pods they're all half grams i got key lime pie and i have cam reserve which is new it's not even on their website complete completely brand new camera reserve it's a hybrid so look out for those videos that's four more videos uh and you know that's going to be dropping the next couple weeks uh hopefully i could do them sooner you know and um i still have one more part of this it's the schermacio and i can't wait to try that one sharmakio it's just a cool ass uh names you know the sound the name sounds dope and i love what it's crossed with too shabbat was a really good strain due to uh just because it's of you know what makes sure marco is just two fire things make one more fire thing so i think um you know before the video gets along guys i hope you guys enjoy the rest of your night uh i i definitely will with this and uh you guys have a good uh recipe uh yeah see like i'm repeating myself have a good rest of your night and shout out to 777 he uh he mentioned me on his live stream earlier and uh i was pretty dope you know somebody i watched so you guys check them out 777 also does reviews and yep that's it for you boy you guys enjoy yourselves", "zVQruAIpxWk": "[Music] welcome to wheat entertainment and we love talking about grandy flora strains and this bud is something called yada da and it's really a unique looking bud but it was crunchy dry when i got it i opened up this bag and then i set it down and now it's even drier because i think i got this thing i don't know three weeks ago a month ago it just sat in the back i don't know why i didn't review it but i didn't do it so today's the day for yada da and let me load my little scooper into vapor cup straw i've already got two in here we're gonna add the third then we're gonna tamper and we're going to stick this down in the vapor cup then we're going to talk about yadda da yada comes in this bag and i got this at cookies maywood i got this at the apples and bananas drop down there i ran down there they held that for me and there were some comments on wheat entertainment so i grabbed it when i was down there and this flower has 26 thc and people are asking for the package date and uh so i'm going to give it that but to get that date i need a magnifying glass because my eyes aren't so good anymore so this is the package manufactured it is 9 29 20. oh no wonder it's so dry it's been in this bag for months right and you know what's crazy you would think that they're saving money on the jars right so at least they would give us some kind of moisture pack in here so these flowers when they come out of this bag are more fresh so let's say i got this the beginning january was harvested three months before crazy just crazy but anyway it's not about the dryness i don't wait for that so even though i note it that has nothing to do with my ratings my ratings are all about the something something and everyone's got their own something something that they're looking for but what i'm looking for are heavy flowers with focus that could grin me out i have to stay active i have a lot of responsibilities have to take care of i need flowers that can let me do that now i'm also a heavy hitter so a lot of the flowers even though i call them focus flowers they could stone you to the bone but it doesn't necessarily do that for me but certain ones do like the couch lock flowers but this isn't about catch lock i'm not looking for those type of flies this is about focused flowers that can grin me out so today it's jan dada turn to get the review we're looking for the best well let's check it out so you can see that's about amount a time it takes for vapor cup to work you can see that right there that's the terpenes the cannabinoids the water vapor and the oil vapor you can see it condenses right on the straw it takes about a minute and 20 once this cup is hot and also a lot of people have vapor cup so make sure your cup is hot if the cup is hot you need less time in the chamber if it's a fresh you just start it up you're going to need more time in the chamber and that's one of the things when you get vapor cup you got to learn use but i love this thing this thing changed my life but today it's about yada da so let's check it out yada da by grandiflora at 330 degrees out of vapor cup let's do this again so this flower's got a light og taste with a pungent pal but there's much bigger pungent pals than this one but it has it and the pungent pal it's i'm gonna say it's something like the chicken wing you know when you go buy chicken wings you smell it it makes you kind of like the ammonia taste people say ammonia but if you try vapor cup i'm going to tell you it's a pungent pal this flower took me a lot of flour to get stoned actually but it definitely got me stoned this flower's strong enough but not super strong and i thought it was good so what did i rate yada da i'm looking for the best and this flower you know at first i'm saying it's not strong enough but i used a really lot of it i used up half an eighth on the session i mean i really used a lot of it and in the end the feeling was actually kind of good it wasn't heavy it wasn't you had focus or didn't have focus i would say it was like a cruiser a little bit i wish it personally would have been a little heavier this flower gets an 8.65 which means it's a good flower if you're not a super heavyweight yeah it's a try but for someone who's a super heavyweight this flower may be not strong enough for them it was good but there's definitely better out of granny flora if you want to get a vapor cup this item right here and i'm telling you instead of smoking your flour up and joints get one of these things that little bit of flour that i put into this cup can last you 10 minutes and stone you to the bone i love this thing makes so many opportunities for use i love it and you can see it at vaporcup.com if you want to see my favorite picks you can see them on wheat entertainment.com that site's just getting updated right now it's going to have my top 100 strains in la out of 1500 strains i tried this is my journey i'm looking for the best thanks for joining in if you have a tip for me leave it below the video i'm the doctor i post every day but sunday it's my day off party on my friends [Music] you", "zbAY763zt4M": "[Music] hi there this is ally hi times concentrate correspondence over the last few years concentrates have become the biggest thing to happen to pop culture since well pot but as the popularity of Deb's continues to grow so the questions about the many forms these concentrates can take all concentrates are made through a process called extraction where marijuana's main ingredients are concentrated into an essential oil the main three solvents used to create Deb's are butane co2 and ISO isopropyl alcohol after extraction the resulting Deb's can look very different today we're taking a closer look at the three main types of concentrates shatter butter and oil oil is a gooey sticky liquid that can be kind of hard to handle while butter has a creamier consistency from being whipped finely shatter is smooth clear and solid all three can be used in vape pens and oil rigs but finding the right concentrate for you is a matter of preference shatter is the purest and most potent form because it involves a second extraction process that removes fats lipids and waxes this can result in over 80 percent THC however it also means that some of those tasty terpenes are removed therapies are responsible for marijuana's unique smell combined with THC terpenes create the flavor of the pot or concentrate your smoking butter retains more terpenes so it tends to be more flavorful but less potent with THC percentages in the 70s oil tends to be the least refined of the three this form also known as honey oil or butane hash oil can retain a full flavor profile however THC levels are generally less consistent unfortunately availability often determines what type of concentrate you smoke but hopefully this little guide helps those lucky enough to have a choice thanks for watching and stay tuned to hi x comm for more Deb related content including how to select a nail and the rig you

of my blueberry live resin something I grow and extracted myself guru and extracted myself I don't know it's am I talking like I'm to still endure it was like I was already tying into this before he started the video so very tasty [ __ ] live blueberry resin here in st. flavor I'll have a Devon that with you guys and I got a another strain with me here my Vancouver cush live resin as well it's just kind of a little chunk right there or private stash and [ __ ] tasty oh boy [ __ ] so taste you gotta love the live resin if you haven't tried any live resin I suggest you get some because everybody i know that's that blood yep dive the line dab the live stuff is probably one of everyone's favorites to get some good live resident i also like smoking distally to which doesn't have any flavor really just taste like hi so it's friday i am staying fried just enjoying my weekend the start of the weekend I think we're actually heading out to a friend's cabin this weekend do some [ __ ]

sesh good old sesh good old Abbey gaps here all right everybody have a good [ __ ] day peace cheers and have you Debbie later everybody", "F1Gj0gPR_Lk": "hey everyone how's it going hope you're having a great day today we're gonna be answering some questions that you sent to us through YouTube or Instagram and yeah everybody's gonna be anonymous for privacy purposes so here we go question number one new to vaping what factor does voltage play in to vaping amazing question first of all I would say in order to understand voltage you need to understand mas casa t so viscosity is just the thinness or the thickness of your oils so if you have a thick oil which basically you can tell by flipping over your cartridge upside down and if it doesn't move or takes forever in a day to move you have a thick oil if it takes like five seconds probably a medium and then if it's almost instantly you got a you got a thin oil so thinner oils would need a lower voltage and thicker oils would need a higher voltage if you vape thin oils on a higher voltage you run the risk of burning the oil itself and if you vape thicker oils at low temperatures it might not heat up all of the oil in and you might not get the draw that you're looking for also cartridges play a factor into this sometimes because of the air hole but that's a whole nother video I'll link I'll put a link to it like right around here somewhere so you want to make sure that you get the full inhalation of your draw and you also want to make sure that you're not burning your oils either alright question number two can I refill my cartridge with new oils absolutely I would say don't do it more than twice otherwise you run the risk of clogging old oils might get stuck in there and so don't burn your new oils correctly you might lose flavor taste vapor production it could leak you know because it's just over time I mean you know you want to change the oil in your car and with this it's just like this is you're actually inhaling it and this is going in your body so you want the best quality of you know oil that you can find plus if you're like a flavor chaser and you know somebody who likes to try and taste different strains you know it's best if you change your oils you know once maybe twice and then dispose of them because they're they're not meant to last forever next question says do these work with normal vape liquids no no they don't uh vape liquid is too thin it'll drip out it'll leak out into the battery you know that you'll have connectivity problems if you do that I wouldn't put a juice in it odds these aren't meant for a juice how do I put a juice into my ex5 cartridge so again not free juice but all the cartridges that we sell they're all top fill so you unscrew the top cap or if it's plastic and it has a plug you just fill down the plug if it's a ceramic mouthpiece just take the mouthpiece off fill it around the heating tube because the heating tube is gonna or the heating post is gonna be directly down the center there's gonna be a hole down there where you can look straight down through it that's where the air flow comes from do not put anything in there what you want to do is have the oil drip around that post touching the glass and and being on the inside of the glass you want to be able to see the oil rise up you don't want if you put it through that post you're not gonna be able to see anything it's just gonna leak straight down into your battery and the ex5 cartridge is as a top fill you just remove it I believe the heating post is actually connected to the mouthpiece so you just squeeze it on in there it's it it's it's a dope it's a dope cartridge you can control the air flow through it - it's pretty hardcore um next question how long do I inhale while holding the button so the button will usually just hold for a good 10 to 15 seconds and you uh you can't you can't hold it for for more than that but usually as soon as you put the cartridge you know to inhale you're gonna hold the button down and then let go when you're done and just you know it won't last more than 15 seconds and then the really the rest is just up to you how long do I have to charge the battery for it does the pen light have to flash or the battery and the charger have to stay green so I know it's full it really depends on the unit you have and for the most part for the most part pins that have adapted connectors or you plug you plug them into the 510 threading you plug that into a computer it's gonna light red and hold red and then it will transition into green and hold green if it's something like this sometimes they'll flash 20 times I know the snap flash is 20 20 times and this one it flashes eight times and then it goes blank um you know just read the instructions I would say so to answer your first question how long do you charge the battery I would say no more than two hours you know some even less than an hour depending you got to watch them and get to know it you know it's something that you're gonna be carrying around in your pocket with you all day every day you know so it's good to know like what what you have on your body but usually what I would do is when I first get it use it up let it die twice charge it for two hours and then never past one hour again alright and can you use it while charging he was talking about the wolf duo no you cannot you cannot use it while it's charging it's not it doesn't have a bypass on it but this one does this is the wolf uni you can charge it or yeah you can't vape it while you're charging it next question hey I just got a new cartridge and whenever I put it in my uni just flashes but when I put in another cartridge it works fine what should I do the best method is basically what you did you know you tried another cartridge inside of the battery and it works so you ruled out that the battery was fine it was just the cartridge that I was having an issue the cool thing about all vaporizers is that they'll try to talk to you they'll try to okay with you if it's something internal with the cartridge it'll probably read as a misfire which will flash three times if it's something as simple as like the cartridge is fine the battery is fine maybe there's a magnet involved it's just not getting a connective touch to it it just can't read the cartridge it'll flash five times just an error like that it could be something like with the magnets you know the magnet might not be screwed into the proper length so sometimes maybe you want to back off the magnet a little bit from the from the cartridge itself back it off put it back in and see if that works so right now it's telling me one two three four five that means I cannot it cannot read the cartridge there's nothing wrong with the cartridge nothing wrong with the vapin but five times tells me that it's just not connecting to the battery so when I screw it back on I put it back in I'm able to get some draws try different cartridges different batteries different batteries and different cartridges kind of rule them out rule out problems if they indicate if you don't understand what the indicator is trying to tell you other than that I would say you know give customer service a call I'm sure we can take care of it for you that'll do it for today guys hope that was helpful let us know if you want to see more of these send in your questions I want to know I want to answer them but yet peace", "F81FE5kUi5o": "what up y'all [ __ ] dmt back here with another video and today i set myself up with another dad video for you guys and for me you guys know I love to get high and today I went to my little bookshop and picked up a new string sorry about the bad date you guys hiding something I don't want you guys to see expert here guys it's all good I'm hideous right now well you got ignore the band-aid I'm here to dab and show you guys I just came from the shop it's still dressed and here we go alright you guys dab buddies here is the packaging you know I like to show you guys the packaging and what's cool about this packaging is that they kind of had a little fun with it they used the Angry Birds theme and it looks like this guy has a different different eyelid color than the other eyelid that's kind of weird but yeah got these three little birds right here on their little perch I'm a little branch that's funny it has like weed leaves on the branch pretty cool we I got a red brown and green bird with the Rasta hats too stoner flies a sky those dab buddies on it looks like the one of the Middle's the only ones stoned blowing a little cloud out the side of his beak they look like I always want to see like that little chest thing they might be owls here's the other side looks like the sticky isn't sticking and it says dad buddies Girl Scout cookies if you want to know what that abbreviation is it is G SC Girl Scout cookies and they usually measure it up in half grams or full G's and it tells you the different strains like in the Kisatchie VII or hybrid or the strain name and what type of wheat it is keep out of reach of children for a medicinal use only and ivory so cool some of it actually um crystallized oh there's that sugar that sugar you know that ever so gracious sugar there we go you guys get that awesome sugar shot you nice or the death but let me show you guys are awesome this Deb because it's pretty [ __ ] awesome look at that there's like see-through shatter on top would like crumble on the bottom Jojo who deters the Terps the Terps wrapped about the Terps and just like over [ __ ] whelming it just straight-up tastes like weed like just punji weed like a sweet taste with like a punji after town sometimes they'll just be punji but it won't taste sweet this has a sweet taste then that punchiness comes right after it's like having a clean categorise to wax with when an aftertaste of light we taste because those clean waxes it's like you just took a fatass wax hit but it didn't taste bad didn't hurt your throat but it didn't also just didn't taste like anything those are like clean this is clean because i it went through like nothing nothing by like the after effect the aftershock and like aftertaste everything after like a lingering look at that [ __ ] you know just crumbled up you all right no crumbly ass dab dab buddies cheers Oh you can just straight-up taste the weed - I was gonna say it kind of has that clean taste like when you can't taste the lead you could taste some more in the crumble then you could taste it in like the wax in it there's actually one little spot that's still shattering I wanna yeah so you guys yeah about that shatter the shatter that isn't crumbling even though it was from I'm gonna dab this guy's [Music] dad buddy's definitely recommended [ __ ] awesome this is some crazy line but yeah thank you guys for it's coming back and checking on another DMT THC video I loved getting faded with you guys I love doing fader on camera and like the video if you enjoyed it comment something down below let me know what you thought about the video anything about the video I'm your boy B of T THC back here with another one thank you guys", "zCefsDMbWUo": "[Music] hey everybody so check it out for this review video I figured it would be awesome to do it outside alright man it's a beautiful day out today it's nice I mean I figured nature would be the best place to do this review video so for this video I have here this is a gram cartridge by buddies this is one gram distillate with no added flavor alright this has got no added flavor so this is the buddies and again no added flavor alright I got to make sure that I make that very clear for everybody so this is coming in at 87 percent THC this is royal dog-walker alright it is the Royal dog walker it's not just regular dog Walker its royal [ __ ] okay you better bow down and recognize alright anyway it is a beautiful product first off let's see if we get a good view on that look at that that is a beautiful beautiful nice product right there that's a nice distillate so this this cartridge cost me twenty nine dollars for medical here in Oregon and for recreational that means anybody over the age of 21 with valid ID you could pick this cartridge up this buddy's cartridge with no added flavor for about thirty nine dollars recreational so that's not bad either anyway I got my om extracts battery here that I'm using really cool battery just because it's got the the charger right there at the bottom you can just charge it use a regular phone charger whatever kind of you know LG charger and we're going through this nice little I want you guys to see this really quick for my stuff there's a nice little area it's nice little walk path this looks like where somebody would get murdered in a scary movie like hey let's go through the forest yeah oh man but it's nice it's nice out today and so like I said before I figure we do this review video outside so um right here's a good area there ain't nobody around so let's uh go ahead and try this bad boy [Music] [Music] not bad man that is really smooth and that tastes really good it doesn't taste too much like dog walker though if you've ever actually had dog walker it's got that diesel that really gassy diesel taste it mainly because of the chem dog in it but man not bad it's got like a fruity sweet taste to it with a little tinge of that gas eNOS at the end that's how I describe it not super fruity more sweet but like that you know sweet fruity ish with a little gassy Diesel at the end that's how I'd describe the terpenes on this and I don't know does it say make cannabis deprived terpenes you see that peep it because it's very important when you get these cartridges all right very [ __ ] important I can't tell you enough please guys please please please please please try to stay away from the flavored stuff now I know that I've done a few review videos on some of the flavored stuff but that doesn't mean that that's what I personally smoke okay this is the kind of stuff that I personally smoke those review videos are just for reviews okay they're nothing more than that anyway so this buddies I don't know if it says it doesn't say the terpenes on it but it's pretty tasty alright this is a hybrid distillate 1 gram vape cartridge distillate alright I'll make sure I say that again because I want people think and it's BHO or anything else but this is a distillate I love it this is a perfect item for somebody on the go this perfect item very discreet easy to use if you're out somewhere like this you know you know what I mean you're just out enjoying nature maybe you're taking a trip somewhere it doesn't matter these are very easy to use and again they're very very discreet alright a lot of people that don't smoke mistake these for actual vape you know mods and stuff like that they think it's a juice I don't know we come to a fork of the road here I don't know which way to go it's either that way we're that way but hold on let me let me show you guys this this is the other side of the entrance this isn't a nice little walk I don't know if you guys caught any of that walk through there but does a nice little walk so anyway let's go this way all right check it out it's really hot out here it's like 93 degrees or some [ __ ] and it's only getting hotter summer has just begun out here at Eastern Oregon a lot of people think that I'm in the Portland area or Salem OR Eugene or something like that now I live out here in Eastern Oregon Hermiston Oregon good old harvestin out here in the damn desert as you can see mostly everything out here is dead just burning up out here in the desert man it's kind of shitty to grow out here because if you don't do your if you don't amend your soil right if you don't make sure that you know everything's on you know the up and up and legit you'll end up with that like desert hay tasting weed man and that sucks Oh God does it taste like [ __ ] alright so if you're growing out here in the desert man remember to amend your soils correctly man because you don't want that nasty hay taste [Music] so my thoughts on this one gram cart bye buddies I have to say I highly recommend it it's something that's still somewhat affordable it's not going to break the bank but it's exactly what you want when you're looking for carts okay the cart gives you a big massive hit which is always you know what I'm looking for because I want to feel like I'm taking a DAB you know what I mean I don't want to feel like Joe I'm just taking like these little nothing cloud hits I want to feel it I don't know there's a lot of you guys out there that are the same way but I would say this is it like I said exactly what you're looking for when you're going shopping for a cart you're looking for a cart that functions well it's not you know a cheap cart these carts are actually really nice carts you're looking for the product itself to be really good okay you're looking for those higher numbers especially for distillate you want those high eighty 90s and I mean that's just beautiful distillate look at that that's just beautiful distillate you know what I mean there's nothing I could say about that you could see yourself just some really nice you know very see-through golden distillate which is very beautiful all right no arguing that and again eighty eighty seven eighty seven percent THC almost ninety that is some good numbers those are some good test results right this doesn't have any CBD in it or at least it doesn't tell me but oh wait it does it does have a house three point five fifty three percent of CBD in it so that is a little bit of a bonus in there so nice I didn't read the side I'm a dumbass but anyway seriously no I like that though so the breakdown tea 85% is a total cannabinoid okay so that's the overall total the actual breakdown of it is 75 percent while 75 point 69 percent THC if we want to get technical about it then again three point 53 percent CBD so that's the breakdown of it nice nice nice nice not bad it's hoping that the THC would be a little bit higher than 75 to be honest especially when you're dealing with distillate a lot of distillates are in those higher numbers you know what I mean but hey as long as it tastes great as long as I'm getting a good hit as long as you know my cart is functioning because there's a lot of carts that [ __ ] up there's a lot of carts that you'll end up sucking the oil through or they'll just burn out and quit to stop working and you're [ __ ] with half of your grammar if not more in there yeah so you go you you got to add that in when you're shopping for these babies so big shout out to buddies again the Royal dog walker which if you ever get a chance to try dog walker itself it's one of my favorite strains a highly recommended man that that Terr pee gas diesel skunky oh.just musters the nostrils and I love it I love it I love it I love it look at these boulders they're very big boulders so I don't drive my car into that Lake I guess if I'm like crazy on crack or some [ __ ] oh there's deer over here I think I scared the deer by yelling too loud I just saw him take a you know beeline it straight for the woods over here that's some crazy [ __ ] he's like oh no not these [ __ ] again look at this white boy out here talking and getting high I can't take this [ __ ] anyway I want to go down here that's nice if there wasn't like fish hooks and all kinds of poke and [ __ ] from people fishing in here I'd probably be like let's go swimming in here in fact then again I don't know they they these are the pawns that they stock every so often so nothing but just small trout oh nothing big for all you stoner fishermen out there if you are a stoner fisherman let me know in the comment section below there's a lot of them out there you know getting stoned and going fishing is a really relaxing fun thing to do I'd have to say I'd do it from time to time anyway so I got to get back to a buddy's good kart recommended if you guys are on a budget can't afford those 50 60 $70 cards if you guys you know need something that is trustworthy none of that added flavor [ __ ] known on cannabis deprived terpenes then go buddies man they're your buddy all right they just want to be your buddy all right they fit in your pocket very discreet easy to use 510 thread so they fit almost almost every [ __ ] battery out there and like I said man just they're trying to be your buddy be their buddy follow them on Facebook and Instagram so you could stay updated with all the product they got all right and the different flavors and everything just everything amazing about buddies all right guys if you guys like this video if you guys like nature if you guys found anything I said at all informational or entertaining remember to support this channel by giving a big thumbs up on this video and subscribing to my channel right here at V Andrew Liam if you'd like to see more content just like this alright guys I hope you guys all have a very blessed day I love you guys thank you much positivity love and respect your way and until next video I'm out of this [ __ ]", "uiiyBZxyutg": "what's up homie murder bombs small tubes been a minute [Music] we here at the lab you know um yes that well like you can see it there's little circulator running that's recovering a run from the closed loop system but for right now we bounce in a little bit of dry [ __ ] just real quick nothing's nothing special just doing some quick bounce tech let me get that off here so it doesn't contaminate that just doing some quick balance tags you know it's been a long day i've run a little over four and a half pounds and i don't have any hash i mean i have somehow but i want different you know what i'm talking about so how is everybody how's your day going what day is it [Music] okay that's the this is uh 120 through 159 not the cleanest or anything just trying to just trying to get a little something together to rip with you guys oh we can't do it like that can't see [ __ ] um [Music] not bad huh for some midzies so you're looking to learn about some dry [ __ ] mojo jojo well then i i have wonderful news for you i uh i finished uh shooting and there's just a little bit of editing for the um second video in the patreon series and aside from that i had all this uh dressed up stuff out and i had some material that i was working with so i went ahead and shut up oh comprehensive driveshift uh tutorial-ish video really a sort of revisiting because i have uh i watched a couple of bubble man's um old videos and some john brothel and a d420k and i realized my dry sip tack is nowhere near what it should be and um well to give you an idea why i'm feeling okay about it i'll just show you here in a second we pressed some rosin we're gonna show you [Music] and what we're doing [Music] wanted to see what kind of a quality product i can get from this and still um this this will still maintain a pretty a really reasonable view um this is 120 through 1 49 159 dry sift but this is in a 50 micron bag um a little bit larger than i typically use for hash but not too let's see what we got right here again not not to clean just trying to bounce any particulate through the screen that's smaller than 74 micron obviously boom playing drum solos over here [Music] i tried to use the camera last time but i guess you can't focus when you're live on youtube oh [ __ ] can you guys see this not bad for how long you saw we just worked on it 519 canada here shout out to my dry sipped masters from the north marcus of course uh john six grams i don't know i guess i could weigh it should we wear it yeah we can wear it why not oops we do have a little scale right here anyway so shout out to whoever the hell this company is no more batteries [ __ ] it usb rechargeable scale and i charged i've charged it one time and i've been using it for almost a month all right so we're going to weigh this the easy way [Music] make it a little bit of dry ice sit and really i was just bringing you guys in to take a break with me but when i set up the stream i noticed i had all that sift on the screen and i thought you guys might like to watch that hey four grams 3.95 looked like more didn't it all right guys it's good yeah i am tired i'm ready to take a dab i'm not sure how much i'm gonna get done after that but i have put in a very full day all right um [Music] you guys wanna you gotta [ __ ] it i guess we could press this real quick i do have some wonderful things to show you that i pressed earlier today from some dry sift that i spent much more time with um so if this stuff comes out amazing i'm going to be a little bit disappointed because why did i spend all that time making that stuff nah it's just there's absolute technique that cannot be denied and then of course there's the advantage to you know fully mature trichomes very dry fully mature trichomes in a very cold environment with very low humidity i mean in that setting you don't even really have to be this very good at this thing with all your variables perfect like that you're gonna you're gonna get some decent hatch but for uh mojo that said in the comments there a little bit ago about getting some screens or recently got some screens for driving oh what's happening here guys i can feel just a little bit of loose sift that's around it you know i don't want that on the parchment obviously okay now where's the first one the one i'm on i don't know we'll see if we get any yold out of this this actually is some 160 160 to 249. huge very high micron hash i don't think we're gonna press that but hey let's see what happens with this step as a matter of fact i know i want to press this because [Music] we want to try to stream i guess by a little bit of dry slipping i meant a lot sorry sorry sorry let's go let's go let's go [Music] all right here we [Music] that's a go too close how's everybody doing how's everybody doing it was a little fluffy you know what that points to unfortunately a high uh count of a capitate and stocks so that's contentment um only only contaminant would have it looking so fluffy like that we both thought it was like [ __ ] when you said seven grams i was like yeah probably maybe even a little more and then it was half all right guys so we're gonna first press the uh which one is this i can't remember which one was the bigger bag now the bigger bag was the last one so this is the 120-159 this is the 74-119 i think yes this is the 70 419 that's the stuff that we thought was seven grams but it's actually get my big fat head out of your way [Music] [Music] should be ready to go whoa those are some big comments yo what up austin video is called miz uh mecca mccall man static oh yeah [Music] so i don't know who so so dare you you must not have been here for the beginning i was talking about the marcus um adding to your driveshift quiver that i watched about six years ago and then i revisited over this past weekend and it was a really it was a wonderful reminder um no we're not of course i didn't just do static tech i don't have the time for that right now just want to make some dabs [Music] no they're actually four thousand dollars so sorry to i'm sorry to so sir dirty i love your information i appreciate the help and everything but you're a little bit incorrect there brother um yes of course the video at least i well i mean bubble man pro had had published tutorials on full mel dry sift and static tech six years ago so that makes sense as far as the drying being done with a freeze dryer oh yeah sure it's a great way to do it but old school microplaning and and drying um on cardboard honestly if you know what you're doing if you know how to keep your room cool and dry it can be very dope aside from that even whether or not you're freeze drying or not you're going to have to microplane um unless you're just going to stuff chunks of well you know i have no way of doing static technique the same thing as you were thinking security i'd like to check that yeah oh of course we know that's v man yep it is you're absolutely right sir dirty it is very simple the uh well there's the [ __ ] [Music] oh he's always doing it dude that's that's all that's like every single day for solving this bacon big he goes live for like four hours at a time and washes and presses and you know all that that's what's up yeah so depending on if you want a pharmaceutical freeze dryer which for the record if you're going to get one through low temp um and we are we're only talking about harvest rate i am not going to speak on anybody or any other company's freeze dryer if you're going to go through low temp you're not you're only going to be able to get a pharmaceutical one and they're not and that's not 2 000. they do have a small freeze dryer that's like it has three shelves it's very very small if you don't need a pump or anything like that if i remember correctly i think it's uh we could just look it up i think it's like 25 maybe maybe 3 500 but if i remember correctly actually i think the medium one is because i was looking at the medium one with a pump and it was going to be right here just over four just over four grand i'm so interested in that uh [Music] i love it i love it um yeah i'm so interested in this static tech austin what you got what you got that's new yeah you and that's don't even get me started on that oil free clown so you know dope about fire fire driveshift if you accidentally [ __ ] around and get and get caught answering some questions on youtube and just watching your [ __ ] burn there's the 120 micron obviously buttered to hell because how long i let it sit on the press but i don't think it's gonna hurt it [Music] all right let's press the big one and then let's go take a dab and then i need to get the [ __ ] out of here but i like to say dear tate because it reminds me of joe dirk [Music] oh that's right yeah okay a moderator i understand i'm sorry i've been so into reddit lately you guys that it's just usually i mean bops are mostly moderators over there but anyway i get what you mean now you got a blue ranch when you go live with them and you help them keep [ __ ] together [Music] i know homie i'm waiting for my taxes to come back so i can make skunk man austin god damn it yo if you don't know anything about skunk man sam you actually don't even know anything about triceps and sir dairy that's you seem very knowledgeable and i don't mean to say that to be rude but i actually you're pretty knowledgeable so you probably know who scott manson is marcus himself bubble man himself shouted out to scott manson without skunk man sam we would be we'd be a long way behind in the full mount [Music] there we go there we go probably let that guy warm up for a little bit too long but that's okay that's the beautiful thing about pressing at 155 degrees you got a little bit of yeah a little bit of leeway looks like there's a couple of you in here hope you guys are having a good day i am wrapping up my work week we're trying to anyway i'm gonna have to come back tomorrow of course but here we go let's get a little bit of frozen banana dry sip hash rosin glow for you again remember guys i didn't really clean it we certainly didn't break out any static tech we're just trying to get some dabs for me to get going with skunk man sam is the [ __ ] man just i gotta say it again austin you know what's up hey thanks mojo i laven if you're old school weed too you remember brett mavericks using the static tech on a pool table with the playing card brett maverick used mavic was that that's that's long enough static tech ago that that's before uh i was seeing people regularly doing it with books and dvds and things damn see i knew we had some crossover man i love solving this bacon bank he's such a cool dude and you ain't kidding i do need a netflix series and i'm down for that pay too um but he is such a cool dude and i just like what he's about um i of course i'm i'm kind of busy doing the same same similar stuff so because of that you know oh i have the timer set for 90 seconds i'm gonna press a little longer than that it just we're probably about 110 right now um [Music] also i don't want to get too crazy with the pressure because i just want this to be fire i don't really care about you um that's a shitty thing to say yeah but solving this bacon baby's such a he's such a cool dude and he's just he just seems to be so like the thing i some people are like so you could say that but they're just so nice i don't get that with him i get to know [ __ ] from him i like that you don't need to be [ __ ] nice for me to be a fan of yours you need to be about your game and he is he's about his game i just don't know personally i get silly with trying to be nice to everybody again some presses you just don't [ __ ] care about the yield this was on the plant how long ago did we start streaming 21 minutes ago this was bud a little over 30 minutes ago now let's see here's our first press this is our one yeah this is the big microphone i think that stuff's going to be better 35 40 minutes ago for sure this stuff was flour in a plastic bin in a tupperware you know what's that you know what time it is only i had a [ __ ] rig ready over here [Music] better not take forever geez my desk is messy i'm so sorry you guys let's uh just bring you in on about that much of it so you don't have to look right at all oh i know what i want to show you so that's the this is a little bit of frozen banana dressing pass rosin that we just pressed together we made it [ __ ] around with the card didn't that card moved it around a little bit let some of the let's let gravity do most of the work for us and uh there we got those two processors from it i couldn't absolutely get a second press and i will later earlier today what did i press oh this is nightwing so here's some night queen dry swift rosin that i pressed a couple hours ago and this is the second press i never [ __ ] with second presses unless it's good hash good hash will press two sometimes even three times if you're not if you're if you're doing short presses or whatever if you're [ __ ] it out you shouldn't have to press it three times but anyway i just want to share that a little bit a little bit a little with you we got some super fire rosins for dab on and um we made them all from the plant to the parchment ready for the bag and it's just 45 minutes tops where are you where are you oh you guys wanna get silly little slurper dab i just saw the case over here don't do that that's how you lose a marble all right guys i gotta have that gauge up all right how we doing how we doing how we doing just so you know i can't see you and i have no idea what the hell is going on but i love you guys [Music] [Music] all righty then [Music] let's uh let's start this [ __ ] off right i'm going to start it off with that second press from the uh from the night queen oh [ __ ] i forgot that i'm working one thing [Music] and by working i mean taking a break i like to take a break about every six to eight hours yes i do work 12 hour days 10 to 12 hour days today is going to be a pretty short day though i'll be out of here i'll be out here right around 10 hours um anyway yes we'll slow down the recovery there a little bit so i can play with you guys for just a minute come on guys i think i just want to look at the picture of that deer pooping now so again give me something let me know what's up give me something to read in there sir dirty had all sorts of good information i do i hate that i'm so uh contrarian and so oppositional and i'm sorry about that but it seems like sometimes like somebody i mean regardless of whether or not he's right about the price we can agree to disagree or just look it up or whatever but i don't know why i have to oh no you're not right he [ __ ] cares if any of us are going to buy a freeze driver we'll find out by the time we check out you know what i'm saying you know what i'm saying there we go that blazer though all right so we're going to start this off with a excruciating dab of the night queen second press tricep hashgraph oh i barely even smoked last night i certainly haven't smoked anything yet today i've been working for since 10 when it's about 7 30. [ __ ] i'm at nine and a half hours now it looks like it's gonna be more like an eleven-hour day whatever where's that second graph that's not it that's not it that's a good problem to have right you like that you guys this is the other reason why i want to do a dab with a second press to start and you might be able to pick up you guys having fun watching me let me watch when i finally get my youtube page pulled up here on my laptop i'll be sitting here by myself i mean i don't know how anybody wants this [ __ ] i gotta be [ __ ] annoying as all hell but i love you guys and i love sharing my little bits of knowledge about how to make hashish with you well and don't worry guys if i knock this rig over digger gave this one to me um for court sales i want to say three years ago so it's a decent ring but it didn't cost anything surprise says oh that's me right there i was like i call myself a surprise set all right here we go oh that's that's actually a very big dab already cheers ladies and gentlemen oh my god i'm not even gonna be able to dab the president that's some night queen and really it's like trim then keith that i threw over a screen real quick and it was so terpy i almost couldn't even i really whoa that must be good where there's the very turkey dab one of you what whatever mcafee any cheers come on dude my antivirus pop up was cracking the comments and then thank you elite uh 27 m uh 27 32 and four and that's for the regular and that's in us dollars iso um but that's just a regular freeze driver it is a food grade freezer option but it's not the pharmaceutical ones which have way way way more um options and settings that you can play with as far as dry times dry times depth of vacuum temperature sublimation is a really amazing thing got me by the nose it really did too man it's like uh and honestly that's the oh that's the second press um mixed micron or whatever it didn't it doesn't have a very clean melt to be perfectly honest with you i'm a little less than impressed with that there's absolutely no char or particulate or anything it's just a little darker than i think it should know anyway let me set this down over here or not shut this down oh man yo night queen [ __ ] give me a break jesus i have never experienced that strain being that loud before um i i've washed it and pressed it i have some sugar of it it's just amazing but never had that happen jesus this frozen banana [ __ ] looks amazing this is not frozen now that's good man all right there we go now this should be the bee's knees wait that's the night queen again i can't do that it's definitely gonna be good that's the 120. the 120 to 159 oh all right here we go no he said it was 2k for a freeze driver and it's 2700 and if you're in canada that's more like three um so he was off by 50 number one and then number two that's if you if you have a pump if you need a pump too it's more unless i'm mistaken if that's the price with the oil pump the other thing is that anybody trying to get one of these to use it in a setting like i'm trying to use it in is not looking for an oil-free pump the oil free pump is like an extra six to eight hundred bucks so at that point it's 35 for the small one and for the record that freeze dryer is so [ __ ] small you're gonna be pissed at yourself for spending three thousand dollars on something that small when you could have spent four thousand on something that is significantly better but still goes back to my point i just i don't know why i always got to be right anyway that's fair and honestly that's the thing is if it's a thing to waste and you're like a hobbyist or whatever damn you're really going in on your hobby but for me i look at it as like well why would i spend two to three grand on something that then when i recoup the value for it it's too small so i mean um freeze dryer is on the schedule not sure what size i'll be getting but we'll see you know what's up it really does man what kind of class is on a dab right what would i say and then aside from that hello annie yeehaw right man damn i [ __ ] but i'm almost scared to go in on another job but we got but number one i need to wrap it up and number two come on jesus man i got dab sweats and [ __ ] my gloves all hashy man jesus and my hands are clammy now because they were in the glove that's probably why i was so hot it couldn't have anything to do with that dab i just took i'm sure it had to do with the gloves all right ladies and gentlemen you know how much i love you um i mean if you don't know who's being silly if sir dirty's still here let's haven't seen a comic i'm gonna walk but if you're stupid still here looks like we're going to split the difference um we're both no i mean to be fair i don't know i don't know actually i don't know about that before i think i just said they're not too um but also i was speaking about the pharmaceutical freezer regardless it is the morton salt girl except it's the morton salt girl taken and done by slinger which marble slinger is a glassblower but then he takes it and he puts an assault rifle in her hands and we have a salt girl that makes sense and this is a special february edition this one's called oh this one's called rain and blood that's right that was the other thing the slayer rain and blood um yeah i love slinger [ __ ] um but this is a this is the picasso version of the design super cool first time i saw it i was like that's like a morton salt girl and then i realized he's holding a gun and i'm like a salt assault like a salt oh god and i've been in love with it ever since because i'm an old nerd and when i see some [ __ ] like that and i think it's cool i never get over it jesus christ look at this [ __ ] frozen bananas you guys it's on was he i didn't know that was i didn't know that was with it but at the same time i was too you know hope you're still here if you're still here let me say something um that's what i was saying about the split the difference oh my god look at that melt you guys need to see the color this rosin is melting into uh [ __ ] dude i went in hot we went in just under 600 degrees holy [ __ ] you guys whoa hey what's up austin my homies in the northeast you know i love you i'm saying that a lot of them anyway that is a beautiful amount and if we were if you remember i was out of the right micron bag so i had to press that at 50. that's the 74 to 119 pressed in a 50 micron bag almost like the same size um you know not really but just a little bit so the fact that i knew that was going to be a little charry or maybe dark on the end as it did get a little char charlie when it dried up or finished but i cannot get over the color of that when it melted down was [ __ ] beautiful and it maintained its color for a minute tastes great tastes great it's a very interesting terpene profile um very very unique for me uh well you guys know it's got to be unique for me because every time i take a dab or a hit of anything i [ __ ] cough for 10 minutes and cry and that isn't happening so it must be different all right guys i was going to say have a great day but that dad was so [ __ ] delicious so delicious just like dog food tastes exactly like it smells delicious all right that's the low mic that's the that's the mids frozen bananas compared to this because this is way way way larger micron hash pressed out of a 50 micron bag so this is certain oh my god what do you guys think drop it i don't know sorry guys this [ __ ] is and i'd like to smoke something with some of my homies back home in missoula how is annie doing man thank you mom um reached out to me about um tincture help for either a sick person or a sick dog or i can't remember exactly but i wasn't able to find the uh micro encapsulation article i was looking for anyway uh it's been a while i'm glad you made it over so if anybody has the chance to try this strain frozen bananas this is my absolute first very very first experience with it [ __ ] uh don't get me wrong the guy that i the guy that i work with is an incredible brother absolutely incredible of the highest calorie so you know if you get your wheat from somebody that all the strains look the same don't be necessarily excited about frozen bananas it might not be that different this is very very exciting for me because it's so different than what i'm used to eddie peace 340. well that means it's 6 40 in california and almost 10 o'clock on the east coast cheers ladies and gentlemen that's exactly how you spell it with a k and one l oh my god wait you guys know i like that i like the flare for the dramatic but i tend not to exaggerate especially not when it comes to ash no cap definitely some of the best cash i have had hashtag that i've smoked so far this year period i don't care if it's from a hyperzone maker or if it's from the dispensary down the street this frozen banana ah find me um 120 to 159 the micron is dry ships hash rising is [ __ ] wild i cannot explain this taste to you guys i guess it is kind of mild like the way a banana is like a mild fruit but yo for real grizz that's what's up man austin where are you that's super cool yeah caspell's though also california's the only town county whatever it's the only place in montana that has a chick-fil-a so if you know what i'm talking about when i say there's nothing quite like the taste of [ __ ] hate oh you can only get it in council i got jokes open your heart let the hate out oh oh you guys i gotta lose some weight i gained weight during quarantine and then i just uh gained a little more love to michigan oh good luck with that because to be honest with you this is the problem the dab before this one i was supposed to quit and get and just finish what i need to do and be done but this [ __ ] is so good man so good nah anyway i hope you all have a wonderful week and hope you all have a wonderful weekend uh for those of you that are patrons or interested in becoming a patreon i'm sorry for those of you that are interested in patreon or are already patrons um i published uh one of the first of an eight video series um a couple days ago i've i have minutes maybe an hour left of editing for the uh part two part three is going to be wild it's going to be a celebration so far we're all only into hydrocarbon content but episode four if you can't tell from all these parchments around me is a dry sift and dry sift pressing episode so we got content coming go over and check it out if you like i and i say this because i encourage you those of you that are interested to just to go over and check it out it's you certainly you know pick the tier that you want with for whatever much you want to support me if you if you don't really give a [ __ ] about that and you just want to see what but what's up with the videos or if they're worth the money whatever then just do the small one you know either way you get to see with everything i just ask that anybody that has the ability and has any interest in helping to support me does that like mr david brazier has been like a [ __ ] high-level tear patron for a year and i mean i've while i think he's i think he's the longest that couple a couple of you guys have been rode with me and it's amazing but mr brazier from alaska i think he absolutely holds the record yes sir i'm gonna try i know this much up until um when i came to work today i had always had some hats you know what that or some oil or whatever but didn't really have any fire rotting feeling like my weekend's gonna be pretty sweet now let's get it started right cheers ladies and gentlemen after this i am gonna rock and roll and go ahead and finish my day pardon me i do encourage you to check out patreon if you're interested in processing a tutorial um hash tutorial but essentially processing tutorial content if you want to learn how to make some stuff make some high high quality stuff uh like there's there's a lot i number one i encourage you if you're gonna get into it to get a notebook my videos are you think my videos are long here the number two that's being published should be published tomorrow it's one right now i think i'm going to be able to knock down another couple minutes so if i should be able to get it to around one hour and 50 minutes it's just under two hours it's a [ __ ] movie i mean but it sucks and it's not entertaining however the amount of information in it is is probably pretty valuable um again check it out if you're interested if you're not i'm always here on youtube you can always email 710.consultations gmail.com you can always email the 7th extractions at gmail.com you're interested in booking a consultation and i'm actually i'm commenting from my 710 consultation so there it is 710.consultations gmail.com or you can text that number if you're interested in booking a conversation and for those of you that are interested in going over and checking out patreon that's great because i feel like i owe so much to the people that have supported me over the last year and the amount of content i i just fell short on being able to publish on time at all um i have this very very very comprehensive eight video series that i'm working on now and when it's finished it may be more like nine or ten videos but when it's finished i'm definitely going to turn off enrollment for a while um it's i uh it's hard when you finish a ton of content and then you need to get back to you know to work and or whatever you're doing and you have a new patreon patron or a subscriber or something come in and then you know their first question is when are you going to post something and i'm going like in my mind i'm thinking like i'm not even trying to shoot anything for a month so it's it's uh it's an interesting thing i'm not the kind of i'm not the kind of uh creator on patreon that like has a podcast going or anything that you would want you know that you check out regularly but there is a significant amount of information available to you right now and when i'm finished my a video series the amount of information that's available to you for the cheapest monthly subscription which is insanely cheap i think it's a pretty good deal i wish somebody would have put all that information together for me and been like give me a couple bucks and you can watch all these videos for a month all right guys yes you're absolutely right i didn't want so austin thank you um as far as things like if you might be interested in them like merchandise uh some personal time with me one-on-one stuff like if that's the kind of thing you're interested in there are some advantages to the opportunities but cheers ladies and gentlemen frozen bananas oh i'm under the same name i am everywhere brother however i do think it is all just one word i don't know why i spaced that either jesus that [ __ ] is so good i want to try a dab of it and save peace and kill the stream and that's my third day oh i love you guys but i gotta get back to it and get it wrapped up again i hope you have a wonderful weekend should anybody have any questions comments concerns anything feel free to go ahead and throw that in the comments section below and aside from that if you have any uh interest in a consultation inquiry you can email 710 dot consultations at gmail.com or you can text

"tt2jaAPM66I": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title we are going to be comparing live rosin and live resin first off let's get this out of the way live resin is made with bho which is a solvent and live rosin is made with no solvents then let's get that out of the way but the brands that we have in question here is raw garden and we got classics this being the live resin and this being the live rosin and i made a video on this one already but i did not make a video on this but i woke up today and i was just like i want to make a video so let's just see what i got and see what videos i can make so you know like i said i rarely get live rosin so when i do i try to make the most videos out of it as i can and once again shout out to p2ps for making this possible he gave me some funds to uh purchase some live rosin myself he didn't tell me to purchase live rosin but you know i figured you guys have been asking for me to get live rosin for quite some time now you know i don't get it all too much but when i do it's a it's a special occasion but once again shout out to p2 peeps he finally reached 1k on youtube here's hoping the 10k this year you know what i'm saying so like i said uh i did a video on this classics live rosin already but i didn't do a video on this but i would like to say that this strawberry rose from raw garden is super fire i will be giving you close-up shots and all that stuff but i would i wanted to make this video to explain the differences between live resin and live rosin because it's an only one letter difference and i feel like some people especially people get getting into cannabis or extracts and stuff don't really know what's up also take what i say with a grain of salt because i am not an expert in any way this is just me uh researching stuff from myself but live resin for those of you who don't know is basically the live and live resin means is when you harvest your plants and you flash freeze right when you harvest them instead of allowing the plant to cure over months and all that stuff and basically reduce the moisture in the plants but the initial moisture from when you just harvest the plants is the initial terpenes that you get from that live resin so right after harvesting you know how plants look super sticky when you just harvest them but then when you cure them they kind of like dry out and become less crystallized and all that stuff but when you just harvest them you flash freeze them you get all the live resin terpenes the initial terpenes that are there when you just harvest the plant usually extracted through a closed loop system using bho and all this other stuff but yeah that's generally how you make live resin live rosin on the other hand you would think you know you would just uh you know flash free some rosin or something and make it that way or maybe flash-free some plants and then just squish it but for those of you who don't know rosin is made by heat and pressure you know i've made some rosin on this channel before i use the the juice box which is a handheld rosin and basically you get a little you shape your little nug into like a hockey puck and then you squeeze the [ __ ] out of it with metal plates that are hot and in return you just get oil that squeezes out in between the metal plates and that's what you collect in terms of rosin but that is not live rosin that is flower rosin live rosin is a little bit more complicated that's probably why it costs so much more in terms you know 710 labs costing like 70 to 80 this might i add was like around 45 to 50 so still pretty pretty pricey uh but probably on the lower end of live rosins that you can get on the market uh but live rosin basically have to make ice hash which is you know you put your your your flour into like an ice bath and you shake out all the trichomes and then you filter it with micron bags and then you get like this bubble hash or bubble melt hash and then you smash it with heat and pressure and then that's the end result and the end result is a very terp terpy terp rich [ __ ] end result you know it is usually like whitish to brownish light brownish uh but the end result is very very good top of the line concentration you can get today is it's got to be live rosin so uh i figured i'd make a video comparing the two and yeah you know like i said it's not every day that i have live rosin in my inventory you know so uh i will get some close-ups on it but we're gonna be hitting it out of the smoke ski so let's just open this i do want to show you guys what they look like all right so we got the strawberry rose as you can see percentage right here eighty seven point five five percent tc not bad i will post the crosses post process but pretty much that's what it looks like i mean it's been picked up but definitely one of the the better raw garden strains that i've tried in a while you know don't get me wrong all of them taste pretty fire but this one stuck out very strong strawberry taste just all around good and then we got this one right here so this is the rosin as you can see right here the percentage of thc is not that as much as the live browsing but still very very tasty so let's open that for you guys sorry one hander so that's what it looks like not the greatest looking live rosing honestly it looks like some nasty crumble but i'll tell you right now the taste is there guys holy [ __ ] stevie really enjoyed this on the santa clara vlog those are what we're working with in this video i'm gonna take a hit of both and we're gonna see um i mean i kind of explained the differences between the two already now we're just gonna have to just hit the damn thing you know we're gonna turn on the smoke ski and uh we're just gonna let it rip i definitely used the [ __ ] out of the smoke ski yesterday so hopefully it's still running good it is that blue battery so might i add that this is awakened make as well so i won't go too too crazy but we are going to take some hits to say the least hopefully you guys have been enjoying the content lately i try my best to upload frequently so i appreciate you guys let's start that over again and uh let's take a hit so like i said i did try i tried these already strawberry rose phenomenal raw garden like uh if you're a fan of strawberry and you're a fan of raw garden i don't see why not you're not getting this uh because it's honestly one of them the raw gardens that stuck out to me most recently other guava cookies did too also but this one too so tasty still a little bit more in here i'm gonna finish that um but like i said as far as the taste goes very very refreshing uh very strong strawberry sweetness to it but as you can see it's 87 thc as well so it's definitely high up in terms of potency and the taste is there so i definitely would recommend for all you raw garden fans out there i'm saying this as i wear this sweater but good stuff let's clean that real quick let's take a hit of that all right take a hit of this live rosin about it i would like to mention is that when i put this onto the nail it kind of heats up faster than live res uh it starts bubbling quicker um i don't know if you guys notice that is too maybe it's the thinner in some ways i don't know but it just seems like it bubbles up quicker and it vaporizes quicker like starts bubbling quicker but cheers oh jesus okay there's something about live rosie it just tastes clean it could be just like the placebo of you knowing that it's solventless that you just you just think it's cleaner i don't know but it's for some reason it just tastes cleaner a lot more smoother the hits was faster that's why i cough but i feel like live rosin is but a bit more bearable in terms of uh smoothness or you know harshness so but with this video with the end of this video i will take this last hit and hopefully you did enjoy this video hopefully you learned something between the differences between live resin and live rosin because you know i would i would have loved to see someone make a video on this [ __ ] you know i'm saying i'm sure there's videos out there but there could be more you know so cheers this oh that is going to be the end of the video like i said hopefully you did learn something between the differences between live resin and live rosin you know there's a major difference in terms of price between the two so it's good that you know what makes them so different in terms of that major discrepancy and price you know what i'm saying but other than that hopefully you did enjoy the video peace out [Music] [Music] hey [Music] you", "i-43_r_zi5o": "all right it's all right for another diver of you anti we are smoking on don't [ __ ] say anything about my pronunciation but I think it's [ __ ] Oh Mikoto not sure I can't really pronounce it but that is what the card is looking like here's the back I'm gonna try to get y'all wish I can yeah oh let's get to it and it's all you know if they're got a voice we got the Highness we got the taste and we got the harshness off the hit so without a further ado and wasting time let's get this [ __ ] started and for you guys that I'm wondering while my carts are half ways because I do someone calls them down before make a video because I procrastinate and I'm slacking and I don't do my part as a regular or not a regular but a real oh it was called reviewers it should be a first-time sir you know I mean I just I get so into it I want to smoke and I'm so late all right here first time spoken all today mm-hmm getting pretty low in these carts so we have at first what I was going to do is stop smoking sir every time I finish a cart like I'd stop for like weeks but no I can't do that like I don't want to do that I can handle it but I don't want to I've done it before plenty of times you just because I didn't have we to stop smoking so what I've changed it to is that I'm only gonna smoke once so that's so much how to cut back instead of actually stopping at one point even though I would get me baked but do it alright today we're going to start with taste if anybody or anyone's ever had green apple of this it tastes more like green apple then green apple does it's very sweet smooth warning do not exhale through your nose where that [ __ ] does burn very bad we're gonna see green apple taste and I kind of like the taste of green apple so one through five we're gonna give it a 4.3 it just wasn't good enough to be four and a half now we're gonna go with harshness I know change right here in a second but right now it's just this little buzzy so harsh it's let's go I wasn't really painful it was more like it was [ __ ] with my head like it was just twirling I'm bringing around and making me do your spin really really fast and now it's just like I'm lightheaded but it's like a high light head is like like that that time actually took a better second but yeah it's not really a hard [ __ ] like yeah it's making me cry yeah tear up and [ __ ] but um-hmm a 1:15 and I don't know if it's a 1:13 with your folks I went to Temple um coughing it's it's pretty bad but like usually I feel like shaking up and [ __ ] and don't feel so nice but that was nice it felt good I even thought again now is that bad but yeah that was pretty good I like that so - we're gonna give it about it - I should week but it feels good like I like it no a [ __ ] sitter so you don't wanna be if you just want to feel good take nice it's smooth it's night Rhett definitely recommend this you only a bait I'm just talking out of the wazoo mmm Highness I feel like my moods changed it's not so tense because usually I'm very light and loose but today I've been all tense Oh since yesterday later last night I've been - I lost my wallet I just got me bones or not my bones but I got me I just I just haven't been in a good mood since lost my wallet oh my there wasn't a money or anything in it was just my tea it was like [ __ ] that [ __ ] that [ __ ] some more get another ID gay not some good dudes make some nude feel better so I'm a loser I'll probably go play something

California and their 300 milligrams each so this one is a sativa and it tastes and smells like elbow rubble smells and tastes like bubble gum it's actually pretty good ever I tried it and it's disposable so when you're done it that you just throw the way this one doesn't have much left and but here goes cheers and see you on the other side it is it is a bit hard to get used to it first but as you can see I'm still getting used to it but um it's pretty good I'm on one hit and I'm already feeling it so and it smells and tastes like double bubble so you can smoke it you know in the house we would ever enough people people probably just say you're chewing bubble gum I don't know as long as all thumbs library long photos library with the little key I don't quote me on that though okay so that was that one that was good I'm sativa it's thirty two point nine seven percent THC 0.09 percent CBD 0.27% CBN and that brand is Alpine sativa disposable vapor came as pretty good for twenty bucks it's three hundred milligrams yeah it's not that bad I actually really liked it everyone that I've everyone that's tried it to that node is like it as well so and then this one is the their indica version and it the flavor is fruity pebbles so kind of taste like that fruity cereal I thought some people tell me that it tastes like lemon it does kind of taste a little bit lemony but I can

jar Tech tutorial well not really jar take away my version of jar attack the reason I say that is because there's a bunch of ways you can do quote-unquote jar tech but the way I like it is to make the material really buttery and really hard so what I do to get that material pretty much all I've done so far is I squish seven grams of flour I put it it got it from the parchment and with my tool and I've put it on to a jar with no lid in between plates and it's out 1:29 and sitting at that for about 10 minutes so I'll come back to you guys and probably about half an hour to an hour once that's a little bit more buttered up so I can whip it and I'll let you guys know what I mean by whipping it then because you can see that's already kinda starting to butter up and that's what we want but we're gonna let it go for about another half hour to an hour so see you guys yep so what I have done here is I've pretty much just taken a little dab tours you can see right there there's now a little bit dirty and I've just stirred this rosin around I noticed that one part was getting really buttery but the rest was staying really runny I actually even noticed that it's trying to build like some sort of I mean try to zoom in there some sort of like little diamonds or like some hard pieces of rosin super-dope but um as you can see it's been whipped now and I'm just gonna put it right back in here this was about half a minute back this was about half an hour in that we whipped it so once again it's just insane out 1:29 it's been in there for about half an hour we just whipped it pretty much stuck a the blossom stick in there and stirred it around mixed it up for about 30 seconds to a minute and then put it right back on the plates and now we're going to sit there for maybe another hour maybe another 30 minutes I'll be back to you guys when that's 1020 minutes from the last video maybe I don't know 30 minutes in - after the whip as you can see we're having very nice crystallization you can see him some big diamonds starting to form we're gonna let this keep going let it keep buttering up and so they could keep doing its thing beautiful we're probably about an hour in since the last video and what I have here pretty much is a very stable a little bit buttery you can see the Terps popping up on top but it's pretty much starting to harden up and as you can see this is that consistently and see I said I wanted from the beginning although I'm still gonna let it go for probably about another half hour or so everyone and how's it going this is pretty much all finished up I started at 11:53 it's now 147 so probably took like a little over two hours I don't know but this is pretty much then the results as I like it this is very hard all of this pretty much puffed up and became very solid like it's all butter and that's how I like my rosin so if you guys don't like it like that you could have left it at the point where it's diamonds or whatever but once again this is just a little tutorial on how I like to do my rosin tag and the kind of results I like to go for kind of things I do and how I do it but yeah guys this is an official tutorial if you guys want any of things I used pretty much all I used was unlocks master unit two heaped up to press the rosin and to heat it up and if you guys want you can use this kind of code yeah I'm stoned and I'll save you guys a bunch of money on these presses or on DeYoung the mini that I used because this is where I made the rosin so I'm yeah if you guys more a mini or alex master you in there like that just discount code yeah I'm stoned one word you guys will be able to save some money at Knox Master Lock yeah guys it's the finished product I hope you enjoyed and thanks for watching", "tz6QveHJ4y4": "to smoke or to vape that is the question at least according to the state of New York hey guys Tara here for dnews and we've reached a turning point in our country where marijuana use is starting to become the norm whether it's medicinal or recreational andrew Cuomo the governor of New York State is expected to sign a bill soon that will legalize the drug but there are rumors that only certain methods of intake will be legalized specifically anything that does not involve the actual flower so edibles THC pills and vaporizing would all be okay now we've been hearing a lot of news lately about e-cigarettes and how those are supposedly better for your health than smoking actual cigarettes but how do we there stack up and are they better or worse for you than smoking say a joint let's go back to basics for a second now a raw cannabis plant contains over a hundred different cannabinoids which are chemical compounds that bind it to the cannabinoid receptors in your brain cells one of those cannabinoids is THC which is what's responsible for the psychotropic effects of smoking weight then there are others like CBD which gives you a body high but without all the mental fogginess now depending on where it's grown a cannabis plant will naturally contain anywhere from four to 65% THC and products with a high THC content like hash don't actually need heat in order to be activated you could still experience their effects just by ingesting them it's just that heating makes them even more potent now when you smoke a joint you're using an open flame which is very high heat and that combustion process activates the THC so when you inhale it the alveoli lining your lungs will deliver it straight into your bloodstream that's why you feel the effects of marijuana almost immediately after smoking vaporizers on the other hand use a process called conduction heating where either the raw plant or an extract of the plant has direct contact with a heat source but without an open flame so it uses a lower temperature and it heats it up just enough to be able to vaporize the THC that way you still feel the effects of it but without all the health problems that come along with smoking now much like a cigarette paper rising marijuana is still a relatively new thing so it's hard to say exactly what the long term effect but unlike ecigs you really don't have any outside chemicals to contend with so it's still widely agreed to be better for you than smoking burning marijuana produces carcinogens it can cause you to inhale soot and it can exacerbate problems like asthma shortness of breath and coughing basically it irritates the hell out of your lungs and there have been many studies showing that switching to cannabis vaporizers from smoking is effective for relieving those symptoms a 2007 study found that marijuana users inhaled fewer toxic compounds and less carbon monoxide when vaping compared with smoking it also tastes and smells better and from a medical standpoint it just kind of makes sense there's no medicine out there that you have to smoke in order to use so if the option to vaporize cannabis exists why wouldn't we use it well like anything there are a few caches for one paper izing can be way more potent than smoking and it's harder to actually determine how much THC you're getting many people say the effects of vaporizing lasts longer but also produce a more even high it also depends on your specific method if you're using dabs which are a super concentrated form of hash oil it can be really easy to overindulge dab users have also been shown to develop more tolerance to marijuana and have a greater risk of withdrawal which can lead to things like irritability and sleep problems even so it's hard to deny the relative benefits of vaping over smoking as long as people are responsible about how much they're dosing then this law may very well set a precedent for future marijuana laws what do you guys think would you support legalization even if it bans smoking outright or is this a step in the wrong direction let us know in the comments below as always thank you guys for watching", "jbn9-JQgw28": "[Music] what we have here is a sample of what we would get out of a supercritical run pressures of about 1,800 psi you can tell the consistency is a little syrupy kind of thick so harden up a little bit if you've got it in a fridge but what we're going to do now is go through the process of taking the plant waxes and fats out of this and come up with a sample that looks like this and this sample is good enough to pull up into a syringe and load it up into a vape pen we'll start the process here we'll go through the steps and see what it takes so first what I've got here I'm warming up some alcohol this is 200 proof pure alcohol we find it's a little easier to mix these two together when the alcohol is warm got a hot plate you can put it on a hot plate and use that as well just for convenience I have this sitting here so this is what we did I'm dry off the bottom we're going to take this over to the scale we're going to weigh it with this sample and what I found is about a ten to one ratio is what's been working well you know ratios you could use but ten to one seems to work really well for us so what I've got here is about 800 milliliters so that means I'd use about 80 grams of extract here so we'll stare that out zero the scale and we will dump in about 80 grams of this all right close enough and now what you want to do is make sure that you've got this sample stirred together as well as you can there's methods for doing this as well just for our sake right now I'm just going to stir it up it's the same stick here that I've put it in with but you want to get a blend here you want to get this whole thing blend together so you don't see a mix here at all they self they actually sell plates you can stick this on that will warm this up with stir sticks on them as well so that you can sit there and have it automated and stirring a product for you but you definitely want to get a good mix on that so you don't have any any clumps or anything like that I can see clumps on the bottom so make sure you get all that off mix all that together as well as you can okay well after we've gone through that process what we're ready to do is I like to throw a glove over the top of that just to keep any contaminants or anything from getting into that and at that point we're ready to put that into the freezer take a look at the sample that we've had in the freezer now we recommend 24 to 48 hours is a good time for for the separation to happen so let's check the freezer its head to the funnel we've got the funnel in the freezer as well the main reason we do that we don't want to shock the sample with heat or with a vast difference in heat so if we freeze the funnel we get that closer to the temperature we're able to preserve some of the oils that might otherwise get damaged with heat let's grab the funnel and the filter now with this process you're going to need a little rubber stopper here that actually just is like a spacer between here and here which creates a seal because we want to hook up a vacuum line into a vacuum pump I'm going to have that in there with a good tight seal and then I'm going to lay my filter in all right back to that and we've got a little spray nozzle this is a spray nozzle alcohol I will take this and I'll pre soaked this filter just to make sure we get a good seal with the bottom of the funnel you see the bottom of the funnel has holes in it and when we turn on the back you're going to see that suck that paper right down to the bottom of that funnel and that's what we want that way we keep the edges filled so we don't get any of that oil to go past or 100 needs of our filter and back down into our sample once we have our sample ready and we're pre soaked here we've got a seal just start slowly slide that to the top of the filter and you'll start to see it come through first they're poor in the church with his blow pressure then they're taking that out and putting that in the oven and be carving it bring that back in the system is running it at higher pressures you can get everything else flood and then reintroducing it sir boil to the other one so that's for the guys who are hardcore enthusiasts you want the cannabis Terps reintroduce back into you can see what's happening here see the difference here yeah got some liquid here on this side saying salad but here I mean look at all that guys save this and it'll still have a small trace amount of THC in it and they'll take you to make that into lotions or so it's gonna end of my sliced ice cream right looks like though they don't seem what's good left until it's light job scope and with this process and actually refrozen of sample this is you can do this and they save up to three times probably I saw that on your video yeah like two or three times yeah if you wanted to get it receive a lot of very small a lot of times via satellite that rolled and I ran through this yesterday the same process I took this yesterday and I want to see what's going like that it came out real nice and clear see the floating same man so even when it came out real clear looked fantastic and I thought you know there can't be anything left in there sucking in freezer again overnight and there still is so it's really funny I feel like if I ran through that process one more time to go shut down pull the back in and there you can see don't come any to check always what okay so that's what we've separated there with that process okay from there we are going to take it to the rotovap data is really important so you guys are going to do trial and error so the only way you're gonna be able to figure out where you stand is by collecting data yeah right so I'll show you an example of a worksheet that I have that I use of the information that I'm collecting I'm practically and you guys can figure out what works best for you but we found that you know collecting all the data you can just helps give you a baseline and to improve your product and repeatability is such a big thing you want to be able to repeat the same quality of last year this is a two liter flask and it's a standard ground glass joint so you guys wanted fish them last way or anything okay fine tip it down alright and you you want to explain the advantage of this oh sure well we'll see what we're when we're pulling it out depending on the viscosity of the oil when you're finished it can sometimes be very thick yeah and and then it's difficult to get it out of the area what we've done before I'm seeing people do is put the bottle upside down and let it drain we've seen people use a heat gun put it in an oven you know kind of warm up the oil and get it rating that we were doing it the top after we took it off the root of that so it actually flowed out pretty well what this bottle does is it has an adapter piece this isn't f1 it just gives you a wider mount so just easier to get a tool in or anything if you are doing anything nice we'll see getting it out you know these are the standard bottles like I said getting it before out of here if you all becomes very thick this is difficult and you may have to add you know something using the heat gun you don't want to do too much you have a hot spot designing the oil industry yeah so you know you're gentle but at the same time you want the stuff and back into like a hot water bath you could just a warm it up people to get that gentle warming and then put it upside down we just we took it off the rotovap it was still warm and we put it upside down and it was able to flow out okay you know but I'm using it practice it is when you start right yeah yeah it makes it easier use it and really if you're learning from multiple samples of the same things don't worry about getting every last drop out of it it's when you go transferring between different strains something like that yeah you know you're going to have to clean that out even in that case you're not going to necessarily lose at all because you can wash it with alcohol and then have an alcohol flask let's just say let's go between down now that I hear that good so we're going to take this sample though we use a little photo here industries you could use a bigger one if you like I'm singing a Phillies big moment that that whole combo I think Nick was talking about is on the website the combo includes the funnel and this flat for 550 I think Oh to that angle yeah yeah all right the winner will go to the rotovap and this is really easy setup here good thing see how that threads in and out Josh so we're going to bring it out here a little bit got this lip on here it's going to go underneath this clip right here and take it here see it just clipped so what I'll do is I'll start to thread it up a little bit till it gets closer where it won't fall back down just kind of hold it up in place felt like that when we turn the vacuum on the vacuum you don't want to tighten it too much I've too much data and that lip on that is kind of rounded so if you did it was kind of it might have sexy to pop over this know what I mean uh-huh so you just get up there snug like I said when we turn the vacuum on vacuums going to help hold that on there you know so flashings in place now I'll go through this real quick here it's pretty simple easy up and down buttons are up and down up and down for good gonna hit the head ultimatum gotcha okay if I want to say I've got this shows your bottom and solid stop for your bottom basically we're going to come down yeah so it came down and stopped at five point nine okay and you can adjust that just hold this button to set that and then that says here right there kind of like what not good that was probably at the right depth right there to you when you say tool and what I did is I change I changed my zero day the heart stops at zero to say zero yeah yeah so then you can walk around the mic dial dial until the point and if you put it in five point nine then press and hold it then it'll say five nine there that's the new zero well then it will know that and that way you just can't bottom it out you try to hit the bottom of the yes okay so that's up-and-down for that temperature set is right here you have switched up here and now I'm controlling temperature here what yeah I we started it yesterday at sixty see guy Celsius yes and so once we get that set to where we want it and click this button right here that's on and off for the bass there I think Roland just turned it on because I just shut it off so what's happening with this blanking right here to show you that the bat is warming thank you yeah and once it gets to the temperature 60 it stays it okay I said a sample that we came up with her yesterday all those and alcohol says stop condensing then this is a simple and that's when you said you took it and that's about the consistency we're gonna get that okay great and stuff we got with a lot of very hot if that were true sorry this shirt give me that so we started with a message right cool Oh dance hall said yeah that's right there is definitely a nice consistency and quality for putting it so they as realize exactly that's what wind up with this this KNF unit is a fantastic city was great yeah a little bit okay right then I just have one more question for okay just because we're using a different machine you know for ours when you take this and you take this and you hook it up the way that he did on the end of there mm-hm then what would I write there yeah you can have a disconnect at or this is just a hole for us I'll do it I'm just gonna break vacuum on this with this is just the boss I mean so you can disconnect this if you wanted to put you know a key in line if you were going to be doing it on a regular basis you know we didn't want to have to keep pulling this off oh I can say I know a piece of - even though I'm able to - sighs but that's all we've done then I just you know so now there's no vacuum on this you see the get alcohol ooh got yet no nothing so when we do that then we just turn this on 100 I'm hydrated for vacuum for vacuum filtration and the concern is what we're talking about before you don't necessarily want to pull as strong a vacuum as you can because you'll start to pull down you can rip the paper or start to tear those sounds and things down through the paper and then you're gonna have to do it you know another filtration and seventy-five to a hundred it's a little bit of a general you know you don't our machine 75 to 100 okay you don't need to pull all the way down to a you know a descending vacuum for filtration you you just want a vacuum assist just help me counselor how we looking Roland getting down then let me get to either will it stops dripping you know right now pretty much got yeah and that's the question to its you know you're saying it's much thicker so the question is how much alcohol you want to take out do you need to remove all of it well for face you think yes and that's a question what you're doing you know what you're going to do with this afterwards yeah put edibles we'll just take it straight out of the first one take all the wax out right if you don't have to do those steps you know I don't know that's awfully push it is easier to work so Nick this morning that a lot of guys can take our customers have been taking some of this extract straight out of the cup and then just mixing that diluting that and there's solutions out there PPG are probably propylene glycol isn't like that they using e-cigs right but and then this coconut oil a more natural approach right so the guys can take that right out of cup and mix that with that consistency that's good enough to go into a pen right so a lot of guys are doing that just like that the problem becomes you're cutting the concentration of your extract so right you're you got the plants and are the the fats and waxes mixed in with that too which will cause some issues in a bait pen right yeah so you're cutting concentration risks you're not so and then also they introduce terpenes from other plants you know terpenes are common throughout the plant families after you have like say this right here would be fantastic because this is just your straight oil we haven't cut this with anything right - alcohol I see how that is turning the syrup and you can just kind of see the syrup in that normally the one that he gets moved after huh you can do that yeah you just unscrew this one we can I counted this it comes with both oh it does yeah come come both yeah so you'll have at least two flat all right this is Swiss made a mess German to release the back yep so over here about to hi Todd but not yes yeah it's been ticket row yeah okay push and hold that long I push the stop button first I hit I'm in just push and hold Vince out come in this and come back up yep there you go right you transfer it out of this would be a lot easier I like to wear the gloves it gets sticky your stuff is tough to get off your hands right you really only need to get real crazy with cleaning like that when you're going to change strange writing you running different materials and you want to make sure you don't have any cross-contamination then that's when you need a about cleaning right this is one and they've got they've got this too but they got the two liters right that's correct yeah so this is a three litre usually gonna be a bit smaller than this one it will still have to hang tight yes the opening here so you could definitely get in there with a better tool and get that clean down so much is good yeah exactly and again washing that off if you're going to change samples washing that off with alcohol real well and saving that alcohol and a flask that is just for that sample will be the way to do that and this fits right on - right this fits right onto here yeah it is funny so that's it okay same setup the only other thing I didn't really show you on this is a the ability to adjust see what this is doing is tilting the whole thing and so that's so you can figure out how to get the majority of this into the water right so for your flute sitting here you can adjust the angle great exactly just depends on what you've got in there so you got the ability to do that in the end okay I think you guys will have no issue with any of this equipment and this is probably more complicated than that so I don't think you'll have any issues with that you know as far as a cleaning process hey did I really just say that it's first cleanup or anything else on this maintenance wise do we have anything if they have to standard maintenance you know there is a two-week sit if every splashing there's a tube that runs through here and there is a seal in the top here we just take this office here that you know there's a problem with the seal it won't hold vacuum so see how this comes apart I'll do is if you could hold this so that way I don't have to take any of the coots or wives or or even the bottom off okay okay so that that's all together okay this comes off don't think your name to rubber seals holding that in place on inside there's a button underneath I'm sort of doing it okay okay cuz otherwise this your spins can't press the button underneath and then locking blue okay now this is a yo-yo Scotty so this is the part that will wear out over time but we shouldn't be talking about any time in the near future so now you know to me again but we have these available and I think they're about 60 bucks and then it clicks into place so where this could have lights in you I see that oh yeah yeah so that seems easy to take out and clean as well if you have to where you get the bump we're talking about is oil carryover then you can see how this comes before it yeah why would you have that much maintenance if you do it the right way you do it later yeah after cleaning itself yo this girl is actually on first yeah you kind of feel just by rocking that around where that needs to be all right that's it let's just for just four stakes here figure out what the dump the rest is in here and we'll go get an idea on how much of the alcohol we actually uncovered that's about where I started it is amazing when you watch that we just had this nasty concoction of stuff put together with this and we were able to make it look so clean right alright well what's happening is I mean alcohol is a different boiling point then then the other oils too so even water so I mean when you figure out what that temperature is with the vacuum it makes the process extremely you're going to leave that much in there but again gets you a little spray bottle with your alcohol and then just spray it down and then I like to just give it a shake shake everything up try and cook the whole inside of it and then just clean all that up and save all that into another flask lay down label it whatever if if you're not just dump it out reuse it just dump this out and just put any sample in here if you got the same sample there's not much worried to clean it like that well I think that about covers that you guys [Music]", "WiMcXcdtMjI": "yo let's go to YouTube is Papa Shan here and today I got a triple threat for you guys I just went to TLC and they dropped three new flavors that they have never dropped before and those strains are the hippy Crashers the mitten cake batter and lemon drizzle and these are [ __ ] far you guys I'm super excited to try them all out so in this video today we're doing a little stream review I'm gonna show you guys up close and personal each of the nugs on each strain and then we're gonna try it out on the bong big bong rips you guys already know it but yeah let's get right to it I'm gonna show you guys the notes so to start this off I got you guys some mitten cake batter this is mint and cake batter number five I think they only dropped to fie knows when this came out but I'm gonna show you guys number five the genetics that make this up is mint and cake X Cushman's it's an 80% indica 20% sativa I test it out at twenty four point three eight percent THC point zero four percent CBD and twenty eight point eight four percent in total cannabinoids you guys this is gonna be super fire I already opened it up and tried a little bit of it you guys so I already know but let's open this up and show you guys what's up with it as soon as you open this up it smells [ __ ] amazing you guys the nugs all just dump this out it almost looks like a gelato to me first thing when you look at it I don't know if you guys can agree or not but um oh and like wedding cake to wedding cake angel out a little bit super frosty very dark green you got the orange hairs in it - [ __ ] zoom in just a little bit see the goodness focus there it is super frosty smaller nug but still gas cracker open Wow super healthy but you guys I cannot wait to smoke it oh yeah this [ __ ] almost smells like gelato it smells really dank - I got the mitten cake I've never heard of mitten cake before you guys that's my first time so and it's got Cushman's in it so that's what makes it so dense like a cookie gasps snugged you guys let's smoke this in the bone all right so we got the mitten cake batter all loaded up in this bowl let's go y'all Cheers baby drool damn yo that tastes super super dank oh my goodness just like a cake oh alright so up next we got this lemon drizzle here and this is lemon drizzle number 18 and they dropped a [ __ ] ton of phenotypes when they dropped this like 10 to 15 different ones but like I said I'm only gonna show you guys number 18 the genetics that make this up is gonna be wedding cake X lemon tree that's a eighty percent indica 20 percent sativa and this tests about at twenty point five nine percent THC point zero four percent CBD and twenty four point three three percent in total cannabinoids you guys let's open this one up show you what she looks like Oh as soon as you open up the bag you get a hint of lemon just right at your nose like I said I already smoked a little bit of it but still these lugs you guys super green you got the orange hair there's no purple in it but still looking amazing this [ __ ] smells bomb - you guys super lemony very lemony you could definitely tell the lemon tree inside of this let's crack this one open better focus oh yeah healthy but on the inside look at that super frosty I like it I like the smell on this too very lemony but sitting on the bomb guys all right we got a big old bowl of this lemon drizzle here hopefully she tastes just how it sounds Cheers oh damn just like a lemon slushy all this [ __ ] Wow oh my god lemons y'all that's all I gotta say are y'all last but not least we got the strain hippy crasher this is gonna be hippy crasher number four and just like lemon drizzle they drop the [ __ ] ton of phenotypes for this one as well but the genetics that make this up is gonna be wedding crashers ex Cushman's this is a 80% indica 20% sativa just like the last two strains it tested out at 20 point six 1% THC point zero three percent CBD at twenty four point three four percent total cannabinoids I'm super excited to see this strain you guys open her up super good bag appeal smell is sweet already you got like a orange orange eNOS to it I guess you can say almost like purple punch look at this nug just first nug you pick out beautiful amazing I don't even want to break this one open I'm not gonna break this one open just admire her super dark purple dark green you got the orange hairs to it super frosty I'd have to say the look on these mugs you guys definitely my favorite out of all three oh my goodness look at that let's break her open this oh let's zoom in a little bit stupid gasps healthy nugs on the inside purple green frosty oh my goodness watch we had no go probably stay together so stinky too sticky dense I love this note though y'all oh my gosh alright let's load up a fat bowl of this see how she tastes alright we got the last bowl of hippie crasher here like oranges like big stones oh my goodness I like that damn but if I had to take my favorite out of all three of these I would have to take you to the hippy crasher or the mating cake batter just because I like the strong taste I like the cake taste in it hippy crash we've got wedding cake in it and the mitten cake batter of course has been taking it I've never heard of that strain it's my first time hearing about both these two of course by jungle boys super fighter you guys I'm big stone after taking all three of these hips but yeah I'm gonna get out of here peace out you guys have a good one you", "0w1alT6bOKE": "yo yo yo what's up everybody it's luke with owls for another episode of al's tv i am fired up today no steve he's not gonna be here for the week but i am just pumped about what is going on with owls i literally just got off the call i just got off a call with uh shantae hannah uh if you see she's been dropping lots of comments below and it's just this sort of you know when we get this cohesiveness of people who aren't actually here in the office but are really a part of owls and we were just going off just a bunch of different names for for for the new al's tinctures and we're just talking about getting reviews set up and selecting people who actually want to get owls out there and and should review the products too and so just trying to build the infrastructure right now is really fascinating and my job right now just just are on the same page i mean my job right now is to build out this team and right now we're building out the sales team because i'm only one human being and we have you know and steve's been helping out too but we're building out a whole sales team right now so that i can then move to another part of the business that needs some attention such as new product development or um you know whatever it is that is needed and we're now seeing the hard work beginning to pay off the youtube videos are beginning to pay off and i see more and more participation with every video that we put out and i am just thankful for each and every one of you and it is uh it's just an exciting time to be alive i mean we've got delta eight being legal it's in nearly every state um people have access we can use banking and not only that but we're also in this new age where we're connecting with everybody and it's just fascinating to watch that the physical barriers are basically removed now because we have the internet and we have so much social connectivity that we can all be a part of something without having to be physically there and it is really just telling me that we are on to something huge and that means you are too when you watch these videos and yeah i just i don't know this video is just me speaking out from the heart i'm just like i said i'm really amped up right now we've got um three so so far for the al's tinctures let us know what you think uh we've got lullaby owl which i love i love we had a lullaby we had slumber owl but lullaby owl is where it's at and i really like lullaby owl then next we've got the amoro owl what do you think about that amoro uh so aperitif is actually before dinner in italian amoro is for after so to digest and de-stress and so i'm really leaning towards a moro owl i just think that's i got the amoro l it sounds just phenomenal and then we have the wise owl but now after the last two i feel like lullaby al and and amuro al why is al just almost sounds like it could be maybe it's simple it's just maybe it's too simple let me know what you think um but we've got those three teenager lines and uh they're going to be getting released soon just designed a labeling and yeah that's really it for this video gang i mean i just again i i just wanted to share that briefly with you i'm super pumped about everything that's going on with owls i'm really thankful for what i'm seeing with each and every one of you who watch these videos i mean we have people going into stores asking about owls we have p you know some people coming up with names we're now trying to build out the whole reviews because there's nothing worse than [ __ ] right nothing worse than [ __ ] and i look around at sometimes all these different reviews and i just like it just seems like a bunch of people who've been paid to write reviews and so i would like to create something or more like we would like to create something whereby we have transparency and honesty and straightforward reviews so i think we're probably going to end up doing something like 10 people are going to be selected to be a part of the review team and the review team will be there to make sure to give an honest review just like you know i was laughing and talking to shantae there and i mean it's so funny i gave an honest review about the apple fritters i don't really like it it's not my thing and what do you know everyone wants the apple fritter everyone wants to try it everyone wants to see it so uh what we're looking for is not a bunch of people yes men or yes women to be like yeah al's is great and everything about owls is great unless that's what you think if you don't like a flavor be honest about it and then we're going to come up with like a review system and have structure and then we would put those all together so it could be like hey strawberry cough got a seven out of ten out of you know ministry of al's review team and that was the honest review and that's what it says and the effects got an eight out of ten and the flavor got a eight out of ten or whatever it is and then we have honest reviews from honest people that are part of this team so every time that i'm talking to each and every one of you every comment that you're leaving or every time i hop on a call have a conversation with some of you you get me fired up and you get me thinking about other videos what we can put out so please more more more right if you have good ideas if you if you want to have fun right like this is the thing we are a lifestyle brand we are not a consumer brand right we are here to bring some fun into this thing we call life and i mean this journey that we're all on and what we're seeing here with owls and delta aid and marijuana and even mushrooms as as everything's becoming more legal and out there um we're all getting the chance to be a part of it it's not like all this big huge monstrous company here and whatever they do over here is like so distant and different from what i can possibly do as like little me it's like no get that out of your head like we all have a purpose and we all have value and we're all important and sometimes we just don't realize that and so we want to do our best here at al's to put the fun into life and just create something huge that hasn't been done before and that's going to happen with each and every one of you so please keep up with the comments shoot us ideas for different

by bezel extracts oh my god has that classic tangi smell a tangerine orange juice citrus explosion Febreze should make this in its brain Oh like you're chewing on an orange peel at the gas pump that's what it's like cheers y'all I can fit a whole grapefruit in this little thing that's like you cut a grapefruit in half and grabbed a spoon and you know old timey nineteen fifties breakfast you liked Angie you gotta try this one", "vwJ0cimzrKc": "mexico set to legalize marijuana becoming world's largest market well wowza bowser folks mexico is finally entering into the legalization of the recreational cannabis space and if you've seen my uh some of my previous videos you'd know that i've been heavily investing into true leave cannabis corporation ticker symbol tcnnf because i'm extremely bullish on the future of the mj space so any big news like this can have some massively bullish implications on the future of true leave and other businesses operating in this space as well so today i want to just explain what's going on in mexico right now and then briefly explain my thoughts on why this could all have huge and i mean huge implications for true leave and other mj companies operating in the us market so with that said let's dive right into it but first of course if you guys are new here please make sure to subscribe and also feel free to drop a like on this video to help support the channel but with that said let's get into it alright so as mentioned we just recently uh received some news that mexico's lawmakers have passed the bill to allow the use of recreational marijuana and this officially makes mexico the largest market in the world to completely legalize pot seeing as mexico's population is over 127 million people as of 2019 and rapidly growing whereas the only two other countries to fully legalize cannabis are canada and uraguay where canada's population is less than 28 million which is literally less than just california alone and then uraguay isn't even 4 million people yet and the growth in population here is virtually stagnant so needless to say the fact that mexico is fully legalizing this industry is going to be adding a massive market into the space and ultimately seeing as they're right on the southern border of the us i'd say that there's a good chance that some u.s companies might be operating in this space to capture some of that market share especially a business by the name of true leave who by the way operates nearly 50 percent of the florida market space and has a huge footprint in the southern us once again which is just over the border of mexico but of course this could just be me making some completely crazy speculations uh however with that said what isn't a speculation is that with mexico joining canada in fully legalizing this industry this essentially is just leaving the united states being the odd duck out right now being stuck between two fully legalized countries so for those of you who aren't any good with geography let's quickly take a look at a portion of north america and what we'll notice is that the united states is awkwardly squashed between canada to the north and then mexico to the south and now both of those countries are probably just staring at america like hey guys are you gonna legalize anytime soon and then on top of that you probably have even more pressure from the citizens of the us staring at congress being like hey guys so like are we gonna legalize anytime soon or what so needless to say i think there's a lot of pressure on joe biden and the rest of the government right now to get some bills passed in favor of the cannabis industry which by the way if you watched my previous video on truly and i'll link to that in the description down below this was a big reason as to why i saw truly being able to completely blow away analyst estimates which is that estimates were only for the currently legalized states and i'm kind of predicting way more states being legalized within the next several years which is obviously going to be dishing up way more and i mean way more total addressable market to true leaf now one thing i will say is that without trying to get too into politics joe biden is a boomer and he's already taken a stance saying that he's against the recreational use of cannabis but just like most politicians he slightly changed his tone to appeal to as many people as possible and he has actually taken a stance for being in favor of the medicinal use of cannabis so of course guys just my pure speculation here but what we'll probably see over these next four years is a federal legalization for the medicinal use of cannabis and this is obviously going to massively expand the total addressable market here in the united states but then even though biden is going to just probably take a passive stance with the recreational use of mj he has at least said that he'll leave that up to each state to vote on for themselves but of course guys if mj becomes federally legalized for medicinal purposes you'll probably start seeing states become less uptight about its use for recreational activity as well so yeah i think over the next several years we might start to see some massive adoption across the us and guys guess what guess who's one of the only largely profitable cannabis companies in the us that's right you guessed it true leaf and guess who will be able to use their profits to expand as quickly as possible in a financially stable manner once again guys you guessed it truly so you can probably see why i'm just continuing to get more and more bullish on truly now with all that said let's quickly do some back of the napkin math to find out a fully totable addressable market for true leave in the us over these next four years and let's assume that cannabis is federally legalized for medicinal purposes which means that these businesses can operate at some degree in all 50 states by 2025 and i'll make a video breaking all of this down and we'll actually dive into a lot more specific numbers in that video but for the sake of this video just for the sake of time and stuff let's just keep these numbers super rough cut just to get an idea so right now only six states are allowed to operate in the cannabis industry and by 2025 this market is expected to be roughly 12.5 billion dollars but guys once again that's only for six states now if we assume that all 50 states can legally operate at some form or another by 2025 then this industry will be much larger so let's divide the 50 states by six to get a multiple which would end up being 8.3 so let's just round this down and multiply 12.5 billion by eight which would give us a hundred billion dollars now once again these markets will be at different points of their development and obviously a large aspect to this is going to be each state's population and also their views on mary jane so this assumption of a hundred billion dollar market by 2025 is probably far too bullish but even if we toss let's say a 50 margin of safety on these rough cut numbers we're still left with estimates of a 2025 total adjustable market in the us of about 50 billion dollars and then let's just assume that true leaf can capture just 10 of that market guys that puts true leave at a 5 billion revenue run rate in 2025 which is literally right around what their current market cap is today now once again guys these are some super super rough cut numbers and once again i'm just making some wild assumptions on the future outlook of this industry and these assumptions still might be pretty far off in fact they probably are very far off but it's at least useful to get a rough idea of the future potential of this industry now here's the thing that we didn't even consider okay let's assume this industry is actually federally legalized even just for medicinal use this is going to cause some massive tailwinds for us cannabis companies because guys here's the thing right now u.s cannabis companies are still operating under a federally illegal industry which causes several headwinds for them okay number one is their tax rate which kim rivers who's true leaves ceo has said that true leave is stuck paying a tax rate over 50 percent now once this industry is federally legalized this tax rate will probably uh get cut down to a normal corporate tax rate and let's assume maybe 25 percent uh so this will actually give true leave an extra 33 percent of net income each year on top of this true leaf might eventually be able to list to a major stock exchange maybe something like the new york stock exchange or the nasdaq and of course this will allow institutional investors to invest more which would push up their valuation and obviously make it much more beneficial for truly to raise capital at a much more favorable valuation and then lastly guys banks could now lend to these companies and if true leave is still massively profitable which i'm assuming they will be they could probably get a lot of capital for some extremely reasonable interest rates which would obviously just help fuel their massive growth so once again a federal legalization in the u.s of some sort would have much more bullish implications i think just a simple expansion of the market share right it could literally even the playing field for businesses operating in this entire industry so yeah once again i'm just speculating on a lot of things right now and granted the news coming from mexico doesn't necessarily mean anything for the us markets right now uh is still definitely points to a step in the right direction in my own personal opinion and i think it's only a matter of time before the us follows suit especially since guys as i mentioned the us is now surrounded by two countries which have fully legalized the cannabis industry which like i said will probably put a lot of pressure on congress to pass some bills moving forward guys especially when you realize how much tax revenue and jobs this industry creates as well so to sum all of this up i'm more bullish than ever on this industry and i'm continuing to add to my true leaf position and i really hope we can see another pullback so i can absolutely load the boat on this stop but anyways thanks for watching peace guys [Music]", "qO-ycDA5vrE": "okay we're going to go through the terpenes now and integrity testing labs ok are we running a while yeah yeah they're fairly slow yeah yeah because they're so detailed yeah they're just so many to clear at you be back quite a few of my friends I receive I ok damage and this is a I think this one's a pecky language may not have to 2 pi n numbers and yeah being washed washed it out the ending ezio so you've been seeing very big God took apart Falls come through but we're just we're not doing a whole lot of juvie during the potency that I'm going to see Rizzuto some super currently carrying just get him I who cares what it smells like yeah down the optimum and so we can get a basic of a percentage sandwich so anyway guys we've got our test results here in our ethanol i'm going to show you we've got five thousand parts per million and that was coming out of the weed which so with those parts per million we can lock them down to zero you can either do that through many methods but through a Gitano oscillation agitation and just moving that material around to to allow that ethanol to escape from the resin so however you do that either through massaging the oil or just whipping it just aerating it and exposes the ethanol to the environment if you do use a lot of temperature you're just going to lose a lot of the your important two teams as well so that's why people use those property column purchase anyway there we have it and and THC count which I think they said the THC count was 78.1 that's for the total but yeah so we've got some big CB G's which is at 3.2 and CBD we have a four-pointer so and the THC was 69 anyway there you have it so we're going to wait for the counts for the terpenes and then we'll get back to this okay", "9Lm6y-eVcHo": "hello senior stoner fans this is the real senior stoner back at you welcome to the diamond discussion that's right today we're gonna have a very special discussion under magnification we have with us today our magnifying glass lit magnifying glass apologize for the light what we're going to do today under light is we're going to examine different types of diamonds and talk about them let's get started first we're gonna use and discuss excellence diamonds these are and will all be of the first batch california-based diamond manufacturers the excellence brand these are made in March they have a serial number on them all kinds of information about the backs because in California everything has to be tracked seed to sale let's take a look inside oh my goodness well when you get these under glass under magnification it's a different deal you can really look at the glistening you can almost see the terpenes inside so this is the excellence brand comes packaged in a glass jar the bottom of the box is a very interesting thing because on the bottom of the box you can actually see inside that's pretty cool thing another of my favorite brands is southern cow extracts this is Kiwi pie they call SoCal divers this is another one Kiwi pie that gives you the batch number the date package the THC content all kinds of great information comes packaged in a frosted glass labeled on the bottom with what is in their container and let's look under magnification and talk about it also wow this is a little different this has got a little bit of sauce going on I'm not a big fan of sauce but now that I'm doing real dab break it's okay you'll see inside there that it's spread out over a wider area not just the big rocks that we saw in the orange one okay this is Kiwi pie but SoCal dabbers I can attest to the fact that it's extremely tasty we also have violet black water og banana sorbet I'm sampling these to see which one I'm gonna go deeper on neon lights these are all individual grams and double train-wrecked so these are the two brands excellence and SoCal divers I also contract with a grower I think I've discussed with you all and within that I've ordered the following la cush cake in a custom blend oh my goodness Wow these are in fact true diamonds if you can see them glistening over there so this is the la quick take you know every one of these is gonna taste a little bit different so I'm gonna pick a few to dive with you all once I get this display mr. nice guy THC diamonds you all know the brand or the I should say the strain of weed mr. nice guy what I did was I asked for specific things specific ways and I'll talk about that in a second each selection besides the odor being different the texture is different you'll see in a second these are each two gram containers of these diamonds now we're going to go to larger containers we're going to go to five gram containers and I order a very specific type of diamond the next one's gonna be cold dry diamonds and can any of you guess why I use dry diamonds that's right for the Jimmy joints these are my five gram bottles of dry diamonds and on the inside you'll see that they're already sifted they're dry so they'll crumble very well into a joint and then these are my custom gorilla glue number four diamonds I buy these in chunks you can see the chunks kind of rattling around down there so what we've now explained to everybody is there's a lot of different kinds of diamonds out on the market okay and it really depends the flavor the tert profile that you're looking for what you're going to get they're all different and everybody has their own preference everybody likes a different type of diamond that's true we're gonna do right now is we're gonna try La Push cake la quick kick that's the one that is really shiny if you can see the glistening and we're gonna pack it onto the Rio let's go for it all the way what do you say we'll pack it onto the Rio let's go and get a dab speed and take a nice bit of the dad dust if you will boy it's really fluffy I like these lighter diamonds sometimes that aren't so dense like a stone you know I mean like like a real piece of jewelry no the lighter ones are sometimes easier to deal with but let's see how it performs in the machine light off here we go throw them else down well bubbling very nicely let's give it a roll right there boy that was tasty let's finish that up one thing about diamonds Wow they are strong they are strong now we've gotten really good about q-tipping after every use IQ tip the Banger they have to every hit I'm getting better at it so I hope you enjoyed this discussion on diamonds diamonds are from 79% to 97% the purest form of THC a you can ingest the reason I have these in different ways is I have different flavors I like different textures the dry diamonds to go into Jimmy joints the regular diamonds to go into a dab or a pen or an earache so there really a variety of diamonds out there now the other thing you need to look at with diamonds is the cost you can get them you can get diamonds for $40 diamonds or you can get diamonds for $100 you need to be really careful who you buy them from where they're made and how they're made a lot of knockoff diamonds on the market if you remember a thing called pyrite that was fool's gold and in the Old West fool's gold made many a ghost town so don't let people make really pretty shatter or really glisteny wax tell you it's diamonds a very different profile this has been the real senior stoner talking about dabbing diamonds I have a great day out there everybody and thanks for watching", "-x3UYdAmjos": "[Music] what's up everybody thanks for stopping by weeds reviews and checking out another one of my videos today some more products from a platinum vape new strands that come out that i was slacking on getting but i have gotten and i'm here to review for you guys today i'm gonna look at a sativa and an indica the sativa we'll be taking a look at is apple fritter and the endicott we'll be looking at is motor city kush motor city kush indica apple fritter sativa which one should we do first blindfold motor city cushion is one gram indica testing at 76.86 lab test 835. now this is indica so look for a relaxed kind of hungry euphoric thing out of this one at least that's what it says on the packaging again i will say everybody's body's different right elon some of it isn't healed some of us don't that being said screw this bad boy in let's get a taste of it that bubba um uh detroit was it bubba something about detroit bubba that i reviewed last time that was a really good cartridge from an indica strand um i'm hoping this lives up to what detroit bubble was motor city kush let's see boys girls yeah we have girls on this channel now hey how you guys doing for a while there's just us boys all right this cartridge is nice too cool this one has its own taste not really peppery like i was thinking we were going to see a lot of pepper from platinum vape now like it was going to be like their signature taste not the case this one here not peppery whatsoever real sweet decently real sweet diesel earthy taste no pepper whatsoever smooth nice tasting cartridge tell you what platinum knocking out of the out of the park at least with their indicas a couple of their hybrids nah i don't know yet like there was khalifa or that was cleveland khalifa kush with khalifa there was khalifa no they're uh khalifa kush it wasn't that great i was kind of let down with that one it was okay it was still like a three it wasn't like like hitting like a presto or uh you know like being like a a mittens extract it wasn't nothing that terrible but it was nothing great either like what you expect from planet vape like you expect kind of a quality cartridge quality cartridge sorry package quality cartridge every time from platinum vape because that's just what we're used to we're just using quality from planet vape when we're using instructions coming out kind of being shocked at how good they are because it seems like they're put way more and more into this they're coming out with new strands all the time now which that was something i had complained about with platinum how cool quality of the product was and how i would just wish more with strands would readily be coming out and that's something that they seem to be doing which other companies aren't you see mkx they're not keeping up with platinum vape platinum vape is blowing them out of the water right now because these new strands keep coming out all the time and they keep doing a good job with the ones that come out but every now and then out of the couple that they let out there's a few disappointments and that was one of mine so far motor city cush though definitely a five-star cartridge i'm not gonna give it up our sorry definitely four-star cartridge i'm not gonna give it a five yet because there's just so many of these other products that i still have to test i don't wanna make that make it so high that i have to keep giving out fives whenever you know there might be some fours and then one will be incredible to where it'll be at five but so far just a four nothing blowing your socks off but a really great cartridge again this was motor city cush indica one grand by platinum vape also i want to touch base on something you guys platinum vape's got a thing going on right now for the golden ticket when you buy a cartridge you get a golden ticket you win their little um sweepstakes that they got going on right now so they got a golden ticket sweepstakes going on right now we've opened three so far we haven't gotten it um i'm sure it's not gonna be too easy to get but it is a thing going on so when you open your cartridge look for your golden ticket willy wonka you want your golden ticket because that would be your golden chance to make your way because with the golden ticket it's a golden day you know come on people it's how it's gonna be so apple fritter sativa you guys all know you're on the channel you watch me if you can watch the channel i'm not a big sativa guy i test the sativas i do occasionally like to have steep around i have two up there so you know i open this one they're probably all going to fall nope i opened this about a month ago you can see i just really don't hit them that much i really don't his teeth that much um just because it's really not my thing and i'm more of an indica guy or a hybrid guy i'm really more of indica person myself if i'm going to buy a cartridge not just to review just a smoke i'm going to pick it in to come most of the time but this apple fritter was last tested 12 22 of 21 comes in at 70 76.6 we'll get off and take a look into it i had never known this around i actually went to a dispenser i never go to i've never really been to i think i've been to it maybe once in two years i went to it last weekend just stopping by coming back from my sister's place because it was actually close to there and it was a sunday and all the other ones were closing so i figured i'd stop by this one because it was on my way home it was close i could get there in the time allowed it and they happened to have this so i just grabbed it i seen it i was like um i've never seen it anywhere i'm gonna grab it so if you guys have seen this you already had it let me know in the comments what you think if you think the same thing if you haven't had it well we'll see what it's like together right away and outside of the cartridge is really sticky feels like maybe bad pour and maybe they clean it up as good as they should have but yeah the whole outside of this one's really sticky so this is the apple fritter sativa by platinum vape like like i said again 76.66 coming in lab tested 12 22. now this says it's supposed to have a real that's why you never go by what it says in the backbone i'm telling you you can't ever go by what it says this one says here it says earthy apple and sweet okay now i'm gonna tell you what it tastes like there's no earthy there's no apple there's no sweet it's a real chemically gassy off-tasting smell our taste and smell that comes off it not pleasant not whatsoever oh this cartridge is bad guys i mean i'm not putting on either i would give it a two and that might be pushing it i don't think i can even smoke this car the rest of this cartridge the reason being it's real chemically tasty it tastes like i'm smoking uh one of those trees for your car the air freshener trees that's what it tastes like i'm inhaling really bad cartridge i don't enjoy this at all elon even if he handled he wouldn't enjoy it yeah if you guys bought this dude if you agree with me let me know in the comments if you haven't bought it you probably want to think of it twice before doing so there's no apple to it there's no fritter to it there's nothing sweet there's nothing that tastes good about this cartridge and now like i said i'm not just putting on i'm not making it up if it was good i would say it was good i'm not just saying it because it's a tiva and i don't really like sativas because i there's a lot of stevia i did enjoy um this one here is just not there especially after tasting like trying like the new um detroit um kush and all those other ones and this it's just this just does fails in comparisons big time big time big time that's the apple fritter by planet vape i don't know if i would erect i can't recommend this car whatsoever i wouldn't say waste your money on this maybe if you're picking up four or four hundred you just want to try it or you haven't tried it you said [ __ ] it i don't care what this guy thinks i want to try anything for myself go ahead and do it but let me know in the comments what you think if you agree with me if i'm crazy but this cartridge here real chemically real are it just doesn't taste good at all it doesn't yeah i mean i can get a sense of what they're trying to do with the apple the other tastes there like this it just doesn't balance out well and it ends up tasting chemically yeah it doesn't balance out you can pick up the apple in there and what they're trying to do but it's just too artificial and it becomes chemically balanced tasting it doesn't it's bad it's not a great cartridge guys so that being said if you haven't subscribed guys i really appreciate you subscribing it would mean the world to me and if you haven't or if you have thank you so much you already know you mean the world to me i appreciate you guys i value all my subs so so much thank you we're still on the road to a thousand haven't really hit it yet but i know it'll happen i love you guys i love your support it means the world to me thank you so much i'll be back as soon as i can with some", "gBxDK8RyU-4": "what's going on y'all supreme reviews here coming back at you with another episode of dab talk a series we review cannabis concentrates in six different categories value packaging looks smell taste and effect we then take these six categories write them on a one through five scale add them up divide them by six which gives us our final score today we're going to be reviewing um a brand new to me brand called seattle private reserve they're decently popular they've been around for a while but i've never tried their wax before so i'm excited to try it so seattle private reserve this company has an interesting sort of history as far as i know so uh back in the day when my friends and i used well my friends would cop it and i'd go to their house and smoke it um their seattle private reserve flower i noticed just wasn't up to snuff they were charging a lot for it and every time we got it it just never seemed you know up to par with how much they were charging but as far as i wax goes i am uninformed i have no idea so i'm excited to see if their wax is different and i'm hoping that it is different because i've seen pictures of it on instagram looks quite appetizing so yeah without further ado we're going to get right into it here value so starting off with value this gram uh costed forty dollars so not too bad um at forty dollars a gram it's not cheap at all but for this type of quality at least from what i can see it looks really high quality so from this type of quality uh forty dollars is not not terrible at all um because you can pay anywhere from i'd say low of 35 all the way up to even 60 dollars per gram for something like this um so yeah i i think the value is pretty it's it's okay it's at 40 it's kind of expensive but you're not going to be breaking the bank for it moving on to the packaging here really really like this packaging so you guys can see here they got the strain name on top source cake and then got all this information here on the side all the stats all the terpene percentage everything like that and it's all in one glass jar no cardboard no plastic no extra added waste to this product really really happy about that i love this kind of packaging y'all i think the last video that had this kind of packaging got a super high packaging rating so yeah i love this kind of packaging so now for the open test here so i think you just grab it and twist or okay hold on so if you guys see these stickers right here you are probably it's your best bet to cut them so i'm grabbing myself a tool here your best bet to slice through them with something so that you can then turn it because using the torque to turn it like the torque from your wrist is probably not going to work so right now i'm going to use this tool cut a little bit of it so i guess that's my least favorite part of the packaging so like really my only part that i don't like is that you got to kind of do a little bit of finagling to get it open but once you do that you're going to get to the goodies it's because they have two like plastic stickers there's one cardboard sticker that one's not a problem at all but they got these plastic stickers make it almost impossible wow okay this is actually a lot harder than i thought not gonna lie right i think i got it okay this is actually annoying to open i'm not even gonna lie like what what is going on here what am i not doing right can't open it dude okay this is i can't open this this is ridiculous what the [ __ ] okay sweaty hands all right so this packaging sucks i can't even [ __ ] open it this is ridiculous this packaging sucks ass dude this packaging is terrible what the heck i can't okay well i can't even like what is this i can't i'm getting so upset right now i mean what is this going to take dude for me to open god damn man like [ __ ] really still not [ __ ] opening on me all right [ __ ] all right i think i almost got it okay this almost i'm so sorry y'all but for this delay but this is this is ridiculous this might be the worst packaging i've had on the channel so far okay got this [ __ ] open holy crap okay that took how long that took like okay that took like four minutes to open i'm so sorry about that y'all but i figured you needed to see it real time [ __ ] this packaging no like [ __ ] it i thought it was good this sucks ass like what is wrong with this lid there's a bunch of like plastic [ __ ] here there's like plastic notches that you gotta like push it down and [ __ ] dude that's impossible to open this packaging is terrible this just fix these notches man i just spent five minutes opening that that's ridiculous okay deep breath calm down okay we're good i'm sure there's a couple funny ass faces i made during that i'm not gonna lie because i was getting i was starting to get pissed i was like i was wondering am i gonna get this gram open for the video or am i gonna have to stop the video but that was by far the hardest gram to open on the channel so yeah that's annoying moving on to the looks well these they look really good this looks really good it's got a really kind of a moist live resiny look to it crystal crystalline it looks really good it looks really kind of battery like it's all going to come up in one scoop which is nice you know i hate that little crumble consistency where you pick one up and it goes everywhere that shit's annoying but um but yeah i like this the looks of this one a lot moving on to the smell here okay that smells bomb it smells like so sour you see sour kush cake was it yeah sour kush cake you're definitely getting some of that wedding cake profile for sure pretty you can smell like it kind of smells sour this is really good it's got a pungent smell to it i like the smell a lot for sure pungent sour wet and cakey really nice moving on to my favorite part of the video and a much needed part of the video considering the beginning took me five minutes to open the taste i need a fat dab right now that was ridiculous y'all that that was ridiculous i literally had to grab this screwdriver and like do some really weird crap to get this open but i did it i got it open so here's a present to myself for getting this gram open cheers huh all right whoa that did it okay um it tastes really good i'm not even gonna put the lid back on i'm just going to like set it on top let's [ __ ] that but it tastes really good it's got kind of a the same kind of sour wedding cakey taste that it was smelling like there i really like that really strong really really clean all the way throughout really really nice uh taste on this product on to the effect here sorry y'all dying a little bit over here moving on to the effect so i like this this effect now that i've been sitting here for a couple seconds it's a nice it's a nice hybrid like i said about the uh i'm pretty sure it was the runts i feel like i can either work out right now which i just did or i can relax and play with like play with my dogs or watch something or whatever it is that you do when you like to relax you can do that after this train it's a nice nice evenly even keel uh sort of hybrid i really like the effect on this one i like the the older i get the more i like the hybrids um moving on to the ratings portion of the video now so for value okay so at forty dollars a gram you're getting a really good quality concentrate you really are the only problem i have with it is it's incredibly hard to open so like if they fix the packaging on this one the value would be a little like higher but the fact that you're paying forty dollars a gram to spend like five minutes struggling to open it with a screwdriver that's that's annoying that's that's ridiculous so i'm gonna i'm gonna say for that the value gets a 2.5 out of five because the concentrate was really good just fix the packaging because that was enough to like almost that almost made me quit filming because i i was like dude am i going to sit here for 10 minutes because that was long enough i mean that was ridiculously long the amount of time i sat there tried to open that so i was just i had to i had to open it and luckily i got it open but yeah it's terrible 2.5 out of 5 for the value packaging okay packaging one out of five i'm literally giving that a one out of five because that that is so annoying like you guys i'm sure you guys saw i was getting like legitimately mad at that freaking container like that's ridiculous so one out of five in the packaging no wii container should make you angry none that's ridiculous moving on to the looks so really like the looks on this one it's got kind of a orangish sort of tint to it it's nice um you guys will see the high resolution photo of course but really like the looks on this one i'm gonna go ahead and give the looks a four out of five because those are really good really prime looks moving on to the smell uh that smells awesome uh it smelled really really good it smelled like uh like i said kind of a sour wedding cake profile so really good i'm going to go ahead and give the smell 3.5 out of 5. moving on to the taste the taste was just like it smelled really like the exact same sour wedding cakey taste i really like that as well giving that a 3.5 out of 5. moving on to the effect so i really like this effect definitely took me down a few notches after getting upset over that whole thing but yeah i'm liking this effect a lot it's really really really nice um [Music] yeah it's like like i said it's like a 50 50 hybrid so you're getting that sativa sort of pick me up um sun's out guns out sort of thing you know if you want to go lift some weights and you're getting that relaxation body high feeling if you want to relax and not really do much after working out or working or whatever it is you do so uh yeah i'm really a fan of this effect a lot it's one of my favorite ones on the channel so far so i'm going to give it a 3.5 out of 5 as well so yeah for that that gives us 18 divided by 6 equals 3 out of 5. that might have been one of the first even numbers we've had on this channel as far as the writing goes but yeah three out of five would i buy this again man okay so like i really like the really like everything about this the packaging i mean now that i know how to open it i'll probably buy it again but that's the the way this is the way this packaging is i don't know man they really got to fix it that was so upsetting so would i buy it again probably i don't know i think there's better options out there for 35 to 40 but if they put this wax in like an abstract container absolutely i would buy it again hope you guys are enjoying my content uh hope you guys enjoyed my little mini freak out earlier in this video i'm sure it was mildly entertaining or boring either way yeah please like and subscribe if you like this channel um i know i get kind of repetitive with the content so far but i plan on branching out soon i just don't have enough resources yet to really fully branch out like i would like to so really enjoying the support y'all peace out", "dFuQi4jNf1Q": "what's up YouTube this is I start images back with another product review I'm going to lean towards do want to click one of this but I got a couple things that I'm gonna do in the next next couple videos [Music] so in this one I think I'm just gonna do a quick dab review and debating on one of one of these two then I do have a platinum babe tangelo coming up and then I also have a MK X called crazy train and on the back of the box it says dedicated to the late Randy Rhoads and from what they were telling me that's Black Sabbath like Ozzy Osbourne and stuff like that we're gonna get started on doing this report I'm gonna do next level extracts [Music] I don't know if you can make that out but it says next level extracts GMO one gram sauce pretty good color yeah we're do the GMO let me heat up my bag real quick I'm gonna get the show on the road I'm like four episodes into that show the boys now and my personal opinion is really good but it's like crazy like instead of showing me like all the collateral damage would probably have a live superheroes said I'm waiting on my burn I still got to see Dark Phoenix he's spider-man parking home [Music] actually pretty far behind of a movie game at the moment [Music] started watching another anime Skol Dragonslayer something I find out more about that [Music] the heat up time I should have I preheated this before making a video [Music] about as real as it's gonna get how anybody else would take it to him [Music] took a dab of some other [ __ ] earlier you got the name of it [Music] calab at the end some sauce as I said GMO I just had that in some flour like a few weeks ago so here we go Wow that's tasty as [ __ ] it's a little sweetness but like I think that initial part of the taste was like like when you do the flower almost like a garlicky taste pick up a little bit of that just at the very beginning but yeah that was tasty as I said that is next-level extracts GMO one gram sauce never heard of the company before I know nothing about them so I can't say nothing bad but uh so far so good one for one it's a little baby jar compared to the other ones that are doing good one of the other ones to be green correct but yeah next little extracts so far so good feel the effects immediately through little little thick on the taste in the back of the throat almost like almost immediately having a cottonmouth or whatever you know I mean spider-man you stay hydrated but as I said I got another wax in two other cards probably I'll probably do one more today but I'm gonna try to spread them out hope for the next three days just so I have multiple videos on the whole days instead of a bunch at the beginning of the week I guess it doesn't really matter as long as I'm putting videos up it's all matters but um go to your local disco I forgot to ask him where you went or where you got some strong name at all but next up let's track the sauce GMO definitely recommend this highly like really good don't know where to tell you to go get that so you may want to go on the weed map search next level extracts and it'll probably let you know what local discos are carrying right now and then if you got the money and you want to give it a go away get ready go well you got to lose you're gonna get [ __ ] high I believe you're gonna like it if you end up not liking it comment below tell me what you didn't like about it we can converse about it I see nothing wrong with this at all taste everything moves around not only crazy but there's [ __ ] going on beside other than the Alpha but those are the only two things I've had GMO and I had someone say GMO sauce before so I may have had it one other time but I don't know because he was calling it by a couple different things if you hear the music in the back by an artist named Kevin phloem and I dig his music his mom been banging it at work while riding the riding horn I'm gonna do some music reviews on some of this stuff you know because I've listened to some of the songs like I'm not really paying attention to the lyrics at the moment so I buy I do a video on this but I've listened to quite a few of his songs I don't know the names because I can't check him on pocket constantly so if I do a review on his stuff it would be based on trying to remember what I heard and what I didn't get yeah whatever I lost my train of thought no big deal we're running the ten minute mark so I'm just gonna cut this short as I said next level extracts GMO sauce one gram it's good I recommend it search it find it try it comment let me know click Subscribe smash that like and I'll see you in the next video it'll probably be within the next like 20 minutes to half hour I mean I drop it right away but I'm gonna record it probably maybe right after this sounds on how I feel in a few minutes it's feeling like a pretty intense high I feel it as I said wrote real big in the eyes my eyes are feeling a little bit drier so if I googled this and went on Leafly or whatever it would probably tell me that one of the biggest things with this is the dry eyes but whatever you guys have a fantastic Monday night I'll see you back here in a little bit if not tomorrow and have a blessed Tuesday's guys Tuesday have a blessed adjust it tell them pretty [ __ ] high right now", "ywzsTnaPF0I": "two persons here coming to you with the review I'll be reviewing this today you know I was saying this spill
