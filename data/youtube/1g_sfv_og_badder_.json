can't find a skunk wad true skunk one the golf-ball indica nobody has it anymore that's that one the original mando purple golf ball in because it's gone you saw there you saw it coming out of Mendocino Ukiah that area and it was just phenomenal and it's gone you know it disappeared in the early 90s both of those both of those days the camp raids were more effective than people think they were I mean yeah a lot of grills were left intact up there but a lot of stranger lost a lot by just attrition or by by bolt by both crossbreeding the seeds you know pollination that people didn't really know where that pollen came from you know we had some great sticky weed in the late 80s early 90s to talk about the SS f v OG so I still have that string I've had it for 27 years week long what's the history of which it actually came in through Point Mugu Naval Air Station in a backpack from those old Navy SEALs that we're working in Afghanistan that's where it came that's where it came

pure coach and that is the original ffs empty what's just a pain in the ass to grow it was like an ivy plant it went everywhere you know it was just compared to like your Northern California indica plants that were nice and in uniform and bushy and you know grew up like this this thing you switched it into in the flower its initial stretch could be as much as two or three feet in 11 12 14 days like maintaining a light height on those was just like wow you know super hard you know and and your bud structure was nowhere as close together that's the end of us out of Northern California you know it would be like a bud and then a blank spot for eight or nine inches another bud and then it was like an ivy plant just going everywhere so getting that plant to respond properly and get a tight

another one by simply bear organic this one is their san fernando valley og kush this one here is sitting at 23 thc sfv or san fernando valley og kush is an indica dominant strain bred from crossing san fernando valley og and afghani and is said to feature an earthy piney gassy aroma this is the certified version of the classic california kush the terpene profile mostly consists of limonene uh beta myrosine transcarafleen and uh betta pinene simply bear is the only producer in the country to achieve the standards of an environmental farm plan in 2015 jessie mcconnell former co-owner of whistler cannabis co and peter dewig both experienced in organic growing joined forces and founded rubicon organics which is the producer of simply bear organic simply bear is located in the fraser valley delta bc grow in 125 000 square foot greenhouse facility basically when mother nature isn't cooperating they have a an led light system which is full spectrum simply bearer also has a proprietary organic living soil which is locally harvested and contains douglas fir bark worm castings kelp and fish meal simply bear manages every step of the process by hand and they 14-day cold room lights off hang dry the plants to ensure all buds are properly cured if you're looking to invest in simply bare organics they're under the parent company it's under it's either rubicon organics inc or vintages organics cannabis company inc so we'll have that on screen so this one here is packaged september 12th so super fresh okay so let's get a look at it here really like these lids and these just jars and the seal it's very easy to uh to open really pungent smell right off the bat okay now that we've learned a little bit about san fernando valley og kush and simply bear organics the last thing i got to do is test it out for a rating so i'll go do that and i'll be right back [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right guys uh after testing out the sfvog by simply bear organics san fernando valley og really really liked this one it burned really well it was very smooth strong effects the ash on it was very white uh super clean as you would expect with an organic product i guess the only thing on it was the the taste the taste was really good um i guess the only thing i wanted to mention was um i rolled the joint of it initially when i first opened the jar and then i put the rest of the flower in a glass jar with a two-way humidity control pack i think it was a boveda or an integra boost and um it actually tasted uh quite a bit better the next day not like uh astronomically um wasn't a huge difference but it definitely made a difference on the next day definitely a little bit more uh the terps kind of came out a little bit more like i said even without it it was still definitely a good flavor with all that being said i'm going to rate this one a 9.3 out of 10. really well done till next time guys", "U28R6w4tEuE": "[Music] hey everyone it's clint from canadian cannabis culture back with another review today we're looking at uh san fernando valley og kush by indiva so i was excited to try this one smvog has always been one of my favorite uh strains it's got a very good flavor in my opinion this one is sitting at 24.7 thc i thought it was interesting too they changed the label up a little bit here in diva uh so they've got their terpene content on the side here now which is really cool i'll try and have a close-up for you for you guys on the screen i kind of jumped the gun on this one you guys for the first time and i've already opened the seal so uh i'm gonna pretend like i didn't and i'm still gonna go and do my test and come back for the uh for the rating but i did open it already it looks really really nice okay so sfvog is an indica dominant hybrid breadbread crossing og kush and sfv og sfv og kush is said to have herbal notes mixed with citrus and a hint of pepper the dominant terpenes are liminin pharnacin and myrosine diva is based in london ontario they produce cannabis and cannabis products and also provide production and manufacturing services they grow and manufacture in a state-of-the-art greenhouse facility which includes environmentally conscious grow rooms and a production space that produces safe and high quality cannabis products and diva uses natural light during all phases of growth the environment is controlled for humidity temperature effective sunlight and water requirements diva produces and distributes the award-winning bang chocolate wanna sour gummies ruby cannabis sugar sapphire cannabis salt and other derivative products through license agreements and joint ventures they have also launched a premium cannabis brand called artisan match which i've reviewed a couple of already in partnership with bc craft supply co which has done a really good job of sourcing cannabis in my opinion focus is to source from micro growers and give them the exposure they deserve if you're looking to invest in indiva they're under indiva limited ndva which i'll have on the screen okay so like i said i've already opened this one up but we'll definitely get you guys a really good look of what's going on inside of the jar they don't have a two-way humidity pack like a boveda so i definitely recommend indiva looking into that because since i have opened this already i tried it initially when i first opened it and i've tried it the day after after being in a glass jar overnight with some boveda packs and it makes a world of a difference the flavor really really comes out so i'll go test it again and come back for the reading so i'll be right back [Applause] [Music] [Music] all right guys uh after testing out the smv og kush by indiva this one is really it's good um it's not as good as their ice cream cake in my opinion i really like their ice cream cake so overall i had a really good taste um especially after having boveda packs overnight in a glass jar uh definitely like the limonene and pinene definitely come out one of the better tasting sfvs ogs i've had only knock on it though is that the ash was very dark and as far as like this the burn uh it was kind of wanting to go out or it did go out a couple times so the burn on it isn't great the effects on it are nice and strong so really good effects uh and it is smooth for what it is even though it goes out and the ash is pretty dark definitely the knock on it is the dark ash it likes to go out uh and it could have a better taste if there were some two-way humidity packs in there because this one wasn't very old either as far as the package date so i'm going to rate this one uh an 8.6 out of 10. until next time guys", "GxM7_IQVQqc": "[Music] you - how's it going it's been a while and we made a video in a quite a while a long time actually ICS still got subscribers people subscribe and checking out the channel so I figured I'd make a video this here is the SF vog San Fran Evalia G super dank super

custom recipe I've been working on for a while this year is a friend of mine it's it's uh a platinum og was just running a few of these see these are all falling over I got something tied up Ralph falling over packing all the weight I don't think I'll be riding this one again I'm not really a fan of her structure she has more of like a fruity nose doesn't really have a really diesel fuel EOG stank that the SME does this year is a an unknown og sir I only ran one of her but I won't be running those again unless I get great reviews Brahma don't be running again the VESA V is just", "A1zZFCKu4v0": "ando og and next to me is my handy dandy notepad so i can tell you guys a little bit more information about san fernando og right from the leafly leaf right from yeah but people

on the couch as the name indicates this og kush relative originates from california's san fernando valley although their names are barely distinguishable san fernando og kush is actually the afghani cross child to san fernando og leading with aromic notes of earthy pine and lemon its body effects take a little stronger to fill than the initial head haziness san fernando og affects feelings happy

people that want to have that heavy hitting indica without being in the couch san fernando og is the one for you and source cannabis stays true to the art of growing cannabis the real ogs now let's open this up source since 2003 wow they have a freshness seal on the top how some guys will put a little humidity pack in there or some guys won't put anything in there these guys have their own little freshness seal so this tells me that these guys definitely care about keeping their flour fresh for a long time like i said a lot of people will add a humidity pack sometimes they won't even do that let's open it up wow okay let's here we're gonna break some of this up right here and we need to bring you in closer so you can actually see it as well okay wow you would be impressed by you know how ogs are tight nugs efren you know this og is always going to be tight tight buds tight tight nuggies let's just look at this flower right here okay let's go ahead i mean this is okay that stem

going to put it into your whatever you use your your papers in my case a joint roller that i'm i'm using right now and like all these videos you know i'm just going to take one hit and see how high i can get off of just one hit and give you guys my overall feedback about this magnificent strain of cannabis yes yes yes so so san fernando g by cali connection is a sativa dominant hybrid that is great for patients who need strong pain relief but don't want to be stuck on the couch as the name indicates this og kush relative originates from california's san fernando valley although their names are barely distinguishable san fernando og kush is actually the afghani cross child to san fernando og so there is there is there is some afghani inside of this um san fernando that's what that's what's being said right here um as i can see yeah that's what's being said right here so let's go ahead all right we just rolled it up okay now we're gonna go like this bam bam bam my paper is a

well not source cannabis i mean you know just san fernan sfvog you know the thing with source cannabis is when when they say that it's sfvog it's sfvog yeah so this is a a hybrid with a sativa leaning properties you know you see a lot of guys out there saying wedding cake is hybrid or wedding cake is indica and people saying blue dream is a hybrid and not a sativa the the the real ogs the ones that know their cannabis you know that they're getting the legit [ __ ] and what i'm saying is when it comes to source cannabis i know that i'm actually smoking on that sfv original sfv og so um yeah and like i said the joint very smooth tastes very good later this week we will test out some of the king garden shatters sugars butters and diamonds and i will be using my luca device that i will open up and we will go through it together i'm not going to open this now i'm i'm going to open this later so i can open it with you guys all at once and then i'm going to take a dab on friday with you guys efren you're going to bust out your shatter i'm going to bust out mine remember efren if it wasn't for you i if it wasn't for you bringing that up i wouldn't have checked into it so thank you very much for your input i do listen to you guys i do take what you say under consideration and so don't think it doesn't go unnoticed um i believe man they're like or exactly so just says new age care center so just i like the packaging too look like they do it right it's not all about packaging but it's great to know that they have the complete package from the flower to the package to the brand this is a cannabis company with integrity integrity south park all right um yeah any questions from the crowd no okay well thank you very much for tuning in this was a cannabis review of sfv og from source cannabis on the video map presents channel make sure you check out the other cannabis reviews where i go to the cookie store i open up some cresco and just know i'll keep it real the buds broken up and it's dry i'm not gonna lie the price um so a price of this out the door including all the taxes in california this would put you in the case of wait did you want delivery or not delivery are you talking like a price to go to dispensary or price like delivery if if you um if you wanted wanted it brought to you um out the door with tax you're looking between 63 and dollars did i mention it's top shelf good hey if the taxes weren't so [ __ ] high in the state of california and remember guys make sure you go get your medical card now i'm not talking about your old medical recommendation you need that too but you need to go to your county office you need to get an mmic card thanks efren that's the price of an mmic card a medical marijuana identification card oh component yeah dude um i just these guys are or in their in their late 40s early 50s [Applause] i mean they're they're literally like some ogs like like they've um like like the real deal it's like they're they're in there they're you know they're a part of the whole thing you know they have all hands on okay so if you guys want to get an mmic a medical marijuana identification card that way you will be exempt from paying certain taxes where you're only so efren for example efren you probably pay up to 35 tax when you go to a dispensary if you get this card you only have to pay about 15 of those taxes you understand you only have to pay about 15 so this is how you do it you go to weed maps and you call up one of those uh green thumb doctors where you get a medical um where you get the online recommendation for like 50 bucks and then after you get that then you go down to your county office you call yours your county um you know the county the city office and you say you want to apply for a mic medical marijuana identification card and they will submit the information to you you'll pay about 100 or 150 bucks and they're going to want to see proof of your wreck that you already got from the little green thumb doctors see that little green thumb wreck that was cool but that you don't get exempt from taxes it's just if you're 18 to 20 and you want to smoke you can get that thing but if you want to get the mm ic card you're gonna have to get that anyway but if you want to be exempt and not pay that much with the tax you're going to need to pay 150 bucks which is nothing if you buy a lot of pot which you do everyone so go here call your county office just call or go online and say you want to apply for your mmic card okay medical marijuana identification card that way when you order from a dispensary or a delivery that also is medical you will be exempt from majority of the taxes and i also need to not take this phone so close to my face i have so many blackheads i need to wash my face more what is this eye boogers in my glasses i'm such a [ __ ] stoner oh crap okay hold on now this uh this review is turning out to be okay this is supposed to be a source cannabis review but then again i am telling you guys about how to get your medical card so you can go get source cannabis so it all goes hand in hand no yeah no oh you're welcome dude that's what we're supposed to do not just have you guys watch me blab about just anything and everything i want to be able to provide information to the group oh shoot hold on so yeah i just want to provide

just you know try to focus it on the uh you know the certain thing that's why i like off topic off topic we talk about everything on off topic you know anything we want to talk about we we always talk

it's me the happy cultivator urban gardener and it is [Music] time [Music] urban what's it time for well it's time to take down the san fernando valley o.g she's been out here for around 60 days she's looking nice and full she's got quite a few amber trichomes on her already and she's looking nice and plump got lucky on this one looks like we're gonna get out without any caterpillar damage i did find a small little caterpillar trying to get on it this morning so that's another reason why it's great that we're able to take it down now but i wanted to give you a last little look at the san fernando valley oh gee and oh gee does she look marvelous so with that guys like i always say keep abby stay stoned and urban garden foreign", "PXH88vFtus4": "hey y'all trevor here with red of the leaf and on this scorching hot sunday evening i'm recording your guys's monday indica review we've got some organic san fernando valley og kush from simply bear we're going to be tapping into today can't wait to see how this bud does and uh let's get into it you guys so that we can actually see how this bud turns out on the urban scale see you guys on the other side of this intro when we get into it [Music] welcome back you guys so as i said in the intro we've got some simply bear organics san fernando valley kush so this came in with a t let's turn the sound off on this laptop there we go so this came in with a thc content of twenty three point four percent a cbd total of zero point one seven percent and it was packaged on june 24th 2020 which puts it at a really fresh button i'm actually really excited to tap into this and try it out so i have leafly's website pulled up here with all of the information we're going to rattle that off quickly and then we're going to get into the actual urban scale you guys so let's roll out quickly off and get into it so san fernando valley og kush not to be confused with his precursor san fernando valley og is an indica dominant strain spread spread bred from og kush genetics by cali connections by crossing a san fernando valley og clone with an afghani father and selecting for favorable traits over several generations the indica heavy san fernando valley og kush was born you could smell the og genetics in this one as its odors is commonly described as a strong lemon cleaner smell intermittent with pine intermixed with pine so let's hammer off the effects that you're likely to feel when smoking this so the top five feelings as voted on by the public are going to be relaxed euphoric happy sleepy and uplifted top five things that it is going to help with is pain stress insomnia anxiety and depression this has some side effects like most strains you get dry mouth and dry eyes being top headache dizzy ebb paranoid coming in last i'm really excited to see how this uh bud's gonna end up doing you guys but we've got all the information rattled off let's get into the actual urban scale and i'll see on the other side when we crack into this container and see how it's gonna do for the look and [Music] aroma welcome back again you guys so let's get this looking aroma started we got this steel right there let's crack into this another seal for your protection oh fat nugs in this container wow simply bear you treated us on this eighth let's get all these nugs out of here so you definitely get that pine lemony kind of smell it's not overwhelming so there's the eighth there but it does have strong enough smell to really make it nice and a little bit exciting to smoke in the like excited to smoke is a better way to put it it has such a nice smell you guys nice and light that lemon with just that hint of kind of pineapple it's it actually complements really well and i am very surprised at how well this bud smells i'm uh i'm really excited to try this and it is really fresh dank sticky dense nugs very true indica dominant nugs um i think this bud has some potential to do really well and i'm really looking forward to seeing how it's how it's gonna do you guys i am gonna give it a i can't give it a nine because the smell isn't really getting me that excited but the quality of the cannabis is definitely close to that nine range i'm gonna give it an eight on the strong side like the strongest eight eight you guys can think of just because that smell doesn't have enough push to really sell me on it and i think i definitely think it could be doing better but we'll see you guys when we got this busted up i'm gonna roll a joint do all that good stuff before we go any further in this review um we're gonna be tapping into the boundless vaporizer first i'll see you guys when we get over there hey guys so we're going to start it off with the vaporizer we're going to start this sucker out at 175 degrees celsius that lets us taste the first little levels of the terpenes that start to boil off you get the lemon in and the meristening which are the mango and lemon based terpenes are definitely sweeter terpenes and then after that we bump it up to the 205. you get a little bit more of the earthy muggy spiced kind of flavors hinting in there as well before we bump it up to 220 and right there is where you're going to get the top level of the flavors that peppery spice the beta chlorophyll and definitely more of a woody type of flavor in there you don't get as much thc at the 175 as you do with the 220 so there as well is the thc dump so the sucker is set at 175 we're going to start out there before we bump it up to the 205 and then 220. so let's see how this one does and i'll see you guys on the other side cheers really light damp flavor enjoyable definitely a fresh bud kind of flavor hmm it's definitely really light and lemony it's almost got a little bit of a woodsy kind of flavor in there it's it's enjoyable and i'm liking it quite a bit you guys okay let's bump it up to the 205 and see how it does there because i'm curious to see if we're going to get a little bit more of that woodsy type of flavor if we're going to get something different so it's set at that 205 let's uh pound this out you guys cheers this definitely goes to a little more herbal and peppered flavor which isn't bad it's definitely not my favorite but i'm still enjoying it again that really kind of peppery flavor which isn't bad but it's definitely not exciting me very much we're now bumped it up to 220 and we'll see how it does there you guys cheers it's gone really peppery and light woodsy touch to it too it's not bad but again it's just it's not really exciting to you guys it's kind of a mad bud like after that 205 i was like this is gonna get a seven and that's all it's really gonna get yeah it's just it's a personal flavor thing and it's not really exciting me i was really interested and hoping for more of that lemon flavor but i'm just not getting it you guys so uh seven out of ten is the best that we can do for this one and uh we're gonna tap into some bongs next so i'll see you guys over there hey guys so we're going to run this og kush through the bongs so we started out with the hamper wick hamper wick the hemp wick and then we go into the straight clipper lighter and after that we use the mk torch slider so there shouldn't be any more weight in any longer let's let up this hemp wick and get to smoking this so start out in the sea turtle rig before we go over to the nice guys beaker bong and then straighten it out with the cyclone from red eye attack hope you guys are having a great day and uh hope you guys enjoy this review because i'm definitely enjoying what i have smoked so far cheers let's get into the second rip y'all cheers okay yes i'm going to end up giving this an 8 out of a 10. it has a really strong cushy's definitely the best and most predominant flavor i could tell you guys there is hint to that lemon definitely hint to the pine but it is a very cushy traditionally cushy strain and the bud is relatively moist though like it's in really good shape the glass container is doing incredibly well with the strain um and overall it did really really well you guys i'm giving it an 8 out of 10 because that flavor is really enjoyable nice and strong it does have a touch of a harshness to it that personally just it's a little bit of a turn off to make me not run to the hills and scream about it but i would definitely be talking this butt up because it's been just really enjoyable with uh with the consistency of the flavor but it's not a personal favor but it's a damn good flavor and definitely worth checking out if you guys like that really cushy flavor but we're gonna move on over into the taste from a pipe you guys we got colorado spoon pipe packed up here and uh you'll be finding out how it tastes while i smoke it so cheers and i'll see you on the other side hamburg every time at least once a day this hempway [ __ ] be over that time you guys got to see it so cheers i'm gonna have to give it a 7 out of 10. it's really light and subtle with its flavor you've got a hint of that citrus cleaner pine that that very light kind of acetone touch to it it's not bad in any way it's just not something i'm overly excited about so seven out of ten is the best i can do um it is a little bit disappointing i was hoping for more flavor i got out of the bong but i guess it just didn't happen so we've uh rolled it up with some rice baths paper there's some vibes blue papers like i normally do i really enjoy smoking these for the reviews and it seems to really give me the best flavor so uh let's take a little bit of a dry haul on here see what kind of flavors we can expect when we light this sucker up but uh yeah cheers so i'm getting surprisingly like a licorice flavor like a really dark soft black licorice kind of flavor and it's interesting like those black licorice babies that is very much the flavor i'm getting from this which is interesting and exciting because if that's what that's what it's going to taste like i'm going to enjoy this joint you guys cheers [Music] okay guys this is a really slow burning joy but i'm enjoying it quite a bit i'm getting a really strong cushy pine flavor it is definitely very fresh bud very strong and fresh flavors i'm uh quite surprised at how well this joint is developing as we're smoking through it and how it's not becoming really overwhelming or like changing the flavors from one to the next it's staying nice and light and consistent and and really is quite an enjoyable strain to be smoking right now you guys let's bring this mic a little closer since my how much i've been talking there we go so that's right we brought the mic a little bit closer you guys i was talking a little bit too quiet i could see it not picking up quite enough so brought the bike in just that touch closer but that's bud really really impressed with it i'm gonna give it a nine just because again personally not my favorite strain but definitely a strain i'm i'm quite happy and enjoy quite a bit i really didn't expect this slot um not sly light of a flavor but that would just build and develop a really nice settle of an overwhelming and really strong flavor on your tongue that i'm i'm enjoying quite a bit you guys it did well nine out of ten it's a solid score but uh i'll uh be right back we're talking about the ha okay guys this is gonna end up getting a 9 out of a 10 for a tire now tell you right now where it's losing it's one point is the headache i can feel coming on right now it is very disappointing when i get this headache sensation especially when it's later on into the sesh when the effects are hitting kind of their optimal highest level for me the headaches come in as well and it's just a little bit of disappointment this one however has got a really nice euphoria to it like that mental drift where i want to just drift off you guys i am so ready to just crawl into bed and get into a tv show um this one definitely is gonna have some munchies to it i believe um i can already start to feel it like i'm really thirsty and there's some dry mouth with it so i uh usually when i'm like this i know the munchies are following through it does have a pretty decent pain relief to it and it's got a really nice relaxing end of day not necessarily sleepy but comfortable um feeling to it and it's very very well grown for its effects and i'm i'm enjoying it quite a bit you guys so we've got it added all up this bud did pretty well it did get a beautiful urban score for its overall it got a 47 out of 60. we're just going to finish this drawing you guys know no more extra bowl for this video but uh it's got a a 47 out of 60 and it did really well in some categories taste from a joint and the taste from a bong were definitely the two that are most um are like they're the ones that really stand out to me this joint just tastes really nice as i'm finishing it up it's still really light flavor it's got more than it did at the beginning but still is that light flavor i am very much enjoying it as well as from the bongs just that really soft cushy flavor that i was getting through there it was nice definitely nice and the high is [ __ ] great you guys the high did incredible as well it's got that really good mental drift end of day smoke i am quite impressed with how well this butt did but i'm gonna wrap this one up hope you guys enjoyed if you guys are checking this out on youtube stick around because i've got an end card just for you well you might as well just make it everyone's end card hope you guys enjoyed

I want to thank Kevin Jody wonderland nursery and the ganje for sharing this video with us this is part 1 of 2 part 2 is going to come out later on this week we're gonna add the link at that time right here so you're pricing it now in this video Kevin considers late 80s really loud and skunky terpene profiles that we found in weed then that have gone away because during the times people were getting busted and they needed to have their you know weed smell more you know fruity and floral than dankey and skunky and so he wants to come back to that so in this video he discusses the terpene profiles that are generally associated with really loud strains from that time you know if you're if you're interested in hearing more from Kevin I recommend that you check out the other shaping fire podcast interview I did with him in 2017 all about the early origins of the CBD strains that started in California you can find that out at the link here or you can just go to the shaping fire calm web site while you're there if you are into terpenes make sure that you listen to the interview I did with Ben from true terpenes as well all about terpenes and how they're used in your everyday life and you know if you are into terpenes and you want to buy some for yourself or to use in production for a product that you're making make sure you go to this link to go to troupe to Europeans and pick up some terpenes because they're the ones who sponsor our channel so thanks to Kevin and Wonderland and the GaN GA and true terpenes for all the support all right here we go this is Kevin Wonderland I was spending some time trying to take a look better at the older strains from late 80s early 90s which is to me is a sweet spot of cannabis that it was this incredible amount of varietals that pooled to make those those varietals and they were the only ones taken out of play not due to obsolescence but more to the fact that they were two highly recognizable and something that I call BC and that's before charcoal so before choco filtration was really prevalent and allowed individuals to hide cannabis in discreet situations some of these varietals from that time period primarily what we call skunks we're so well known to the scent that it was an instant indicator that there was cannabis being produced at this location and so it completely took these strains out and I've been going back in time to dig through to repol this population out because the the varietals were built at that time for totally enjoyment from the user's perspective and some of these scents have been have been lost and it's trying to mine them and find out where they exist and so I've been working with this strain called the hog out of San Diego for a little while and it's a beautiful skunk afghani combination and the the the genetics that make it up go back to that time this might have been made you know 2025 years ago so a little little later than where I'm speaking but the the precursors the plants have made it up combined and did this and so we did an interest in test this year where we ran a humic acid mix from a company as a test to see what it would do on production and when I ran all the Turpin alysus I had the very analytics my lab but I've used from the inception run my trip profiles and so what I find which was so interesting was that they had some very extreme variances in in a one specific area but the overall smell was identical to the user you couldn't differentiate between the two flowers even though one of them was 1% campign and the other one was 1% told pining Alpha and Beta Pi means combined and one of them is pining spine and the other camphor is more of an herbal and so it was amazing to me as I started to look at these and try to understand from a Terp profile analysis what the smell really was and what was really taking place and so I started to wonder where does the smell garlic come from in in garlic and why does this flower of the hog have such a heavy garlic odor so I went through the basic dirt profiles and we had you know alpha pioneer alpha pioneer which of Heinz we had and then in the and then and then the flip sample was it had nope I need had caffeine but basically the same level about 1% and so that was really the only major difference in the two and then Mayor scene was dominant we had limonene which is in mere scenes of Earth's and mosques and lye meanings as citruses and we have Lin aloo which is a spicy floral Finchel which is a camphor Kaurava lean which is a hoppy peppery humulin which is earthy woody that we went into some of these lighter ones which was a valance scene which is an orange and then farness scene which is woody trans neurology all citrus apple roads near allah dog barking woody and then a growl all I can't really pronounce the word GU a IOL and that's piney and so I took a look and these were the major Terps that made up what we talked about and I started to do some research and I start trying to find out where is this smell or that we call like funky death and where does these things come from and I started to take a look and I started to find out that farness scene which is farness all is the precursor to all cesspit are beans but farness seen the the Terp itself is the death smell of aphids and so plants exude that smell to drive predation away from it because it smells like insect death and then if a fits die they release that odor which then tells other athens that their death is present and they should hide and so it started to it drives some interest in terms of you know are we picking up some of these funky tones that are really bio protectants and we're interpreting them in a way that makes us perceive something and so I started to take a look at this and we started to go through and we took a look and we'd find that Jarrin Hall is the precursor for all the mono Terps and farnesyl is the precursor for all the sesqui Terps and I started to take a look and trying to understand you know what are what are some of the reasons why this stuff works why do we have some of these smells and we've been talking about esters which are alcohols and we find that you have alcohols that are glycerides and glasses Rides are makeup fat and so almost all fats and animals and plants are from glycerides and that is from esters and so we start to say as we go back we always remember the sticky the oily the greasy things that we don't see as much anymore things that don't have the same tactical fields same constituents that make it up and and some of those things I think are directly connected and so I started to take a little look deeper and as I started to go into this I started to find that things like Valentin which is orange which you can smell so clearly in this you don't smell citrus in the sense of lemon-lime through your hog flour but you if you give it a squeeze you're gonna have this our garlic and you're gonna have this underlying citrus tone but you can smell a distinct orange over a lemon or lime and you have a muskiness that typically would come from mere scene but when you look at the profile of a hog and an OG limonene Mayer seen pining and we'll use the pining sample instead of the camping because like I said they smelled identical when you compared them but for OG Kush which is typically we would say limonene piney mersin dominant it couldn't be any different than the hog and they both have similar profiles and so I started going through this and I started trying to understand better what makes these things happen because we all become very Terp aware but they're they work in combination in conjunction with each other and there's also conversions and what I started to find was the valence scene which is this incredibly Valencia orange smell they take Valentin and how to write this down so I get the name straight but you can use bacteria and they do this in perfume industry and other industries and they use a bacteria and it converts Vallon scene to a newt Cottone and so a newt cotone is the was valuable of all grapefruit Terps and so this incredibly valuable grapefruit Center can be converted from valence scene biologically and so I started to take a look at you know what is what is garlic and why do we smell it and why do we do and garlic is something called an allison ester al Li CIN and it doesn't release its smell until you crush it but it's not because you volatize dit as much as you've crushed it and you've released enzymes which then reacts and go to process and then release this so there's all these things that are taking place in how we perceive smells and tones and when we're looking at Terp reports and tert profiles and i'm gonna go through a bunch of these i'm gonna go through a lot of these older over the next couple of weeks as I get a chance I'll go through some of these profiles pertaining to some of these older varieties I'm sifting through and what it'll do is it'll let us kind of take a look at what's a chart profile compared to what's the actual strain what do we really smell and when we look at these things where do we not see these odors meaning that I should see with all the pines and Earth's I should see a lot more in this thing but really what I have is a sour funk a garlicky tone and underlying orange and a little bit of earth and it would make sense because we have so many earthy Terps present but the irony was when I started to compare all these profiles I started to see such similarities between things that we have now and things that we had in the past and it's primarily these alcohols that make these differences in the strains that were from the past and now that we know that these esters are directly related to the fat production in plants and animals this thing starts to make sense because we remember these strains being so sticky and so greasy and we assumed sticky from resins but perhaps sticky from fats and so as we mine back through these older strains and go dig through these profiles I'll go and take a look through the tert profiles and we'll start to try to understand better what are we looking at and a lot of it is so that we can understand what makes it attractive and what doesn't otherwise it's just basically these simple profiles of this this and this drive and attraction this and this give us a desire total amounts solely dictate desirability and in a lot of cases it's just not true and it becomes confusing and misleading to us in terms of production and when people start to look at cannabinoid profiles and then interpret early profiles and that becomes the the basis of their decision making process it's not necessarily very accurate in terms of how we perceive it through the mouth and through the nose and so I spent some time just over the Christmas break having a few minutes to hang out and I just went through and listed this stuff and went through and started trying to understand you know why do we have some of these odors that we do and why do we not and try to understand the subtleties in it because it's always the subtlety that determines quality it's not gross characteristics it's always the fine details both cars of cars they both get you from point A to B one of them has a better experience and so we would typically consider that the better car it's the same with cannabis whichever one gives you the best experience how you perceive it what it does for you in terms of medical usage spiritual usage however we want to define it but all those characteristics are from perception and when it comes to smell we're so nuanced through the nose it's such a direct connection from brains brainstem to nostril that it it's primal it goes all the way back and so we've been keyed to smell and understand so many things but with cannabis we've been necked into some populations now and there's this drive to bring out higher louder strains and louder just meaning more visible to the nostril quickly which means more aromatic at room temperature so that's more volatile so that's more monoterpene derived and we have so many these varietals now that we're working in those directions but ultimately is it is it giving you an enjoyable experience and does it give you the effect that you desire from that Terr profile and a lot of the information when you get into terpenes is by protectants on how it affects against tumors and cancer and bone loss and tooth decay and I mean it's unlimited what you can do with this but the none of this has been studied in a smokeable form always in applied to a thing it doesn't really apply to us in the same way it's it's extrapolating data from one set and putting it on another and kind of pretending that it's accurate and we really know that's not the case and it's really more a matter of trying to understand how do you interpret the the cannabinoid profiles the turpenoid profiles and also these esters these alcohols that was so dominant and present in these cannabis varieties from the past that released such an incredible smell that was so distinctive to all people that eventually these varieties had to get removed from the system and so it's this understanding that I'm trying to find as to what drove such an incredible desire in cannabis from those types and how do we get back into some of those exotic forms of cannabinoid combinations and terpenoid alcohol combinations so that we can get back into some of that desirability on a different direction and it's we're not working the same populations that we're working which are primarily right now with so much of the og directions and I was just so fascinated with because if we when we talk about you know the mere seen piney limonene where it's uplifting and then brings you down the hog strains skunk strains couldn't be any could be any opposite in terms of where they lift you up but they don't bring you down they don't have that same type of sedative effect even though the mere seen level and this is relatively high it's you know double the pines even more than the crow Faline levels the only thing that the the hog had that was really high was trans and neural Adal and CIS Nala doll and so between the two of them you were looking at almost you know four four and a half percent and that's citrusy Apple rose that's barking woody and all these complex tones that come into these varieties that make them taste so so green and green meaning you know subtleties of the of the earth and the forest within and we can pull out some specific little pieces and I would say you know you have some hoppy taste and some wheatgrass or some lemongrass present of that beautiful subtle orange tone Mir seen is always this this the component that when we crush this and volatility volatility we can get it to come out but so much of it is is in my mind now as I see that we're having biological conversions of alcohols to other substances we're having enzymatic conversions of something to something so if garlic is an enzymatic conversion to a scent then maybe we need to rethink how we approach the smell components of cannabis and I'm not a terpene scientist I'm just fortunate enough to get to listen to them frequently but I'm somebody who's trying to understand where is the the desire in cannabis where do people like to go when it comes to cannabis where is the directions of cannabis and this entire population from that you know that late Atle 90 time period prior to really smell BC before charcoal all of that was this incredible cannabis population that was still globally developed meaning that though the world had produced all this different cannabis varieties and they had been clustered into these cannabis zones and those zones of production created these varieties and then lo and behold as we go forward the demand of the customer drives what people have but black market forced some radical changes because there was a limit in what cannabis was available and cannabis that was coming over at that time from say the remnants of Colombia the remnants of Mexico that cannabis was so much lower quality than the indoor produced in California that even though the end are from California had these reduced snow rates because we had turned them down you still received a better higher-quality product than what was available so the market became accustomed to that and then as we start to go into medical marijuana and move forward all of a sudden we had the ability to produce cannabis again in a protected manner which allowed us then to have cannabis that was inherently louder more distinct a higher signature and that brought the awareness back of hey where's all this good smelly stuff we had when we were younger and so we we go back and we realize we've necked all these things out and so I've been on this hunt to pull stuff from that time period back from globally and try to locate these varieties so that we could go into them and start to say what creates these smells really we're all looking for the skunk pee but the we and we want it but we want the skunk pee on a better chassis the skunk pee that we're so caught up with in terms of skunk it was always on the leafiest cabbagey looking stuff you have ever seen in your life it was never on really solid flour it's very very rarely primarily and a different type of morphological bud characteristic and so I don't know if I'm so much seeking to go back but I'm going to seek into those tones because it was also stunning other varietals the burnt rubbers the the heavy citrus pines that were just dominant you don't see any of that anymore not to the same degree no og is piney like strains that were piney and we just don't see them they're moderated something's controlling these these connections on how you perceive it and so I think that as we go forward and we start to dig and look through the reports and then take a look at the cannabis and actually consume and test and say hey what are we seeing what don't we see it starts to become very informative because when I had two samples run that were almost identical in almost all characteristics little fluctuations but in piney and kam Fein no camping in one no pining and the other but you couldn't put the you could put the fly was in the same container and no one could tell the difference so it started to really make me realize you know that some of these things that are so characteristically known are either subdued or enhanced by other terpenes and what alcohols are present and the degree that the alcohol is present and that would be from a lot of it from the the growing conditions the inputs obviously because it changed profiles here and you know your harvest time and the curing windows and all these different pieces that control it but it's gonna be interesting as we go forward because we're gonna start to be able to take a look at profiles and start to find some really interesting markers so that when we get into breeding and we're able to start to mark for some of these terpene indicators and look through genetically do we have these markers we should be able to start to go back into some of these plants that were extremely high in these volatile esters and alcohols which are exceptionally attractive but very hard to mine you want seed and concentrates because of the volatility and it just starts to help us understand better what it is we're producing what it is we're trying to market to the public and when people want you know unique varieties it's unique because why what what defines unique and so much of this is being able to take your varietals and say they're unique because people like them for this it has an applicability here there's a demand for it this way not just it has a higher content than others because ultimately that doesn't really numerically it does make a difference on a shelf but in terms of how people perceive it radically different and so when I spent the last you know half a day trying to understand where's the smell of garlic coming from when I don't have any garlic terpenes or alcohols present in the testing and we're only looking at a truncated test it might be say like 30 and there might be over 200 possible but those will be at levels that would be so small it's it's catalyst things that change things things that precursors things that set things in motion and so as we go forward and we start to really have a more in-depth test and we're able to look at this a little different we'll be able to start going in and moving some of these populations in these directions I believe and for me right now it's just a fascinating time to be able to see this and do this and actually have the chance to understand what made some of these things so attractive versus just had a smell that was this because we have her having a hell of a time trying to replicate it if skunk was easy to replicate you would see terpene blenders blending it and it would be present as a Terp to add the things but I don't see skunk piss on anything right now period so I know that some of these things are exceptionally hard to capture or create and it's what made some of these varieties so attractive and that's what that's what's fun right now is we get to hunt and do so the hog you you got me curious because your smell is unique and I for the life of me could not figure out where it came from so thanks thanks we attracted me so much that I put the effort in and I hope this video signs a little light on the chase of where these things come from and remember I'm not organic chemist and I don't claim to be one and nor do I want to be one but I'm someone who's fascinated with genetics and what makes something desirable and in these things we start to have desirability just like when we look in in cannabinoid profiles we can start to find out that these cannabinoids influence the way the body accepts other cannabinoids and it directly affects how you perceive this effect because it is absolutely giving you in effect and the understanding of that allows you to better tailor in what you're seeking so that as we move into these different populations and people come in you're able to give them better choices and we're accurate choices and then they are able to understand why they made the choices which lets us drive directions of breeding and plant choices towards those directions so that we're not just creating and hoping people like it but we're actually marking some of these incredibly attractive components that individuals find attractive and figure out how to apply so I hope you holiday season went well and thanks for listening to the vid and I hope we got something positive out of it you", "KswI8PjxJ2s": "hey guys urban gardener here the happy cultivator with another edition of your minute videos [Music] so this here is the san fernando valley and she's one of the earlier flowering plants in the garden and she's stacking up pretty nice here looks like we'll probably get an early harvest off the san fernando valley but it is definitely stacking very nicely give you one more little nug shot over here all right guys keep happy stay stoned an urban garden", "7AFfiDePfyo": "what up YouTube how's everybody doing hope sit hope everyone's having a great week so last video I said I was gonna talk about our sfv og harvest and I was gonna do that last you know my next update but this next update is gonna be quite busy considering the fact that I totally forgot about the cannabis cup and I'm [ __ ] going so you know I want to probably save some footage or some room on my video for some footage of that [ __ ] at least uh you know to show what I picked up or some [ __ ] you know I don't really like doing the cannabis cup walkthroughs not because they're not [ __ ] fun because they are it's just uh I seen you know a bunch of other videos and other people just doing way better than you know what I'm gonna do because I'm not a [ __ ] uh paparazzi I'm gonna go and [ __ ] you know with my camera in front of people's faces and [ __ ] just not my thing you know I think it's kind of rude to you know I want to go meet people you know as a regular person not as a [ __ ] journalist you know what I'm saying so it's gonna be fun you know this cannabis cup tambourine or do you know I'm kind of looking forward to meeting old dirty bong water dirty bong water so he's one of my favorite growers kind of been following him for a minute he's gonna be at the best uh best value back smooth and really excited to go meet him sounds like a really nice guy so anyways right here we got is our SF GOG harvest I mentioned that she was exactly 114 grams and there she is this job was completely full it's actually been curing for about a week and a half now it's been tasting really good after about a week of cure she was way the [ __ ] up here and I can't keep this [ __ ] in the jars around here [ __ ] they get wind of this [ __ ] my boys and this [ __ ] flies off the [ __ ] shelf so might as well do this now while I still have some decent decent examples of my flower he's one guy here's another one this is that loud [ __ ] you guys you can't be opening any one of these jars not the whole house knowing there's some [ __ ] dink or a dead skunk do you think gasoline one or the other very very frosty very tasty let's get one of these nuts for you guys see if I can crack one open for you guys frosty all in the guts all the way to the stem yeah so really happy with this sfe og very dense nuns as I mentioned before she doesn't really form huge colas the sense of Fiocchi what she does do is form very very dense mugs that one I cracked open all on the insides is heavy heavy tracks all the way through so yeah there she is you guys SS vog groaning dwc vegetable six weeks I would say she went a full eight weeks of flower and we love this [ __ ] over here one of our favorite ladies over here it's not hard to see why so frosty and her aromas are so pungent so strong so I'm gonna keep this one short and I just wanted to show you guys the results of my harvest of my 1sf vog plant and DWC so that's pretty much everything going on as I mentioned before I'm gonna be at the Cannabis Cup I [ __ ] can't wait it's gonna be [ __ ] awesome if anybody else is gonna be there to shoot me a message maybe we can meet whatever you know that'd be [ __ ] cool so that's pretty much everything going on over here I want to thank you guys for joining us stay safe out there and stay faded peace that [ __ ] dick", "6PvM2rbTCHU": "[Music] hey guys welcome to the CCC 4:20 my name is chase and this is turkey Tuesday episode 7 today I'm reviewing the Tahoe og live resin from SD vestments here in San Diego once again vestments coming through the firehouse concentrates no idea is making this but again it is absolute flame to get a chance to check out vestments definitely do that I think I'll leave maps they have a funky different name and they gets timeless healing patience group so if you're trying to find them on weed maps I think that's the way to find one there but but yeah as the best meds on Instagram and this stuff is absolutely flame it's pretty rare that they do a live resin or for their house runs usually they're just enough runs and they're super fresh nope runs for sure but it's they usually don't label them live presents and this stuff definitely labeled live resin and it is clearly a lie present it tastes really really fresh yeah skunky this Tahoe cut is really really strong dark and when I think a Tahoe I think of like tiny dark skunky og flavors it's like a really really really strong kind of OG I think I like Todd over sfv but we really don't see much 200g here in San Diego we see a lot more sfb down here and the Tahoe is one of those pets of OG where there's not really like a definitive Tahoe og cut I feel like at this point it's been grown so much by so many people that you know one Tahoe cush that you get from one place could be very different to another one I've said I'm gonna go in on a debbie has a church together [Music] this one is really skunky mm - donkey so so good like ice it really is a treat to get fresh wax when you really know well you know it's fresh it's kind of like having a fresh doughnut if you've ever had a fresh doughnut like right out of the fryer when it's still hot there's nothing better nothing fresh wax like that this live present is a treat yeah my second dive ready to go you're already the consistency on this stuff is a kind of what I expect from a live resin like not too sappy to where you can't get it off the parchment by any means so it's perfectly able to snap off a parchment and they always use a Reynolds at best meds which is a win by the way any extract artists watching this using cheap parchment is the worst a lot of times I get parchment it's just a dirt cheap and getting getting the wax off of it it's almost like it's a notebook paper I transfer it onto a piece of Reynolds immediately and I usually lose some wax in the process because there's some that just won't come off the paper so ex tractors out there please use Reynolds or just don't skimp on the parchment it's yeah please please yeah that's it I'm gonna go in on a second down here of the Tahoe og live president best investments here in 70 years dark tiny og overtones but just gas just that og gas mmm yeah really really quick man I'm so tired of having this light make me sweat I swear I think I need to get like an air conditioning unit but then I feel like a little air conditioning you didn't hear it make a bunch of noise while I'm filming or a fan or something like that like I have fans and stuff but you can't have that going way of filming so like I need I just need someone like swinging a palm leaf do something could just stand and swing a palm leaf all I had why dude ABS on camera that'd be fantastic yeah yeah yeah I'd wanna put up a wanted ad you know someone could just swing a pong but palm leaf well I do too have yeah it'd be great oh man to describe the buzz from this stuff I would say it is the definitive full-body high definitely an indica back into it but really top to bottom I feel it behind my eyes I feel it in my head shoulders really am i back here resting on my chair but yeah all the way to my toes definitely I just the full-body buzz it is a really really really potent extract this live resin I've had a few different waxes here on my desk and dabbing this stuff will cut the high from this stuff cuts right through everything else I've had flavor-wise so I think the terpenes really really have a lot to do with the buzz on this stuff I mean it's got there's that touristy Tahoe's dark skunky funk and the gas is just so strong and every time every time I dab it I'm just just won't and yeah loving that well guys thank you for tuning in to another Turkey tuesday's than episode 7 the CCC 4:20 my name is chase", "Taw-9QXxfTE": "what is going on YouTube welcome back to puff and Pete's medical cannabis review channel this is a unique one for me I'm going to do a two for one review two reviews in one video because I'm reviewing two products same company and I'm mixing them so hold the thing so I've reviewed it before I reviewed THC ace and before also by Moxie but today I'm gonna be doing sand and sugar I'm gonna put them together it's gonna be in the Jeep and connect I want to get ready riggityrekt son so yeah stick around it's gonna be fun I just got my order in you dab 12 silicon tips came with my new ashtray with D bowler you didn't de bowler and this is awesome silicon dishwasher safe sweet anyway this is what we're here for folks Casey Jones cross banana OG live resin sugar so now this is going to get a little complicated because it's two products Casey Jones banana OG and the sunset sherbert and I say it's gonna get complicated because they have some complicated genetics so Casey Jones banana OG Casey Jones is a cross of oriental express an East Coast Sour Diesel right oriental express is trainwreck in Thai so there's three string banana og is banana cush og cush so there's five string so there's a five strand cross to create this then we've got the sunset sherbert THC a sand which is GSC Girl Scout cookies and pink panties so like I said that's the homework I did online folks don't bust my nuts on this it's just what I found online so I did a little homework for you guys there sorry it's been a long day I did something to screw up my left arm so I don't know if I pulled a muscle or what but it it's bad right up in between from the crook of the elbow kind of radiating upward and outward just mmm so I put some muscle rub on it I'm home I want to medicate all right let's crack into or shall we now full disclosure I've already have cracked into the sand but that's neither here nor there we are March 3rd this was packaged January 21st 2020 is fairly fresh all right let's get into the potency profile THC zero THC a ninety three point zero seven THC V 0 CB d 0 CB g a point nine zero CBD a CBD v CB n 0 CB g 0.63% and then there's a Terp of no name there is no name it just as your person yeah that couldn't show you the cameras I see they're all listed and then no name 0% anyway I thought that was kind of funny and that's the sugar like I said that's the sugar folks the live sugar THC 893 o7 alright not too shabby so there's the live sugar let's crack into that see what it looks like now I'm not gonna be all silly and like oh yeah this is what the scene we already know the sand is white it has no color and it really had no smell this time like the other one was a lemon had a lemon odor all right Casey Jones banana OG very crumbly in there looks like yeah alright so let's take a look shall we again no real nose to it you get a cap underneath there you can kind of see it really nice yellow color it's got a nice bright color it's not too dark yeah I like that yellow not too shabby not too shabby so here's what I'm doing folks I want to get kind of blasted kind of quickly so you heard the numbers on the sherbert they're not the sherbert you heard the numbers on the Casey Jones banana oh gee so what I'm gonna do is kind of being a little ridiculous here with it because my medicine and I want to so I'm putting a couple scoop in of the sugar so you get two or three of them in there to kind of and I'm doing this for two reasons one that's gonna get me really blasted into not using a banger so I've soap base underneath before I put the sand in watch it I know it's crazy hell are you doing with your common sense how dare you sorry folks I'm being a little weird tonight I know little more than usual right alright so the sunset sherbert eh see ace and January 14th so it's a week older than the sugar THC zero THC a ninety nine point two five th CV CBD zeros CBG a 1.12 CB da CB d vc b n zeros c BG point four two that's it folks there's your numbers so of course we know that it's white it's powdery it looks like an illicit drug it's not it's cannabis medicine THC ace and it is not an illegal drug it is not what you guys say it looks like I know I get it I get it I've made the same comment so let's just behave now this stuff I got two of these because they don't come around very often I like to have them just help stretch my meds I'm gonna get kind of a big piggy scoop here I'm going hog on this little ham yeah that's a big old scoop so like I said I'm trying them together this is a review of the two together it's just the way it is it's something new I'm not trying to be a silly I'm not trying to be a smartass I'm doing a gram damn it's not like that I need to get medicated I need to get medicated now this sounded like a good idea and I get to knock out two reviews with one video try something different right work smarter not harder Cheers [Music] definitely cushy cushy flavor it's not crazy it's not like super potent flavor is very smooth though Cheers that was a bit of a bigger hit there that had a better flavor to it too hmm a little more fruitier no more fruity oh boy nice sound like my kids oh sorry folks just one of those days I did while I was taking that I get a notification that finally finally after two weeks my press has shipped my press has shipped ladies and gentlemen finally with that said I'm going to take this moment this moment right here to voice a frustration I have with the company right bud calm yes you right bud calm how in the bloody hell are you as a biz this a busyness going to advertise products as in stock on your website in stock ships within 24 hours two to five days UPS charge me $25 for shipping and not ship the product for two weeks give me no response to my initial inquiries except oh we're very sorry about that there's a delay we'll send you some free filter bags okay I accepted that out of the gate two weeks go by folks two weeks and the only response I can get is oh it's the manufacturer oh it's me if you have to wait for something to come from the manufacturer folks it is not in stock death I'm standing there that's false advertising that's the end of my veteran I have nothing more to say on it because it's not fair to you guys taking away from our time here let's go in again Cheers tasted the banana a little bit on that one so not a whole lot of flavor on the - not a whole lot but I like the mix folks I like the mix I can kind of see it in my eyes already no yeah very much like that mix I think we have to go in for another one though while I am lifted not exactly right where I want to be not quite so let's get a little bit more of this sugar big ol steady beautiful fatty just let me haha play all right [ __ ] let's go in here yeah you get centered in there you little sorry pardon my language but uh I'm just I'm in a mood I'm full of it today piss and vinegar is my mom would call him full of piss and vinegar today I'm not a bad mood okay but I'm not in a great mood I'm in a mood where I'm ready to mess with people because I've had a long week already I'm about to have my awesome weekend with my wife traveling through the Poconos hitting up some dispensaries you know the whole deal so I'm over this week already and I have decided that if I have to deal with people and people have to deal with me and my shenanigans not gonna be a jerk about gonna mean it's gonna be weird I'm gonna make it weird I'm good at it very good at it all right folks Cheers that's a sweet spot got a tickle a little tickle about definitely definitely good medicine my arm just feeling better I mean it's not gone don't get me wrong that's not him this isn't a miracle it's not like I'm him purrs you know um but it's not throbbing anymore and I can function I can talk to you guys I can procede about my evening it's not gonna debilitate me for the rest of the night but it was doing food for the last hour of work and the ride home and cooking dinner before doing this video so that was kind of miserable I mean I love to cook I do it for my family but I wasn't exactly happy to be doing that with a messed up arm so feeling better now I got to take care of the family first then I get to take care of daddy

is San Fernando Valley og and I picked this one up from nature's wonder out in Apache Junction last week this is wonderful stuff man I've been hitting all kind of OGIS lately and this is probably one of my favorites man it's a sativa dominant a hybrid or strain and it's an OG Kush phenotype San Fernando Valley og and it's really wonderful from what I found out from the dispensary THC it's in the 80s so if it's high man it's strong I love this and we're gonna hit this right now this is all I got left I was gonna break this down into like two small doubts by Freya trick and open your little ones so anyhow let's get started because this is a wonderful straight and other one medicating with this it's gratefully going places and doing things and probably Greek it's a wonderful waking bake man I wake and bake with this great strainer medicated before he would work and stuff I felt like a kind of focused attentive great for watching movies it's great for just about anything really I mean if you're going someplace if you're doing something you're not doing anything this is a great strain just over offer just bought just buy anything so yeah totally medicate with this I would hit this on a daily basis man if I could this is a great strain man pressure for in a daytime San Fernando Valley og oh boy it does taste good man has a earthy sweet feeling a little bit of citrus in there like a lemon assumption you feel it oh it's wonderful I love this strain man huh I don't know I wasn't it my favorite of the old G's but definitely up there man like this had me on cloud nine I still want cloud nine right now at least it feels like it it is kind of cloudy in here it's hotbox in my garage anyway so I spin the whole video just freakin coffee for you guys but this is a wonderful strain I would totally get this again man I love this great daytime medicating strain that keeps you stone me in it's got a nice uplifting high you know it's it's wonderful great for anxiety wonderful for stress depression great for depression social anxiety stuff like that absolutely wonderful man everybody that's good for inflammation but yeah it's a wonderful I should I would totally get this again man I love this stuff because that it's gone I was like nah that's my last dab but anyhow if I see it again I totally get it again San Fernando Valley Oh G good stuff", "WQuiL8nODwA": "[Music] the american dream [Music] ain't got no heart", "2NjtA-uFp3Y": "so we've gotten a lot of uh response from the sfv and as far as finishing it out and my advice again was not to hurry up and here even after four days you can see that we've doubled pretty much the size of this bud so i mean if you can look at this bud and just all of the the production that's come on to it she's doubled in size and not just here but if you look at the cola and the head and everything we're talking about uh a good you know 30 inches of bud material right there of a cola and coming on out and that's of a nice eight foot plant with several just dense gigantic nice nuggets like this and look at this one right here i mean all of them whether it's that one or this one they're all bigger than your hand you know and this is sfvog it's the same plant that saved my mother's life several of our patients lives in the san fernando valley in california so if you have aids or cancer this is just one of the plants i cannot recommend enough because it saved my own mother's life so sfvog and i'm breeding it here this variant makes it very well in the state of oklahoma now very pungent dumpster gas sweet smell and that's what we're dealing with here so sfvog by colonel sanders here in og oklahoma og.com", "el2BrRMETU8": "hey yo welcome back I want to get to show you the snug of indoor sfv EOG they like that yummy sometimes you just got to get a little indoor you know you can see all the nice try come check that out nice choice and this is again sfe og and it is a sativa dominant 70/30 I believe and it is from Kings garden and they are down in Coachella California which is a ways away here all the smaller businesses have gone out of business because they put up so many rules and they have so many taxes and rules and everything else that you can't do it so you have to have a lotta money to start a little business here so okay yeah it is and you can see look at this the consequence it is 4 1 eights 3.5 grams it is $60 yeah that's a lot that's like seventeen dollars a gram and that's what I was telling some people the good stuff is 72 gram and you know the outdoor like mind would go for 30 units this is 16 it's you know it's double but it is worth it it's a little bit more pure because it's indoor it doesn't have any other pollutants it doesn't have any other stuff going into it and I really personally I love indoor I miss my grows indoor I really do that's what they moved here to view but I ended up having to do outdoor because it cost so much and yeah that's why I miss my white widow endure really badly but here's the stats and it's got 29.57 percent THC cannabinoids and that's nice it looks like it has zero CBD usually it has some kind of percentage but I guess this is zero and so that's cool it's really good for pain and not being coach lungs that's why I like it I really like your life so I want to get to show you all some nice indoor before I smoke it all and believe me it was really good for school it really helped me I passed a bunch of my chest but I didn't think I was gonna do that it on and I did a lot better than I thought so I'm very excited I'm very happy with that and I'm really happy that Candice smokes or indoor yeah sfe is one of my favorites it's really good it's a nice sativa hide and I'm not huge on sativas but it's got just enough indica that it keeps your mellow and it keeps your you know pain good and they you know keeps everything at a low level as far as pain and doesn't make you too sleepy so I really like that and it's just a good conversation get up and go do your schoolwork kind of so yeah like enough but yeah here's a even closer look at all those nice try comes yeah it look at so yeah I just wanted to get to do a quick video of some nice endure for you I know I don't get to show you any indoor lit you know haven't gotten to lately and yeah we splurged and we got a little to celebrate hopefully having my new car and hopefully by the end of the week it'll be mine and I'll be running around like I always do I can't wait so yeah this is gonna be yummy rest of this is so I hope you all keep tuning in and have a peaceful day", "BaoRwiEHpKE": "hey guys welcome back to greenbox the weed unboxing channel today we've got some bc organic sfb og kush and it has 23 thc and 0.10 cbd and then it was packaged june 24th 2020. and three and a half grams [Music] container kind of feels like the houseplant ones like it's a thicker heavier plastic but not quite the same sorry it just got cut off there so this is first look at the nooks i actually think this is a glass container i thought it was like a thicker plastic like the house plant but it's definitely glass so just scale it got a pretty strong skunky smell to it a little bit of something else too maybe like it's kind of uh peppery or something like that so 3.52 so just the nugs seem fairly dense for color i'd say closer to a medium green got some fairly dark chunks in there good amount of crystal though and then fairly pale hairs but a decent amount it's like a lot of crystal in that section right there like it does seem like pretty solid nuts but like not dry yeah bust it up fairly fluffy you can see the hairs a little bit more they're a little bit darker now and it's still like the skunky kind of peppery smell the nugs do seem like a bit darker than you can obviously like see the patches where like there's dark leaves oh this one's fairly light yeah so bc organic sfv og kush from simply bear organics is a nice strain gives you more of like a uplifting relaxed high like it's fairly balanced i also found the hits had like a pretty strong flavor to them i'm not sure how i would describe it though it busted up real nice i did get a few close-up shots and i will put the video of like the close-up recording in but i will warn you the quality isn't the best i i struggle with keeping the focus throughout the whole video so i will be working on that but yeah this is what i got lots of crystal lots of hairs definitely a nice strain a couple of the darker patches but yeah this goes on for about a minute just kind of looking around the nug again i apologize about the focus i will work on that anyways if you've tried this strain before let us know your experience in the comments below like and subscribe and we'll see you next time thanks for watching you", "5xoorAUUEF4": "you too how did you put up to here all that [ __ ] you guys it's a beautiful beautiful beautiful thing speeding everything extremely simple all you do is you mix up these stock tanks right now one of the leg one right here this is Dominic go say be shy my hair would enough events and stuff insider we've been hearing this [ __ ] exactly one behind maybe the exact image comes on definitely never worth the investment yeah miss we do many lives many likes do you want [Music] [Music] [Music] that quest year and I put a bunch in this here is an 18 live around this is one of the smaller rooms the beaters in here 18 lights to five tons while mouth fans a bottle of co2 here and all the fans right on right on these wall clocks here Slits saw all those fans pull your feet when you got to make a video and cut off some of that damn salad right here we're running a all that vog mailing will be run actually got a few other oh geez and testing the Wi-Fi apply thorough G few others atomically yeah a few other other crosses we've got the sunset sherbert [Music] mainly focus on oh Jesus California's eligible market that's just what everybody wants so then it's just you know skanking enough good flavor everything's well mistaken okay anyways here we got four by eight tables automated tables here that the car goes flex caps so these are six by six by fours four flex cap on top or flex clips two feeders / 4 per block running 40 plants per tray reason why we do that we can run a lot of glass if you grow the plants bigger but well we don't and you strip before we do the blue decent were initiated I blew them about right here we strip all the way up to the first note so we'll strip these flats all the way up so they're very to the little to top leaves are left with every single main branch we do between four to eight arms per plant nice nice canopy don't got the method sevens like I said I'm just coming and making a video giving you guys some content these are all fat on the on the big valves we use these ones we like these blade they're nakta bubblers a 12 quart 12 ports on them starting to stop me [ __ ] open showing you try [Applause] down there way too tight yeah they got like a little screen and them have a little removable screen he touches anything like that this is all ran drain to waste so everything drains out comes here goes to the pub I just spent [Music] as far as like you know how to feed these blocks and all that there's really no way I could tell you how to feed these blocks it's been like the biggest thing learning the response blocks and dialing and then they pull your unit irrigation you know but that's all different you know from the beginning to the end we don't soak these blocks before we plant them we've literally just put them on the trays put the new clones in there put the caps on feed them all the way through and then you know the important thing about these blocks is just managing by banks so my dryvax I mean you want to irrigate this block we want the block to drive back enough to pretty much wick air through the block so the roots can look for that that's the richest who gets bigger you know you readjust your irrigation and then you feed you know fortunately there's really no way and no time limit or anything it's all based on the string it's all based on the size of the plant it's all facing the timing of the plant you know what stage the growth you're in so there's really no dial blade or dial the recipe to feed these blocks you literally have to get in there do the grunt work you know figure out and do trial and error and figure out yourself I don't ever recommend using the Hugo's you know always the Fargo's the quick drains these old hole blowers near as much water content as the Hugo's do these dry out further quickly by now this room gets fed these rooms get fed like every other day sometimes every day like I said resolve and size the plants in the stage you know that the plants are any that pose here the customer I'll be made and on the homeless that stuff in line these big fat blood standards that all these plants are weak for well bloom so they're just starting if they're familiar with LG's you know week four you know this is just a beautiful size we're just beginning before by the end of week four these things would be by about that big bunny in the week for though Jesus don't start putting on a lot of their weight and so week seven we need to see a lot of genetic change you know when it comes to puro cheese like this year to check Eric things you know you can do it this way run and inline fans and the put an in-between the I always you know you can get the mouse will point them up you know you can do it that way can right over the corners you know if you don't want to really either cleaning spans or pay someone to clean these fans every single run nasty all digital thermostats in here all these a digital Wi-Fi [Music] I saw a little beauty controllers to control everything right here let's go once it's all the rooms and splits off and a lot of the ship pretty much just a nice clean definitely want to spend the money and hire the proper guy to do the electric election was very important and yet they want to [ __ ] around with that male sees that his Mirko Curzon porky Traci's Mexico these are 12-foot ceilings we just about other things not green lights in here while working the dark the beds about the fluorescent to turn the green lights on with the switch or the falafel all right here brainless there the best-managed with everything at night yeah I mean it's really about it yeah I guess so so this room there's a lot more rooms there's a lot of work to do in this facility each and every single day ton of work the new to this want to start growing and you know you're passionate about it a ton of work the markets very very competitive especially here in California your product has to be just exceptional we can't be any any any slip-ups on your product you can't have anything that goes wrong throughout this whole crop cycle you really have to be dialed in especially when you have this many rows it's important that you really really know what you're doing first before you try to expand on a crazy level most years that have been following me you know either doing this for now 13 years so I've you know had a pretty a pretty good knowledge base geez nice using extremely huge trying to think another video later on I'm gonna hold over the second video show anyone you know oh yes this is uh this is what it looks like now so no more buckets no more of that stuff you know you can easily just you know access every plan which arose everything's cleaning just toss these blocks at the end struck the tray is putting the trays you know put any blocks and you're ready to rock and roll again you got guys here just a quick update and hope you guys enjoy you have any comments or questions or whatever I'll try to I'll try to get to those we post more actively on insta a lot of it's just easier music people see just going on nice update yeah about politics and mother Rose and take care guys", "Utbi8tHWLmo": "[Music] [Music]", "Y0UBbSFI_7g": "future what's going on I'm gonna give you guys some night shots these plants come down tomorrow you where the dogs are living line everything smaller we're on ours it's hard to do [ __ ] with these these camera balls somebody's dog sir really really large they're falling every word about the double screen everything next time set up a lower net here and then hollering it top so the bugs don't lean on each other start falling over shouldn't be too bad to trim which these are pretty easy when it comes to that here's the SoCal Master Kush this one just fallen operator work sir I just gotta test their plant through in there these are all that subbies ones that I showed you before and these lots of around these tables very classic og knows the ones that have smelted before you know what I'm talking about this whole section just busted past the net really nice and for us to do great Calix production super stinky the GDP Kennish this GDP not so huge on this thing super dent quality she won't grow nowheres near this big and soil there's another one earlier here a lot of guys grow the strain in soil and little tiny notes the rock world GDP doesn't look like the same strength then the serious the Blue Dream it's gonna have one of these inside the room nice achieve a smooth and the GDP is a monster I'm not really wanted and none of these strains we wanted so kill anymore unless you once you're growing on geez that's pretty much it some more sfv nothing they're not wanted they're just it's not worth it for the for the grower to to grow these strains between power and chores and just everything else it's just not worth it at the end there's don't like how Harry she stayed the whole time she's not as solid as this years just string her up like crazy all these garden ties everywhere she was a mess she's a really really big yield or so see I just don't think we were a higher scale than me the platinum and the others this is all smb2 a small table Australia's extremely fun to grow you really gotta have a room that has controlled there at all time I can't grow this you know your battle ants have a heat issues or you don't have air conditioning that can you get any of that on this room's got to be completely in line there's still room for improvement here as far as mass mastering the magnesium levels of their strength you got it no Allen it just right these ones I grew a little bit bigger I'm gonna tag all the ones on these two tables see if they yield more than the other ones that a flowered shorter everybody seems to draw their own juice pretty small seems like the less heads you end up with you know if you go between four and six heads you'll end up with way like huge no just like baseball sized dogs the more dogs the plant has more it's gotta feed so you end up with smaller dogs and you draw them bigger so cows are so picky that uh we really got a have everything dialed in if you want to survive when it comes to growing out here it's not wrong for our over here everything's flushed out real nice and that the smaller large at the bottom here not too bad with the again you can see the trichome development and good straight legs are pulled too so I said nice I keep my nice 72 73 degrees you know towards the end I I drop it down to around 70 and that's what the running co2 what everything seems like if you you know up the up the temperature even with the co2 the way the they say the plants were supposed to work with absorbing the co2 the stomata opens up at a certain temperature not this straight the other strain yes G nope alright guys only what everything looks like before comes down enjoy any comments or anything leaving the box though", "xPpYOUi74cc": "hey what's going on folks this is Steve Stevenson with Maryland marijuana review how y'all doing you know insurance doesn't cover blowing minds but I do have some mind blowing weed and yeah insurance won't cover that either well I hear tell it may cover it now but we'll save that video for another time ah the product in question here today before we get into it is a disclaimer all products here reviewed 100% in compliance with Maryland state law everything I check in to is bought locally from local distributors dispensers and this particular product here was purchased from trilogy wellness on route 40 so anybody under 21 is advised to turn away I appreciate the youngsters but there's not much I can do here they won't allow you to hang out I'm sorry high five and uh good luck on the next journey and all reviews are my own I don't get anything from anybody for doing this it's just products I buy I want to be honest about the things I buy you know sometimes you get a bud that's got a really high potency but uh doesn't taste very good or vice versa you know what I mean you get something that tastes great but it's got a loo you know bang for buck so that's what I'm here to do you know I'm just here to give an honest opinion on what I got the stuff in question here that we have is a San Fernando Valley og og cush yeah that's definitely a mouthful but I believe it's SV it's San Fernando Valley yes it doesn't matter what it is there's an acronym for it and it's quality the bud is lighter color it's got a lot of crystals on it but I don't think the cameras doing it much justice it's got a lot of hairs on the two but it's not a crazy hairy bud but they're definitely not glued down they're there about four you know pretty close as I mentioned I've already reviewed this once and I had a major major failure on where I actually got this from and I wanted to redo it because I can't hit a bit I'm doing all this on my cell phone so I'll San Fernando Valley og let's check into it let's see how this product goes yeah definitely has a weed smell it's got a little bit of a skunky musky kind of essence to it the density of it is definitely more elastic it has a bounce back if you squeeze it it'll you know slowly spring back on you it's not a super Drive plan either so when you crumble it you know it keeps a lot of the parts together which is is cool in my opinion for rolling joints I've tried rolling joints with dust it's not that it can't be done but you know yeah say for what it's worth San Fernando Valley oh gee cush let's get into it yeah it's got a really good taste to it it's definitely more in the the earthy weedy kind of taste I like it and it's a mellow buzz our mellow toke it doesn't have too much harshness to it I am getting over a cold so I do have a coffee coming we stand by yeah but that's how I feel about it um yeah this cold is killer I don't know what else I could do it a kick it I I was over it by the peoples unity fest concert but I've still got a call that's from 9 and that's in my quarter week two weeks who knows it's all time it's all relative so yes I'm Fernando Valley og cush is pretty good bud all things considered and I like the taste I could see me buying this again yeah all things considered and the look it's got a premium look for buds you know what I'm saying that uh that looks not that you can judge a book by it's cover because some books look bland but they you know they're amazing so yeah but I think that's where we're at on that um thank you all for your time and cooperation this has been Steve Steven Singh with marijuana review giving you an honest opinion on what I do what I buy and uh I get my numbers reset on the 21st so I'll grab some more weeds on the 21st or the 20th we'll see I forget what day it is but it will pick it up some more stuff so stay tuned and I do always appreciate you all joining me leave comments in the comment section if you have any questions or anything that you wanted me to review you don't I mean if you're like hey I've got a really good bud you should try to do a review on this I'll be more than happy to listen and if it's at a place that I have I'm gonna try the glue guerilla gluten for I want to try the headband eight one eight and yeah as soon as I get my numbers back I'm gonna go for the I wanted to also try the dos educe is that how you say it I think

see you guys get notified every time we upload my go everybody will catch you guys next video yep", "hq817YjbISY": "welcome back please gentlemen boys and girls this is some OBC we're doing another little episode of growing for freedom this is a sum of a long awaited video I would imagine for a lot of people that have been following my channel and I will either growth freedom channel but also the previous celibacy channel this is really my first time making a video for a while so I do excuse some of my vocal hang-ups and idiosyncrasies you know just kind of trying to get back in the groove and a lot has happened obviously over the last few months and as always whenever I do take an extended break without leaving any good reason there's always a lot of speculation as to what may have happened or whatever the [ __ ] whatever and to be terribly honest guys there's a lot of reasons why I stopped making videos and I'm gonna talk a little bit about that right now first thing is that a few months back basically moved into a new Sonny's place and it's a lot nicer obviously then the test pool of a [ __ ] hell that I basically you know still kind of live at now and for you guys it's been out of my neighborhood obviously this is about as bad as it gets guys you know if I take some pictures on my street it would be some pretty shocking [ __ ] especially to all you guys out there to suburbia I've never seen the the rectum of downtown LA you know but that's that's basically I think of the most horrific scene you've ever seen from the most darkest and grimiest movie you've ever seen and that's basically you know where HQ is but obviously it has benefits for what I do and that's why we stick to it but in any case guys ya didn't make the move and I've really been enjoying myself I've been making it kind of a habit to you know isolate myself from all things having to do with growing while I am out at my new spot I think it's really important that I you know someone somewhat detached from work because I have been I think probably taking this I wouldn't say to seriously but you know you have to understand ladies gentlemen that you know to date I have not really had anything even close to a real vacation in someone that like something like five or you know whatever years you know unless you count like a six month stay in LA County has vacation which I personally do not but yeah you know it gets tough after a while and even though there are a lot of benefits and perks to this lifestyle at the end of the day it is still work and if you are totally pushing ahead to try to grow and expand and prove you know upon your game it'll start growing you know becoming grueling and stressful just like anything else so I really don't want to you know paint the picture that this is just an absolute walk in the park and it's rosy you know obviously that's a huge thing you know term that gets thrown around you know that it's so easy to sit in your house and grow pot that it's obviously not the case and it's never the message that spread on this channel you know everything here is all about stepping up the game keeping up with the latest and greatest in regards to strength technology and you know the knowledge of the market in order to survive in this business and that's that's pretty much that you know I'm stance so as far as the other things are concerned you know it's really really hard guys to keep up with the schedule you know obviously with full time work going back back in 14 different places trying people with vo entering and you know titling and then doing a site composition it's it's a real load and with using the site building tools that I do also find out that there was a code limitation that really held back how I wanted to design the site in the long term and although I do know how to jump through the appropriate hoops flaming hoops perhaps to make this thing work in a good way it's just a lot of [ __ ] mental stress that I just really had to withdraw from in order to just make sure that everything else obviously performs at the highest levels blow impossible because that is ultimately the highest priority and you know more importantly you know I don't think that I am nearly as relevant on YouTube as I was before you know when I started making videos there was really nobody that was making good quality videos on YouTube as far as like spreading knowledge ideas and techniques on how to really make it as a you know grower in a professional style you know someone who is they were constantly working against time tables you know scheduling transplants you know learning the advantages of timing stuff like that nutrient feeding regimens correct expectations in regards to results I mean seriously not allow that what's going around but you know here we are more than a couple years later and there's plenty of guys making videos on YouTube excellent videos you know with better video editing better rendering better video quality than what I was do it you know and I broke a lot of barriers initially but you know people have definitely accepted the torch they've carried it on so with that being said that was you know really the purpose from the beginning so don't really feel so bad about leaving everyone hanging because there's plenty of other cannabis grow content out there and it's getting better and better all the time you know I'm saying but we're going to come back here I do want to you know continue on with these season to you of my growing freedom escapades and other a lot of great things going on obviously as there always are but there's also been a lot of changes and I thought it would be a good idea for those changes to completely manifest before doing the video series although I do think it is important to keep up with you know consistent video uploads if you are going to be trying to you know really educate and share knowledge as best you can because it does help you know obviously you know it will give you some of the first name glimpse into the absolute monotony that growing can become but at least was a little break in video production I cannot reintroduce all the new changes as well as some some of the new philosophies that I've kind of adopted over the last few months with my growing endeavors so without further ado guys let's uh reintroduce the money maker Guardians so you know obviously for all you guys have been watching my videos up to this point I really fall with the Sun kind of hostile so far no I think this is a great way to grow plants how's the huge amount of advantages versus the the 24 plant five gallon model which is you know essentially what I had before now talking about San Fran of alle OG specifically so far my highest yielding result growing this plant was using the 24 plant five gallon pot configurations so you know I am kind of using that as my baseline to beat that which is at about four point eight pounds now I am currently working on many Korean the most recently harvested grow they came out of this garden obviously because these plants are all more less fresh the transplanting but I don't think I'm gonna hit 4.8 you know in fact I think I would be closer to four which would be right along par with what my very first SF Fiocchi grow was and you know that would be the first 16 plant SF EOG harvested from this garden and that's so terribly great but relatively without expectations from you know a lot of other growers that have been handling this strain now the SF EOG strain is definitely not characteristically a high yielding strain not on this strain has a lot of difficulty supporting its own weight even though it does not have large buds at all they are incredibly dense however but you know when this plant really finishes it up it never really thickens out at any point you leave it the trunk any of the branches really develop any heart think this is the way you see like in the Blue Dream you know which you know even though that plant obviously has a lot of difficulty supporting its weight those plants build up a lot of weight and you know structurally if you were trying to apply the butts that's you know growing on blue dreams to sfv you would literally have no chance on all whatsoever so this video really goes out to all those guys out there that are trying to grow massive vog I know that I've put this strain into circulation there are a lot of people that have adopted it I really really love it and they love it you know cuz it's [ __ ] the [ __ ] and we've grown properly the results are just absolutely phenomenal and for anyone who is really serious about making it in this business you know there's it's generally a good idea to keep a high percentage of this strain in your repertoire especially if you can overcome the challenge in this and that's we're gonna focus on you know with this next grow is really to overcome the challenges so obviously we have 42-inch occasions this is something that we've done with every girl before but in order to make things more hardcore we really had to start building that support system now I think in the long run I probably am gonna shift this specific Guardian to handle strains more like the Mendel after which it has a very short growing profile the main reason is because I don't really want the trellis in this garden I only have it in here because I am growing SMB in here but I think we move forward we're gonna be doing a little bit of a switch room strains with the 6000 watt guard and now go a little more you talk about that later but the main reason for that is because the lack of space you know I mean I do have access to this Lane here although I really cannot Traverse across the rear nor can i really Traverse across this back wall unless I want to crawl underneath the the table that is supporting it be seated in which I can't realistically do but you know with my growing style I'm more of a lavish grower I like having easy access I do believe in having us you know a good amount of human space you know I don't believe in just stuffing rooms full of plants and try its use every bit of square footage you know it's a cover with canopy I'm firmly against that you know I'm all about order and planning for everyone you know not only the grow system itself the plants but also yourself so you can access everything so obviously the trellis really doesn't fit that but it is something that I can definitely manage for the time being so this thing guys it's really really cheap to build I think that these are like 2 by 1 or 1 by twos is they're two by twos all of these wood pieces here come already pre-cut in an 8 they cost like 75 cents each all you need is like a drill or impact driver and you know two screws per will usually get it done you know this whole thing here probably cost less than $30 you know essentially less than like a gallon of Bud candy you know it's not expensive at all whatsoever and I'm using the attendant care for a trellis you know this is the I believe it's there for it's a four by sixteen essentially yeah so I cut that up to make it eight by eight and really really easy just use some ties to attach it and we already be doing full trellising at two levels so right here this is actually a post that was cut to five feet this is the actual actually only the only piece of wood you have to cut are the posts like I said everything else comes pre-cut to eight foot so if you are doing a 4000 watt configuration which is my favorite essentially an 8x8 box is perfect for that size so all these wood pieces come pre-cut except for the posts which you've kind of a 5 feet and then directly below I have another level to do Charleston and there's a 1 foot separation gap between the seams so combined the cages will load the first layer you know then you get the first rather than the second Charlie Slayer you know that's a lot of support guys I really have a lot of confidence that this new configuration will definitely handle any of the vertical height limitation you know problems we released a limitation that vertical height dishes I've been having with the the San Fernando Valley other cheese so really really really good upgrade I think and we're gonna see how it goes now as far as the nutrient delivery this new trellis does create some complications you know as far as accessibility is concerned you know like I said I really can't get in here without going through here it's difficult you know to get around this I get into the plan towards the furthest back Lane is really hard so we went ahead and adopted a new watering system and initially started with this but after you know not really digging this too much I actually got a much simpler version that had a threaded end on it it just so happens this threaded end meets perfectly with the the pre threaded hole that comes with my reservoir which is excellent so you know what I want to mix my nutrients that basically just plug in the pump I use the the 1/2 horsepower monty pump which is the same pump that i used for my top featured irrigation systems so obviously a lot of water pressure backing that and with that thing running and you know at full strength all the time you know this thing's fully open this thing locked open you can just add nutrients right to the reservoir let it run for a bit and it will do an excellent job of mixing all your nutrients so that is a really really sweet upgrade and of course with this extra you know length I can just get down in there and get water to all the plants and because it doesn't have that funky attachment on the end it's a nice you know basically like a faucet you know the water comes out super super smooth with no bubbles it's just pure water and no splash in this it's a very very clean way of getting water to the plants and I really really like it it definitely suits you know I should say it definitely solves the problem of accessibility in regards to water so I don't worry about that too much now in regards to nutrients we're gonna move forward again with the house and garden Coco's a and B do like this nutrient line specifically because the fact that I can use it in both grow and bloom stages and obviously with the ESPE dojis I really determined after a most recent experiment that it said II that you really have to finish these plants in the seven gallon environment before you flip them you know if you don't these things are the instead piece we really don't get the root development and the head start they need to really become it was a really reach their potential as flowering plants so you know once they make into the seven gallons you do that vej it's nice to be able to use you know one nutrient base for both you know so that's primarily the reason why I use it not only that you know I got good results we get and battle blooms and it's a price pretty well you know how far is pretty good [ __ ] combine that with cycle up take these a little cover load I'm actually starting to use the Orca same guys that make great white I think it's like the plant success I could be wrong I look it up but yeah the great white obviously is a huge product I'm use it for a while huge favorite of mine the Orca is essentially the liquid version of great white you know in a nutshell and much more cost-effective believe it or not to we just generally inverse the rule you know essentially when you go over to any kind of the lipid soluble alternative to a powder product you're generally going to pay more money for it but I'm not in the case of Orca at least not from what grade or told me now now you know obviously reduced evasive Shuster bottom which is always a a favorite item of mine that's been a really rotten shield the reason the advance nutrients additives speakpipe overdrive the general hydroponics for surplus as well as snowballs antenna cameras come back plus the honestly favored mind as well as sweet raw although I think I might pretend to be wrong from the regimen and trying out humble honey last bro I should yeah last girl that I just finished was one where I was experimenting by cutting out liquid caramel hood at the late stages and not using a candy but using combination of sweet wrong with floorless plus but I don't really like that combination too much to be terribly honest you know honestly guys I think that after this you know next grow with whatever combination I do you know whether it be humble honey floorless plus or you know maybe it's going back to Boyd Canyon say [ __ ] it I'm going to be trying out the psycho line because that is really the only nutrient line that I've not tried on SMP and it's probably more that I should have done you know due to the fact that Guren he had really good results with it but you know for whatever reason I've been kind of falling into this will house a garden trap I did have good results like I said you know a four point eight right there at five pounds and I think that with this this new trellis layer will be able to really lock this canopy in you know we do food work by the plants will make sure that we bench them nice and hard early I'm hoping to build to break all the records we'll definitely see this one that we're gonna be tracking and you know like I said for all you guys out there that are growing Stanford a value chain that a questions about Stanford the value Qi I know at this point guys there is probably close to if not more than 100 you guys out there growing in this doesn't the video for you guys to check out so that is pretty much it for this video update the next video update we're gonna be talking about the the 6000 watt and really just giving everyone a more-or-less update of what I feel about that garden overall after running it for as long as I have and as some of the changes that we're making to it in the future so definitely stay tuned for that guys thanks for watching and see you in a little bit [Music]", "PFaGROadYTA": "all right today we are also going to review the Kings clear hybrid and it's Wi-Fi you don't open like that and then you just close that back up but I mean y'all need this but it's pretty pretty cool a box where you can keep Cupidon to not forget you can reven Wright name on it because it doesn't like the little it's not as much as this box I mean the wherever you're hitting it obviously you can tell the difference between this and then another [ __ ] way doc let me take up the other one like at first like and looking looking at them like you can't tell the difference between them right but hitting them you can tell like the different effects but it's good to have like something where you can put it in where you could be like oh yeah this is a savio gene this is whatever else you have or whatever you should have been open that's why I was reviewing mine you're holding pretty quality and because consistency welcome to the new industry standard tree based it says a hybrid strain with a pungent OG flavor possesses pine notes with a sharp spicy citrus overlay that is so characteristic of OG Wi-Fi OG vapes cleanly and provides a comprehensive great and something I wanted to show you guys is now it has different things on it like I actually shows the total THC total all it shows when it was produced it shows who you can call and all that you see all that new [ __ ] that they put in and as you guys can see it's different color than the old ones because the old ones look different Oh watch I'll show her old package or but look different kind of yellow either ways the old packaging is like this right here good yellow I like you just pull it out now let's take a poll you guys would be able to see the smoke more there was a little bit but you guys until there's a lot of fun it looks beautiful I think I saw I have a little bit of the other one so that I've been saving it I thought my pen is alive does it fit though it's just it's she's mine oh look you can tell the difference in color did it work I've been saving the Sun I've just been hitting the other pendants to keep dropping [ __ ] tree bass clear I feel like it'd kill us busy hmm yeah but they don't make full batteries yeah they do have batteries I just don't know where they sell them I felt right away but it's that much of it as a burn oh my [ __ ] you're really is really here yeah I mean that the that tastes good so yeah what does that one taste like cuz I don't get playing small for it oh it tastes like what it said it no no it tasted like like knowing they didn't taste like that laughs I see you Freddie no it tastes it it tasted like og Oh like OG Kush and og not Otis Lee like have you ever had like oh this for you guys oh gee coach or any other oh gee strains yeah basically they Gil have a different type for taste and that's what it gives and it does give that it Doug if you're have it in your mouth it does you can feel the scent of pine you don't taste it but you feel the Senate I don't know if you get what I mean Wi-Fi OG and this is and dizzy which is ssv oh geez all right yeah they're both I would recommend both I got this one for 55 the gram great and look at it and it looks way better than before it doesn't look as dark looks like cat piss looks great that's not supposed to look and this one looks great too if this one came in a program it'd be great but both of them are great I would recommend both if you can get them if you can't then I try to get a kingpin or something that has great flavor not as potent but great flavor try to my friend", "C1ADUQvsA9M": "[Music] hey I am Yanni and we'll be talking a little bit about sfv og so it's part of the og family so right

"S7JiOgCQqy4": "personalized everything thank here back on with another video today I'm gonna be doing a review for San Fernando Valley oh gee speaking pod now for it to be a proper review unlike some other videos I just pop - my first time review I've gone through about more than half way about 3/4 all the way through with this Daisy pod so far so I could give you guys my full review I know it looks kinda like half way but this is a full grande pod they go up to about like here so that's why looks little less but yeah anyways my first thing I got to say about this is it is an indica usually I do not get into pods especially for this biggie because I don't know the sativa gives me a really good head rush it makes me and kind of like a talkative like a talkative mood I just be talking I'll be fated as [ __ ] and it gets my brain pumping but recently I kinda just wanted to sit back relax just get faded and just slump out so I decided to get an indica my first choice for the indica was obviously the OG Kush for the stage because actually not really obviously but if you guys don't know it tastes [ __ ] amazing the rainbow candy flavor is incredible so I really like that but the dispensary I was picking up from they didn't have any of those so I decided to go with Santana Valley sfv OG and to be honest I really like it I like it more than a hardcore OG for sure granddaddy purp and Irish granary purple hybrid I think grant daddy perp might be a hybrid actually but I do like these more than the hardcore OG I haven't had much body in a while so I wouldn't be able to tell you if I like this more than that but I really really do like San Fernando Valley or I shouldn't be the thing about this part is it really doesn't have that much flavor sorry I'm talking with smoke coming out of my mouth but it doesn't have too much flavor to it which is kind of a good thing and then kind of not really a good thing it doesn't have a like it doesn't have a lot of than terpenes flight like the terpene flavor um it's just like pure wax but it also doesn't give off like that wax flavor - it doesn't at least for me for someone that smokes a lot of oil it doesn't give off like that that aftertaste and kind of feel that that wax does which is kind of weird but it definitely does hit like a [ __ ] indica like you could tell for sure that he knows what they're doing and that when they say something's indica or sativa it really is which is hard to do for oils a lot of the time because they're just a mixture of weed that's compressed so it's hard to get an exact exact strength and an exact strain exact or strain hand um the exact the type of weed I guess what it's called but that's why it's digi I think they haven't nailed down cuz the sativa gives you that straight head rush and then their indica gets you slumped and their hybrid their hybrids are weird I don't really like hybrids on species that much the last birthday cake pod one was a hybrid but it kinda if I feel like you're like it balances each other out like the sativa cancers out the indica the indica and sativa I know it doesn't work that way but that's kind of how it feels for me when I do smoke hybrid but anyway just take some more into this how you guys can probably expect this [ __ ] smack but yeah so I've had this full gram for since Saturday and it's currently Wednesday so probably got about another day or two left on here so that'll be almost a week so that should be good that's about how long I expect this dizzy pod to last me a full gene yeah I don't usually get full G's usually I get half G's but the dispense I went to is out of half G's so I was just like [ __ ] it might as well get a full G for a change and honestly I might start getting full G's I don't know but I've been chiefing this a lot and it's been lasting me pretty well so yeah just drop it but anyways thank you guys for watching hopefully one of you guys goes in cops the San Fernando Valley og Stacey pod or any Stacey pod I really enjoys these products and that's one of my favorite babes for a weed on the marker I know so anyways it's been anything dank peace out", "74RdUV-hjaI": "little before 9:00 on September 7th Labor Day 2015 very bright morning it's gonna be a hot week this week and we close to 100 degrees today things are developing nicely let me take a little tour around the garden shot this earlier in the day when the light is low because this hour the bed points are obvious from afar a lot of development since the last recording which was about a week ago things are busting out all over looking very nice probably next week we'll get some some close-ups we'll get some images with the microscope see if we got any trikes showing yet these things have solid centers there's really developing nicely of course we're still using the flower initiator 730 nanometer light to make the plants like tonight as longer so they will develop more rapidly yeah the smell is starting to develop pretty nicely now it's a fruity sour push very consistent odor from plant to plant although the appearance is slightly different little bit of genetic shift from seed to seed I

got a super dank very smoky taste it's not quite like locking up my chest but it is making me want to cough a lot it's locking my know I can't stop coughing and it hurts this is definitely the hardest thing we've smoked that didn't taste horrible as well eyeballs hurt and that's that's an important distinction to make this is super hard on your chest and lungs and throat but it doesn't take bad unlike some others we've done that were super hard and tasted horrible if you can stand the burning face it it's it's okay Ilan's being a coffle lung up so let's keep smoking if we can tell you what I be back in a minute and we're back so we did have to stop prematurely um not like other ones where we've stopped prematurely because it was just so horrible but or it wouldn't smoke right or this is

up plus you know it is what it is so that's like my almost captain safer girl cape in this [ __ ] so where was i um frame for another greenhouse i gotta take all that [ __ ] out there um we gonna use the whole bag attack situation so i need to come up on like four to five pallets of [ __ ] uh miracle-gro soil um and yeah after i said that i need to come up with about four to five pallets oh this right here [ __ ] this right here [ __ ] and ain't nobody gonna be able to shame me i don't give a [ __ ] what you better not fall y'all [ __ ] you're leaning bro you're good don't chucky chucky check

saying you just had to you did what you needed to do when you had to do it ain't no race cause i ain't never seen a rat really win a race yet yeah you can use a fish tank water i've done that before i ain't gonna do [ __ ] you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna take a whole bunch of these bags i'm gonna ladies [ __ ] sideways like this i'm finna put a i'm gonna put a plant i'm gonna cut a little extra to put a plant in there i'm gonna put the irrigation line in that [ __ ] i'ma pull the trellis across that [ __ ] and that's a wrap i don't want to have to touch these plants like when these plants like i want to be able to fill up the whole goddamn greenhouse like there's no reason to go in there when it's when it's done like we're done we'll cut that [ __ ] down and go like i'm trying to have some like big crazy [ __ ] i'm trying to use like i said four to five pallets of miracle gross soil i'm trying to use that [ __ ] quick start solution [ __ ] during a veg i'm trying to hit this [ __ ] little plant food all up in veg i actually said you're supposed to use this all the way through but then again if i put these plants out there in march we're going straight into bloom we're going directly in the bloom and [ __ ] gonna go crazy is it gonna work i don't know i have no idea i don't know what the [ __ ] that happened i know i've seen a lot of homies go outside with a bunch of [ __ ] plants in about march and about may they was walking inside with a whole bunch of weed say hey man how you do that man i just left plants outside you for real he said yeah it wasn't alive but you know i was like and i was just outside yeah i was like so what y'all [ __ ] doing in the greenhouses he said we turn it up in there boy shenanigans in there boy hey and we gonna feed that [ __ ] right here right then we're gonna come over here probably like in a uh uh well part of bloom probably like week three of bloom put the little balloon boosters or whatever the [ __ ] in it and we're gonna see we're gonna see what's up i don't care what it tastes like i don't care about none of that [ __ ] i want some big ass giant [ __ ] plants with some super duper backbones in it with the [ __ ] super duper frosty pretty colors on that [ __ ] i don't care when the [ __ ] say oh that's kind of hard someone said [ __ ] that's called gas evidently you're not used to gas we in the business so wait a minute this one was like 9.99 the bloom booster was like 12.99 and it's four pounds we went in bro we went y'all [ __ ] leaning hey you look like one of the drunk uncles you know the [ __ ] be drinking too much and they can start slouching down into the chest like he's about to go down he's not about to go down told you about drinking on the job dog get you [ __ ] up you can't be doing that [ __ ] yeah i gotta scoot your [ __ ] back son there we go how about that how about i did we good soldier [ __ ] you're getting held up by some dixie cups and some one gallon of plastic pots in this [ __ ] now what do i expect out of this i really don't expect nothing too much out of like the these spring runs i really don't spring runs is just the process of us getting geared up and going through the process you know what i'm saying like okay cool i need to tighten this up a little bit i need a little tighten up on that because the greenhouses ain't going to really get to cracking cracking rocking hard rocking hard that june july august june july august is going to be turned up in the [ __ ] greenhouse now i really expect to see my most craziest [ __ ] outdoor adventures on the 50 full sunners the 50 full sunners with the [ __ ] miracle grow and all that other [ __ ] i expect gargantuans i expect some [ __ ] we ain't never seen and that's why i'm spending the time today getting the clones ready for the next day so today we will be doing um what will we be doing i want to say we're gonna be doing mauio g i gotta check though uh here's our little tray you see anything white in there [ __ ] that is not mold that is [ __ ] roots growing up in there that's how she get down like i was telling everybody earlier in some of the earlier vids like i expect powdered mold i expect bug i expect all whatever can be [ __ ] up on a plant to be honest be [ __ ] up on a plant um i mean like yeah hold on hold on give me a second i gotta do something so what i wanted to start doing is i wanted to start taking these uh oasis cubes that we're using as a cloning material with our little plants and i wanted to start using this right here but i noticed that i didn't do that so i need to go make some real quick give me a second boy you did good on the one you [ __ ] up on the other one though hey happy birthday happy happy birthday so basically i'm just to take like a picture and probably like maybe like a quarter cap mix that up and use that for my uh for my little clown bag bags there's some good ass [ __ ] weed i'm kind of like a little prepped on it because i've been smoking that [ __ ] from from the mountain all the way down boy so first you wanna shake [ __ ] up so one of the homies is like oh my god i can't believe you used a miracle girl that is so bad for an environment i was just like dude shut the [ __ ] up i'll smack the [ __ ] out of you i do not tell you how to [ __ ] your [ __ ] i do not tell you how to pay your bills i do not tell you how to wipe your ass or wash your clothes don't you [ __ ] dare come over into my grown man section and tell me anything about the [ __ ] ethics immorals not unless you're gonna shake out all your dirty [ __ ] laundry and all your [ __ ] up skeletons out your closet he was like dog i was just trying to help you i was like but you learned to die didn't you i love cryptocurrency going to scan mountain we already there boo we are already there scam mountain we so already there that this [ __ ] already up there all we got to do is get up there and finish the rest of the work that's up there hahaha yeah baby hollow and it be i do want to say something though not to be cocky i beat them old man's asses on that hill this year they weed good don't get it [ __ ] up but since i used like all that citric acid and all that extra [ __ ] my buds are way tighter they [ __ ] gassy they got nose online i'm like get solid but when it comes down to be like oh me feel a little different that's what they got i don't really [ __ ] i don't drink bro like i really don't drink like that like every now and then like when i need to like you know like share out with the team i like pop a little hennessy um but i'll be about some little bitch-ass little like fruity booty drinks like uh dirty bananas and uh to kill a priest and like you know like fun [ __ ] when we out there you know at the all-inclusive resort and [ __ ] bruh oh okay back going to the moon tomorrow i heard that uh mr beast was out there selling space on his little thing he was gonna send to the moon but i don't know [ __ ] my nose is my nose is on this bro this is my hustle app i can't stop and slow up we remember i said we started on the hunch now what if i told you that you can use this on your clone starts that to give your clone starts to [ __ ] edge you take like take your little picture shake up your little bottle so it's half a cap per gallon that's not a gallon so i'm just gonna do like a quarter [ __ ] look nasty as [ __ ] though not done they look like [ __ ] uh sour apple juice like it looks like some [ __ ] like a kid to try to drink maybe a little more little mo there we go bam bam bam bam tighten up little [ __ ] tighten up i'm a little partner what's up dog you gucci you're good okay so of course i ain't got nothing to mix that [ __ ] up with yeah i do i'm gonna mix it up with my little dab stick so this is my customizable you know what i'm saying like american dad uh nutrient mix stick that's come with garvey and i'm gonna use it to to mix a little [ __ ] up all right so this gonna get kind of weird because remember i'm using the this solution well [ __ ] if you really want to pull up and do something [ __ ] just pull up and do something i'm here so this is gonna be a mixture of avid and eagle 20. like i said this would be your mixture of avid eagle 20. so let's take a moment to talk about some of you [ __ ] concerns right now because you were probably looking at me like my [ __ ] are you really growing weed with miracle grow and you're using avid and eagle 20 are you for real right now and you're using miracle-gro soil um well let me explain something to you uh yeah [ __ ] we really is we going all in all about all in all about and we drinking straight black coffee that's how real it is what up even welcome to the spot man welcome to the spot man so i need to start rocking out these [ __ ] everything i got to get everything kind of like in a you know ow [ __ ] get my elbow so now i got gonna kind of see i gotta scoot over a little bit so i can make sure everything is at arm distance because once we start rocking this [ __ ] we gonna start rocking this [ __ ] i keep telling you [ __ ] it is all about high volume cannabis production get [ __ ] get your uh corporation find you another [ __ ] legal cannabis uh entity work up under their license through a [ __ ] subcontracting [ __ ] paperwork get your little [ __ ] [ __ ] together with your attorney and then start mobbing yeah the [ __ ] who be getting these [ __ ] things yeah they know what it is and they're like okay cool no problem at least we know what it is it was kind of weird i was like hey man i'm about to do such ancestor like that's good i was like what i was like oh yeah so if i can show them that you can use miracle girl on their nursery them nigga's about to hustle her they bout to flip that he was too cool with that like like he didn't even like he didn't even batted his eyes like okay cool that's good i'm like that's good what's good about it like what like where come out here let me talk to you for a minute what you mean that's good what's good you didn't tell me [ __ ] but that's how we be rolling around i don't give a [ __ ] about no liquid terps not unless we gonna do something janky with a weed bag we gonna do some janky with a weed bag i need all them turp bags one of the homies gave me a link to all the turps the wrench terps the [ __ ] [ __ ] your [ __ ] pull her hair turbs choke her out spank her turns like all the [ __ ] turps what cups are going okay we're gonna use the red cups oh one of the homies like bro why are you using all them other cups like a lot of this [ __ ] i had to pay for so i'm about to run through all this recycled [ __ ] because there's a [ __ ] ton of [ __ ] plants and all the [ __ ] need to go out this weekend so it's gonna be fun yeah a lot of the nurseries are starting to get they start okay so what happens is there's a lot of nurseries like subcontract like dudes like us like chicks whoever they're part of the game and who love doing this [ __ ] and they buy hell of them from us take it to their spot like re-transplant them into like maybe like one gallons or some [ __ ] let them be stuff you know what i'm saying and then they sell the [ __ ] out because they gonna get hit with waves of [ __ ] demands of [ __ ] one clones and you know me bubba i'm just gonna stay right there and we're gonna we're just gonna be right there and we're gonna enjoy that [ __ ] i'm gonna get all that part of that bag i don't give a [ __ ] that's just that you didn't know that's how the game go you thought all the nurseries [ __ ] like did all the clowns what you thought all the dispensaries grew all their weed too huh no bro that's why you gotta have your [ __ ] if you ain't got your [ __ ] uh corporate little get down you can't participate that's why i keep telling you [ __ ] like bruh get your [ __ ] bruh get your [ __ ] bro and i know you get [ __ ] tired of hearing me [ __ ] say it but that's real bruh get your [ __ ] so i'm down to try and experiment with y'all so i got this [ __ ] trap bag of uh roots organic 707 mix that came from scam mountain 2.0 and i've been using that as a base you guys want to use uh this uh just uh just coco core from black gold use that as a base then put the [ __ ] uh miracle grow on top see what it does i think i'm gonna go crazy um i'm really i don't know i'm trying to stay away from a lot of soils that carry a lot of perlite i don't want to do that anymore i'm not really quite sure why i was [ __ ] with the pearlite so i really want to let that pearl light go and if i have to come back to it i will homie's like do it well let's see i mean like let's see what it does because you would think now this is how i be working on my hunches and hypothetically well maybe you know you be smoking the weeds you just be like well you know when you're born the hospital doors are the only set of doors that you're ever going to walk out of you're never going to walk back into those same doors i was like you know my [ __ ] you absolutely right about that because [ __ ] when you're born and you leave that room like when you come out you'll never go back there no more that's the door you ain't never going back in same thing when you're born when you come out the [ __ ] [ __ ] you ain't never going back in so no matter what bruh this is like we going that way we're going into the future man you know what you know they could be smoking a weed you don't know [ __ ] stop [ __ ] around [ __ ] you ain't gonna talk about the uh you had them pondering ass moments and [ __ ] and if it didn't make sense you're not high enough i don't know tell you smoke more weak take another hit let it feel your [ __ ] chest don't [ __ ] cough and puke from everybody let's say we say natty try miracle go shake and feed to make your other soil what what what'd you say what did you say the shake and feed we got the shaking feed was i supposed to get the shaking feed that's for the for the for they got one for the shrubs and the palms too i'm just saying i got i'm there witching with you i'm with you there dog i'm with you there ten dolla ten dollar hydro store you come here at ten dollar you get good mushu mushudai pan ten dollar first one said oh you're being racist by [ __ ] look i got more asian tattoos on me than most [ __ ] asians combined all right let's stop playing with me boy so where the [ __ ] was like before we got all crazy we we're talking about some shenanigans whatever we'll come back dude we'll come back to me i'm gonna try to stay back focus that's what i was doing oh we so hypothetically if i use a base of coco core and the rooting plug is soaked in this the quick start planting and transplant starting solution give gives transplants the nutrients they need to thrive stimulates root growth for faster blooms and you just need to mix with water the mpk on this [ __ ] is ready to go 4 12 4. half a cow per gallon can't beat that so if i'm putting the clone in it's just popping the [ __ ] roots right the little solutions to make the little roots pop and do whatever the [ __ ] they gonna do right and the roots is gonna go down so as soon as the roots go down it should hit the little cocoa core and go [ __ ] ape [ __ ] and then while it's getting ape [ __ ] like hey man what's there to eat around here it should just get sprinkled and showered with the [ __ ] like grow more soil feed right i mean that's what i sound like to me i could be wrong but we don't [ __ ] know until i try it what you gonna do all right i got my bag all right here we go let's try this now what i tried to do this foot all i don't know bro we gonna find out i'll just start off doing one tray then i'll start rotating the trays rotating the trays so you guys remember i had that job at the uh winery right working in that [ __ ] they were like not want to get your boy uh a job in a in the cellar and i said there's two jobs i'll take in a [ __ ] winery a job and a cellar or a job as a quality control technician you know them [ __ ] called me and asked me if i want to do an interview for a quality control technician at the same [ __ ] winery i was doing that i was like well i ain't gonna say no to that [ __ ] walk around all day look at [ __ ] and keep it chill get a check [ __ ] i'm doing it will i be tired yeah but if you gonna do it for the babies [ __ ] you better just just keep your flash full of coffee power nap on the go so don't be surprised if you see a [ __ ] rocking four greenhouses and two outdoors while working a [ __ ] uh four ten hour shifts with three days off hey hey hey and you probably asked me like well why would you want to do that just because you can't if you ask for opportunity in the game you got to be ready for that game when it's time to play you're going to sandwich the mc between what the coco no no no i'm gonna i'm gonna base rock that [ __ ] right i'ma basic with the coco i'm gonna hit it with the cocoa to about like maybe like half right then i'm gonna put my little [ __ ] little dick [ __ ] on top of it then i'm gonna put the miracle grow soil on top top got me so i'm gonna set i'm gonna go coco core at the bottom where the roots can go [ __ ] crazy i'm gonna feed into the uh the oasis cube that has the the cutting in it with the roots growing in it so that solution should make sure and this is what i learned okay so i also learned that when you're doing your transplant with these clones and you'll be [ __ ] with this miracle grow like soak your [ __ ] cube dude like why don't the [ __ ] versus water [ __ ] don't just pop your cube in here pop some miracle gross trail on top of you're gonna suck all the water out your cube which is gonna [ __ ] your plant up that's when i walked in like my [ __ ] what the [ __ ] is this soil too hot and i started like looking at it i was like oh [ __ ] you thirsty so i got the pump pumped that [ __ ] up hella hard sort of like splash you know like spray water through that [ __ ] to the soil real tough instead of like sitting on the top and roll it aside and i was like yeah so now i'm gonna put a solution to it then i was like hey wait [ __ ] that bottle say it's a starter solution so why don't you dip that [ __ ] i was like i remember them [ __ ] white boys with that one [ __ ] commercial grow like they would dip it in the [ __ ] that i was doing and they would dip it in some type of rooting solution i wonder if that [ __ ] was [ __ ] miracle girl cause some of that [ __ ] they just they just never let me see they just never let me see and that was cool one of the homies was like bro let me get some plants i was like you gotta get back to me dawg you gotta get back to me bro you gotta get back to me you a member you know what i'm saying you subscribe you got the bell notification on you know like some [ __ ] no bro i ain't [ __ ] with no aloe i ain't [ __ ] with none of that [ __ ] nope [Laughter] it's all about max results [ __ ] cheap input [ __ ] you these kids are only getting bigger they're only gonna want more then i gotta be there to give it to them so let me just you know i'm just gonna keep on filling up the cup halfway yeah but once i soak those [ __ ] and let the [ __ ] go i was like oh they look let me shut up how about how about i just show you that's what that [ __ ] look like what's that like day two day two from a transplant royal sour number three uh sativa dom traits they look like they got any problem any issues so that's with using cocoa box putting a little clone plug in it and then top dressing it with the miracle grill and like i said i'm kind of over the whole perlite hustling situation here go to copart this is where this is where i think you kind of miss it that's where you kind of miss it they get hella cold in here dude they get [ __ ] freezing cold up in here like like cold cold like blowing frost out your [ __ ] mouth cold bro and the plants are still going crazy before i started feeding them all this crazy zany [ __ ] from miracle girl they wasn't doing all that i was feeding it to kelp you like the like the powder kelp they look like a [ __ ] squid or a [ __ ] octopus like [ __ ] [ __ ] in your goddamn water right so i just thought i was like well i just got a muscle on through it i just got a muscle on through it plants would be okay domi was like nah bro do it like this i got on that [ __ ] my [ __ ] why would i come off why why would i come off that hustle there's no reason to this [ __ ] going crazy and the reason why i didn't buy the cocoa core bricks is because [ __ ] gotta wet that [ __ ] up not into all that i feel that do you even know your cannabis process my frill you know your sop system of procedures like do you know your rundown i'm kind of serious right now i'm kind of looking at you like yeah my [ __ ] talking about some real [ __ ] right now because when it comes down to your system of procedures of how you operate your situation like you have to really take in consideration if you're serious about vertical and horizontal growth of your hustle in your trap you have to start counting like touches and steps and how long it takes you to do [ __ ] and why it takes you that long to do that [ __ ] so you can figure out how to refine it and go faster and get a better return on your investment so the reason why i'm okay right now just as of right now because if i find out that [ __ ] uh miracle girl got some type of like i guess like like a seed starting soil like some [ __ ] that i know i could just go that seed starting soil to where i don't have to put like the cocoa core at the bottom put a cube and then put you know what i'm saying like the miracle grows soil on it i'm gonna i can move that step but the reason why i'm doing that extra step right now is i feel that the long-term effect of that extra touch that extra little you know extra [ __ ] to do that you have to multiply over and over and over and over again [ __ ] yeah yeah [ __ ] do 5 000 [ __ ] plants and how and tell me how many times you touch that one [ __ ] plant the one plant i'm at the one plant out of that five thousand times out of them five thousand plants you gotta do how many times did you touch that one plant you tested twice [ __ ] that's ten thousand touches touch it four times hey you see where you see where it go so that's where i get so so like did you see me like how far i can move because if i gotta do this too much you know what i'm saying that catch up to you but if you just in this [ __ ] you'll be like oh i just want some tops and i just want some flavor and i want some more one-on-one well check this out yeah we want turks we want flavors we want all that [ __ ] too but see we want that by the 275 gallon tote [ __ ] we want the same thing we just look at [ __ ] on high volume because you can't compete on a high volume consistent repetitive operation how you gonna how are you going to obtain stability in the market [ __ ] how you gonna stay on the block [ __ ] if you ain't always got the bag i know sometimes i go like hella square over here and you go over here what'd you say the miracle grow green bag is for ceilings so now i need to figure out okay so i got to get somebody eventually send me the link to that [ __ ] and i'll now i'll see what it is and what i'm gonna try to do is i'm gonna try to get some homies to come together and we'll order all this [ __ ] from like walmart and get it sent to the walmart that's close by over here and we'll pick it up he said i can't do it that gear hard all right where was i i was filling up cups [ __ ] i was looking at the blunt like i think i gotta roll another blunt i'm like where do we that's over there where the pounds at over there knocking you matt cause now in my head i already have the layout of all the garden situations because all we're going to do is take a whole bunch of bags now first we're going to take a string line and we're going to run that string line all the way down the interior part of the [ __ ] garden and we're going to lay down a bag then we're gonna lay down another bag like you know we're gonna lay down the bag bag make a long row then we're gonna come over like it's another bag right here but then start a whole nother row of bags and use that one extra bag as spacemen i really don't want to have to go into the gardens because i noticed that the mexicans really didn't [ __ ] around in them gardens i just want to go in there and get everything plant was it dirt irrigation plant trellis netting trellis netting leave that [ __ ] alone pull plastic if you got to pull plastic if not the irrigation line should be able to do that if you need to just like crawl around and check your lines and [ __ ] like that that's cool but if i think you'd have to nope this is gonna be too much this might get too [ __ ] easy this might i don't know i don't know cuz you gotta remember we're using miracle-gro soils we're using miracle-gro nutrients that's just feeding the roots of the plants we haven't even talked about like god damn it i gotta get that hey nobody send me that on the [ __ ] either like email or on like the ig i can't touch none of that [ __ ] right now give me until about friday we should be able to test [ __ ] like that that's if i can get into all my accounts and [ __ ] you know when you get the new computers you got a whole bunch of [ __ ] you can do all you got to do because we can go buy a half a [ __ ] pilot of the seedling [ __ ] for all the clones take all that [ __ ] from the clones pop those [ __ ] into the [ __ ] soil that's got the uh miracle grow that grows what grows plants twice as big hit that [ __ ] with the [ __ ] uh they new line and we should be good and i think we might be able to bring the cost of each plant to 20 i'm trying to budget oh you didn't think there's a [ __ ] method to my madness oh thank you thank you so much i appreciate that i see y'all in there thank you so much i'm about to look that [ __ ] up so if i know that it cost me 20 to plant the plant take care of the plant all the food and [ __ ] for the plant and spraying for the plant i don't know that the overhead is just 20 bucks for that plant then it goes into i saw that thank you um if i base each plant's cost is 20 and that twenty dollars includes two cubic feet of soil for that plant to grow in a safe and secure location that bugs ain't gonna get up into her molds because they gotta eat through the plastic um and it's not really gonna be that long in the first [ __ ] place whatever i harvest and i yield off of that plant so if i can make more than 20 off of that [ __ ] plant when i harvest it i know i paid for the input the bag and the cost y'all got me you feel me versus like oh i just spent 19 thousand dollars and 18 cents to do my gardening season i'm like no no no no sell for each plant to be put in a bag of soil and to be fed for its duration of its existence including uh spraying avid and eagle 20 all that silly [ __ ] it's gonna cost me 20 now out of a two foot two cubic foot bag of soil feeding all the miracle grow [ __ ] with the 20 investment what will be my return off of that you with me and would i lose anybody because if you can look at a bag of soil and be like okay i could take that bag and this and put a plant in it to cost me 20 bucks to run that [ __ ] from front to back if i get a half pound off that [ __ ] and it only cost me [ __ ] 20 to run i think i'm winning uh-oh uh oh i feel it uh oh uh oh doom dude i feel hit him with the light skin yeah i'm sorry i'm okay i'm just saying how long will the plant be in the cup you doing now um well one the cup would tell me when that i mean the planet the plant the plan to jump out okay in my world and the way i'm thinking i'm gonna do this [ __ ] and these [ __ ] gonna go crazy and they're gonna be like [ __ ] let me out we gotta go and i wanna be like no no no no no let me cut clones off of you so if i pull this off right so if i do like let's say say let's say this week i did a thousand clones right when i'm feeding them all this miracle girl [ __ ] them [ __ ] plants should be going apeshit bonkers right and i got a time deadline for particular plants that's going to take a couple of days so i want to be able to come through and cut clones off of those cups therefore re how can i say this is it a double up or triple up i don't know because you cause you getting you're getting clones off the moms and the clones off the mom's going to the cups you're still getting more clones off the moms but the clones and the cups are growing and if you get them [ __ ] to grow fast enough you can swipe some of the [ __ ] off the top and that [ __ ] will give you some more [ __ ] clones so if you did a thousand clones you get a [ __ ] about like a week to like a week and a half you can run back and go cut another thousand clones while getting another thousand clones off they mom you with me so this is how because when you start hustling in this game you gotta learn how to like offset your books you know what i'm saying you gotta be able to like offset your books so that's why i'd be telling you casamayor you got to kind of pay attention so if i know there's a chance for a triple up if i just pay attention i can hit that [ __ ] again and all i got to do is like let's say get my little cup put some of this cocoa core at the bottom put this little [ __ ] plant on top after that and dipped it in that starting solution put some [ __ ] miracle grilled soil on top should go crazy should go ham steak all the way across the board and then when they it's because you know it's going to shoot shoom right because you don't want to get that new [ __ ] it's supposed to allegedly when you give it all this [ __ ] it's gonna jump shoot as soon as you go shoom that's when you be with your your sister like yeah i got you gotcha gotcha yaya gotcha and you put that [ __ ] back down then when the [ __ ] say oh man you cut clones off of it already you say of course you wanna don't you wanna plant with multiple heads on it do you wanna clone when you buy a clone do you want it to have one stock or two or three or four how you want it you want that one two you know [ __ ] we know you want more you want more than one so if i keep hustling the right i'm just going to entice my buyer in a long time but you got to smoke a lot of weed and be willing to get outside your comfort zone like you got to be able to will to like smoke the weed though bro you got to be able to get high you got to be able to get you got to get outside your comfort zone now hey we can't really we really can't put these plants out to like march first in a lot of locations right hey if you want to impress me like bro i need i don't know give me all the [ __ ] that we could use for weed on miracle girl because if i do this right i'm gonna open up a [ __ ] miracle girl account we finna go crazy i know mama was going hard at last time i heard she was after like maybe like she was up 50 or 60 or some [ __ ] she was going ham surprised you awake right now no don't apply flamingo jones discount like [ __ ] we'll get it to you like i'm on some other [ __ ] like i might be able to like i don't know we'll talk about that later a little bit trying to branch us out into some [ __ ] but at the same time we're like how easy is that like we get the miracle girl seed mix put the [ __ ] clone with the miracle grow sauce on it the [ __ ] should go [ __ ] ape [ __ ] go ham take a [ __ ] bag of uh miracle grow uh and see i haven't decided yet i haven't decided i want to put them all in one gallon pots then transplant them or do i want to [ __ ] like i don't know i got it i got i got i got to figure some [ __ ] out i got to figure some [ __ ] out i got to figure out like what size teens i want um the homie was like bro you need to hurry up and get them into plants where you just want to [ __ ] bloom and i'm just like oh i don't know bro i don't know i need to go through this process i need to go through this process over here now i'm having fun in the veg we ain't even gotten a bloom but if we do this [ __ ] right it should cost me 20 per bag i should be able to get a half pound to a pound per bag for 20. a half pound of [ __ ] weed to a pound for twenty dollars per bag twenty dollars whole feeding schedule [ __ ] twenty dollars including the dirt [ __ ] twenty dollars yeah [ __ ] we all speechless right now we all speak because when you it's one thing to be thinking in your head oh that sounds like some good [ __ ] but when you when you say it out loud you just like wait a minute bro we ain't even did a greenhouse yet my [ __ ] did you just did you just tell us [ __ ] for 20 bucks you could get like [ __ ] it a quarter pound to a half pound for like 20 bucks bruh you win it you win it that's a win but wait it gets better hey will you see what type of [ __ ] you could be flipping out there in the bermuda take that bag special twenty dollars a [ __ ] bag flip that [ __ ] like got it so here's the we're talking double up triple up all that other [ __ ] i want to bring you to the triple up so in each greenhouse you're gonna take like a bag of soil put that [ __ ] down right put your plant in it put your irrigation on that [ __ ] like trellis that [ __ ] trust that [ __ ] you're good to go leave it alone but when you harvest hey good looking good looking he's like 20 bucks for a plant you silly as [ __ ] my [ __ ] you look funny you crazy as [ __ ] that's a lot you silly as [ __ ] so what happened when we harvest in march april when we harvest in may there's a bag of soil right what are we going to do for may june and july as soon as we harvest we're going to take another bag of soil cut an x at the bottom part of that bag of soil sit it on top on the pre-existing bag of soil and repeat the process giving the plants a whole lot of room to grow a whole lot of room to go i'm just saying bro i'm just saying you're giving that [ __ ] twice the space and there's absolutely no waste you are maximizing now twice the space with no [ __ ] waste like the only way should be like you're [ __ ] like trellis netting that's about it why are you using micros what the [ __ ] the micros gonna do how we gonna use micros we want this [ __ ] that we using off this [ __ ] miracle girl that [ __ ] is chelated that [ __ ] got immediate uptake hey cause you know normally my folks like go i gotta dump out the soil or i gotta do this nah nah nah lay the bag of soil down use that [ __ ] harvest it get the same [ __ ] bag of soil sit that bag of soil right on top of it now you got two of them then put your plant on top of it repeat the process so when you get to the third time because now y'all don't think i think you're missing it i do not think that they already eddie i do not think that they are already at the eddie i think that they do not they do not understand i think that they need to get more smoke in their lungs i think they need to grab the chalice and inhale with all of their might so they can open up their third eye so they cannot only see that you can get it there one time or the two times but you can get it that three times with the maximizing of the situation in all of the goods on eddie do you understand that we're going to do march april may that is the bag may june and july that is another bag june july and august july august and september or august and september october is only another bag so you only have three [ __ ] bags so that is a total of sixty dollars by the time that you are done for your last plan for it to give you their full song give it that full son eddie it has about six six cubic feet of soil to grow through eddie he gives it the room to give it the deepness and the wideness eddy what is the problem that you do not understand do you not understand i need to make sure that you overstand the situation because it takes the 20 and you get anywhere from a quarter pound to all the way to a pound when you do your june july and august eddie you can [ __ ] around and get a half pound to a pound you can get your last part of your season and get anywhere from three quarters of a pound to a pound and a half pour 20 bag eddie do you understand do you understand that you need to stop sucking on the white man's dick and licking his tank and get your [ __ ] face into your own world his world does not revolve around you the things that you need to do in your life are all about you so you need to start figuring out how to not get the hustle you need to not just get the double hustle you must get into a triple hustle so you should be able to do your just one greenhouse eddie this is just one this is just one [ __ ] this is only one [ __ ] for 20 dollars eddie you [ __ ] this is only one greenhouse you done [ __ ] we have multiple greenhouse eddie make it very easy for everybody to participate for the 20 you can support a real trap [ __ ] in the hood all right man i'll stop bruh i'll stop i'll quit i'll leave it alone i'll leave alone i know the way i know the way in the snow eddie i know the way in the rain in the mud i do not do like you and use the apple maps eddie i am not the man like you have uses that google apps maddy i am the one who uses the waze because the ways knows the way you do not know the way your girl is not a professional member of a bob's leading team eddie until she is a professional member of the gold olympics bobsledding team of going face down not sled you are not knowing the way we doing way too much welcome to the hustle welcome to the trap um if anybody need me to break that down in english you know what i'm saying like [ __ ] you missed that because it was like either he was laughing or whatever the [ __ ] all the greenhouses get bags the investment for each plant is 20 bucks once you harvest you repeat the process slap another bag for 20 bucks so your first hustle when you go through you should get like the early spring run like quarter pound half pound if you're [ __ ] good you know what i'm saying like then you really setting your soil up for your like yo your june little [ __ ] uh uh light depot so you should get anywhere from like a half pound to a pound if not uh you know i try to like i try to low ball it all because a lot of my [ __ ] like oh bro you should be getting i'm gonna be like okay but [ __ ] you not paying 20 a plant from start to finish until you can tell me how much you actually paying per plant start to finish the [ __ ] out of here because you don't know what your roi is if you don't know what your roi is you're not over here doing it for the [ __ ] babies they gonna learn today they're gonna learn today they're gonna learn today i'm just gonna i'm just telling you bro if we stay like i mean [ __ ] i was about to go start a [ __ ] fishy motion company i was like oh i know where to get all the fish guts at them [ __ ] to get us to me by the totes i was like hold on hold on hold on just do it with the miracle girl right you see me [ __ ] with the sauce anyway still [ __ ] with the salts is more refined 26 00 15 30 that's gangster hey j ganeck in the building i was over here uh trying to share with everybody how much it's gonna cost us to run each plant from start to back including soil um at twenty dollars a piece because you gotta also look at when you start using this uh this all-purpose this [ __ ] say you only got a water you only gotta use it every seven to fourteen days and you really only gonna what the homies say he said you can do a a live ppm of the soil and the nutrients so you know what the plant is getting oh you thought i was feeling uh see i thought i was hella crazy no no no no no i don't go out there without a sherpa i got a canadian name morticus who [ __ ] walk me through that can you imagine how big colorful and frosty we're gonna be able to get this weed to go then we gonna hit that [ __ ] with that gatorade oh might even hit it with some powdery milk i don't know damn [ __ ] gonna be spraying that [ __ ] with trichatinal because now if we know that it only cost us 20 dollars a bag you know what i'm saying to run the plant if you want to trick it off on some good [ __ ] like some plant hormones or some [ __ ] like that now you got room to wiggle you got room to wiggle got me all excited and [ __ ] i'm [ __ ] still guys we still got to work but it still got to work i got about a hundred or so plans to do uh we are smoking on san fernando valley og is the cannabis that we're consuming right now this was grown on og hill this is done with the super soil and all the organic compost teas and all that hippie hippie unani [ __ ] that [ __ ] said purple cooler but can we do it with the flavor egg can we do with any of that [ __ ] what'd you say dog [ __ ] them bags of frogs some [ __ ] uh frog forest [ __ ] just whatever is happy bro just do whatever you got to do there go coach coach mordeca is in the building that [ __ ] said ionic copper boost the yield well this one got a water-soluble copper raw and then uh hey mordecai's to tell you as soon as he told me about the [ __ ] bloom booster i immediately went over to amazon and ordered it immediately that shouldn't be here like by the seventh i don't need that [ __ ] no time soon what i need to do is keep working you better work there was one point where i wanted to just go with all the cocoa core but i would rather spend so watch this i can teach you how to break your plant all the way down so your soil is gonna cost you seven dollars per cubic foot now that per cubic foot is already going to come riched and ready to go so if you had to like let's say abits you want to hey hey you see these [ __ ] plants right you see that right here so what if i had to buy all my plants this season you know what i'm saying like i had to go to a nursery or some [ __ ] and had to go buy all my plants hey cronic what's up partner i'd be [ __ ] sick fool i'd be crushed i'd be crushed cause now i'd have to eat the cost of the [ __ ] plant but since i got the clones and i'm doing what i'm supposed to be doing when i'm supposed to be doing them it allows me to not have to worry about that cost so my bag of my plant bag is only going to cost me 20 bucks versus 30 because i had to spend 10 on a plant what's bloom booster i don't know i don't know i ordered it though and i can't really look at it right now cause i'm on i'm on my phone and i ain't at the computer oh back up hey what up bing what it do dog what to do dog what to do dawg i'm still trying to get my hands on a whole bunch of [ __ ] pink strains so if you got any [ __ ] pink strings in your [ __ ] pocket let me know [ __ ] hey what y'all think about using a whole bunch of uh all right so we were debating earlier on whether or not to get some runt seeds that were rags so we can use that runs mail to cross a whole bunch of other [ __ ] you guys think that would be a good investment man i uh [ __ ] that i don't care so what if the cup kind of crack don't [ __ ] look i'm still gonna use it this [ __ ] got a hole in the side i'm still using the [ __ ] this i'm doing it so if i didn't have to pay anything for these cups i only had to pay for some soil didn't have to pay for the clones only had to pay for the medium and the cutting in the [ __ ] labor like we went in bro and that's how you keep your roi oh oh oh oh oh big bro got [ __ ] uh forbidden fruit he said we can get a cut of it oh and what's this [ __ ] these [ __ ] see okay i'm almost debating to get into a pissing contest literally it's a pissing contest going on right now these [ __ ] just trying to take some cat piss and calling that cup that [ __ ] up i can't use that one i might slap another one on it no you take so what you do is when you get a [ __ ] up cup take another [ __ ] up cut and just make sure that the cracks down the line then you can still use it uh i think i'm gonna get into some [ __ ] and call it liger piss or tiger piss which i mean if [ __ ] don't get a pissing contest but the homies was really sitting there talking about this [ __ ] run [ __ ] for real for real and i was like well you got every [ __ ] type of wrench you got like but the rents that we have is a female so if you really want to cross some [ __ ] with like you know a wrench cross with this like you're gonna have you you're gonna have to get a red c because if you only got female seeds then you're gonna [ __ ] around and have to do that spray [ __ ] and i don't know if that's what we want to get into right now yes you could yes actually and if you want to send me some [ __ ] seeds get you a big pin pop that [ __ ] out take out that little cartridge a little ink cartridge and then you can stick the little seeds up in there if you need to i've had homies take [ __ ] seeds and cut straws put that [ __ ] inside the straws and open up a [ __ ] bunny rabbit [ __ ] and put the seeds inside the bunny rabbit then stitched it back uh you can send that to uh jones aka maddie mcbarbar aka flamingo jones [ __ ] p.o box one two three upper lake california yes you can p.o box one two three upper leg california yes you can don't be shy with the grind you can always hit me up on the email at go big international gmail.com and i can always send you this [ __ ] whatever whatever is clever pimping give my [ __ ] scented [ __ ] in seed vials [ __ ] little calves [ __ ] cinnamon [ __

don't i don't i don't want to get caught in that one my job is to make sure that i know how much it costs per plant per cost um what you're getting what you got in the house is getting with it why you got it like this and all that [ __ ] boy i came up on a whole bunch of trays today cause i know i'm gonna need them and we were sitting over here like oh what lights we gonna get oh what lights we

autoflowers we all got to be ready for the autoflower cause i don't know nothing about no autoflowers don't know [ __ ] i know we gonna be ready to go though i mean events are we gonna get to some other [ __ ] work around here but for some strange reason i'm really good at rolling blunts but i ain't really good at working right now first and foremost man let me take time out to thank everybody for hanging out with me we now normally hit like you know what i'm saying like on a reg when we do on these [ __ ] like 100 people so i really want to thank everybody for all their support and all the participation and being a part of this [ __ ] cause i remember when [ __ ] we was nobody and i was like [ __ ] i used to be hella nervous to do a [ __ ] podcast and i seen my [ __ ] toy soldier doing that [ __ ] i was like okay i could do that i could do that i'ma figure out the wheel i don't know if i should keep on smoking but we gon i'm gonna keep trying can't give up you can't give up just keep smoking bro that should smell like straight gas that's just my fuego yeah what is this this is all maui lg so this all bread is cisco brussels there'll be a whole bunch of og a whole bunch of stinking so you know how we [ __ ] with the smog right how was all big and [ __ ] this the uh this is without the sour diesel so this should be really really crazy allegedly hypothetically but we won't know until we see what's up and some of the homies like oh i don't know nothing about that i was like bro this one might not be for you any [ __ ] way just cause you see me [ __ ] clown it don't mean you're gonna get it ab gooey i was like you know you said i'm gonna say something [ __ ] crazy not a pocky i don't know what i do know is bro these [ __ ] i have to come up with 50 [ __ ] plants that we're gonna run on the outdoor that need to be full sun so i want to figure that out like what the [ __ ] i'm gonna run for full sun full sun outdoor however big we will make the hole holes are already there i just think we should just build on to it that's funny you said that uh uh first and foremost i don't even know what that strain is uh second of all i was also thinking about dirty squirt i want to do like some high yielding big picture [ __ ] plans but then again i don't want to [ __ ] off the bag you know what i'm saying like when i say i don't want to [ __ ] off the bag like i don't want to like you know these [ __ ] gonna always buy a bag of runts you know what i'm saying like so i don't know i have no idea but i know that dirty squirt is [ __ ] gushy he's in the darn megan that's supposed to be a big ass frosty plant i don't want no early i want a very selected very very targeted strain for a particular mission of full sun outdoor i don't give a [ __ ] if it's like uh as long as it ain't no [ __ ] long ass flowering one you know you still gotta keep it within and get it with the strains we got bro we got [ __ ] lord jesus [ __ ] strange you [ __ ] out here talking sideways and [ __ ] like how about like zeddles the glove the gary payton [ __ ] um tropical runs you know what i'm saying like crazy run it's like god damn y'all [ __ ] was awesome like way sideways [ __ ] i mean i feel a dirty squirt but like god damn i'm just saying bro i'm just saying let me roll the blunt and we'll okay i'll be getting sidetracked first let me do it let me at least let me do like a couple of these [ __ ] plants real quick so i can say that i did something we'll go over here and look at these strains like what about peanut butter breath hey i'm i really want to do a [ __ ] uh uh sour a royal sour cross with a run so call that [ __ ] royal runts and use that rolls royce [ __ ] logo tell me that wouldn't be nice unicorn breath hey alien piss alien crashes y'all crazy as [ __ ] that vortex back there but there ain't no way in the [ __ ] world [ __ ] sub cool even though you get hella [ __ ] free uh hold on let me think about that i wonder how mad [ __ ] would get if i ran a whole bunch of [ __ ] vortex outside and did it as a tribute to [ __ ] sub cool i wonder how many [ __ ] would be mad at me for that one make a little t-shirt look would you buy some royal runts oh of course you would look [ __ ] is like oh yeah i'm on that one now you said some royal runs some royal sour cross with some runts yeah bro that's that's purple on the outside purple on the inside vvs diamond uh whatever runs is is fruity fruity but i know that [ __ ] other [ __ ] gonna be gas gas boom royal miz i need to smoke another royal blunt or lighter app all so nine hours later [ __ ] we bout to [ __ ] transplant some plants cause all mr and mrs [ __ ] tiddlywinks out there can't figure out out of all the goddamn me strains we got we get 50 [ __ ] big ass ginormous out okay little [ __ ] huh four greenhouses all greenhouses are mono cropped per [ __ ] get down like there's no other hand [ __ ] chicken have a [ __ ] biscuit like no this [ __ ] all chicken this [ __ ] all biscuit this outdoor need to be all ham there will be other spots that we can nick and cranny right i'm saying if i get some [ __ ] around with me we can do some other [ __ ] too but i'm trying to include y'all on all the strains that you see now we got up in this [ __ ] from the gelato 33 the runts the ziddles the gorilla ziddles like all that [ __ ] bro [ __ ] crazy runs tropical runs there's all type of [ __ ] back there we eventually have to pick 50. i have to get 50 plants for that project i would like to get everybody on the team who are members and [ __ ] to like actually like yeah [ __ ] let's do this so come on rawr like oh oh oh you know i got everybody focused up a little bit because once we make that decision right i can pull them 50. i can get ready when those 50 like i already know like okay like uh i'm gonna fight you [ __ ] i'm gonna fight y'all you're supposed to be transplanting plants [ __ ] i'ma fight you oh yeah i'ma fight you too [ __ ] i'm gonna fight you with my army on my back so by the time these plants get to where they need to be right it'll be the season so in a lot of these like this ziddles is a girl you know what i'm saying like what else is back here peach oh g is a girl dirty squirt's got to be sexed um what is this [ __ ] peanut butter breath dirty squirt more peanut butter breath 24k yeah we got 24k moby dick you have to go to moby the [ __ ] is this san fernando valley og so basically that's gonna be a big ass strawberry og so basically we got this is gonna be a strawberry og and then over here somewhere we got peacho choji gorillazoodles zoomy [ __ ] acapulco gold [ __ ] crosswit whatever the [ __ ] we got blue glue [ __ ] blue glue green crack uh blue crab cake baby purple voodoo bubble coast sucker free og might be able to get a watermelon rancher definitely go with this here go to real straight [ __ ] og kush from diana farms so you got og kush a strawberry og kush and a [ __ ] peach o.g kush plus a gorilla zittles in the back what you do who is you who's you i've seen you back here peeking at me like what's up don't try to hide from me who are you another gorilla ziddles the gorilla zito's got to be boy or girl though then we got some of this [ __ ] uh cracker jack by toy soldier tropicana banana great white shark the homie sent this some odin then you got that uh rude boy og back there moonshine uh ghost haze cherry vanilla cookie oh let's not [ __ ] forget the goddamn uh rhino berry in the cherry cookie wreck back there then over here you got the [ __ ] runts the gelato 33 and the supremes and that's the rude boy og back there i'm just saying i got a [ __ ] one of these is a tray of sanford that's the tray of san fernando valley right there so i got the cuts that ain't no problem we just gotta figure the [ __ ] out what we gonna use as a boy you know not right now right now but i have to figure it out so i can get everybody situated so we get like these big ass plants so i'm like okay so this 50 we need to pay more attention because this one's for that one it's not hard to grow [ __ ] bro it's not hard to grow nothing this is gonna be the easiest grow we've ever done in our [ __ ] life so we'll just take the rude boy and cross that [ __ ] with some [ __ ] you take the rude boy psycho no we are psycho brought to you by real [ __ ] in the trap what it do dre what it do i'm supposed to be working but i've been doing a whole bunch of talking all right i gotta i got i gotta bust in i gotta bust in so this is mauio g maui yoji uh maui wow we crossed with og kush maui wow we crossed with og kush just sayin tryin to pull this up bro there we go oh we got that og bro we got that og got that all day so how am i gonna do this i'm gonna go dippy dippy soak and go all right we're gonna break it down into fours we'll drop over the tray break this [ __ ] down again dip it and go dip and go bro so anybody keeping counts of how many times i've touched this [ __ ] exactly exactly exactly bro so if you're gonna compete in the game right i wanna i want you to be able to compete but you gotta be able to do it in numbers and the only way you're gonna get good at numbers is by repetition practice and going through the [ __ ] process no it's never too many you know what i'm saying it's never too many you just got to be able to explain them like why you got them it's not that it's like good bad or indifference you just want to know why are you touching it so many times and can you do it faster because the mexicans whooping [ __ ] asses out here in the cannabis industry and if you're gonna compete with them you got to be able to get it in and go that's why [ __ ] love me i give a mexican a run for his money out there in the [ __ ] gardens let it drip and that's what we just the fun part just highly easy so before it goes into the soil it's getting uh avid eagle 20 is getting a rooting solution it's getting a soft little [ __ ] little medium to jump in through the just core which is 100 coco core is getting a [ __ ] ton of news about to be dropped on his head um when it hits this [ __ ] uh miracle-gro soil so we should be doing good i don't know i don't know bro i just i like i like the process this is the [ __ ] i like doing and when i got [ __ ] everywhere at the end of it and everybody got dirt on them and everybody's cool and been watered and good to go i'm a happy camper i can look at my hustle and be proud of myself is that okay with you guys are those all right good with that now how'd i get this i got that with this see how white those are now this was uh ten dollars you can do uh 3 000 clones allegedly now here let's talk math can you break down 102 cubes for how much that thing is like for six dollars you got 102 cubes and you're spending six dollars how much is it per cube then you gotta factor that cost in with uh a cost of a bag of soil and a bag of soil is basically all right that's gonna be seven twenty it's like 20. so basically 20 in soil so once you get down to it you got to figure out the cost of each [ __ ] clone including how much it costs to dip it whoa whoa whoa whoa don't be looking at me crazy like what the [ __ ] you you're the one that wanted to learn about your roi [ __ ] if you knew how much it cost you to create each one of these [ __ ] clones with roots out of it that would be beneficial to you so if you're spending six dollars for the tray six dollars for the [ __ ] bottom and six dollars for the top so basically i just say 20 bucks it costs you 20 dollars to do 102 [ __ ] clones as long as you get 10 per [ __ ] clones it's looking good yeah bro so then you got to take that 20 and you divide that 20 into each cube and you'd be like oh it cost me this much per cube to get like this crazy bro i know but once you start figuring this out because you'll get some square [ __ ] who want to like really invest with you or [ __ ] with you hey what's up pimpin um and they gonna want to ask you real uncomfortable stuff like well how much does that cost or how much are you making off that or like why are you doing like that you need to be able to uh explain your [ __ ] and if you can't explain your [ __ ] you missing out on an opportunity and if you're missing out on an opportunity it's like a lion out there on the serengeti that [ __ ] buffalo went bob when you went to go grab and jump on that big ass ain't got nothing but air and you're going home looking like a loser and you don't want to be a loser you want to be successful and that's why you want to learn your [ __ ] or you can just keep that doing that same [ __ ] oh why am i talking all these numbers because you can start your own growth facility less than 200 bucks 500 bucks you gotta grow facility you can do some [ __ ] and you know all for each each row you can sit seven trays seven trays got a hundred plus plants in it each tray cost me 20 bucks so that's 140 bucks off that one level then you got [ __ ] four to five levels depending on your lighting situation but you get ten dollars per cube once it goes into the cup so now you're able to look at your numbers and know why you got your numbers the way they do telling you man all that other little weak ass [ __ ] y'all used to do back in the day as far as like random ass growing or just like regular oh i'm about to get the bag this year yeah we gonna get the bag this year but you're gonna look at your bag and understand why your bag is heavier this year why you got more [ __ ] in your bag versus why you had last year like i was trying to explain to the homie i was like no no no no no so that money that you invested in that property last year that y'all [ __ ] took a goose egg again like i'm trying to get you back on that property so what'd you spend you spent like five grand on that [ __ ] and on some other stuff so everybody's like 10 grand in the hole well we'll just strong-arm that same property my [ __ ] you go get your bags of soil and your plants and you do the same [ __ ] that i'm doing over here and you can get back at it and spendy show up [ __ ] either abc and you know where to do what it does and we'll just move it how it is on the chess board and we'll keep back being winners will he do it i don't know i hope so tell the easy all the infrastructure is there everything is there who has the heart to [ __ ] pull through i don't know hey mh that's not my job i don't have to invest in none of that [ __ ] that's somebody else's department that's halfway's job fa [ __ ] with all them genetics and stuff my job is to make sure that when we go to work there's something to work with that's facts bro trapping and grinding grinding and trapping so you will think that this set of roots as soon as it touches down on some straight coco core and has a root growth hormone from [ __ ] uh miracle growth it should go crazy it should go crazy it'd be super duper amazingly green do you know how much [ __ ] money i saved on clones this year like it's insane bro like dudes are looking at me stupid bro why are you cutting clones right now they don't order you i'm like no bro i'm gonna need these we're gonna need these and sure [ __ ] [ __ ] sure as [ __ ] i need them all and they hitters too nothing but strike gas fool we got straight smog royal sour like bro like it's just that shit's gonna go hard on the yard we don't figured out how to like adjust ourselves so we can get the bag and win offset by reusing [ __ ] inputs and elements [ __ ] making our [ __ ] nutrient line hella cheap since the nutria line is hella cheap we don't have to worry about the [ __ ] overhead as much and we can offset our books that's the real girl life right there boy all right all right all right all right let me scoot this out the way put this over here oh i got smoke in my eye that's horrible why does the smoke in the eye have to burn and you'd figure since we smoked so much weed you'd figure that we'd figure out how to like get immune to that [ __ ] some type of way all right now big daddy get to make a mess anybody got any questions y'all want y'all like am i missing something am i doing something that like uh i can't see am i like you know my [ __ ] up cause if i am like let me know i'm always down oh dude like for real so look at your investment if you spend 20 for the cultivation of your [ __ ] plant let's see here so if you did like six plants if you did like six plants at this thing you can do like you can get your cost of twenty dollars a plant get six bags of that miracle gross [ __ ] right buy your little [ __ ] little sauce ball so you look [ __ ] little little all-purpose powder and your little [ __ ] little root i mean whatever the [ __ ] bloom does or bloom shake feed my dick um you can get that can make your cost your plant for 20 and each cost your plant is only 20 if you can get anywhere from like a minimum of a quarter pound that's gonna be like 80 bucks a pound it took you eighty dollars to make one pound of some zaza zaba [ __ ] straight head smashing weed bro look at that mouth look at him ten 20 30. that's going to be 13 so you're going to have like uh a leftover a seven get that with six to seven bags that'll make your bags 20 bucks out of those four bags that'll cost you eighty dollars at a minimum of four bags you should be able to get a pound dude i know i'm super low balling dude i'm super low balling i'm super like i'm super super super low balling oh my [ __ ] crazy bro i want to look at that but you know i can't you [ __ ] up for sending it to me though but i got you now what's gonna really happen is we're gonna put some big ass [ __ ] plants in that situation and i'm gonna average this [ __ ] at a [ __ ] half pound to a pound um on the first go round second go round i'ma look at it to be about three quarters to like a pound and a half then on the last part i expect a minimum of two pounds out of each [ __ ] bag so if i at the max run i should be able to get for that 20 bucks on that investment because you gotta remember first run bag of soil second run another bag on the third run which will be your last outdoor [ __ ] run that plan is gonna have all that [ __ ] to running so i am getting a 60 gallon pot remember that okay first layer is going to be going to be two cubic feet the second run is going to be four cubic feet the third run is going to be six cubic feet each cubic feet is 10 gallons of soil so if you got six cubic feet of soil you got 60 gallons of soil why did i just get hella eggbert and just know that dude i have no idea hey thank you pimp thank you pimp thank you thank you pimp hey hey thank you pimp thank you pip thank you thank you so let me get my little miracle grow bag here start rolling it down no i need a blunt bro don't [ __ ] laugh and do that do you know how big these plants are gonna be like stop stop stop stop stop i need you see we just back up just back up you're looking really really close right now back [ __ ] up so if we're working on these plants right now and we really don't need them until march how big do you think these plants are going to be in march because yeah the ones that like that are going going like anything that stays like all that shit's got to go into three gallon or a five gallon pot or some [ __ ] at least i don't think this is going to be [ __ ] uh big enough for a plant until [ __ ] march i just don't i don't think it is like maybe like the three gallon pots yeah i can see that that man's gonna be a little bit that player's gonna be stupid but it's gonna be fine we're gonna have a field day we're gonna and if i keep doing like how i'm doing every time i put more plants out the plants should get larger what'd you say you would you could add bag soil base in the dirt and transplant i'm not adding [ __ ] you're [ __ ] with my twenty dollars why you [ __ ] with my dub bro i'm trying to get this [ __ ] down i'm trying to get the price down homie i'm trying to get the price down right that's what you want that's what you want right so the nursery is i don't think okay so other than getting some [ __ ] uh miracle grow seed start i don't think i have to do anything else like i just think when i go like this i think that's over with i think that's a [ __ ] wrap i really don't think i'm gonna have to do much because i think there's enough go hard to go home in this soil and in the transplant solution that it's just gonna need water and it's got these little weird-ass little brown balls in the soil they kind of feel like little popcorns or some [ __ ] i don't know don't get me started bro don't get me started i know i got a whole bunch more [ __ ] plans to do so once you were able to like one of the homies was like well what if the weed don't taste good i was like i don't give a [ __ ] what i care about is my roi if i know that it cost me a max 80 to create a pound of greenhouse weed [ __ ] i'm winning we're winning all the way across the board i know it you know it stop playing so if i do it right i could [ __ ] around for that 20 bucks and get a pound to a pound and a half dude that's crazy that's that's that's an insane roi you look at the cost of plastic it's like maybe like 500 bucks you look like once you start looking at the numbers [ __ ] we winning so until you can show me another process i don't know what to tell you i don't know what to say so y'all got any questions comments concerns pippin i'm about to get up off this [ __ ] and knock these [ __ ] plants down so i can get my trait going and bruh it's [ __ ] raining crazy outside oh this one need another cup bam look at all that fluffiness look at all that fluffiness i ain't dropping [ __ ] i'm about to drop this [ __ ] plant in this tray you wanna know why i gotta stay focused bro now if you wanna uh come up with some beats or some [ __ ] then we can go we can talk about it but like right now i got to get on my plant hustle i got to get on my plant grind because there's somebody out there trying to take my spot [ __ ] somebody out there trying to work as hard as me man it's a [ __ ] trying to put in more hours in me man it's [ __ ] out there trying to do more plans to me man that can't happen i can't i can't live i can't let no [ __ ] get past me is it time to rap nope not yet you know what it's time to do it's time to plant so it's your boy boy natty mcbarbar cannabis all-star doing what he do dog i really appreciate all you [ __ ] i'm so thankful um any questions comments concerns let me know you know say hit me up on the p.o box if you're trying to shoot some genetics um i'm trying to get all these drops and [ __ ] together so we can start sexing all these [ __ ] plants so we can start cloning them and we can start getting them to go so without further ado it's an honor privilege a pleasure to [ __ ] with y'all uh hit me up on ig and other than that y'all be safe and stick around stay tuned what we gonna do next really [ __ ] i gotta go do those i gotta start hanging those big ass lights in that little trap spot in the back but before i do that i gotta move and clean out a whole bunch of [ __ ] i can't really do it right now cause [ __ ] like a little babies like storm or some [ __ ] so we'll see stick around stay tuned but i'll be back though you already know that

down and hit record and shoot a quick little stony ramble with you guys so whatever you guys are smoking on and be sure to pack a bowl and smoke along with me again we have sfv OG kush there's some Tahoe wellness company some of their meds and this was an 8th that I got a friend called me regarding another friend's plumbing situation I went over there and Superman backed up kind of clear didn't got him up and running again so they treated me the 40 bucks cash and my choice of some clubhouse med so I got an eighth of some sfv OG kush as you can tell I've been going ham on it I love it I love it to death so who knows I might be able to get some more dank herb here soon but I got a bowl of it crushed up and loaded I should let's show you the nug I just sniffed it I just broke off it so it's not as big but some nice chunky blades nice orange hairs it's very piney has like a lemon scent oh this is pungent if you guys ever smoked it have if you have ever smoked it let me know I think that was in proper english so um real quick in a sense of a verbal update I will get around to posting an actual office update of the girls but I just haven't gotten around to it yet I know I'm terrible sorry I couldn't get a bowl clear but i will post something soon I've been low stress training one of the UK GG lunatic days is currently in low stress I got it pulled back I also have one of the Zeus which is a confirmed female I have her pulled back no signs from the other Zeus yet in a sense of sex there's only a few for the Afghan tangs have showed me the female so I'm kind of waiting to weed out the males from the female so hopefully we'll get there soon depending on their structure will determine how although stressed ran up maybe I'll just let it get kind of big and bushy and I'll pull the actual branches back in these cases I just grabbed the full stem and bent it back the Zeus was getting a little lengthy and the node we're getting lengthy as well so I figured ok that's a perfect time and kind of pull back make a nice even canopy and then with the UK WG growing in like almost a zigzag pattern because it did usually the gross inca kola style this one kind of have the offset growth so I had to pull that one back and it's a very beautiful bonsai tree it's it's perfect it is perfect fingers crossed for a female I haven't smoked all day either I got off work maybe like 30 minutes ago I drove back into town and now i am here take a quick toke and then we're going to actually talk about something real quick in a sense of a new way to process and operate in my growing space I need something bigger and better and I found an easy solution i believe so cheers to you guys what you guys smoking on No oh definitely has like a lemon hazy taste to it Oh gonna let this marinade real quick I think we call that one and done for now ooh already so in a new way to operate and kind of how to run things I'm always telling myself I need more space I have plenty of space in my flower more than enough room to work in especially for the limited amount of equipment that i have so far it's a what is it a five by five space back there so that's more than enough space for me especially when it comes to the girls and flower last time I ran them in seven gallon containers they're nice and bushy this time around I think I'm gonna try and keep my plants on the shorter more dormant hopefully like chunky monkey just buds keep it in that section for size and I'll transplant them into either three or five gallon containers because i would like to clone and then veg in one gallon do all my low stress training and everything to it and then again either switching up depending on their size to either a three or five gallon now with having 18 plants in my limited space for veg I should have moved it over a little bit more but then again I would have a longer grow space and then in a sense for how my lighting would be I feel like it would be less concentrated because I have more space so it's a little bit shorter two lights I feel like that's enough but I don't want this to be my bed anymore I'm thinking about making my flower room the multi-purpose room I do have my high pressure sodium up I will be taking that down I'll probably just be vegging in LED and my 200 watt fluorescent granted i believe i have access to a metal halide i'll have to check into that because I know my girlfriend's uncle he's into neon lighting and he has his own shop and everything and he actually works for a lighting company so he has access to literally the high pressure sodium Zand the whole nine so i think i have like a 200 or 250 watt waiting for me so that's probably that's cool so i'll check up on that but i've been debating just using the 200 watt fluorescent and the LED for that grow space granted i'll keep them closed in the beginning but then eventually they're all spread out naturally getting bigger and then when money and finances allow it i will probably be making the ultimate switch over to Mars hydro I've been watching a Brian a lot I would attempt to your last name but I don't want to butcher it what happened watching his channel like ritually whenever it's on even checking out his past videos but he's talking on it with his LED lighting in Mars hydro he's very in depth and just the all in purpose seedling veg and flower you can control your different your reds and your blues and your whites and it's just I am sold like that that's cool that's hands-on that's in depth and I think that would just be neat especially for the all-purpose now again with veg just veg and flower in that room ultimately working my way up to scrog again let me show you a guess just for a quick little example this is the Zeus I got it tied back so I'm making a cute little bonsai Bush out of it and them this kind of something like that that's get it prepped for scrog and then even with the UK GG again start them young it's and this is just this is beautiful to me and against rock so way I'd like to I'd like to try it and so there's a lot going on a lot in my head and I believe I'm going to implement it just with those two plants alone so I'm gonna make my flower into the ultimate veg space again running with LED light and my 200 watt fluorescent I don't think my setup in here with my t5 my for bulb t5 light my 200 I don't know if that's enough light for that space since I know how to go about determining it but yeah I don't know we'll see if you guys know let me know your opinions in a sense of what lighting out of the equipment I have what would you guys do I'm curious about that let's go ahead and talk i'll be sure to get you guys an update here soon before and then after that whole switch maybe today probably tomorrow i'll get you guys an update so much love thank you guys for watching got a toke alrighty again thank you for watching you guys haven't already go about like common end subscribing I mclovin other than

much like it just smells dank first of all every time like I take it out of the little baggie there's so many like crystals just left in the bag and I just I just love it well I don't love that they're in the bag but I'd love that there's an abundance of trichomes but anyways so Josie is filled up so yeah guys I was thinking about something and imaginary friends seems harmless but they're actually pretty [ __ ] scary if you think about it it's like if you have you seen a little kid playing with an imaginary friend like it's scary it's like interesting they're talking themselves but anyway it's that's not the point point is I want to talk about this imaginary friend I mean it could have been an imaginary friend or I could have just had mild schizophrenia or something as a child my imaginary friend as I recall I'm gonna tell you it from my like five to seven year old point no five to eight year old point of view of how this person went my imaginary friend not only do they scare me but he took the form of that like cross-dressing lobster [ __ ] Satan dude from Powerpuff Girls I don't know if you remember his name with him um I'll like flash a picture or something to show you guys what do you look like but yeah that's what he looked like and that's who he was he had the same creepy creepy boy it was a scary character and he scared me a lot actually when I was a kid and when I watched Powerpuff Girls so it's kind of weird that he was my imaginary friend pretty much he would tell me to do bad things um I want to see as a child I was very well behaved for the most part because my mom was psycho so I just knew not to mess up this friend imaginary friend would tell me to do things that were out of the ordinary for my [ __ ] behavior my parents were the parents that made you sit at the table and finish your food and everything before you got to leave like you had to finish all your [ __ ] food or you couldn't leave the table couldn't leave until you finish pretty much but which is stupid because it's like what if I [ __ ] wasn't hungry like when I'm a parent I'm gonna do things completely different for real they stink food and drinks was not good like just finish her [ __ ] in my household but anyways I remember my mom she poured me like a big old tall glass of grape juice and like she was like she don't even finish it cuz I had asked for and she was like yeah at finish it and I remember him in my head I was like taking a sip but then him in my head just kept staying poured down the drain remember I was arguing with him I was like no I want to drink this juice like I have to finish it and um he just kept telling me like poured down the drain before I down a drain like repetitively he just told me to pour down the drain angrily and I I did and as I was pouring it down the drain my big old tall glass of juice my mom walked in and she yelled at me and was like why did you make me for you saw him if you didn't want any and I totally [ __ ] got in trouble and then I remember one time we were outside and like pretty much we weren't a lot to like we had to stay within our like apartment complex you couldn't leave the vicinity pretty much I'm could either like playing the front or play in the back of the apartment complex but you could not go anywhere else I remember I was outside and like all the kids were just like they're just [ __ ] around somewhere right and I just remember him like telling me to go [ __ ] and run down the street run all the way down streets touch the cross light like you know the little crosswalk button and then come back I was like no cuz I'm gonna get in trouble like I'm definitely not allowed to like walk anywhere by myself you know so y'all just like no I don't you know want to meeting in trouble and like he just kept like urging me I totally did and like it was like not nighttime yet it was like around like 5 6pm you know so it was like dusk kind of I guess and like by the time I came back it was like kind of getting dark and like I didn't get caught this time but it's like as soon as I came back it's like he like disappeared like he didn't even care yeah I know I sound like I haven't mental illness but that's just what I wanted to tell you guys like he was [ __ ] scary and he would always like make me do like stupid [ __ ] like that like stuff that I wouldn't normally do like on my own when I turned like eight like almost nine he's wasn't really there that much and I used to always like make-believe we'd make bets and legs by each other monopoly money it was really weird and I had like two separate piles like one was for me and one was for him I was a weird kid okay my memory is kind of like hazy but like I do remember that like I remember that vividly that's what I'm trying to like that's what kind of like interesting too because like what our imaginary friends essentially write it like a part of our own personality cuz like when I think of this imaginary friend he had his own like features and [ __ ] in his own quirks and stuff like it was like kind of like he was a real person like in my head like I can't even explain it so it's like where do they stem from why do they come about like I just I don't know I think that's kind of wild I guess psychology major for like a really long time because like I'm really interested in that kind of stuff but like like what part of your subconscious is coming out in your imaginary friends but yeah well today you guys H is five more days till I go to California so like it's be back home and it's going to be great and I can't wait I am like so [ __ ] excited you guys don't need and that is like my paradise I feel like I think I'm always gonna live in a place in California like I think I've just always gonna be in California except Las Vegas I'll totally move there Las Vegas is legit my question to you guys is have you ever had an imaginary friend like as a kid and if so please elaborate I totally appreciate you guys [ __ ] sitting there getting stoned watching me getting stoned talking about random [ __ ] like I totally appreciate it I love you guys so yeah guys I'm I'm out I'm out I'll see you", "C176A4KbkgA": "good morning July 27th 2015 about 15 to 9:00 in the morning you can see it's this garden is just about to get sunlight it'll start getting light at around 9:00 and by 9:15 or 9:30 it will be fully engulfed in bright sunlight which will last until early evening this tree here to the to the west will begin to shade this at little after 5 o'clock around 5 o'clock and also this tree to the south begins to cached on this spot in about mid-september so we always have had a problem with bringing plants into fruition completely mature complete maturity before the sunlight diminishes and destroys the quality so in the past I've used flower and initiator saved I turn Romana in July 10th I mean it's you the August 10th and that will usually bring in the crop before the end of September now this year I've added a new experimental feature we have these 30 watts outdoor LED lamps there are 5500 k rated there these are the the cob type very powerful LED lights I've got some footage here I'll show you in a minute how this looks at night and it's amazing that these two 30 watt lights can like this very well and the whole intention of this is to extend the daylight period to roughly 17 hours a day and this will allow the plants to develop more completely during these next two weeks before the flower initiator comes on and also when I switch over on August 10th when the night becomes 10 hours long I turn the flower initiator on and the plants respond as if the nights of 12 hours long and they go into flower now with the light extension with these 30 watt lights I expect that I will have a stronger flowering response than I have in the past and anyhow we'll see how this proceeds again this is a new experiment and it should bear fruit it's looking pretty healthy for the most part pretty flawless just put some metal stakes into the ground and attach this metal lightweight metal framework to hang these to spin these and it just has a 50 foot extension cord coming down from the small greenhouse above and then just a means of splitting the energy to the two lights and the timer's up and underneath as I said so that it's not exposed to the weather out here you show a little bit of this after the lights come on later really quite right for just 60 watts of energy I hope believe it's adequate to keep the phytochrome switched into the act of innate state and to allow for the data to appear quite longer for plants and actually us so some trimming techniques in the morning Sun sights sunshine is hitting the garden area the lights are still on they'll be shutting off in a few minutes they come again on in the evening at around 7 o'clock and stay on until 10 o'clock they come on in the morning at about 5:30 so it's giving it a pretty long day and we'll see some benefits from this I'm sure most of these plants are a new variety this year I should say a variation on an old variety I've taken my my grew strain that I've been making over the years been breeding in lots of different strains all the major land races are have been represented at one point or another and it's very good on its own and now we've blended it's with us San Fernando Valley oh gee and so we'll see what the results are we're hoping that the fast-growing large yielding big buds from my variety will fuse with the og and create a really nice combination of the two in terms of flavor yields and density of Bud now an observation see these lower branches down here that are getting quite long already trying to reach for sunlight and throughout the plant you'll notice that these branches are elongating in the past I've used a technique where you just reach into the center of the cluster and grab the little bud in the center and and do that and that will split the buds at the ends it cost two buds instead of one the end buds are always the better buds well this year we're gonna try a different kind of experiment I'm gonna today I'm gonna cut half of the branches on this plant back I'm gonna cut them back to the second or third at the bottom the third internodal set here Oh on the waist and I'm gonna cut half the branches on the plant back to the second or third module longer at little lower shorter as they go to the top oh my god that seems horrible I know but in any case I'm gonna go through the whole plant into half and when those plants start to develop more growth on the tips then I will go back and cut off the other half I'll do this over the next two or three days this will double the number of buds will shorten the branches so that when they become long they will not be so heavy that they drag down onto the ground and usually the in buds are the best so and I found in the past that if they're closer to the main stem they tend to become larger and better buds and they don't look too good at first after you've paired them down but they'll respond really nicely in a few days bud so this is an experiment this year you can watch this one as well and we'll see how the combination of the lighting and the trimming technique pan out that's a 35 year old plant that's just going into the flower for the first time this year and then we'll have another report and probably two weeks not a lot it's going to happen for until August 10th I'll give a report when the flower initiators come on and show you how to plant how tall the plants are

believe seven days so now she's uh she's caring she should be she's been carrying in here for another four five days so I weighed her out today she totaled 145 grams she was under a 600 watt HPS light and she wasn't taking up the entire light I believe she was using up around 35 to 40% of that light because you know as you guys know I've run a perpetual harvest perpetual garden over here and I harvest every other month so yeah I can't have one plant eating up all the light over here from her and like I said I pulled a 140 I don't know if I mentioned it but I pulled 145 grams out of her just pretty good pretty good in my previous plant was 115 grams so I definitely you know improved my yield but this is not about these nugs just harvest this plant the footage that you guys are about is seeing a little bit right now is from a concentrate event yeah you know we have them I'll be here quite often now concentrate events or competitions this last one that we went to is called a Gabba pond so this is just some footage I'm going to show you guys of our little trip you know to this event it was kind of fun it wasn't the best one but it was fun so we got another one coming up this

guys know this is a hybrid the taste it tastes really lemony and piney you can the Terps are strong on this one the smell is amazing you guys are soul - is really potent the burn as you'll see in this milk shot of the head burns really well longer now I have titanium but ceramic or whichever type that you use with totally burn just as well the high had me feeling really relaxed and believing that this is an indica dominant strain alright you guys have been my review if you co a saw I recommend it to pick them up at the event at your local dispensary say hi leave a like comment subscribe peace you guys", "LrlWbtqYiTw": "you - how's it going guys just started week two will give you guys a little update show you how things are looking plants look really good I see uniform growth looking really good see the stretch is fully underway I got the first screen and I'm gonna drop the other one in tomorrow citron like day to week - these are all SF easier they're all looking really good starting to pop out some free flowers now that's our a really really good good help noticed the SMB og is very sensitive to any type of change mission when it comes to just bringing in new plants and - and - you know if I take her from the Cologne room and and bring her into here she likes the lights on very low and up as high as possible and she likes to kind of just chill for a few days and just kind of get acclimated through a new environment we try to rush her too much she'll just start getting stupid real fast she's actually slowly brought in two things so give it on 500 watts you can even still see the some of the issues on just a low release when she first came in you know like these ones like this you know she really doesn't like a lot of light Oh when she first comes in these are the GDPs and blue dream you know one light of these just you know throw it in there these are incredible health sir so I throw out some nice pretty flowers there yeah real nice growth deliver dreams six of those inherent six the GDPs or the sov the rest of all of everything is to Sophie and I got a drop in the second screen yeah here's some more of you know the older leaves getting accustomed just to the 500 watt light as high as it can go she really likes to be brought in real slow well at least for me I don't know anybody else's experience for me and my situation she likes me brought it and really still hand watering these I haven't got the chance to hook up the irrigation but they're flowering in these 6n spots and the in the growing in so yeah we're a day a day nine I'm working more this time on mastering the levels of magnesium and when I'm taking a lot of notes on far as getting those magnesium levels dialed in he says no purple stems at all there's no sign of any magnesium problems it's a big thing with this strain she'll just shoot through magnesium these are all the shorter plants here I did more of them on this table just to make up for the smaller plants a couple big ones right there there's one right here I'm just running her just this one in Coco this one gets fed like every couple days when the Coco is nice and dry they asked she's on the same food so she's running just fine I just wanted you wall with the sfv just see how she liked the Coco yeah watch the buds uh develop and get fat on the next few weeks just wanna give you guys a quick update all right take it easy he's up", "2Bl4uokfpso": "hey what's up you guys shadows here again with another episode of shadows weed review today on our show we're going to be going over the san fernando valley og also known as the sfvog this one is by the mojave reserve and it's an indica and it's weighing in at twenty six point eight seven percent thc point zero six percent cbd thirty two point five percent total cannabinoids now this one was fifty dollars at my local dispensary and as you guys have know if you've watched some of my old videos i was the guy who came up with san fernando valley og it is not a different type of og it is og back 25 years ago plus i was growing my og giving it to other growers to grow my other buddies as they would grow it in different cities and they'd bring it back to my dispensary i didn't want i couldn't name them or some people wanted to have you know aliases so it would be yoda og or whatever and then most of the time i just went by their cities malibu g san fernando valley og you know what i mean and now those have become people think that those are different strains all they are are the same og that i gave out grown by different people growing it with different nutrients in different environments can change it dramatically but it does not change the overall smell and flavor now you can make it taste bad by not flushing it good and that's a whole different story and stuff like that but when it comes down to it it was all oh geez if they have a different flavor or they've changed throughout the years it's because they've crossed it with something else and then that's a different type of og it's not just og it's a og cross but the real ogs are you can definitely tell the flavor the head high is intense you can smell it from across the room and we'll see if this one's legit or not considering if it is saffrono valley og it's myog and i would definitely be able to tell you if it was legit or not so let's open it together you guys and see what we got so here's the original seal on there as you can tell as i opened it this didn't even break so their version of sealing a container is terrible you can open this and there's no like sealed down lid so anybody could have opened this and changed it with something else if you want to get down to it now this is the first time it's been opened you guys the smell i can tell you right out the gate this is not a real og it's an og cross with thin mints or girl scout cookies now the reason i can tell you that is that after that minty smell yeah that's definitely crossed with thin mints or a girl scout cookie now look this is what you get for 50 bucks you guys that does not look that great you know let me pull the best snug out for you and if you can see it's frosty it's not terrible but it's also not super calixy which means the clusters the little balls if it's a bunch of clusters that's a good calyx to leaf ratio if it's like a big nug of leaves that they trimmed into a spade looking thing like these that's not so great this is about a 50 50. there's some calyxes but mainly it's just real trimmed real well so out of the gate i don't think it's that great i can tell you right off the bat it's not just og it's og and thin mints are a girl scout cookie i can tell you that and let's look at it underneath the uh a microscope to see how they treated this bud now if you look on here you can see that there's hardly any caps it's mainly all these stems you see all these stems on here there's no globule heads that means it was wasn't treated very good it was trimmed really well because somebody had to sit there and trim off all the excess leaves if you have a good calyx to leaf ratio there's very few leaves to trim off there if you're growing this leafy garbage then you got to trim it all up and there's a whole bunch of trim and that's when you they all of a sudden now they're making vape pens and they're making they're giving you a free joint with your purchase that's because they're giving you junk they're giving you the trim all the trim leafs only have 10 thc or less you're smoking all the carcinogens all the fertilizers that have been sprayed on the bud all the pesticides that have been sprayed on the bud and stuff all that residue all that stuff is on the trim they trim it off or whatever and then now they're going to run it through butaner or however they want to do it to get you to to buy their junk back in the day we used to make it into edibles and there would be different ways of doing it for people that that didn't want to smoke a healthier way now they're just trying to maximize it they're keefing that stuff then they're okay so they'll get a bad bad nugs they'll roll it in cheap wax and then they'll cover it in cheap keep and then it's just all the junk they had and now they'll sell it as moon rock for sixty dollars and eight it's just trying to maximize their profit off of the amount that they get so there's only a certain amount of nugs on there those are the most quality and most profitable the rest is all trim and all that stuff so they're trying to maximize profit out of that because you got to pay for lights you got to pay for nuts you got to pay for all that stuff when you're growing so when knowing all that you know that they're going to try and sell you that stuff nobody's going to blast butane and make you good stuff through nugs they always use trim they're always gonna sell if you ever wonder why you get those free joints and you open that container and it smells like plants and it doesn't smell like the nugs like the jar nugs you got it's because that's water leaves that's trim that's junk they're selling you jungle giving you junk trying to be like oh i got a good deal because it came with the joint a joint of trim it's trim it's not good to be smoked it's good for edibles because you're you're just ingesting it you're not and it's already been filtered but to smoke it that's not the way to go they give you a free joint smell it in the container and then you come and comment down below smell it put it down below what does it smell like does it smell like michaels fake flowers that's because of junk don't let them get you with that okay so now right off the bat we know that this stuff has been trimmed a lot handled poorly it doesn't smell that great i would not waste my time on this stuff just telling you right now if you're going to spend that kind of money go to get los angeles blue box get some real og don't get this waste of time stuff get some maven triple x og maven og do not get this step i i already got another jar of this over here because i wanted to smoke it for a day just so i could give you guys the best review possible not just one bongo review but i've already smoked this for a day garbage don't waste your money on it it's it's okay but it's not worth this 50 bucks plus that they were trying to charge so don't get this mojave reserve okay spend your money get the los angeles kush get a maven this is just it's okay the smell out of the container just smells me the flavor is in there not that great but we're going to take a bong load together just to give it one last try with you guys so grab your bongos grab your bongs grab some bud and let's do this together all right you guys let's do this so as you can see from my last video this is my brand new platinum roar bam and we're gonna do it out of the platinum more so actually we use this best snug that we looked at on the microscope and i'm going to break up this fat mug i'm going to give it one last try and see if it's any good but i can tell you i smoked it all day yesterday flavor wasn't that great i wasn't that great a little headachy it just wasn't that great all right you guys you got your pieces let's do this together all right let's do this oh okay so the bong loads okay you get a little bit of a a head rush because it's no g-cross with animal mints so it's two good strains you know it's not terrible terrible but when you compare it to a regular og it's definitely subpar compared to a regular og now if you're going against purples this is definitely going to get you higher than most purples but when you're going against og's this is gonna be on the bottom rug just because of the smell the flavor and it's it's the og cross so i just want to let you guys know do not if you try this don't be like i don't like ogs because i didn't like clayborn or try los angeles blue box or some maven and then tell me that you don't like og because that's real g and it's pretty good and even that that's pretty watered down i haven't seen anything like this stuff that we grow out on the market yet and we're trying to get it out on the market but let me tell you big pharma and all these big companies buy up all the they only reserve certain amounts of licensing and all that kind of stuff and these fools buy all up so it makes it really hard i'm already at the point where i don't need to do this anymore i want to retire but i feel that i need to get my stuff out there and to get like show the world what really what og is like and what it was like to go to my dispensary back in the day and to get real pure cushion real ogs and not just these businessmen who don't know anything about weed calling everything og trying to fake kids out when they're newbie smokers and they get high off everything and they're like this is good this steezy is good it's junk is junk and you're buying these vape cartridges spending tons of money on these vape cartridges none of them are nug run if they were nug run it would be a hundred dollars for a half gram because if you look at how much comes out when you run it through the bud very very little you would your profit margin would be nothing you would have to grow outdoor bud and get it for free to be able to sell it for the prices they're selling it at the reason why i know this is because all my friends grow indoor outdoor i've been growing my like for almost 30 years like well 25 years and let me tell you nobody does it through nugs the few times that we have done it through nugs we smoke it ourselves because it's super valuable super rare nobody's gonna do that through good blood it's going to be through junk bud and if they are it's going to be so expensive it's not going to be worth it let me tell you if you want to get the best best best weed you got to do pure teeth now let me tell you about it do dry sift key if you put it on like a silk screen you sift the key like your bun before you sell it before you get rid of it when i used to be a grower i just get a pen shake it one or two times bam then i take my ounce out or the pound out then you can sell the pound or whatever and that keef would be just pure blonde keef and that's nothing but trichomes mainly caps if you use a small enough screen and oh my god that is the purest way to smoke the best way to smoke and absolutely the most potent way to smoke so if anybody tells you anything different they're wrong you're smoking butane or smoking something else that's why they're making it into glass and also because it doesn't get any more concentrated than just the caps okay so if you want to do this best bond load in the world get the best blood you have shake it in the keef box and then if i can then you can take your bond load later or whatever but scrape up that key take that one bond load you'll be the highest you've ever been in your life okay we'll do that on another video because i want you guys to experience keith now most the key that's out there right now is trim keefe so it's brown and green it smells it's terrible that is because they're doing it with tren with trim and and their leaves and all the extra crap because there's still thc on there so they want to shake it off and get some money out of that i know because i've done it before and that's why i'm trying to tell you don't be duped once i got up to the top and i realized hey like you know it's not about the money i want to get everybody high i want everybody to be high nobody should be left out everybody should be smoking og from the top guy to the bottom guy there's no need that anybody needs to be smoking garbage and getting headaches and smoking pesticides and mold that's wrong don't need to do it shouldn't do it it's bad for your health bad for their health and then it's overall bad for for getting high because i hear like people like oh it gives me headaches or oh you know it makes me tired i'm just like come with me come come you don't have there's sativas you know there's weeds that have been fresh properly that don't give you headaches there's i have a solution for your problem comment down below why don't you like weed and i'll tell you why you should like weed okay because that's what i do when i was at had my dispensary we went around to hospitals and we we it was illegal at the time but we got their caregiver certificates to make it legal and then we went and we delivered bud to everybody through the dispensary it was the greatest thing seeing these old people that were miserable super happy like oh it was the greatest thing but we'll talk about that on another one sorry we're gonna get back to our mojave reserve so as i told you guys before this mojave reserve isn't isn't the real deal oh gee it's pretty good but i would get something else if you can if there's another type of og i might give it a try i would say it's about even with the jugo g jugo g is it's okay i mean as you can see i bought quite a few of those back here the jojo junior cakes all that i tried them all but ellie kush is definitely the best right now them and maven so if you can get some la kush or some maven oh g's but uh yeah if they don't have those this is definitely better than the purples but uh yeah it's not one of the best objects all right you guys i'll see you on the next one later", "8oJdjHBGIos": "i all its guard here with another review this time a BHO review what you see in front of you is sfv San Fernando Valley Oh G butter this butter was made at MMJ total health care you can see the website right there and you can see this glorious glorious piece of butter butter is a beautiful beautiful extract here's the rest of it let's give you a good look it's a beautiful beautiful extract that takes the best parts I think with butter with butter you get what you miss in shatter and what we miss in shatter is flavor butter gives flavor I there's new things coming out I forget they call it clear or they call it something else I shared it it was dragonballs of this stuff at THC 99% then they add back the terpenes that they took out during during the concentration process really cool anyways sfv og san fernando valley sfv it's a mouthful stands for San Fernando Valley oh gee by Cali connection it's a sativa dominant hybrid that's great for patients who need strong pain relief but don't want to be stuck on the couch most pain relief comes from the indica side the energy and the depression fighter on the other side you know this is a nice down the road middle really really nice you saw what it looked like there but let's look a little closer there it is up close and personal really really nice butters used by taking the the initial process and stirring and stirring and stirring there's a lot of work to it but there's a lot of flavor to it and yeah it turns out like Swiss cheese that's a 20 times zoom let's really go in there 200 times I'm gonna have to come back a bit and focus back down again sometimes it's hard to get really close to an item there we go wow look at that I'll be honest with you this is my first time seeing it under the microscope at this tight zoom level and it's beautiful it's beautiful okay let's say goodbye to the butter no let's not say goodbye to the butter let's take that butter up from under the microscope right here nice little piece but put it back in the container I have told you a little bit about it we've seen it really good this thing has really strong pine and lemon smells it is it has very few shall I say negatives dry mouth dry eyes yes but as per most sativa dominant that may cause paranoia or dizziness or it doesn't test data's show this between 19 and 25 percent as a flower with a fairly good CBD 0.4 percent half a percent fairly good CBD then all that gets concentrated of course that is not the outcome of this I'm speaking they're of the flower itself the wax just concentrates that again we've talked a lot about concentrates I don't think I need to say this concentrates is just the pure form of the plant the more we remove from it the less I think it's a great idea but I like now there's now they're working the science is getting to where they can remove everything and then add it back those essential pieces Cheers thing is we don't know what's essential yet that's why why are they removing anything Cheers the lemon flavor really comes through on this really really nice a soft smoke a soft smoke I find that with butter it's not so harsh it's probably a little less percentage I can't even guess a percentage but since it isn't a flower and I'm not making rosin we've gone about as far as we can go we've tasted we've looked at and we smelt it pungent beautiful works good on stress works good on pain but gets you out the door and I can tell you it works because I didn't even want to do this review I have been smoking my Romulan this morning because the pain was so high but it keeps wanting to put me back to sleep Romulan is good for real good sleep and so I was really tired doing this this just happened that toke has already bursted my energy and I do think I'm four hours away from getting my Sun maybe I'll go for a walk it's not as warm today and no Sun so it might be a nice walk but it's working for what it's meant to do the pain is getting less and my energy is building that's why concentrates are important for us for me to have done the same out of this with flour I would have had to have probably two bowls and therefore probably irritated my lungs more filled the air with much more small all to get what I got out of one tote by concentrating the product down MMJ has done a wonderful job on this project project on this product as they do with all their BHO I have always been impressed with their BHO even now that I make rosin like crazy for myself and therefore have my own steady Pharma concentrate I still get their BHO because some of it is just so beautiful and so warming I can't do that out of my own rosin peace and Cheers love and harmony I hope you enjoyed this strain review share it share it with others subscribe if you haven't already loved this channel love all of you peace and Cheers", "rdYmUgFQZLw": "what up [ __ ] that's right you guessed it another [ __ ] video bang I couldn't leave you

hair in my ass [ __ ] you know I kind of want to kind of want to go somewhere else change change carriers change kinky did get anything falling out still rocking little flip phone ship so I ended up going with AT&T and I didn't get sucked into the iPhone thing and my main thing with the iPhone is no not the whole stupid deal with not be able to get insurance on it and and just I'm not really big you know Typhon so I really didn't go to 18 T for iPhone I just kind of up to 18 t you know kind of for a change you know they had some really polyfoam so I end up going with the HTC Inspire the phones the [ __ ] the phone is the business the phone is without a doubt the best one I've ever had but the [ __ ] service att's phone service is the worst ever I think in six years of t-mobile I had maybe a dozen drop calls or you know at points where I can hear myself or you know I lost when I lost the car so maybe maybe twice a year that would happen it seems like every other phone call with AT&T is garbage unless you're calling somebody else who has AT&T which is then then you're looking at about an 80% chance of it just rockin on but then there's also still a chance it's gonna [ __ ] up some somewhere down the line or right off the bat so if anybody out there has got t-mobile and you've been hated on I was hated on not remain not really just by some friends and stuff hating on a stick they call it a stripper phone they talk T Mobile stripper phones so to all you guys out there who were rockin the t-mobile cheers [ __ ] this one's for you I wish I was back there but I'm stuck with this [ __ ] for two years so look that said that little rant out of the way here we go is that vog don't a big way more expansive than that then family taste matches the up the smell for sure definitely though that's um it's got a nice little lock to your throat definitely very definitely expensive definitely I'm definitely saying it's right up there what now I'm not gonna be able to really tell you how the high end because I'm still hiding a little bit but in this drink but I'm definitely going to tell you that all right was just at one point and now I feel like this doesn't like I feel like I'm oh this is like a know like a sativa think five minutes ago I saw like I was kind of like leaning a little bit you don't want the indica but right now I feel like this is like a moralistic this is a guy like I said it shot us a tee way you know so props to the hike wiggle we'll shout it out at a 15 and gram 4584 grams on Thursdays so we don't talk out with that three-point talk [ __ ] we wait till Thursday so anybody else's cat [ __ ] throw up and then eat it again my cat does that and it has no problem I mean he eats it all backed up everything am I the only one let me know so many hit me up I mean I got an older cat and stuff but I mean he does he pretty much anything that moves budweis I mean it [ __ ] up a you know a cricket you know what I'm feeding some [ __ ] some of my my aquatic stuff some of my reptile and [ __ ] sometimes said a lot a creek you'll get loose or whatever and he'll say note something he's got no problem [ __ ] killing it and eating it like it's nothing I see almost sometimes it begs me when he sees me bring home the food phone so I don't know maybe I'm scared we're don't get okay so maybe not maybe guys got a cat that [ __ ] eat people let me know but uh I thought that was it just bizarre and he just did it around like 15 minutes ago whatever an expression my mind so maybe that's why I'm throwing it up in oh man this week rest in peace Ryan done you went out like a [ __ ] champ like I mean you can't say that she didn't go out like the way you lived you know like you didn't get bit by cancer some heart attack or stroke enough and you went out like like you probably was supposed to go out or like to play envisioned it or something but top damn that's some [ __ ] up [ __ ] so rest in peace man you entertained me more than more than to more than one occasion man I'm gonna [ __ ] on jackass so just want to throw that shout out there man I'm gonna in this video I can make that long battery turn it out and put a shirt check the Twitter for pictures these [ __ ]", "bdXqzqQjO9w": "what up and welcome to canopedia where we are bringing to you honest and unbiased cannabis drain reviews so today we are going to be reviewing valley o g by grow sciences and you guys are checking that out right now this is the growth sciences smalls or micros as you guys may have seen out there and this is not our first time having valley og on the channel but it is our first time trying the grow sciences valley og so if it's your first time trying valley og let's go ahead and talk about it a little bit this is an indica dominant hybrid strain about a 60 40 indica dominant hybrid that is a cross between sf v o g so san fernando valley og and blueberry two huge strains coming together to create this grow sciences valley oh gee we are stoked to have it here on the channel so i'm gonna bring it up a photo of this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out and then we're gonna take a look at it together and see what this stuff is all about okay so you guys just had a chance to check this stuff out what did you guys think let me know in the comments below and i'm so sorry you guys we only have these tiny little micros to photograph here for you i know that makes it tough with these reviews and stuff but i did pull out the biggest nug i had this one had actually a big stem coming from it so i pulled off some of the butt at the bottom of that stem just so i could bring this uh this nug and this was the nug you guys were actually looking at there in the middle um of the other two nugs and honestly you guys from a looks perspective it looks like og kush like this is the same bud structure it's you know it's not like absolutely raging with um you know trichomes but there are definitely a lot of trichomes and these great orange hairs i mean it really looks a lot again like just a classic og kush pine cone bud structure and you know to me i really really think this is some good looking bud um and what i'll say here is like as far as the terps go it actually has some pretty good terps like it's awesome you guys like the smell of this stuff it reminds me of like og kush mixed with something just kind of subtly sweet hence that sfv blueberry so like i really dig it if you like kush and you like some sweet flavors you know not citrusy sweet but like sweet like gelatos and stuff like that wedding cakes blueberry for example sherbets you're gonna like the smell of this stuff and it's not like rocking super super loud but i really like the smell i really really do i really hope these terps translate well into the bowl so man i am so excited to try out this valley og because last time we had valley og on the channel it was not not good um but a completely different grower and certainly not the level of quality we've come to expect from our friends over at growth sciences so i'm excited to get this going so if you guys want to get your pieces ready i am going to get my piece ready here and today i'm going to be enjoying this valley og out of my arizer extreme q desktop vape i've got this bad boy set to 375 degrees fahrenheit you guys see that right there i am then taking my whip so i've just cleaned that i'm gonna take the whip this end has got the double screens on it so two screens there i'm gonna put that on to my vape and then this other end here you guys see i have another female that's got a built-in glass screen i just picked that up from arizer and i'm gonna feed that piece into my you guys already know what's coming scientific inhalations triple filtered bubbler look at that piece of art first chamber there is where carbon goes we're going to leave that empty since no ash is going to be getting in the second chamber filtration chamber which is our purified water just clean this piece out and in the third chamber there i have as always got a brand new organic cotton filter to filter out any remaining impurities but we know this bud is mold and pesticide free because growth sciences is all about that clean medicine at the end of the day so if you guys are ready i'm ready get your pieces fired up let's try out some of this valley og from growth sciences and see what it's all about wow for a first rip that was oh my god a lot of vapor and i know i just took a big rip you guys but damn was that a lot of vapor to not even cough at all you guys that's on freaking heard of it's unbelievable this is gross science you guys that is the difference that grow science makes straight up buttery smooth you guys now flavor is like a subtle sweet kush is kind of what it tastes like it's very subtle it's not strong the terps are not strong now that was just the first rip though you guys i'm diving in for the second one now to see if these chirps develop at all for me wow another beast you guys about like nine tenths of the way through that or 90 of the way through the rip i was like whoa i'm getting really i'm like i can barely i can barely keep pulling this thing i've been hitting him for a while now i will say again i can't specify enough you guys that was some of the smoothest blood i have puffed in a long long time terps are very subtle they're not super loud they're not super in your face they're just kind of lingering there on my tongue um and it's just a subtle cushy so like a sweet piney flavor is kind of what it tastes like but it's good i mean it's very unique a little bit like a kush cake or something like that you know if you've ever had something like that very very similar um but man i'm only two rips in i didn't even realize i'm like i still got the whole rest the review to do you guys i'm all like thinking we're all done here no you guys i gotta finish out this bowl now and while i am finishing out this bowl damn i'm getting ahead of myself maybe this is a lot stonier than i thought i'm just kidding you guys or maybe i'm not i don't know you guys i'm gonna finish out this bowl while i am doing that i'm gonna bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out under a 25 times magnification macro lens so i'm gonna show you this nug actually that i'm holding under a 25 times magnification um macro lens and then once we're done taking a look at that stuff i'm going to check back in with you guys to let you know how my session went and give you guys my final rundown on this stuff all right so here is the valley o g by grow sciences and wow you guys these are some bright awesome orange hairs on this stuff it is pretty much covered in crystals except for a little bit there on the leaves you guys but i mean i think it's got a great proportion of crystals to hairs and all in all this is just some great looking bud and you guys can even see the leaves just trimmed right up to the bud there and all around it looks killer all right so what did you guys think of this stuff under the macro lens personally you guys saw i mean it looks bomb under that macro lens and honestly you guys see mice are cached this stuff was a pleasure a delight to try out and it had its ties it had its lows and there's a lot i want to talk to you guys about with this strain because this is an interesting strain for me um and i would say that like overall i mean the effects that i'm feeling right now are very much like honestly kind of like a more of a balanced hybrid but it is kind of on the heavier side so i can see why they um would put this as like a 60 40 versus a 50 50 hybrid um it's probably just leaning a little bit more on that san fernando valley and i would probably actually back that and stand behind that because that is definitely kind of the effects that i'm getting um like my body feels pretty mellowed out but my mind is definitely still pretty alert you know so that's kind of what the effects that i'm kind of getting are right now um but i want to rate this stuff for you guys i want to give you guys a rating out of 10 on this stuff and so how i do that is i break this stuff down into four different categories the look the smell the taste and the potency of this medicine or how effective this stuff is so before i jump into that i'm going to bring it up on the screen one last time for you guys to check out since i want to talk about the look of this stuff or the bag appeal of this stuff first so i want it to be fresh in your mind when i go ahead and do that so here is a look at this valley og from grow sciences one last time okay so you've seen it a few different times you guys and you know it's a bummer to me i wish we had some bigger nugs of this stuff because truthfully i bet you this stuff really does like a big fat knob of this stuff i bet you looks absolutely killer i bet you it no joke would easily be a easily be a 2.5 out of 2.5 but unfortunately it's gonna be a two for me out of 2.5 and that is still amazing you guys i mean you know it's it's got a lot of great things it's just not the best looking bud that we've ever seen and ooh this mug's even got a little bit of purple uh undertones on it and that is really really pretty there i don't know if you guys can see that if i get my fat face out of the way um you guys but yeah honestly i mean these are some really really nice sized trichomes and those orange hairs are just the killer killer so i'm going to go 2 out of 2.5 in the looks department and the bag appeal now on to the smell the smell of this stuff you guys it really does smell good but it's just like not really loud so it's like you know there's no way if if com you know comparatively speaking to other strains when i open the bag it should just be whoa holy cow like i could potentially i i rate it like this you guys here's my rating could you get pulled over by an officer of the law and he would not ask for your medical marijuana card you know would they ask or would they not in this case i'm like i'm gonna say that they might ask they might not you know so it's like it's good but not great you know if they'll ask it's gonna get a 2.5 for sure you know if they're gonna ask for that card but if you can get it by an officer of the law then i would say um you know again this would be this would be good it smells good you guys it's like a sweet kush as i kind of explained at the beginning of this video i'm standing behind that kind of like a cush with some berries in it it's like right up my alley now the taste oh the taste taste my heart you guys here's the deal the taste is where this stuff dropped the ball it just did i wanted it to be there so bad but the terps were lacking on this stuff they really really were and it's unfortunate because um you know what i did get in the flavor in those first two ribs that i thought was kind of gonna develop it really didn't after the third rip or so it just kind of completely died went to that kind of just like um leafy taste you know earthy taste and it really wasn't that enjoyable it was really smooth and clean but those terps weren't really you know on point in my opinion so i'm going to freshen this up hopefully with the boveda and hope those terps come out but unfortunately straight out of the bag it's a 1.5 out of 2.5 for me now the potency you guys this it had a comeback it came back with a little punch at the end i'm going to go with a 2 out of 2.5 because this does have really good effects the one thing that i'm just not liking is i'm kind of getting that rubber bandy feeling around my head and that's just like i i don't like that particular um uh feeling it's kind of a little bit to me um it's it's just a little bit artificial feeling if that makes any sense you know but it is still clean and i mean this is definitely still good medicine but you know from the potency standpoint a 2 out of 2.5 is still really good it's just not great um so if you guys have been keeping tally let's go through the look it's going to get a two the smell it's gonna get a two the taste it's gonna get a 1.5 so it's got five and a half points and in the potency category it's gonna get a two so it's gonna get a seven and a half for us which honestly that's what i think this stuff deserves is about a seven and a half um which means that we are going to give it the dank recommendation go pick yourself up some of this valley oj if you guys see it floating around and give those guys at grow science is a big thumbs up they still got a little bit of work to do to perfect this stuff and again listen maybe if i got the jarred stuff um you know that was vacuum sealed some of those terp issues might have been you know resolved and i mean i didn't really talk about the um i didn't talk about the freshness very much and i'm gonna just press on some of this it's still here's the deal this is still this is good i think from a a freshness standpoint it's not super dry it's not too too fresh so i mean honestly i've been using those 62 humidity bovedas and honestly you guys i think it might be too much humidity for me i might go back down and start using the 58s uh you know to retain all the terps and freshness in this bud but you know again this is actually pretty pretty fresh stuff so yeah i really enjoyed this of g go ahead pick it up 7.5 from us so growth sciences have done it again you guys big ups to you guys and your team we love it if you guys have tried this valley og definitely let me know what you guys think in the comments below and if there's something you guys want to see reviewed definitely let me know that in the comments below as well but with that being said you guys until next time take

is because it is the San Fernando Valley cut monkey push JMO still growing so no geek push back behind me that my finger [Music] [Music] it's like oh gee flavor a little bit of that chronic taste coming through just a little bit so you know it's pretty good [ __ ] just under 20 percent so it was like $4 grand probably like $15 Nate $28 for a quarter it's probably still around 120 fern ends but I can't do 20 that's too much throw a little bit of them my stone is coming on yeah it's nice and smooth I don't know they can see that but - it's nice and white flaky music watched well smoke productions pretty average it's definitely no top-shelf lead that's for sure it'll get it good it's it's good weed unfortunately I'm Leafly the advertisers being almost 23 percent THC going and I'm disappointed to find out a [ __ ] just under 20 for the price that it was so that's a little bit misleading petite sheep the number doesn't matter let's get you started so I mean the mistake you're going to define and getting a bunch of expensive [ __ ] that was overpriced and it's just way more beautified because it was really poor chemicals so we learned our lesson from that if you're going for a good [ __ ] you're looking to get you're getting like names this is what hate isn't a bad deal there okay that Bulls out from on the looks I'd give it a I'd say six point eight out of ten Oh make it a seven seven out of ten on the looks on the high are that the taste there another smell it's a good solid eight and a half on the smell it's good chip nice pungent strong smelling weed words burned um on the taste I'm gonna go ahead and give it a seven because it's not like no no no let's bump it up to a seven and a half seven and a half so cuz I had a little bit of that chronic taste come true so get eight a seven and a half on the taste on the Hynek different you have to go with a solid eight out of ten eight out of ten on the heights it's not quite up there quite up there with the other stuff I got the other stuff I got it's like a nine and a half a nine and a half out of ten love the stuffs I got some more expensive it's $10 grand-pere's $4 Graham so she's a different sir so overall it's good weed seven on the looks eight-and-a-half on the taste coz that a little bit of chronic taste other Smith a seven a half on the smell it was pretty strong and eight on behind pretty good overall would I go back and get this stuff again maybe a more indoor hydro cut of it this seems to be more of a greenhouse cut so yeah they had a indoor hydro grown cut for the same price yeah but I'd go and buy another half ounce of it so yeah that's my review on the San Fernando Valley og make sure you guys like and subscribe for more woof Oh", "q0xWOZOgVLg": "four days from harvest

right do that you're like taking all kinds of pills like brings iety and freshen not the answer you I've been there I've taken all kinds of pills and you know even done a lot of recreational vapor it

creative it just makes more I'm stressed I don't want to be music when I was fast I want to make easy good I guess and possibly after you I mean the world we live in today naturally everyone is just stressed out you have working of school your parents your boyfriend's girlfriend's whatever it all stressing you out it's like do you have something you know and cuz I I know a lot of people have anxiety and they probably don't get help for it because they don't want to have to take a pillow in that kind of stuff and I don't disagree review at all and this is something naturally game and uh

you know it's acid its program for a man's voice what are you trying to say there's nothing wrong with never mind there's nothing like at the end of a Cabo hearing someone call you ma'am it's like wait a second do you think I was a woman\u00eds entire three-hour conversation that's una people were like I kept switching back and forth actually I wasn't sure half the time but then I was definitely sure you were a female and I'm like re well I'm actually actually I don't know what I am quite yet warning warning for vaporization water pregnancy or lactating females store in a cool dark dry area please call dr. Roman in case of emergency and if you have any we always have drugs surrender you can surrender your old flower we get it here it's good you have a disposal box you just throw it it's a cardboard box outside and we'll dispose of it it's got a padlock on it alright is this thing done it's going I turned it up to 320 which we were doing like 420 so we'll see that's not how you use it by the way you use it with a bag alright oh the comedy is wonderful on the show here we go the boiling points of the cannabis compound what are they all we need is the boiling point of THC i HD refrigerators for for you you sit on squash all right we're almost there we're there John we're there it's time oh it's not always fair we go it's like Pinocchio's nose a girl sat on Pinocchio's nose and she says lie to me tell me the truth lie to me tell me the truth lie to me tell me the truth let's take this serious THC approximately 350 degrees all right John your medical patient as a my THC v burns at 428 degrees I don't care about that stuff what is T C's T chase such t sees see you retain the taste they're good let me try I want to retain the taste I'm not getting any real vapor there's oh that's a good taste you know and you keep it lower in temperature drop away better 20 meter scene 334 living in 349 I think whatever oh it's inside of me I think we should turn it up a little bit all right we're like 350 maybe 360 John you call the shots today how much you save 360 I actually like this a lot right I think the reseating might be a little high we'll see I mean that's that's alright that's what we're here for let it go it's not up there yet cuz if you look are we there yet daddy there look shut up kids see this we have 20 more hours to drive if we're ready to Disneyland THC Presley 315 so we were just right at 320 we were right in there that was the perfect amount 320 I'm telling you you don't want any of the other stuff research that though I don't want to see me be you just went up in the CBD spike jump you're gonna be yeah that's up there ah it already I can smell the like already that taste that you didn't want I could already smell that first one tasted really good it was low be easy dude I can already smell smell it it's got that like wheat burning yeah Haiti's look you can see it it's like it's the smoke yeah I guess I could see how much more great it is guys it was perfect before though it's almost like dabbing right you want to have the coldest to have you waited a Preiser that you can you all right stop it still tastes pretty good though does it still not bad yeah it's got that it's a little bit too high like 340 that's good it'd be for you but it's interesting that you need to go a hundred degrees higher to activate the THC V what is DC video exactly one day or maybe I mean we need the research like we need to look at these individual compounds and see how they have affect people differently so have there been researched looking at individual compound research out there so why did the green house guys go in Africa dude died with malaria because because some writer out there or producer was like guys why are we making about TCE and then they're like okay cool yeah yeah we'll make it more you look a flavor if you guys could smell this it smells almost like a concentrate where you have that the live resin where you have the you know all of the green aroma that's how this flower smelling right now I think you could cure for like another few weeks like if you could buy it to keep it and burp a jar every day and just cure it further the taste would become that much better and the aroma we become more pronounced aroma I love it when we see that someone likes so mo ensure his buzz for months and these guys are doing it for a few we just does not do it for me right now I don't even feel anything no are you sure that's not CBD we're hearing that looks better smoke did do a whole bag it doesn't taste good no that's deeper that's smoke vapor is clear oh hello all right good so you take that whole back you might need it your tolerance is higher than mine yeah 350 I bet anyways I have three levels about yeah yes it seemed like three less when you got people out some good vapor vapor not smoke okay so I I think that it could be stronger this is marijuana product the last thing I took was pretty good no yeah I mean you need to give it a few seconds I think it's very strong guys by the way make sure to subscribe to the channel if you're new here and give the video a thumbs up because we are like that and since we tend to use bangers here I want you to bang on that subscribe button and make sure to engage with us and John you can you know read some of the comments too so that way they know we're here live yeah you got a car show James or what's up Carson J that's a good nickname all right don't mind if I do get another baggie baggie I think if you want premium flour you're gonna pay a premium price not for long hopefully that changes soon with the prices I mean we should still we should be able to $20 because that's where I think their price point should be we're about $20 Andy I think the price point should be $20 an ounce Wow tea bro your owner would be now if you goo you're on it be free nope the ground come back a couple months later nothing added your soil has to be okay no it doesn't yours and shitty co2 hey you know what if you do that you're gonna get mold I mean especially with this look good talking look who's talking the season that we have here in Pennsylvania is one that we get a long rainy period and cold period long rainy season what I'm pretty sure we have four seasons here no season but at the tail end of the summer we get a lot of rain and foremost bulbs mode especially if you have super tight buds is that right your super date funds to get more mold easily yeah because it keeps the moisture so that's why there are strains developed specifically for outdoors and those bugs are a little bit more Airy not as dense Wow there are strange my weapon of choice that are more mold resistant more pest resistant all right Moxie you do not get number one flower of Pennsylvania I don't think so not yet you don't maybe at the Cannabis Cup you will Liberty and PA has the best flower of PA I'll agree to disagree with that isn't that dispensers like liberty now they grow as well I gotta try this something we gotta get yeah we've had it have we yeah they're becoming the one container no that's Alera oh that is Alera I've had sent some samples over to dr. Romo so we can you know rate it on this stream just kidding they're not allowed to do that all right James Johnson said bud rot yeah but Ruben it's true east coast rain review said can I come visit yes you can you can be on a stream maybe we need help east coast but review for a website called cannabis critique comm so if you're interested in helping us with that and anybody else by all means also we're looking for some females to join us on the show because we feel that we're being sexist by only having men on the show so often so you're females on the show we try but the balance is way off we need a female's perspective here because otherwise it's just those doofuses talking to one another guys are so much dumber than girls from a very young age that I don't know yeah I'm just starting to like dawning on me I'm like oh are we the Dumber of the two sexes I have then I look around and all the guys like and the females are like filling out their their forms for them they're like okay honey relax relax you're gonna get your marijuana card all right then I have to give them the instructions how to get the card and they're like so we're gonna do my marijuana car and I'm like I literally have to like look at the woman and be like I'm gonna tell you all the instructions cuz you're probably gonna be doing it all for him aren't you and they're like yes oh you're one of them that have caught on I see yes very good you can tell me and something like this tell them and now I'm realizing it's like that for basically every couple it's pretty bad guys we are the dumbest by far I don't think we care though I think we're totally on me to be the down starting at a young age because I have three girls and I say the little boys are like cavemen I mean are they I'm not the only one yeah no I agree with a little bit me they we're gonna start hitting each other poles and stuff you'll see I mean it's cerebral right I don't even feel anything yeah I don't know man I think guys really what you see in this or not I don't think they put any teach you why can you smoke a joint in New Jersey and in Delaware but in Pennsylvania you can't no one out there huh why can you smoke a joint in New Jersey and Delaware but you can't in Pennsylvania because someone DEA comedy they're all like sorry Jimmy all right we'll take smoking out how about that happen we'll take you smoking now all right fine and that's probably what happened I think that's exactly what happened Liz that's what happens in Harrisburg I mean it's like these modifications to appease everyone and yeah that's what you get so I think we gotta find out who Jimmy is and get the guillotine out no I'm just kidding we're not actually condoning any violence we are peacefully asking them please Jimmy please can we smoke now it's true yeah I should be able to cuz looking like a woman he's becoming a dad head I know you're here I'm like this big device you know it's all [Music] yo yo you see my dad

forward it's my jam son do you see the lovely ladies in the background um oh but yeah the shot watch eyes he's getting too much damage right now he's giving diamond pretty much what he needs easy easy damage easy pickings he's keeping shine very honest it's what you call conditioning the opponent at his finest are you come shine what he's gonna do nice to meet its life no diamonds checking those comment that she's get out of here with that food stuck a pin trigger though would it be able to pop it Oh indirect trip car working down millions favor Wow very unfortunate for sure because he needed that jump into line so you can pop the V trigger and this is great I can't believe that man you put herself in danger like that actually could have got ugly hey unless you finish the job yep worked on his favor pretty nice right here we go down menu first blood headset yeah got a five guys top eight the whole way it's gonna be a serious upset a really really tough deal for shine to swallow yeah not only does he have to think about losing the Dominion twice but then take don't think about how much you have to pay for that table yes for sure nice blocking Ovid ok nice shaving it Yoda space in them from both of these players man was very much the last match to our to the bundle stuck in the corner can't get out paying a price I'm serious price trying to get on the corner okay scissors all he's doing is running from dominion yeah what is that yep left the right Wow see I could understand that strategy from shot but I think you should get the lead first before you texted play a little lame exactly oh thanks here the air with the fear spent diamond heinous on it oh no oh my god you're staying right there this is the wall of Dominion Wow get right and today yo Lina's is all over it man conditioning as fine as easy from left to right doesn't matter which part of the screen whatever n which ever end Eagle Street and shine like a typical prey let's chasing him down usually thing is the zone and type he does Jace people yeah well yes here's a Goods owner but what our company is zoning is no to be a villainous sheep have much help while the poisonous taking it yeah poison look at that oh my god the grab so much damage from that with a poison he can't get it shine can't get a read on this man right now he really can you're driving a slippery as hell oh look at that oh my lord everything's just working I'll a look at that this bunch of scrambled a mitigated been in and that should be it and he had the eax to juggle to start off I think it should have a Karen emphatically damn don't don't write it out like it's not like this in winners was all the way around yeah it was kinda many PP pic ibuki and malden then the and force diamond to you with God and that's when God hit him with the es flash kick okay that's the reason why what would a bulky this time around thinking that you know it might be a better matchup it may work in his favor and the dice the cards pretty much incorrect yeah no no reads I'm telling he's not even it's not more so that he's not a dad that he's doing what he needs to do but he just can't he just doesn't know how to stop the randomization up that may destroy Chuck random jump you can't find his footing it he couldn't get it started yeah can't he can't go he had a hard time that my momentum right now it a hard time getting started would he be able to get it started with Karen all when he just parish 30 Wow sucks to see him going like this 88888 it's bad enough that New York taking on new york yeah home home kill team kill friendly fire somebody got to go yeah somebody gotta go home you know I'm gonna pick the homie down making you know just baby ok I jumping mice confirm Oh too far to get the VC link Oh skip to my Lou oh no just like that a suicide Wow dinosaur up today yeah diamond is in perfect control oh those paws frames of using it I mean in a face by a plus for him though nice oh babe lovely that was nice there it is that's what i was saying earlier the one way to open up that man is to make him uncomfortable yeah you have to you have to take him out of his comfort zone yep that's one thing a lot of players do like you know that man he does do it a little rare is the jump back on west i will definitely definitely help them playing fang especially yeah and that's how you know he's not in his comfort zone if he forced him to actually jump like always but i was sitting there block for 30 seconds you know and I mean it does have that after the plot especially behind that poison yeah watch your health does deplete here we go man shine with all these stop the resources he could definitely make somethin happen here Oh skip to my Lou no get off me be reverse of the jump right in the corner ouch while he's getting something started don't back off and kitty all memento when he leaves the pod nothing shocking Kenny uh ghost would go through our years yet shoulder may be possible what get that was interested jumping oh I'm still alive magic pixel no bang us be trigger oh my god try to go and choke it up oh my god oh my god your own shine choking instead o bed with ya that wasn't a bad choice door but shine just wasn't it rain just just a slight bit of a tad bit out of rage stroke up crouch and his stand up with auto range he got him cuz he caught him crouching good good good good decision by the minion when he didn't condition about that here and there you go oh gee Shaun already doing that much better switching to count it so it's a total opposite of what happened man in witters it was the switch all that took place versus is Karen didn't switch to pookie and forces got men to choose God you know what does this could be a reverse cycle right here you know what he might just go to you might just go to go if he does lose that right here to set yeah my boo the meter those are solid rock I was solid that's what you call it get a perfect boy I might say that this is a bad match right here everything just goes on shines way he will be picking guy or guarantee maybe well I think that I put all his stock from good old US of A okay I Santa here I was shaken shaving all right hand he's properly spacing that's not true blood sure you can't actually critical art through that yeah when shows the crouching strong to ribbit he has one that's a true blonde I don't know which one is it dog right there right there that's not sure he can supertooth i knows he's able to activate realizing i hit yeah you can do a criticar do that okay I'm off shine is aware the whole nice we want to project offer was godlike Oh nobody's home I got him yo shimmy took our typical shine got the ship it to close it out weaving in okay managed characters all mistake we out alright let's see if your predictions are on point let's let's pick popeyes who throws vinyl records we won't fight already we need Popeye that that throws those vinyl records papaya Chuck Chuck vinyl records okay one time one time oh we decided my decisions decisions decisions okay okay okay carcass elec oh yeah joe said it mm-hmm I wonder shine is I don't even think China's worried about the man I think it's worried about that tables understand no time doesn't matter damn here we go nonetheless bow two games apiece well done Ben you go put a switch though and it could be a good switch cuz that guy was one of those characters that can slow down Karen there yeah there he goes there he goes with the shapes on the gelatin had banded Kyle America's own the candidate that the Capcom Cup champion hey canonical champion actually hear what he goes weel all right who's gonna draw first blood I'm catching ah enough or a donkey kick oh there it is neutral game booms to the face first attack went to should I

nothing in US after standing forward nice jumping but he recovered nice space all right no I mean starved of meter oh my god damn that could have been a serious turn around was shining to commit to anything he didn't believe you just go for the fishing reset into reset twice and that was just enough you know one thing that's scary about fighting Gao is that you always have to be aware was going office yeah I'll put you in that zone and that lullaby get you in that tunnel vision then you just have no answers but jump yeah so he doesn't oh there he goes the es punish nice punished okay come

this stuff smells amazing it smells amazing now sfv og by cali connection is a sativa dominant hybrid that is great for patients who need strong pain relief but don't want to be stuck on the couch as the name indicates this OG Kush relative originates from California San Fernando Valley although their names are are barely distinguishable sfv og cush is actually the Afghani cross child of s FV og sorry y'all that was hard to get through there SF vs San Fernando Valley Oh gene excellent stuff y'all excellent so let's get right in it and check it out I'm having such a hard time getting stuff out this morning okay there we go says I sold all the but let's go ahead and get right in it s FV is like man this stuff I mean it just it's get you super high but it's a good hot it's not the hydrant you wanna go to sleep on c4 waken Baken you need to buzz and like wake you up like not have you sleepy I don't need to be going back to sleep soon as I get up anywhere let's jump right into SF beat San Fernando Valley y'all see the shirt wake-and-bake thing if you haven't already subscribed to the channel go ahead and subscribe to the channel hit that post notification bell so you don't miss any of the cool videos and right now let's jump right in Oh No the expense rate on this one sit your lungs it's like it's a really low expansion rate hold on a second please it's a really low expansion rate someone hit your lungs it doesn't expand immediately but it expands enough and believe it or not that was the first hit one hit and I'm high it's not one hit of critter but I can feel the heart ready and it feels right here running across my forehead so to posi on this is really hot this I believe is um this has got to be a dispensary grain this can't be street grade well every once in a while you get some good street grade but I can't imagine anything being better than this you know what I mean so um dispensary grade to me it's always better than the street grade but this seems like it's a little bit of both anyway let's jump right in again quite nice quite lovely indeed so if you ever ever have a chance to get some FS FB grab some San Fernando Valley I highly recommend it's definitely I can't say it I've had a bad strand up this is actually my very first time smoking sfd I'd rather call the San Fernando Valley but I guess it's kind of a long name to label the bottle anyway let's jump right back in y'all it's got color Wow man I had to pause it because I went through a serious call from fit just now I should just grab my lungs was like wham wam whales alright so I'm back now one moment again alright so I was trying to explain the taste before I was so rudely interrupted by that cause it tastes kind of like when I first hit it it tasted like like gas and platinum like a platinum gas but it immediately soon as they get your lung is like you feel the buzz already this has got to be the top one that I've smoked so far on the channel now the booth the best way that I've ever smoked was the real granddaddy purp you can even take your head of it it's like you you could even take one hit man a half a hit you're choking but you was so high my second pick would have to be LA Confidential I'm always a fan of LA Confidential because of the flavor because the tightness of the density of the bud and just because of the high it's just you can't beat of LA Confidential but San Fernando Valley is really coming close I think it's got a beat but it's been so long since I had LA Confidential so this is really really tasty have some excuse me anyway I gotta film it's gonna be kind of a short video so you guys this is me chasing my dreams right here so I've been wanting to do YouTube for a long time and I always knew that I was gonna do something with weed always I've been smoking weed for probably about 43 years now 40 for some around here so I always knew that I was gonna do something with weed so this is my way to do something with weed and share with you guys to critique and smoke with you guys wake-and-bake style and give you my honest opinion on the other cannabis then I've been smoking um a lot of it's been street grade not too much uh dispensary grade we're gonna try to change that as time goes on right now we're don't we live in a state that it just became legal I just got my marijuana card so it's now legal for me to have it to possess it and bar from the stores I won't even borrow from the stores out from the dispensaries out here because the dispensaries out where I live at they're so weak now when I lived in California those dispensaries they got so much variety man I can't wait to this state gets up to par with that anyway um I hope you guys have a beautiful blessed and awesome day please tell all your friends about waking begging y'all help me grow the channel please so y'all have a blessed awesome day and be all you can be stay baked peace", "Eg63wyk8Dtg": "so this is a nug of life dispensary life flowers dispensaries to light mix with San Fernando Valley oh gee and the you know me me personally I'm a [ __ ] OG head and personally i think california produces one of the most potent nostalgic and potent buds known the man but I don't know I just love you know I'm saying any any cross with San Fernando Valley I don't know he's just a smell smoke is his way strong yeah yeah yeah even out in Denver I've never had a problem whenever I bought seven and oh [ __ ] Valley cook oh gee I mean oh gee not cuz and I want to just give a big thanks for everybody that's been rockin with me all along just supporting me you know I'm saying and the newcomers also you know I'm saying I see y'all I love the interaction you know I'm saying I love the subscriptions you know I'm gonna try to be more consistent now you know so I had to I had to take a break from Colorado and move well I'd like went out to Chicago for a couple of weeks like a month and a half really and it was fun well needed saw friends family you know I'm saying acquaintances all that man you know it was great when I say shout out to everybody in the seven oh eight seven seven three two six three zero you know who you are and it wasn't like you know I stopped smoking weed it is just I stopped broadcasting it I stopped making video so you know this is a day in a life you know ain't nothing change [Music] so one of the companies I'm truly a fan of right now is this company based out of California called loaded they do like pre-rolls of joints least this like this tobacco and joint paper mixture and tobacco leaf you know I'm saying of blunts or whatever and their hand broke crafted high quality you know called the bitty sizes you know I'm saying I wanna I want to get in contact with them I want them to sponsor me yeah I'm just joking but uh yeah shut up for them if y'all in the California area man y'all smoke on you know if y'all smoke joints or blunts check out loud it man check out ooh ooh don't mean a blonde on camera it's kind of difficult I haven't been practicing oh and I just dropped in why am i nervous so the things on the thing I'm noticing about this is you definitely get more the weed the flavor I got out of the the high hemp's right here is the regular one so of course I get them all I taste them the majority of the weed birds slow I'll notice it burn slower than the Swisher's are definitely it's not as it's not as harsh as the backwoods but it still has that blunt flavor you know me it's like a little bit the regular rat paper but then again it could be we all the gassy notes that I'm tasting it's a cleaner it's a cleaner blunt that's that's the the main thing I'm trying to express in this video your lungs ain't out over working with the tobacco smoke you know I'm saying it feels like my body's like I don't know doesn't like tobacco as much as I smoke blunts so this is kind of like a personal vlogging episode this is not like me to promote for a change here your guys's habits you know I'm saying I'm smoking you know I'm saying backwoods forever love Swisher's always a [ __ ] go-to first type of blunts I first learned how to roll it up get older my lungs don't need to work as much you know I'm saying so I'm liking this alternative I do have a filter on there so go on I think I put about point eight point nine of material in this to see if I can do some tricks down to the end and it's still smokeable you know I'm Sam more because more of a cohesive type of situation going on with these raps and with the Wii you know I'm not tired I can probably spoke another one of these", "cJKwm6HWgik":

years concentrates have become the biggest thing to happen to pop culture since well pot but as the popularity of Deb's continues to grow so the questions about the many forms these concentrates can take all concentrates are made through a process called extraction where marijuana's main ingredients are concentrated into an essential oil the main three solvents used to create Deb's are butane co2 and ISO isopropyl alcohol after extraction the resulting Deb's can look very different today we're taking a closer look at the three main types of concentrates shatter butter and oil oil is a gooey sticky liquid that can be kind of hard to handle while butter has a creamier consistency from being whipped finely shatter is smooth clear and solid all three can be used in vape pens and oil rigs but finding the right concentrate for you is a matter of preference shatter is the purest and most potent form because it involves a second extraction process that removes fats lipids and waxes this can result in over 80 percent THC however it also means that some of those tasty terpenes are removed therapies are responsible for marijuana's unique smell combined with THC terpenes create the flavor of the pot or concentrate your smoking butter retains more terpenes so it tends to be more flavorful but less potent with THC percentages in the 70s oil tends to be the least refined of the three this form also known as honey oil or butane hash oil can retain a full flavor profile however THC levels are generally less consistent unfortunately availability often determines what type of concentrate you smoke but hopefully this little guide helps those lucky enough to have a choice thanks for watching and stay tuned to hi x comm for more Deb related content including how to select a nail and the rig you [Music]", "J2YY7aJWhz4": "good morning it's September 14th Monday it's been about the last report it's time to look at these flowers they've done quite a bit of improvement in the last week misty morning once the CSIs I have to shake the plants off and perhaps blowing with the leaf blower to make sure there's no moisture in the interior of the flowers and we had a scare yesterday parcels two parcels over caught on fire burnt five acres was headed right at us but the local firefighters of the CDF killed it so we're very happy this money we are still here things have progressed nicely since last Monday still dedicated to using these flower initiators to accelerate the flowering and it appears to be working get in a little closer here in a moment get some more of these bud shots oh man that smells good this is heaven on earth down in here right now very very sweet fruity cushy smells wonderful my favorite that's our edge - it just finishes it off nicely so using the flower initiate er essentially and has the plants causes the plants to respond as if the night is two hours longer than it actually is so each evening as a night becomes longer the plants like it's even two hours longer than it is so they get very urgent need to complete their flowering process because they think they're running out of light but because the day is longer it's responding as if you're actually getting more light and a longer night at the same time this works especially well when you have it in a greenhouse with lighting and indoors you can do a 13 13 hour 13 11 hour day and the plants think it's a 13 13 day so we call that - 26 hour day you if past experience were to hold true these plants should be completed in the next two weeks may take a little while longer because there was that one and a half weeks where I didn't realize that the flower initiator was not plugged in Oh breeze just picked up so that's today's report September of 14th 2015 hope to have a lot more improvements in next week to show you here hey I have a great day enjoy life do you have the Medical Marijuana Blues when I was young it was just a sin but now that I'm all the medicine you'll spring

coming at you with another waxy taxi flower review as you can see in my 1/2 became a work at I got three more on the way they should be oh soon just I wanted some backups just didn't get around the word on when I would talked about it in a previous video finally got around to it can't wait to get them so I just got off work that's why I got the yellow shirt on every day got home was like you know what I want to smoke some weed but the only weed I got left I need to do reviews on so this is [ __ ] let's just do a review you know why not sorry if the fan is a little loud but so I've got my grinder got my pates and this is the the last big nugget I have so I wanted to save this one so that I could show you at least what the nut looks like or try to trying to figure the best way to get the camera to focus on it so from what I can see lots of light green you can see a bunch of the orange hairs through throughout inside here right there it's pretty pretty dense so we're just gonna break that off we're gonna roll it up we're gonna [ __ ] hit it I've had motor breasts before but I had it I had it in Detroit growers so I've had it before it's really really good but I want to try the same strains in different different branding different nests and you know some people are gonna their growth process is gonna be different things like that so you know the weed might taste a little different might be a little more potent you know [ __ ] like that so it's a hybrid it's a mix or a cross between s v sv f OG ya and chem dog cam top being one of the parent plants or whatever - Sour Diesel soak em dog is always a good go-to it's a good they've mixed that with a bunch of different stuff everything I've tried that someone said or come down it's typically good the child of Khem dog and SV LG mix together to make the motor breath and the child of motor breath is PI of the tiger according to the chart that I saw it has a citrus peppery herbal taste it says that it's supposed to be really potent so any novice smokers one that might only have like I want to get her once in a while you know instead of jumping straight into this and powering down the [ __ ] dude you know you might want to caution to the wind I'm telling you not to smoke it just you're a novice and you're a lightweight that the strain might be a little too powerful I didn't see anything about specifically but look on the jar for Detroit growers it says it's an indica hybrid so I'm gonna stick with or that one says and say it's in here with an indica hybrid we're just doing juvie I was debating whether or not to do a [ __ ] cone or not because I can do that a little quicker and anybody else that doesn't want to watch all this other stuff well hopefully you do because this is the time girls actually had something to really talk about because I was able to find you know information on the strain but typically when I'm doing this seven minute mark 6 minute mark give or take which isn't too bad especially if you actually enjoy listening to me talk about this [ __ ] as I said in a video a long time ago I'm gonna try to start coming up with some actual topics to talk about but I don't really want to get involved in all the politics and all that all the other yes it's just not worth it for my channel you say one wrong thing you know it could be channel suicide basically you know and I'm not trying to do that I'm not trying to get involved in all that [ __ ] so I'll leave that for the Facebook get in the [ __ ] Instagram and the [ __ ] like that and I'll keep my channel to the [ __ ] to the weed the music and eventually I will get back into doing some more art kids I've been super slacking on the music and art lately I don't think I've drawn anything in [ __ ] weeks which is sad but I've been working my ass off and I see some all I'm supposed to be a [ __ ] ridiculous here in Michigan 91 would like a real feel of maybe a hundred and two depending how cloud cover and [ __ ] like that worse sideways tongue right there on the drive yet I'm getting a lot of the citrus maybe a little bit of the peppery if I'm getting a little bit of all of it I'm gonna say that this is a really good flavor mix but it's saying that you're gonna get notes of earth and stuff like that in the description which the Leafly description is what I will put in the thing below cuz that's where I got my information from so that's the same [ __ ] that you know marking up on the board there too we're mind trying to memorize most of it so I don't have to keep looking away in searing at the board - tied or broken especially doubt way too much [Music] at this rate I should just pack the code try not to burn off all the [ __ ] weed and all that [ __ ] [Music] definitely getting the citrusy and the herbal the pepper is a little bit towards the end which almost gives a slight earthy taste ooh so yeah definitely definitely citrusy but not the citrus part isn't the overpowering part it's the peppery to herbal that take over at the end that gives you that little earthy undertone it it's not harsh and it's not sitting real heavy right there but you can definitely feel like a tiny little bit of light that had seemed to be all otherwise other than the earthy part would be the only negative for me which isn't a negative at all I'm giving wrong it's just people being picky about their we not picky I just like to certain flavor profiles pretty sure a lot of stoners can agree with that people prefer in diversity so it's only natural that certain people are gonna be like all I prefer you know citrus very sweet versus earthy woody find him standing with your Cologne you know some people like sweet sack others like Aramis your car and things like that that had just [ __ ] the super strong we're like being I'll be more like funny cabbie from that Tommy Hilfiger not come on Gigi oh it was Imani something code or something I forget the name but I came in a different bottle there's a Burberry one that I really like they're all like a softer sin it's not like super overpowering and strong to where you're gonna walk by and be like whoa God reeks you know you're gonna be like okay especially if you didn't put a shit-ton on you know it'd be more about oh okay it seemed iake was really really hot for a while there so everyone's got preferences - the whole point of that yeah motorbreath really good I didn't do it at the beginning so I'm gonna do it now but waxy taxi motor breath they got this [ __ ] I'm assuming they still got some blueberry pie some marshmallows some of the most uh some motor breath they had a couple other strains then there was one more I haven't tried yet if they have it in I'll get that soon but go to instagram @ underscore WT underscore delivery or waxy taxi delivery three one three something like that go to one of those and you can order this [ __ ] for yourself try it yourself come back have a discussion with me do whatever make your own assessment and let me know what how you feel about it because motor breath is really good I like it you know out of all the ones that are up here like obviously there's something I liked way better than that but that's it's just the way it is motor breath is really good though I would strongly recommend it for anyone that prefers a strong indica over a sativa must achieve a man obviously I've mentioned it in pretty much every video I'm definitely feeling it here heavy under the eyes dry eyes setting in not real dry mouth I'm not feeling tingly I'm not feeling dizzy or any of that [ __ ] so [ __ ] yeah also I'm gonna try to get my hands on unicorn dream from platinum vapes it's in the same type of boxing as purple champagne that I did a while [ __ ] ten months ago if you want to watch that go back watch it any of us appreciated great [ __ ] flavor but the unicorn unicorn dream is in the same type of box same hard work and [ __ ] and yeah I definitely wanna try it it looks [ __ ] phenomenal James Becker mentioned that once I mean somebody's mom that I know was looking for it the other day so we're on the search to get our hands on this so I can review it and as soon as I can do that I will make that happen that being said wipes taxi thanks for the [ __ ] killer smog always you guys come through hand in hand every [ __ ] time killer [ __ ] stated in a bunch of videos that I've smoked a lot of their [ __ ] you know I got probably sit on the bags that are theirs in the velvet pie at three times you can see that up there we take the bruiser and the peanutbutter breath these jars up here is one of theirs oh yeah although buds from them he draws from them too so depending on their menu on the day you can get your hands on some some really killer [ __ ] so peace out like sub on the logo comment below let's talk it's about catch you guys in the next video I appreciate you watching and happy smoking", "lzV1EHghPaM": "[Music] bow [Music] wow [Music]", "mlLFmpIjNZ0":

spring review on Jedi cush [Music] but Jedi cush is a cross between Death Star and SF GOG two very popular Springs to make a very delicious very nice powerful flavor so now let's get right into the smell for you guys now it's not that much but I tell you when you crack is when you kind of get more of the smell it's not very pungent but like I said when you crack one of the buds open [Music] definitely get like a diesel II smell very diesel love nice kind of citrus diesel II smell [Music] just not playing it like I like it but while I get a joint nice and rolls I have some close-ups that I hope you enjoy [Music] all right as you can see by the close-ups guys very frosty nuts like frosty covered in trichomes my favorite thing about these nuns are probably the red hairs I mean it it's very dark orange it's almost red makes my butt look very nice but a very nice note that's like perfectly dry the nice snap see we've got the joint rolled up if you brought papers smoking way too much back woods lately guys yeah guys whether you've got wax or bus and hey lit up get into it wait for actually let's get a dry hit so we can kind of get definitely along with yeah that uh all right at these least taste very good but let's on taste when it's I'll actually live you've got wax or but guys in hello [Music] exhale harsh not an expanding [Music] very nice lady I said some some weeds are a little harsh [Music] you know that there's a very smooth taste [Music] very [Music] [Music] hi definitely one of those that's a good friends omnia good for loss of appetite if you need a we need to get hungry if you need the munchies definitely one of those good for PTSD or depression because it's definitely one of those uplifting strains jealous is an indica dominant hybrid so it does have that body relief but it also has that cerebral hi that's kind of unexpected but it creeps up on you and it's pretty good what are you smoking or you know I like to know we smoking on some Jedi touch have you spoken to the dead I push what did you think of it my first time trying it I have tried Skywalker og bribe that tried Death Star so out of the whole like Star Wars strange Skywalker and Jedi push for the only one time try I know Death Star originated in Ohio so originated the pretty close definitely a smooth tape like I said [Music] would definitely be an indica you could like smoke in the middle of the day doesn't give me that couch lock but it just gives you the body relief so honestly it's a pretty good strain if you want the body relief but you don't want the couch lock you don't want like the tiredness that you get this would definitely like I said gives you that up higher [Music] all right you start to review get up here [Music] I'm gonna have to give it a low six out of ten guys oh it does have a good smell crack it open just doesn't have that pungent smell back I personally look forward and weed but it's it smells good don't get me wrong [Music] tastes very tasty very singing tastes so I'm gonna have to give in a good 8 I love the taste something you can smoke to the face like I am [Music] you don't get that harshness [Music] look we can give it a ten out of ten nice-lookin does frost speed or dark orange it's almost like it's red but [Music] I'm gonna also have to give it a 10 out of 10 because I mean I love that it gives you that body relief but it also gives you the nice bright like up lifting positive high [Music] it's definitely a strange people smoke before you go to work [Music] over [Music] favorite strange it's pretty good I like the nugs I

contest them anything but they can't we test them ever but that's it that's how teachers are is there's no team Jimmy Hoffa today they don't work for Amazon okay yeah their own private company yeah just go to next so yes I'm gonna do that because it's y'all company not tell the brakes either it's all girls but if you [ __ ] up you gonna lose your job yeah cuz they go to drug test you if you do something something gets [ __ ] up they're gonna test you that's what they do that's how almost all jobs think bigger like they have insurance policies just make them do this well they lure you in with the ability to make more money but that that's how they get out of paying for insurance for these drivers that's the difference from the car that's just one have to pay for the drivers zero we've it what do you mean not to pay for the drivers the drivers making money they pay their drivers but it's didn't 99 yes but it takes all responsibility away from Amazon that's my point most of elekid you know run all of it yeah no they've already proven it they've taken the core cuz people they are killing people yeah like like they said the difference between Amazon and like ups is you can see how many trucks and how many accidents that UPS is in all their their whole shipping Network you can see the go they report to the government like it's all reported I don't how many you think there's no [ __ ] there's no way to know how many Amazon [ __ ] kill anybody well what's crazy is I hear those [ __ ] don't know how to drive a little Sam trucks at like don't because don't do their dicks I run a street where GPS doesn't particularly work greatest like it works a house are too long and I've got that reporter from lifting and we're drivers they're like yeah it sounds like your house is right here which is in front of that house and I had to actually use the address and I'm here that happen to me too when I first moved in there but like in the morning out here beep beep beep beep beep that's them backing up they passed the house they don't know how to drive they're not like you couldn't walk the three houses with that package you're gonna back out yes well thank you sir well yeah and we're that much louder yeah those trusts will be be obsolete about five years probably they only be using trucks no more not for that not throws neighborhood deliveries a massage will be everywhere you you always will be within five to six miles of Amazon [ __ ] that's why he's doing it man I'm Samaras you know they don't do it like like post offices why well he would have their land like where you have Amazon pickup centers he does he got there really yeah they'll pick up your package from that spot up there yeah everybody doesn't want a package come up to their house we'd wandering it up from Amazon to Cole's full disclosure it's least it's least six grams of my lead that leaves no more than that mm is he brought at least six grams so and then Lou lit up like 12 joys if he had a mall rolled up yeah no never had left that home I thought so too this is all about taste because it was your old but higher higher so I shout out to dude shoutout to do all day rest in peace buddy up in smoke just rub put on this day bud rest rest in peace up in smoke the other thing the right on when they put it on Facebook are but his death I'm here so people would come in the picture they chose the water was great Madison area service me too I thought it was dead for a minute who was a Lewis ID and I'm probably gonna regret it so I'm gonna have some counties from breeze that's after this to kind of flush it out very little know that she almost got no food at all what you do not like you listen you gotta eat the healthy food you can't not eat food you have to have food oh no I'm eating food but a lot of it I mean enough though and I know you live this life you can eat and I'm Nicolas mushroom drinks at my printer that do it dark it's uh mr. Murray they gave me and Wow mushroom coffee is just a second go-round right yeah no it's a second this is the one that we thought you had we thought we had but we have eighteen yeah - definitely another 18 but now I got some deadhead to see it's coming oh really yeah a saint shot out the same oh yeah two branches oh that's it and then I think I got up I think I might have got the survey a TS for coffee and leave I'm glad the wait a while but I do a real wait a while oh you don't want to [ __ ] pop those oh yeah of course actually I just got them so I had some future stock well that's what you got to do yet thank future you know being super accident Oh trying to rap the podcast you got your score yeah yes sir I mean it's shark it's got some sting to it there's not much to me just very sharp almost the point where it's kind of metal II first inhale at least a little no we just kind of scares me a little bit but it could be a gimmick I don't taste the difference between usually between Hydra or not Hydra so that could be the hydro coming there's it's all the human lean and mercy we're seeing benefit carefully no [ __ ] anything else to bring up the complexity of the flavor and it looks like [ __ ] yeah you see look at that I wish isn't a bad thing to be a bad thing no it doesn't grade in' I was a Spartan after the second hit I don't even know why i hitted that third time I really want to hit this time I just hit it but I wrote sharp chalky for [ __ ] it I still have to wait better [ __ ] tonight copies the word I like how you said sharp cuz the first arrow sharp arrow sharp chalky for well start absolutely aspired for those three statements is you sadistic believer that a lot of wheat has like that's what people think good wheat is is a shark man continue the paragraph that was this I says [ __ ] it I smoked away by her [ __ ] today but first talk I I didn't really like it but when it came on a second time it was better and when it came on the third time it was better so I was thinking for but end up being five and a half ok which is ok it ain't great it expanded pretty quick I was confident and I got high really quick for not having smoked yeah cuz the way the package says it reads yeah it reads are produced by exclusive Brands LLC packaged by trust septa LLC and if you read that one its packets produced and packaged by the same company which is the trust summer okay so I'm assuming that receta is the actual grow up and that exclusive brands LLC is just like a caregiver who turn their stuff cuz you could I could take my stuff and turn it into the [ __ ] these real ops right and they as long as it tests test only proof yeah clean here fine so you can use it so I think this was caregiver", "-EywE3C8TQo": "hey what's good everybody jay ping here checking in respect my region.com back with justin cures for part two of the buddies brand west coast we tour review series for this episode we've got the three bears og cannabis derived terpenes distillate cartridge i've heard it's really good the roommate sells it at mother nature's remedy where we got it it's really delicious so 91.98 on the total cannabinoids and again since i'm an employee of buddy's brand justin here is going to be the official reviewer on behalf of respect my region for this case so thc at 88.5 this is a high potency product brother this is high potency 88.5 yeah that's crazy 91.98 basically 92 cannabinoids i mean terpenes listed on the back coming in hot 3.3 yep uh we got the top three are beta-mercene beta-caryophyllene and beta uh osamine i believe that's how you say it osamine muscle i don't know whatever 0.26 on that one point three seven on the karyophylline and 1.62 on the mercy which makes total sense uh since it's an og three bears og is the string uh i have smoked a different i'm sorry i vaped a different batch of this probably about a month or so ago um and it was around 88 on the total award-winning so we're gonna check it out cannabis single source distillate are you ready yeah i feel like uh you know i'm not a big you know pen smoker but i have definitely tried lots lots just about every brand because it's either been handed to me you saw or give it to me or exactly live residentially like even back in the day when it goes to you know where you don't even want to talk about those times medical days yeah medical you never knew before testing and all that um so but right away i look at the color and i'm like yo this is poe because that color just looks it's so nice very beautiful shade of gold that's for sure so you can just look at the color i'm like this is going to get me uh probably pretty stoned this is good i feel like it's going to be harsh though you think so yeah but what i do want to know though is what's what's the cross on this three bears oh gee though that's what's also kind of missing is because that would usually tell you right the genetics information we want to know i think as consumers we all want to know what g's can vary what what is the original strain right there's there's ogs that are like they come out purple there's og's that are very you know stoney there's you know it ranges it says ingredients distilled kettle oil and canna terps that's it simple as that that's it inhale until desired effect is achieved i always recommend four to six seconds system is safe if you're experienced obviously you know i'll do it around the middle minimum i always also like to say if you're less you know experienced go a little shorter we're talking high potency some good clouds right there shout out to buddy's brand battery okay not harsh at all i was actually expecting to be very harsh wasn't harsh do you get the terps i mean yeah that's like smoking a bowl of lg right there wow yeah that's really nice wow almost almost could trick somebody like if you didn't show me the box and said this was live resin i i could have got dude really could have did me are you just let me try this are you saying yes yeah are you are you thinking yeah no i'm saying no i'm saying that i like i said you might have dude me no i'm not saying you would but i'm saying because it is just it's not harsh and it has very good the terps are like there you can tell it's og but um it does have that it does have that limonene and it does have that carryoffaling not my main i guess it does that but then once once i'm like sitting with it i can tell it's this because the vapor is just different it's different than libraries it doesn't have that sweet or you know like live resin has a rounded hit to the end of it versus something sharper yeah just sharper um that's what i need to do too i always do the hit uh out the nose to really get the turf beam profile second hit here this is your score out of 10 hit opportunity so we review for respect our reason review you know presentation appeal color taste potency wow more information would you recommend your experience i'm definitely stunned i'm definitely stoned and man that knows would you recommend i would to somebody who's a big distillate fan yeah that is that this usually ranges from between 37 and i'll keep you 42 that'll keep you lit at disneyland i'm telling you that much yeah this [ __ ] is potent let me hit this up later i feel a head change i feel it behind my eyes like making my eyes lower i feel on the second hit i was like i'm like going back to what i said i'm like no you couldn't do me you can't do me on it like getting it the second time i'm like yeah you can tell that's some really fire disney what are you thinking really exciting really clean for a distillery pen i'm like man that's i'm surprised uh more people aren't talking about uh i want to ask you that like is you know do those are they flat whoever has them for the club oh really wow okay okay people i just i guess i way more than that yeah and and um certainly sometimes i even get like like what you would call like sweats yeah and i'm not so i think this is just really really good distillate you're right yeah you said it a couple times really really good oh hi i can tell i can tell if i were there's no mirror in front of me but my eyes are red for sure for sure right now um let's let me see from color to to overall to the packaging you know once again hey let me know what the three bears og crosses but man i i'd suggest that over anything when it comes to just a pencil that's uh i don't know how else to give it anything but um nine club 9.5 9.5 a little bit more information could help i can't remember well i appreciate you sharing that review my man you know i personally have reviewed so many of these buddies discipline cards i've tried them i've smoked got 100 100 of them at least and i think as of recently you know whether it's the extraction or the source material i think you know we're just seeing a lot more consistency um but yeah you know adding the strain the genetics and some of that information will be a key addition and let me let me say that that this is very honest for me because this is i've tried i mean i could just name like a bunch and gone to so many events where they're letting you try this try this try this trying whatever flavor they're coming out with and again and again it's like a lot of coffee in the sweats you know a lot of harsh products a lot of harsh product exactly and i believe that's where it comes down to you know single source over multi-source i guess right i don't want to see anything and that's what really sets this apart this product apart because you know it's three bears og when you're smoking it it's like i said tasting a bowl of og kush so hats off to that because i appreciate that that's that's really good for some distilling

collaboration with a very good friend of mine sir skunks a lot on my side I'll be trying out a beautiful strain from over here in the valley the SFB OG Kush the nugs have a bright green tone to them and a few deep purple undertones the smell on this is almost like gasoline but with the deep og citrusy lemony scent you know all right well I'm gonna pack a bowl and pass it on to see what he's got down NSD this strange virgin even with its arms and growth is a sativa classic clone oleum from the six by nine area it has an absurdly sweet stench that moans its name hard with it's like an animal stink match with berry don't be too judgmental find it I'm gonna give it a try pretty strong turnout was fair on March 20th a San Diego City Council finally passed an ordinance with guidelines for the cooperation of medical marijuana dispensaries under state guidelines 215 the controversial through the implementation has yet to be addressed by the mayor the initial flavor that goes into you very simple expanding smoke in your chest like the og tastes almost like fuel e gasoline I don't know you know the exhale smells all kinds of piney Foresti sweet tones you only need a very small amount and you'll be very medicated with the sfv OG Kush oh man super strong very tasty the buzz length is really long like two maybe three and a half hours I love the strain it's not gonna tear you down maybe after an hour you'll be able to start working and doing all the other thing again but the first hour you're just gonna be in your couch like whoa what just [ __ ] happen all right guys peace out go check out surf sconce a lot don't forget to be high all the [ __ ] time because it's awesome you", "uvKl1XMpPE4": "you Oh G stands for overgrow comm all the stuff that came off of that so it's from that one website there was more knowledge about cannabis put on that one website over a five-year period then the rest of the world has now combined when that place went down in a cop took that information out they rip the heart out of like the whole movement for a long time for what we know for true knowledge OD cous is surrounded in a bunch of mystery right now and I know most of people that was involved in getting it made it's one of those things that happens spontaneously when I was II went down three or four breeders such as myself and a couple of other people's best stock was just used to make that and it's really like skunk number one it's so truth true breeding now so many people have it certain zico zico she's also open-ended it can be bred with it doesn't have the Terminator gene in it it's been bred in so many different projects now that that gene spread across the scene that it's gonna be hard to remove it my problem with it is if it tends to harm me very easily just like the train wreck one it's like it really wants to show our Methodism it's that of its genome and I personally don't like working with them there's a couple variants of it that are alright but myself but what you're trading in yield and what you have to do in hormone tricks to get the plant to do it through the other ones do the same thing but the pedigree on it is really hidden a mystery of BS and I refuse to play along with you I know three different rumors on it but I can tell from smoking it what I think is in it and when we get done with these DNA tests in the future I'll let you know for sure what's in it in my experience I've seen OG Kush grown in urban environments you can grow it in and in some I didn't think he could be growing it's more with it about finding your own phenotype that's why there's so many different variants of it and then people cropped it with a hundred different other things as well but really it's about getting a hundred or Turner seeds and find that one plant we like out of it because it tends to hurt me for one and four to meet some of them what a fox tail and there's a bunch of the variants of it that have problems so it really depends on where you get your clowns or your seeds that's one of their ones it's mostly grown from calm to I've not seen too many people sell in other states I was in Cruces voted out of 50 days and I've seen it but out of 70 days depends on how much light you put on it how much co2 you give it it's one of those ones its metabolism it's very critical to how much yield you get and how dense it is and not plastic but and then how much dark you give it has to do it how much crystals on it LG cushions another one of the ones were it use did you get what you you know about it if you do it right you do everything right you can get some decent yields if you don't it's your crappy order that's why so expensive I've seen people go out see a green one bud I've seen outdoor OG Kush plants ever elected veg for six months Oakland treaties you know it really depends on how much you know how to put the hormones in and the vitamins to the plant because really the light feeds into point [Music]

it's kimbob 91 cross the San Fernando Valley og cush so two really good strains two well known strains and this is a really good strain as well perfect for your waking baixa just wonderful to whole entire day great day time medication it's got a nice uplifting energetic height to it very uppity and euphoric in fact it's kind of focused it's got a really nice stimulating cerebral high that'll kind of have you just zoomed in on whatever it is that you're doing you know whatever whatever is in front of you wherever you're into you'll be on that and I took this with me on my hike up to the Lost Dutchman wonderful trip pain relief the whole entire time payment was great with deadhead OG so is the hi everything seems to kind of stand out more it's kind of like a sense it's I've been elevated sights and sounds they all seem to kind of stand out just a little bit more and it's wonderful wonderful for being outdoors and just taking an all of nature anything that's giving off good vibes you'll pick that up and it's really positive very uplifting the only thing I found is that there are munchies there is dry mouth cottonmouth dry eyes and the crash and the crash isn't even that bad from what I found the crash is pretty much only when you kind of take a break once you stop you're done and you sit back you kind of feel that relaxation just kind of take over absorb you you're very calm and mellow and it kind of eases you into a night's sleep it's really nice I really enjoyed it and it's something that I could probably use on a daily basis seems like a nice everyday type of strain to have mmm just because of all those things that it has and can take care of great for anxiety stress depression irritability nausea pain relief and even insomnia because I even medicated with this at night and I didn't have no problems of sleeping either so it's a really really great strain I was able to pick these buds up from healthful life Mesa that's where I usually go really nice I usually try to find some big buds just as I can show them on the cameras people can see get a more closer look at what it looks like but with these popcorn buds they're very useful very useful for being outdoors when you're out on the go when you're medicating their way around because they're like a little pre-made servings perfect one go hitter so you know just pack this in and with buds like little popcorn but you don't have the huge stems in them you know so for me perfect I love these kind of things for when I go out on my little adventures and whatnot you know my adventures don't even have adventures I'm a hermit so fricken going to get my oil change as an adventure and it is always go walking around I love it working on that car try to explore different places you know but that's just what I do so very fun strain very great strength to enjoy and very sociable really great I would totally get this again the flavors are all in there once you first pick it up out of the bag it's got a nice earthy sweetness to it once you get this sucker open it's like a got a nice little tiny citrusy pungent flavor to it really great all the earthy smells are and flavors are in here just absolutely wonderful I love it I haven't been a kid in like a few days because after my hike I got sick got a little cough lungs are still recuperating so I'm checking this out right now wonderful

of OG Kush there's Tahu oh gee there's SIV og there's ghost OG just to name a few now we're looking at Derby poison Durbin poison a pure sativa it originates from South Africa out of the port city of

heed Wow did that open my chest oh boy that was a good dad Oh huge logs expansion on that one huge I literally felt the air come back oh yeah my goosebumps have got goosebumps look at how do you like that yes that's what I was saying I honestly would say those with breathing and respiratory issues I wouldn't even go after this one I mean it's got me coughing like this daddy's up there I'm sweating

heard the word groans yeah I'm sure you've heard the word Crohn's over there on YouTube I'm a lifelong sufferer of it and unfortunately before you say well what about pharmaceuticals I tried pharmaceuticals in the past and I'm just taken out of my house in an ambulance I was dead from a pharmaceutical thanks to an anaphylactic shock of a medical marijuana patient now one of the reasons I'm out here doing what I'm doing is to show people other fellow patients who have never tried products who are thinking about coming into our program or trying Candice for the first time here's an idea of what's going to happen when you try the product now I stress it I stress it all the time everybody is going to get an effect that's going to be a little bit different it's going to be a little bit wider maybe a little bit varied however the overall idea is what you see here does relax the body it is very strong to understand this okay when I said that thing hit me and gave me like goose bumps the top of my goose bumps I felt like everything in my body and then do this after that coughing was done Wow I'm breathing great as you can see it's just it's that initial inhale it's that initial expansion which will give ones who have asthma ones who have breathing problems respiratory issues you you know there's too many other products out there ones that are in the program once that don't have those issues okay you will not be disappointed in this at all if you want something that's going to medicate you if you want something that's gonna do it literally instantly taste great as a beautiful flavor both inhale and even the exhale going off on the sides of the tongue bit in the back of the palate yeah I mean again towards locking OG Kush we're talkin Durban poison you know like

"vPDFXw6hHeY": "hey y'all trevor here with ready leaf and today we're gonna be diving into our 510 vape cartridge i know it's christmas eve so we're gonna stay somewhat festive today i'm gonna have to go and plug in those christmas lights to uh cheer us up but for the time being we got something from tabletop we're gonna be diving into the 90s oh gee kush honestly i've been a big fan of any of these old-school style strains the 90s og kush is definitely one that has intrigued my interest you guys let's uh get into this 510 vape cartridge after i go ahead and plug in those christmas lights but for the time being cheers y'all and i'll see you on the other side of this intro [Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome back you guys and just like that we've got the room feeling just a touch more festive so as i said in the intro we are diving into table tops tabletops 510 vape cartridge the 90s oh gee kush as a person who's been a really big fan of the 90s og kush lately and the overall not the 90s og kush just the kush flavor lately um the 90s variant so the uh not 90 what is it 96 the pre pre-98 bubba kush i know i've got the seeds over here i know i know i'm not talking craziness yes the pre-98 bubba kush i just want to make sure i got the ear right the pre-98 bubba kush i am a incredible incredible massive fan like incredibly massive fan of that strain that pre-98 bubba kush honestly is the best pheno of that strain that i've come across it hits the heaviest for me the flavor is the most enjoyable and i've come across and enjoyed a lot of the og cush strains so i'm curious to see if that 90s variant is going to be more enjoyable for me just like the 98 bubba kush was but for that we have to dive to find out that you guys jesus i haven't smoked yet today and i'm already [ __ ] rambling and not having a good start to this uh this review so we're gonna go ahead and we're just gonna get into where i'm comfortable which are that uh actual portions of the review instead of that pre-ramblings that i tend to get myself into a little bit of trouble sometime because i just go on and on and on and on and that tends to happen about halfway through the review where i just go on and on and on and on but let's not do that today let's get into this review for those of you who haven't been here before and don't know what to expect you're gonna get a lot more of what the past little intro has been as well as the information that comes off of this individual package as well as the information that we have off of the ontario cannabis store we're going to use that as our base for today and then we go ahead and we rock it through our two 510 thread batteries we've got a vuber battery right here and then a g pen battery we rocked the uber first and then the g pen before we go ahead and run it through all three temperatures of these batteries again but we do it through our two glass rigs here we score the batteries individually for the cart on the initial pass and then when we go through the glass they get scored as a unit as a cohesive unit between the six rips after that we go ahead and we score it out of the high and then we finish it up with the overall the total and highest score that this cartridge is going to be able to get is 40 today and that means 10 for each portion of this scale one piece of vital equipment that i just about forgot to grab it's going to be our hemper adapter this is what we use to connect the cart to the rig but with that information powering you guys let's get into this cartridge so the 90s og kush from tabletop it came in with a thc total of eighty percent a cbd total of zero point zero three percent and a package date of october fourteenth twenty twenty so it still is a relatively new cart on the market so for those of you guys that don't know tabletop and ness and the mtl companies are all going to fall under the green organic dutchman so we did cover that rotterdam and the ripple we're going to dive into even another green organic dutchman based product right here in this tabletop 90s og kush cartridge but before we do that let's go over into the ontario cannabis store site and cover the info on here so the price that they have on the ontario cannabis store is going to be 39.95 for the half gram cartridge now about this product the 90s og kush distillate from tabletop comes in a 0.5 gram milliliter filled cartridge compatible with 510 thread batteries it is an indica dominant hybrid with high thc and notes of fuel skunk and space and spice dang flavor profile courtesy of limonene carefully and maracinine the flower has pulled through an advanced ethanol extraction process and these emission tested cartridges features a proprietary ceramic coil enhanced airflow and glass housing all table top distillates do not contain added solvents pigments fillers or waxes major bonus right 90 og kush it's got legs so huge huge benefit and already scoring major points for me ceramic core i love me the ceramic-based cores the verse original cartridges are ceramic base and so are the pure sun farms and those cartridges in my personal preference have been some of the best on the market for overall cartridge performance and um flavor coming off of it but with that information ready you guys let's crack open this container and get going with this full oh we just ripped off the pull tab so let's get this cartridge out you guys and uh see how tabletops 90 ogs kush is gonna do cheers and i'll see you on the other side of this herbage scale intro [Music] welcome back you guys looks like we're going to be able to get this thc sticker off of here and you know exactly what we're going to do with it once we do come on i know you want to come off there we go we got that sucker off we're going to add it to our growing ring of stickers on the torch i honestly don't know why i started doing this but at this point why not continue to uh to add to it as we go through each of these reviews but overall cartridge look is really nice it's got more of the tweed look and feel with that nice round mouthpiece the white to balance off the silver is really nice i do um i do miss having the band that lets you know what exactly you are smoking on but this coil does have a six port on the base versus some of the more typical four ports so you see those cotton ports just inside there this one does have six versus them a little bit more common fours that we have seen on some of the other companies so that definitely is interesting to see how this cartridge is going to function in comparison to the other ones but to start it off we've got the lowest temp on the vuber vubis battery the uber battery this one goes green blue red and then our g pen is blue green red before we finish it off at that highest temp but we've got some rips to dive into and i am quite curious to see how this 90 og kush tastes you guys so for the time being let's uh let's dive into this and start scoring this cartridge cheers and i'll see you on the other side okay so initial flavor on that that first draw really smooth very light overall flavor but it does have a nice heavy settling flavor on the exhale that complements the smoothness of the draw on this cartridge so very well the the mouthfeet mouthpiece has a really nice almost kind of grip to it so when you put it to your lips you don't feel like it's going to slide out overall a nice enjoyable experience so far for the flavor side of things i'm getting a nice light lemon hint but it definitely has more of that grassy almost kind of gassy touch to it as well the the higher the temperature goes i the feeling that i have a feeling that the higher the temperature goes the more we're going to lose on that sweet side the more we're going to lean more into that kind of gassy grassy cross but the only way we're going to find out you guys is by diving in and trying it out we've got the second temperature ready to go let's get into this and see how it does you guys cheers okay guys so let's second temperature and flavor coming off of this cartridge it was really nice you started to get a nice strong full-bodied lemon flavor and started to get little and light hints of that pepper and spice combo and it worked really well within the two and it actually developed quite intensely at the end to kind of give you a nice lemon pepper cross which was incredibly enjoyable and honestly left me quite pleased with the final extent to this if if these og kush cartridges lean towards more this lemon lemongrass citrus base you guys i am going to be loving this cartridge for the entirety of it and can't wait to dive into the flower but if she goes on that pepper trail which i have a feeling it could be on this higher temp or when the oil within that point within the actual ceramic coil it's heating every time if that starts to go a little bit peppery or a little bit rancid we could be losing some score quite quickly because it's it's one of those flavors that it either does incredibly well consistently or it starts to [ __ ] the bed when you add a little bit more flavor or you try to get it a little bit more intense you guys so let's see let's see where it goes if it goes on the good or it goes on the bad the only way we're going to find out by smoking what we have so let's go ahead crank that highest temp back and give our score for the vuber battery cheers and i'll see you there [Music] okay guys so as i switch this over to the g pen the last taste from the uber was quite disappointing i'm not gonna lie it was a little bit of a letdown in comparison to the other two you had more of a really light almost acidic pepper kind of flavor it wasn't uniquely lemon per se but more so just kind of citric in general like very citrusy leaning still it was a decent flavor nice enjoyable final kind of experience for that uber battery and it has me excited for the g pen because i see that the potential for the cartridge should put off a really intense and heavy flavor because of the larger ports and just have it be more potent i'm thinking is going to be the benefit for the g pen over the uber but saying that i'm gonna give the vuber an 8 out of a 10. it did have that much of an enjoyment and kind of uplifting flavor to it that i can enjoy and with the g pen i'm expecting the same or better honestly but the only way we get to find out about that is by smoking our way through it we've got the first rip ready to go let's dive into it and see how she does you guys cheers and i'll see you on the other side okay guys at this point that pepper is starting to become a little bit more dominant but i was right about the ease of the haul through the g pen you can get a lot bigger haul and a lot stronger of a haul through this just due to the larger ports on this battery versus our uber battery it's not a big like a big big change in the sense of the actual size but it makes a major difference when you're hauling through here it's crazy the amount of the the size difference between the g pen and the vuber and the clouds if you were to go blinker to blinker the timeout on this one is longer and the ports are bigger so you're able to get more in and that also affects the flavor because i got a lot more pepper this time with that intensity so the pepper starts to creep in a lot more when you're pulling more of the oil through as well as the lemon flavor had more that lemongrass flavor less of the lemon citrus flavor so it it changed a little bit still all in all that sweet lemon pepper cross is definitely what i enjoyed now we're gonna go ahead try it on the second temp see how it hits see how it holds for that flavor and um just enjoy it you guys cheers and i'll see you on the other side okay guys so that second rep honestly was just a weaker version of the first experience with the lemongrass flavor and that kind of sweet flavor but the pepper ring like that a little bit of that black pepper burn you get on the back your throat that stayed consistent with the um the last experience that it just seems to be building upon that so at this point we're starting to lose a little bit of that lemon flavor we're starting to almost see a little bit of the breakdown of the oil within that that uh the heating compartment of this vape and it actually is losing a little bit of its flavor which is a big downside of doing these reviews and stacking this many hoots like a uh a dozen hoots through the uh the cartridge you guys but we got the highest temp set on here it might just be that voltage maybe not agreeing with this cartridge but we've got it set on the highest let's see if we get a more intense more enjoyable flavor before we move on into the rigs because there we pack six hoots in boom boom boom boom boom boom let's get these these uh the first half a dozen rips done and over with and the g pen a score out of 10 you guys cheers and i'll see you on the other side okay guys so the g pen is going to end up getting a 7 out of 10. and it did the same thing that the uber did but the difference is that the vuber did it on the way up so the flavor increased with every rip and it got more enjoyable more intense and it just it left you with kind of an almost endless expectation at the end where the g pen had just started to degrade it started to break down every hoot got a little bit harsher a little bit more a little less enjoyable each time and that's really why the g pen is gonna get a point less is because it just it leaves at the end of the session if you're feeling uplifted enjoyable like you're going off feeling better about your day there's extra points to be earned but if it kind of leaves you going what the [ __ ] you're gonna lose a couple points so that's the difference between the 897 with the vuber and the g pen but now now we get to dive in the glass and just rip both apart because this is either gonna do incredibly well and we see improvements and nice intense flavor or it just shits the bad so let's see uh whether we're gonna get a a warm feeling in our hearts or a warm feeling around our thighs you guys dive in and find out cheers say get ripped folks you know how it goes down we preheat on that third cheers okay guys so through the uber egg it had still that nice strong intense lemon flavor the really citrus output overall and it's just i don't know why the g pen can't do that is the larger port is the fact that it's just a different voltage match up with the cartridge i do not know but that uber battery is slowly starting to become my personal favorite for uh a lot of these new carts that are coming out and that's that was not something i was expecting you guys but we got the g pen she's still a nice good old girl we're gonna run her through the three reps on 420 rig because uh it's about that time guys so let's see how she holds up and how she hits through the glass with the jeep head but so far the uber's doing quite well really really well blended lemongrass lemon pepper cross but for the time being let's uh start ripping some bowls cheers okay guys we are on that last rip let's go ahead preheat the [ __ ] and dive into it cheers okay guys so the glass is gonna end up getting a seven out of a ten for its score i'm i'm just gonna tell you right now we uh we aren't going to be using the g pen for this cartridge anymore that that smurf blue looking thing was the reason for that seven out of the uh out of the out of the glass the uber in this cart the fact that the silver and silver match up all sexy and like i think these two are meant for each other because this cartridge is absolutely delicious through this pen and i cannot get enough of it especially that lowest hemp even on the medium we get that nice calm overwhelming kind of blend of that pepper and the lemongrass kind of cross i'm it's surprising that i don't get much of a kind of a kush experience from this but it's more kind of that lemongrass and pepper cross it leans me more towards the white lemon from thumbs up kind of an experience and honestly a strain that i am so excited to try and flower the the flavor that this cartridge puts off has some major potential for just a really nice and enjoyable smoke through the flower if it has this lemon and pepper blend of flavors but with that being said we're going to move on to the high which is going to be a 7 out of 10. and i'm going to be honest with you guys this is just an amazing high that's too weak for me to score well that's honestly the best way i can describe this it's a really nice and heavy mood enhancer but it doesn't have that extra little for me to get that like that big goofy smiling joking around kind of feel for an indica this is definitely more uplifting more okay let's get up and do [ __ ] kind of a smoke for me it is a massive improvement for mood and for just overall um more the mental kind of i just don't want to do [ __ ] um when it comes to the body doesn't even touch it like it is a 100 cerebral type of strain i'm finding with the vape which isn't a bad thing it's that perfect combination of having a nice heavy body stone from flour and then adding this to top it off and a 7 out of 10 is really going to be there because i want more i just want more of this i want more of everything that it has to offer and i want to experience what type of body high it has and i have a feeling that the flower is going to provide that type of experience for us and it's definitely one we'll be diving into next month i have it set aside i'm really really interested in trying it but it will be a january-based flower and if you guys want to go and vote the mr writer leave page is the place to go and vote because well instagram shut down the main page for the time being so we are going to try and grow up the the backup page and grow page a little bit more as well as uh i've hopped on cannabis you guys if you want to check me out there but for the time being you guys this strain overall did quite well a 29 out of 40 for its final score it really only lacked the intensity of the flavor through the g pen when it came to the actual cart in and of itself so the honey sticks the elf sticks or any of the ones you find in your vape kit boxes i have a feeling will match up with this cartridge really well just because they are the little bit of the smaller ports now i can't speak on the voltage side which ones are going to work best the g pen's biggest downside i've i'm feeling is the ports because of the intensity of that flavor like i said it's either going to complement it or it's going to [ __ ] it over it [ __ ] it over so that's the biggest grief i have is there is too much with the g pen it needed to be throttled back just a hair but 7 out of 10 still really enjoyable i and honestly through the g pen i would still sit down and smoke it it's just more sips versus hauls on the uber so 20 7 out of 10 for the high 29 out of 40 for the overall it did quite well and tabletop you've impressed me and ceramic coils thank you so all i've got to say for that is thank you but for the time being let's wrap the sucker up hope you guys enjoyed up in the corner is going to be my logo you hover over that you click that subscribe button and the bell notification system anytime one of

cake batter this is the BAMF extractions vamp ODG and cake batter so this is their house og and it's a live resin cake batter and yeah it is some serious og gasps I smell um when I get a really good

piney yeah this is definitely a very true oh gee Kush source material this is made from no doubt in my mind yeah shout out to vamp on this one and this was brought to me by left coast collective here in downtown San Diego killer delivery service and yeah they just got a bunch of different flavors and this one stood out to me the most that I got to try a couple different flavors the vibe and yeah the BAMF OG is it is the truth I would like in this too if you ever read the mega Bangna so G from nameless genetics this is actually pretty similar to that and that yeah it's just uh it's a little bit more of a hybrid leaning of G gasp but yeah really really really [ __ ] day yeah love it I mean really us as someone who's from Southern California I love OG Kush and I know the channel is all about you fish as well so yeah the the light your v3 stuff has dropped guys so if you want to check out CC a7 100 comm that you can see all the v3 lighter stuff is for sale it's not gonna look exactly like this one this one's still prototype of the new new bodies have like a flat top right here it's not like a slanted corner but it's exactly the same I mean yeah the function is identical and it's

this thing apart doing close-ups on all the individual parts going through how to clean it all that good stuff alright guys going into my first AB here of the advanced extractions damned og live resonant cake batter brought to me by left coast collective here in downtown San Diego cheers guys oh she's a pretty big toke right there and sup reminds me of the SF e OG ara dude if you expect from can't abide onyx you know mouthful turps OG Kush is mmm easily one of my favorite genetics if you haven't tried it if you're if you're from out of state if you're not from California or if you've never tried out G code for pouring when you're visiting California absolutely give it a shot it lives up to his name yeah hmm the sfe that I reviewed a few weeks back had a it was an uh grunt definitely had more of a mmm cured resin taste to it and that the the source material was cured and not fresh frozen this stuff definitely has a little bit more of a fresh frozen taste and the terpenes are a little bit more intense as far as just right now like I'm having to swallow the saliva that is definitely in my mouth from this stuff it's a serious OG chirps and OG Kush has a way of really making you salivate yeah that first I've got my eyes feeling pretty heavy right now the the indica effects of this OG push are creeping on me before me and they are creeping on me fast yeah all right hmm as going in on my second dad fear of the vamp extractions of sam vachi live resin cake batter brought to me by left post collective here in downtown San Diego proper indicate funk on this one it is a gassy OG Kush yeah cheers guys yeah I think I was trying I was gonna mention this in the last video but when I'm when I'm smoking Asheville for dabbing natural to say hmm I like to exhale after I've gone out to hit and try this if you haven't but with really high quality at concentrates I like to free the out of my nose close your mouth and breathe out of your nose slowly I find that that really carries the terpenes up into your nasal passageway and it really just gives you kind of a full head of turps so to speak I feel like I can get such a bit of good impression of a flavor by doing that and it's a good way of controlling your breath and and helping yourself in our coffin jury try not to hang up a lung on camera like I'm trying not to right now this man I am feeling the effects of this one it is yeah it's gonna be cottonmouth it's just got me feeling loaded down I mean really just heavy I mean I don't feel like I really want to get up from this chair at all right now yeah I've got my eyes really really splinted shut proper of g.push effects and and yeah the live resin the intensity of the Turks is really increased with the library nature of this stuff it's a super - yeah just that mustardy just OG oh yeah just so almost like chemical long kids it's really just yeah funky OG mmm yeah this one is really really strong definitely check out Vance extraction some I think what I've heard about this company they they were part of HGH extractions and then split off to become their own company and yeah both both companies make great concentrates this is the first

when I get a puff go then we'll start doing more because you can actually use it and because literally you just sucking it [ __ ] gives you a perfect temperature perfect tap and it burns it right where it needs to be those who worry about it I just started getting on the boat empty out said man those are some monsters like you you get so much more flavor but you just choke it out because there's so much more smoke well we'll try I mean I didn't know you would do but the hash is impossible to find I haven't seen hash I've seen bubble hash in any of this country because there's no companies making it I wonder why there's no market right now well you never have a bucket if you don't have it available for people leave behind I get this how you have a market there's no demand it's wasn't that'll be a demand to let different and enviable listen to me if they stock it people will buy it maybe that's what we do with the micro grow we [ __ ] figure out how to make [ __ ] great bubble hash with the trim that we have make cookies and bubble ashes yeah we do instead of making a Greek actual bubble hash I mean and let it sit age day yeah so in jars just like you do just like you uh age of you know you know your we can't we use all that far more screen Keith that comes off the trim boxes to just make a clock yeah yeah yeah there's not strong enough it really represents yeah there's too much I'm not smoking I don't take a bunch of smoke in than that guy what if we ran it here another the way all right that's right that's how you do dry that's Keith that's what dry hash is yeah we want us we want bubble he's talking about Keith well you used to dry ice yeah no Lauren or dry period or just make pucks and [ __ ] yeah I get what he's talking about the stuff we have already know I'm Kyle Ike that we we said Nick once through the four screens yeah you do it the bottom you press it you don't think he makes a seal no you need I mean but right that's what this thing is in here and you gotta wait for drew lead read before you know would you talk about doing you that mom still have to wait till it dry that's not Keith no that's a that's a bubble okay so it's still soft like if you were to squish it it would like literally squish down - yeah it's that's what I want inside it should be nice and green and a green on the outside yeah I think that would be hip to do though you know they would only one bubble we'd only ones with Blanche yeah and that makes my bubble hash excellent Mobley well I think the other ones I think [ __ ] you get some really unique flavors off to like the bug POS s for hashes oh yeah I wonder yeah that'd be interesting to see em you gotta do something with that trail this is garlic cookies again by the way for the biggest fittest I hate that this sixty by [ __ ] I love garlic but I hate the idea of garlic garlic Jim I'll start a little garden look at me that's what GMO isn't it some garlic so no there's no what GMO is look up GMO Gillett genetically modified oh oh there's a strain called I'm sorry cookies yes garlic cookies with Carol's cow so income dog everything you eat is genetically modified any theory just about no there's no just about everything you eat there's gotta be some fruits and vegetables that aren't know look at apples man apples don't like an apple you eat is a mutant okay hold it so there's some guy 60 miles from here you just got a little teeny apple orchard he sells one on the side he he sells them on the side of the road he sells a lot of them on the side of the road no GMO again but don't modify thousands of years ago they weren't modified actually he's they're mutants there's a difference yeah because modification means that well it is modification is it's a selection its selection but you're not actually improving it cuz you're never gonna see you either it's just it's a final product of modification because you planted a thousand seeds and you got one that happen to look like that that was your luck that your your Apple that's how you get a good Apple don't look like [ __ ] defense made over potato now in the wild or whatever that is poisonous and they both use know you can fry it tomatoes and you can find potatoes in the wild are poisonous there's a group up north in the northern part of be a big deal the way we modify that [ __ ] the way we plant the ones that we like that do good for us yeah but they do I eat them yeah I mean I mean tomatoes no but tomatoes themselves if you if you eat the natural form of tomato oh yeah yeah the same what potato but there's a group of people who grow those potatoes anyway and then they put him up they literally it's so cold was there no that they put him up you know because they grow and drought they grow no matter what so we're gonna bid no they put him up on the [ __ ] on a cliff side and they literally just laying on the [ __ ] moon in the snow because it's something a hill or a mountain or whatever and they let it sit out they sit out in the [ __ ] Sun for a year mmm-hmm something like a year and then they're good where's that unique component I hope they decomposed and all the poisoning coats out of them so they become out of oil well and it's a way for them to get through the drought seasons because they're not only cut normal they don't have access to with food we're talking about a potato uh-huh and where's this potato coming from potato is naturally are poisonous I just started eating me if your gravel right what potatoes come from their poisonous nightshade they come from the nightshade don't they potatoes originally I don't know fear I mean I know what nightshade is they come from a poisonous family and the mutated versions don't kill you gotcha and there's but there's people up there that use because they're drought resistant they use the mutated or the non mutated version and they just have to let them sit for a year before they become edible before the voice movies you know and they're black and that's what I'm saying I just started eating though like darker what no but you what your skin to the inside is yeah the little guys that they sell at the store and the one variety color pack of potatoes like some of them are red inside some of them are black so from a brown inside yeah the same type of you know yeah no I mean I've been getting those weird ones with my student to make what's new and they they're they're sweeter they've got different flavor profiles I love the little ones a little sweet ones yeah [Music] the Howards or is it on something wash slash Michigan canvas review so I was thinking about Oh Oh almost erupted so brings all those cables alright so what you got here cut my god loved it he's [ __ ] ripped right now I'm gonna give it the same life I go dump my left leg so it's like a 5.5 and I mean it's got some goodness expands like better flavor than the last one shines through Bradon I guess I can see what you're saying but I wrote down pretty it's pretty I thought it was pretty is pretty okay then I wrote spicy that are really hard five solid five I've came right to me and it's I feel like a hater because these are lower scores than I'm used to but I also feel like we smoked a lot of [ __ ] weed tonight now is grading big all night my head and I don't like these [ __ ] weeds I didn't give it a 4 I mean it's it's sharp you pretty wasn't where the puppy it's harsher than the last it's harsher that's all it is it's just harsher it's no smooth this it's not very sharp very peppery so sly something to be honest with you it tastes like this weed looks like every time I smoked me day was you guys I don't really know that looks like this what's up art did you want to sum over you know every time I smell believe that looks like that it has that very very it's just too intense to even saints tell you what it is it's not that there's too many flavors it's just strong on the very sharp and harsh flavors Linden hit me like that what hit me real bland real real yeah it wasn't sharpen and harsh it was harsh that's lame my heart it was still sorry coming in okay but it was just it's this one was sharp coming in but it wasn't harsh like that was harsh yeah I was like yeah come to say pepper that's probably when I say spice do you know a term for that yeah was that it carefully the better carefully yeah it's just both of them were pretty mediocre and be honest with you yeah so we will be doing some shows like next Thursday imma do show cuz things gonna come into town okay I want to test some dead head I have up in the cover cool and I want you guys let me know on next Thursday yeah I want to know if it's like if we think you could win some competition because there's a competition coming up in March I'd like that so you would test today yeah I want to test it out so I'm bringing sane he's obviously gonna bring his home but I'm gonna grow up from someone I liked how we were all the same [ __ ] page today we were we all commented the same way yeah cuz it was very it's that kind of at least it was whatever what", "MKKKhCnqsU8": "you - what's going on - so I make this video and I know a lot of you guys I'm waiting for and it's been really busy you know a lot you're going on I like it what do you want to guess it you know but it's a missing element or actually it's not even a missing element it's just a wrong ratio of the elements and it's simple you know it's it's nitrogen I know a lot of you guys like what the [ __ ] nitrogen that's a bunch of [ __ ] but you know it's not because a lot of these nutrient companies that are not making nutrients for high intensity Gardens with co2 of maximal levels perfect conditions that are making these you know nutrients for regular conditions with regular sunlight and basic air exchange it's what they're making them that's why you know when you run your lights at lower levels and you know your plants are nice and healthy that's because that's the nutrients in made for it made for you know I would say a lower light but not a not a high level of seat of co2 in the air and that's what changed a lot of things so if you look at like a not a lot of nature companies you know general hydro being one of them I think they have like the best levels and there's just two different forms you know there's a sportin forms of nitrogen but the two important ones that are used and the most are the ammonium and the nitrate those super forms of calcium use the most most hydro based nutrients you know use more of a nitrate but just they are they're not using enough of it and moist most soil nutrients are using more of a ammonium but it's just the ratios are [ __ ] up and they're not they're not made for for these high intensity high intensity situations and I'll get farther back there but I don't really feel like talking and standing in the same but you know if you look at you know here I mean this is all on dry salts now found results these are on Drive saltzman's start you know once I get in to show you if I need to see this the perkiness and just help with these plans [Music] these and the nitrogen you know it's just a building block to amino acids and proteins and chlorophyll you know plants can absorb nitrogen either as nitrate or an ammonium nitrate you know and therefore the total uptake of the nitrogen usually consists of you know a combination of these two forms which most missionary companies you're just not taking a consideration when it comes to high intensity light and co2 supplementation especially now the double-ended bulbs producing even more intense light the ammonium and nitrate ratios are just they need to be better balanced with these very fast-paced conditions you know the ammonium is the main the main nitrogen source you know per se and it's used immediately by the plans it's a very fast-acting nitrogen by a lion source of nitrate and ammonium you know working together and [Music] sure where was I going with this and I'll say so a good a good ratio for the bird I'm just going to go by the instead of saying oh you know an ammonium in the nitrate I'm just going to go by no.3 and NH 4 you know the no.3 being the nitrate and the NH for being the so you know good ratio for no.3 and NH 4 and 38 fertigation waters between 10 to 20 so you want a ten to twenty to one you know and like which means ten nitrate and one in one part [Music] and that goes for highs are climbing situations you know like with this and that's at a minimum you want ten to one maximum of twenty one I'm using a 15 to one you know when you look at these nutrients like this they have a six nitrate to ammonium I mean there's [ __ ] nowhere close to what you need you know for a situation like this that's what the plants you know I mean yeah they'll [ __ ] yield you know and you know I'll get quality out of these plants but [ __ ] [ __ ] compared to these you know that's because they can't process all this damn light but uh well you don't know because I'm telling you now but now you know my plants cannot you know self-regulate you know the uptake of the the ammonium nitrogen yo but they can they can with the nitrate to a certain degree you know produce some type of amino acids because that's what they're you know nitrogen is just a form of the amino so you know it's blank and I'm moving up sugar to the roots fast enough NH spore will not be converted soon enough they can burn roots you know it cause other expressions of final toxicity what you see in most high light gardens like you're seeing right here you know the ratio between ammonium and nitrate isn't a great significance you know a lot of nutrient companies just aren't taken into consideration or actually they are but they probably just want you to [ __ ] go out and buy more products that they offer you for sale you know Effects of both cannabis plants and soil and soilless medium no.3 and no.4 cannot be directly controlled in Silverlake hydroponics I'm not concerned so but this isn't about soil a little bit of body no saw process of no.3 and no.4 there's just controlled it's control of the root zone and I'm broken down by certain microbes that's why I have like nitrogen-fixing microbes you know in hydroponics you wanna you know hire a nitrate nitrogen a very low ammonium nitrogen and soil you kinda want to reverse that around because uptake is different how the plants process it based on the medium on occasion exchange and the ions you know react inside the medium is very different in both ways between soil and meetings you know before cannabis you know highlight Gardens you know test between 500 micro moles to 700 micromoles which these are rate a mm micromoles per 5x5 you know my time to gets down as a planner so based on a farm meter you can dial that in to around 700 microphones which is needed for significant for vegetative growth those doubles with those type of micro moles just up to 700 between 500 sent our microphones with double co2 concentrations listening you know depressed depressed for the money of nitrogen made chlorophyll so all the floor flipped ammonium nitrogen made in the co2 concentrations it was suppressed by 40% you know the newer leaf and shoot grow and that's what you're seeing here and all the newer leaves are you know when I turn these lights up they really just got this [ __ ] summer that's clearly what happened well you know at the same time you know Tesla's showing you know that W co2 at the same micromoles you know increased no.3 you know or the nitrate nitrogen by 14% of course you know and all in all just increase your overall yields you know on an awesome uptake and growth you know these plant species [Music] each plan you indica sativa hybrid whatever you know they are requiring on different ammonium nitrate ratio so it's important to dial you know we've strained in and really work with these string you know cannabis being our planet choice you know me needs a minimum of a ten to one to a maximum 21 like I stated before you know ah nitrogen ammonium ratio you know for high-intensity lighting and co2 controlled environments that's the ratios you want to be it's where you don't have any the efficiencies any problems with you can really pound these [ __ ] and it can actually make use of it do their job and give you big fat stinking [ __ ] fun you know I choose the I choose to use a 15 to one ratio I'm not going to max it out of 20 to 1 you can I have actually done a 2001 and and there's really no no downside I mean I would look problem to run that into like week 4 and then drop it down to 50 you know the correct ratio to be applied also varies with on the temperature the girls stage you know the pH of the root zone and soil or soil properties you know for this purpose you know we're talking Oh in soils you know then the fact the temperature on nitrogen and metabolism and plan actually metabolizes all these nutrients you know firstly understand the different ways these two nutrient forms are metabolized and ammonia metabolism you know consumes much more oxygen than and that's why I co2 and highlight conditions depress the Sullivan and I listen to everything I'm saying you know literally putting it just all together you know ammonium is metabolized in the roots all right that's why it's used mostly for soil soil medium [Music] and that's where reacts with the sugars inside the soil these circuits have to be delivered from their production site you know in the leaves down to the roots and it just won't work in high conditions in hydro it just doesn't work in hydro you know that condition starts at the leaves and then works itself down to the roots soyal an ammonium base nitrogen which starts in this metabolized in the roots and then it's you know processing the sugar is very fast through nitrification which I'll get into that you know an ascent up to the plan you know on the other hand though you know you have nitrate is transport up to the leaves word is reduced to ammonium so it's you know starts as a nitrate and introduced to ammonium but it has to be at the at the right ratio or else you're going to have an imbalance and [Music] you know and and when it's reduced to ammonium you know it reacts and sugars you know and it creates a mass that it creates massive amounts of chlorophyll you know nitrates are best for for hydro conditions and a higher temperatures you know the plants respiration has increased consuming sugars faster making them you know less available for ammonia metabolism the roots at the same time at high temperatures you know oxygen solubility is you know and water is decreased and a lot of this [ __ ] Brian I'm making sense a lot of you guys are like what the [ __ ] is even happening but you know it's complex man I want to really explain this [ __ ] to you guys to guys but the basic understanding of why this is happening you know but when you have the oxygen on solubility in the water and it's decreased you know you're making it less available as well which makes it afford to keep it cold a nutrient solution or one of the many reasons typical a nutrient solution we look at front plant growth stages you know as we already established you'll serve sugar seed to be transported down from the leaves or the roots to meet the moaning to make that you know that that exchange you know that you processed and growing counters plan so much the majority of the growth you know is in the leaves sugars are consumed quickly near their production site and you know they're much less available for transport to the roots so you're not having this you're not getting that full exchange from nitrate so ammonium to where you need all this ammonia where you need this you know this is a two part ammonium you know you need a very low amount ammonium and very high nitrates because the leaves and the plant aren't producing sugars so fast with this intense light and turning them in you know it's usable energy that they don't even have a chance to get down to the roots to even sit there and that's why higher nitrogen is needed in these side conditions you know imodium will not be officially metabolized and used and and you know the use of a lower ammonium nitrate ratio is just just really you know and [Music] I get my you know I mean oh you know I'm gonna get further in there but uh I mean he's [ __ ] plants are healthy as [ __ ] I mean there's not not one problem with these damn plants not one [Music] as compared to these I mean look how dark green and [ __ ] sad those things are now's in the general hydro line you know they're snapping out of it now but I mean the damage has been done you know the damage has been done the lights took their toll when the nutrients you know weren't available see it there but you look at the you know the facts of ammonia nitrate you know ratios by the pH in the root zone that's what a lot of these companies base their [ __ ] off keeping a balanced pH and honestly I don't know what the [ __ ] for I mean that's why you got pH up kids down you know some more basic chemistry [ __ ] Electrical balance you know in the root cells must be maintained so for each positively charged ion that has taken up a positively charged ion is released and the same is true for negatively charged ions again guys are like what the [ __ ] so when the plan takes up an ammonium you know nh4 you know releases a proton which is also a positive ion it releases that into soil or a solution you know an increase of proton concentration around the roots decreases the pH around the roots so that'll that'll bucks away your ph depending on what your ratio of nitrates to ammonium are now you know so all this [ __ ] means that you know uptake of the Knights rate increases PHR on the roads while uptake of ammonium decreases it you know that's how pH spur become advanced is created with creating a stable ratio of for the nitrate and ammonium for the perfect pH at the root zone and that's why I tell you not to worry about all pH meters and all that [ __ ] because you're literally maintaining a perfect pH at the root zone where it matters based off of your nature and ammonium ratios in a guard with highest co2 it's a good idea to to hedge bets really and and use a low no.3 NH 4 ratio again and again stress how important that [ __ ] is you know and if you look at you know most agricultural facilities warehouses whatever I mean a greenhouse is not [ __ ] warehouse they consider up below for it's too low and will hinder the and more hinder plant growth the reason being you know there's mounting you know scientific evidence that plants given only you know no.3 or vast majority of the no.3 our only benefited by co2 for a short time days weeks whatever you know and they have an increased growth rate you know etc however though the plants given only the NH four or a majority of NH 4 the plants were continually benefitted by co2 over a long period of time you know because they're able like I said they're able to to process all that else I mean fronts on that line it's a it's a musical energy which is then made into food and the co2 allows them to do that a very fast fast rate that's why you need high nitrate nitrogen you know most digital companies they choose the ratio for you know just because of the buffering effect on pH you know from a lower ratio this has a negative impact on plant uses of a pre co2 you know phenom own IAM mandates more you know they keep the ratio for for pretty much all stages of growth you know [Music] or whatever it is you know ideally you know a ratio of three is better in terms of pH and co2 for ammonium per services all right however you know plant some warm conditions and bright light especially flowering and fruiting plants for the photo sent a which means you know the actual element itself the photosynthate stays close to the source tissue you know the leaves the flowers and the closer you get to those leaves and flowers and other planets less able to move carbohydrates which are simply just sugars created by intense light like I said just how photosynthesis works that's just photosynthesis it's hard for the roots to convert nh4 into amino acids you know in such a case a ratio way above three is is ideal you know to prevent this this spinal toxicity important Road you know I mean you need to be way above way about three oddly specific I'm just writing member all I should get it [ __ ] out watch this whole thing really benefits you if you do this [ __ ] is especially important in Solaris media No for soil yeah it's it's [ __ ] whatever I mean so as far as our soil where the roots you know where the roots may use the effect you know the median pH because their volume is relatively large with the mediums volume so that's why it's more important for hydroponic situations you know as far as the median pH and all that [ __ ] but really it's really not about the pH or anything like but you know throughout the medium pH from rapidly-changing you know we should keep an appropriate ammonium nitrate ratio for but I mean who gives a [ __ ] again like when you have pH up pH down you know who gives a [ __ ] you know we want fatter buzz and healthier plants are more important so we need to get higher nitrates you know with a lower ammonium ratio and you know but at the age and my my my situation over here I mean my ph is [ __ ] and sent up by pointing right now I have a new adjustable opportunities the minutes are got like five points if someone up you know the facts of the money of nitrate you know a ratio I'm uptake of other nutrients you know it does it really does affect other nutrients and that's why you have to [ __ ] dump so much of this [ __ ] into your reservoir in order to get the elements you need to get proper growth but then you're overloading all these other elements which is going to give you a city amount of [ __ ] room you know I mean so you're literally just defeating the process I mean the purpose and you're just going backwards ammonium is ocation you know which is positively charged positive charged ion some more chemistry [ __ ] so in competes with other caissons which is also potassium calcium magnesium those are all positive charged ions as well literally has to compete with those other elements you know and that's what you end up with you know nutrient problems and lockouts knowledge and I'm balanced you know fertilization you know too high of an ammonium content might result in calcium magnesium deficiencies and that's what I state you know what this is that you start to see magnesium deficiency as well you start to see so you think you go I need to add more cowl-neck when really it's just your light was too intense and you don't have enough nitrate in your leaves you know to fully extend out words tear leaves so you're competing against each other with these other elements and you'll see these just under high light conditions you know and that also allows potassium uptake to to be more more abundant you know see end up with you know large potassium burn that's already mentioned you know the ammonium nitrate ratio may change the creation of the roots you know these pH changes may affect you know solubility and availability of other nutrients so you know so just maintain your [ __ ] pH [ __ ] you know I mean is that simple and I don't know how this [ __ ] even sounds [Music] hopefully you guys understand that [ __ ] [Music] if not oh well", "E3urMq9M4XY": "yo what's going on youtube welcome back to another video with your boy sebi g guys so check this out all right guys so i got this um this very kind person who just made me this piece right here gave me a whole gram of this stizzy um watermelon cherry pie wax all right brand spanking new i did not it's not open at all right it's a full gram right here so i was thinking man i haven't i haven't the next hour to to just sesh to myself so i was like i want to get pretty freaking baked so this is what i'm going to do all right so i'm going to use my dip device um e-rig by vape dynamics and what i'm going to do is i'm going to try try all right i'm going to try to smoke this whole gram in one sitting i don't know how long it's gonna take me i don't know if i'm gonna be able to even do it man i like i got lungs i got lungs but a whole gram by yourself is like a lot all right so i'm gonna go ahead and smoke try to smoke this whole gram by myself out of this e-rig right here and just sesh it out with you guys man just have a nice little session with you guys talk with you guys all that good stuff all right but before we get into the actual video if you guys can do me one big favor smash that like button on this video and also if you haven't already man hit that subscribe button alright guys we're so freaking close to 50k and i know we're gonna be able to hit it by the end of this month there's there's still not a doubt in my mind bro so if you haven't already hit that subscribe button just join the fam and hit that button alright guys so let's get this thing started cheers all right ladies and gentlemen so now that i got the camera set up on the tripod man let's just get straight into this man i don't even want to talk so three clicks goes ahead and turns this on one two three all right there you go and then um i am using the stock piece i kind of want to switch it out i'm not even too sure but this is a custom piece that goes on the dip devices um usually i always i like the stock piece on this one honestly it's it does a phenomenal job it has a lot of water in there you get a nice chuggy you know feedback but this piece in particular you get to put even more water in my opinion i think it's actually kind of similar it's actually very very similar this one's a little bit more narrow but i like this piece i like this combination just the purple going on and then um yeah man the overall like look of this the visual appeal is very very nice so let me go ahead and go show you guys the function very very nice feedback right there like i'm telling you guys all right so we're gonna go ahead and set that to the side and then bust into the wax real quick like i said brand new this is a full indica and the funny thing is that this um watermelon cherry pie this is actually one of my favorite curated um one of my favorite curated strains from stizzy so shout out to um the person who made this i think their instagram handle is blaze blades by or i'll go ahead and put that up on the screen so you guys can go ahead and give it a follow if you guys would like all right so brandon you guys heard that seal cracker right go ahead and boom and you got that right there take that off and then give you guys a little bit of a close-up all right so yeah man this is a full untouched gram of wax so shout out to blades by aurora for blessing today's video and i got the nice little um what do you even call this a little picker dab or whatever the case is so we're gonna go ahead and get ourselves a nice chunk i'm gonna be loading it up i'm not gonna lie with a humongous dab every single time now this bowl it's actually pretty big now i do not recommend doing this every single time honestly this is just something that i'm doing for the purpose of this video just so i could get some fat nice um so i could finish the wax kind of quick all right so my plan is to put like three to four fat scoops in there and hopefully it'll be done but let's go ahead and my favorite setting you guys already know it's the purple slash violet color but um we're gonna start off with something a little bit light which is the green setting right so go ahead and hold that and that's already gonna start warming up for you guys and um man i need to prepare my lungs i need to prepare my lungs right so the e-rig if you guys haven't watched my videos on this um you could vape flour out of this and concentrate and it's super budget-friendly all right guys one of my favorite e-rigs out on the market personally for the cost it beats the puffco pro in my opinion if you guys haven't watched that video where i compare the two i'll put that down in the description but this one the function is out of this world like it kills you it kills you so i'm kind of scared because like you get really really fat ribs alright so we're starting off small though on the green setting and i hope you guys are doing good man i'm doing good i'm ready to get baked i'm scared though because i've never really smoked a full gram by myself in one sitting so nonetheless it vibrated so cheers dude this thing gives off super amazing flavor too oh yeah two hits right there now this is the first hit off of this device right now so that's why i'm not really getting too much vapor production you really have to like use it like the first dab in any e-rig that is you're not going to get the fattest clouds you kind of have to warm up the bowl and once it's warm you're gonna start getting fat clouds oh yeah that's super smooth honestly man this might this might be a breeze who knows fat clouds the water filtration on this is actually super super nice now you don't get the biggest chugs out of this but honestly you get a really really decent like you know feedback from the water because there's there's rigs out there let me give you guys a little bit of example right this right here is a really really cheap one and i don't really like the function of this i don't really i think it's like that the feedback of the airflow is just like too too much open airflow let me give you guys a little example like there's so much water in here yet still i'm not getting enough of that that super chugginess that i like right so that all depends on the type of glass that you use honestly and let me give you guys another example so this one right here is a leisure piece that i just copped recently and let me give you guys um example on this chug this is what i love to see that is chug central man this is one of the with um one of my most favorite rigs just because of how much it chugs so let me go ahead and hit this with another reheat real quick because we can't there's there is a little bit of a puddle in there but i don't want to waste anything just for the purpose of this video we're going to try to you know maximize the wax man we're not going to be taking weenie dabs but um yeah man like i said back to the chugs this one has a very very nice chug me personally that's what i call it like you know the little airflow that comes back i call it chugginess because i don't know it feels like a chugging water you feel me so look cheers for an e-rig that's actually really really freaking good right so man this thing is smacking bro so i'm not getting any more flavor off of this it's just straight up smoke so i'm gonna go ahead and clean this up and then we're gonna go ahead and load up another dab so far so good man i haven't i've coughed a little bit but not enough to the point where i'm like all right i'm not gonna be able to do this this is possible but remember guys remember to always keep your water at hand or gatorade or something that's gonna keep you hydrated because when you're coughing when you're smoking it actually really does deplete your body um i'm not really too sure in what way but i there's been every single time that i feel like i smoke i feel like i i lose a little bit of energy you know so keep your water handy man that way you're always hydrated so going in on dab number two all right guys and i'm doing this all on camera so you guys don't think like oh he's not really putting all the full graham so the next one's gonna be kind of a stinky binky big ass one dude look at this one right here right this one's actually pretty freaking huge um it is gonna fit in the bowl i believe yeah it's gonna fit in the bowl perfectly so the only thing though is if you put this much wax inside of the bowl you got to make sure that you keep it leveled because if not it's definitely going to spill and you do not want hot oil spilling over all right so next up i'm going to go ahead and keep it on the purple setting because um i don't know man actually no the green setting was actually perfect the purple one was for the reheat but the green one honestly i was getting a very very nice terpy flavor from that one so we're gonna go ahead and do green alright guys so while that heats up though i just want to know man how is your guys's day going my day is going actually pretty freaking good i hope you guys have been enjoying the content lately man because i i've actually been putting in uh effort like you know i feel like there's there was a slump and you guys and i feel like everybody noticed that i'm not gonna lie i feel like i noticed i feel like my like if people around me notice that i feel like you guys as fans as supporters notice that and it's okay you know it's okay to have slumps but i feel like what is most important is how you pick yourself back up how you come back from that slump and um because that's really what defines who you are man how strong you are right so this is not this vibrated so cheers one like this is my favorite stream because you get a lot of that cherry pie flavor i don't know what it is but that cherry pie flavor that they have in this is just phenomenal man massive clouds bro but nothing but terpenes now if or even the white setting i would have been getting a lot of clouds but i wouldn't be getting that terps now the like in my opinion is the terps are a lot more important than the actual you know vapor production because the terps in my opinion are what gets you faded now don't get me wrong you do need a decent cloud to get you faded but with this device you get the perfect cloud but it gives it really really brings out the terps right and the green setting at least so i'm getting a little reheat on this because it ended a little bit too early i was doing a little bit too much talking so i'm gonna go ahead and hit this man i'm starting to get bait i'm not gonna lie i'm starting to get that head change um but we were already like six dabs in i'm actually pretty faded man but either way cheers oh yeah it's starting to taste a little bit burnt for me now no more you know it's like you know when it doesn't have any more terpenes because it's just straight up smoke it doesn't really taste that good i'm not gonna lie dude it started to get hot boxed in here and i was like dude i started like choking up bro so i went to go turn on the ac made sure there was airflow in this damn freaking house because i was about to [ __ ] pass out bro so cleaned it out dude and i must say i all right so this is this is no no bs all right so i've had this rake for over a month used it multiple times and the bowl is freaking pearly freaking white i don't know if you guys can see that i'm pretty sure i don't know try to take a look in there but it's pearly white man this thing has lasted me so freaking long and i've taken at least 50 dabs out of it so it definitely definitely holds it has durability so i'm freaking faded though that's all i can say right now it's all i can think about is how my throat was just getting graped right now bro so that was technically only the second dab in and um we still have so much freaking more man uh i kind of want i really really want to beat this to challenge so this is what your boy's gonna do you see that i'm gonna just clear this [ __ ] out right now man i should i should honestly just title this video easiest way to waste your wax all right like this isn't even i mean it technically is a challenge though because i am getting super super big like i honestly am on another level right now um i'm baked dude like literally my head is on like in the next realm i i'm just freaking high as heck right now and all i want to do is just like listen to some music and just chill out but i gotta finish this video out i honestly don't even want to take this last dab i'm not even gonna cap but it is what it is um i'm gonna go ahead and take it on the blue setting just so i could get a lot of that freaking terpene profile and i don't really want to cough man my throat is killing me right now like the last two dabs that i put in here i literally reheated them to the point where the the oil was like burnt so that that says it all those first two dabs were killer so it's time to really just minimize it and taste the terps out of this because it's kicking my butt it's kicking my butt alright guys so i'm going to go ahead and actually we're supposed to be hitting it on the freaking blue setting and all you have to do is just hold it like i said and it's going to go ahead and start heating up and i need to go grab some water i'll be right back boy is back in time it still hasn't vibrated but dude this thing all right hold on i need to give you guys a little bit of a close-up i usually don't like pulling out my phone and doing close-ups but the bubbling of the freaking oil is just beautiful bro so i'm going to go ahead and give you guys a little bit of a close-up for that so you guys can really see how it looks it's just so eye appealing it's just so beautiful the oil just burning up in there it's just phenomenal all right it's a it's a beauty it's a beauty to see so this thing is ready and cheers guys oh yeah that's it the blue setting is just super freaking smooth all the way through nothing but terps oh yes oh yeah baby this might be my new favorite setting you're getting a really really nice cloud but nothing but terps bro this is fire alright that i'm not even going to reheat this dude that that was enjoyable as heck i'm not gonna lie now we did it we actually did it it was actually not that hard and all right think about it this way the first two i really really freaking burnt the crap out of the oil like it literally started tasting like it was on fire and then but this one it was just straight up terpene profiles and i must say like judging the the different temperature settings on the dip device i feel like it really does its job bro because when i was using it like i said on the green to purple setting i was getting really really fat clouds and it was like i was getting terps but it was in maximized terps right and as soon as you level it down to green temperature which is supposed to obviously like the lower the temperature the more terps you're gonna taste i started tasting the heck out of those terps like phenomenal so honestly this still to this day is my favorite e-rig i must say so we did it boys we did it we finished a whole stizzy gram go ahead and show you guys that right here in one sitting it was pretty fun i'm not gonna lie i did i did cough a little bit here and there but it is what it is that's the name of the game right so i'm baked really freaking big like honestly like i'm i'm happy like i'm there there's nothing that makes me happier than being baked as heck so with that being said i'm gonna go ahead and shut this video out here i hope you guys enjoyed it as much as i did all right guys if you did do me a favor hit that

down some more so yeah how y'all feeling today i'm feeling good about to take off i can definitely uh join this journey with me and [ __ ] blast off you dig so yeah i got that all broke down you feel me go ahead and uh split this down the middle i will use my little knife but um i don't really like that straight line man straight line when you when you break down the blunt and use a razor or something it makes it so we're done it's really difficult to stick because the line be so crispy so i'm just going to use my fingers so i get them i mean it's nothing though simple all you do is just squeeze together like you would do any bunt and none different about a dutch it just burns slower to me it burned way slower than a swisher go ahead and empty these guts real quick i mean the difference between for me the difference between a dutch a backwood and a swisher is with the dutch with the dutch you ain't necessarily got to put you know i mean you it's right in between in the middle it burns like a backwood but it smoke like a swisher which means it's not as harsh to your lungs but it don't burn as fast as a swisher so it's like right in the middle right in the middle for me a lot of people use a lot of people use backwoods because rappers use backwoods but that's what a lot of people do it for i do it i i i use it backwood because [ __ ] you can put more weed in there than you could with a dutch or a swisher if you just want to smoke more weed if you got some some ok and it ain't getting you as high as it would in a dutch or a swisher then you just put more in the in the back wood and [ __ ] hopefully it gets you to where you need to be that's really what the backwood for or if you're smoking with a lot of people you got a lot of people hitting that one blunt roll up a backwoods but if it's just you and your girl or somebody you know you know you all need something especially if it's some good weed get you a dutch roll it up it's gonna burn super slow like this perfect row so yeah that's pretty much that that's pretty much it perfect roll you know take long at all man if you really know what you're doing that's it that's it that's all now for let me see i'll be right back before i light this nah i ain't even gonna say it just go ahead and light it look for your rookies though right you don't want to light it and pull it while you light it nah it's going to burn wrong you just wanna char it a little bit i hit it a couple times and you're gonna get that right burn my bad i didn't mean to blow it in your face excuse but yeah san fernando og go

be reviewing three different products from heavy hitters today we're gonna be reviewing the 2.2 gram cartridge the one gram cartridge and we're also going to be reviewing the actual vaporizer battery pen itself so let's go ahead and unbox these things and see what we have here first off is do we have the actual vaporizer pen and this is the pen that's actually provided by heavy hitters that you can purchase that's branded by heavy hitters it includes a little USB charger plug as well as the pen itself and that's a 5-10 thread pin okay and now we're gonna unbox the 1 gram cartridge this is an OG Kush cartridge which is a hybrid but it's in indica dominant and that's the one gram cartridge and now we're gonna unbox the 2.2 gram cartridge this is the ha static cartridge and this is a new flavor it's the blue dream ok so now let's take a closer look at these individual items first we're going to look at the battery itself now the heavy-hitters battery that is available through heavy hitters and which is recommended for the device is just the right wattage at 4 watts it also has no buttons or anything on it the only thing that you can see is the logo on the side for heavy hitters and then the 510 threaded end that actually plugs into the USB charger that's the simple kind of USB charger that plugs directly into USB and you could charge that with other kind of chargers as well ok now we're going to look at the 1 gram pen and this is the cartridge pin for the 1 gram that's the og cush I'm a big AG fan so I'm really looking forward to trying this out in a minute and it's really simple it's just a one piece I know there was a little rubber cap that goes over the 510 thread there on one end but you just could discard the little rubber cap and then you see it's just a simple cartridge that threads directly onto the pin and these are sort of low wattage it's a 3.7 watts recommend it there so you could try these on other pins but you wouldn't want to try these on a modern of high wattage device okay now we're going to take a closer look at the big 2.2 grand pen and these are monsters I really like this the concept here of just making a tank that's gonna last you for a couple of weeks and also a big fan of blue dreams so looking also for it to trying this out and you can see this pin is so big that it's actually the cartridge is a little bit longer than the pen itself but it's very similar to the other pen other than the length of it it has screws right on to the end of the battery and it's the same battery that you can use on both size cartridges look at that at this like a it's like a rifle or something they're just not rifle you can see the comparing the two you can also see that the two oils look different as these are strange specific and you can also see out of the quality of the oil is very good how thick it is that takes that bubbles so long to roll up but one thing to be cautioned with and this is a lot of vaporizer pens they will roll off the table and break so be careful you don't want to break your heavy head or you'll cry okay so it now comes the favorite part the part of that we've been waiting for here at Roth house studios and this is amazing a pen if you've tried any kind of these cartridges you just can't equal the taste I really like the little light-up end there when you you don't have to do anything when you draw through the pen it lights it up and also ignites the the vaporizer atomizers so you don't have to press any buttons or anything like that it's just air controlled and then I had a little fun here to try both flavors at once that OG Kush was delicious by the way very piney a little bit of lemon but very piney and delicious and the same goes for the Blue Dream it wasn't as pioneer but it was a much more lemony citrusy flavor and just awesome the flavor on these is incredible and heavy-hitters is the correct name you can get major puffs especially for the low wattage coils you can still get major big puffs and like I said we've tried these on multiple batteries and they work good with most of your low wattage batteries but you do need to be careful not to use too high of a wattage of a battery because you get burnt out the coil in the atomizer and it won't work another thing to be cautious with about using these heavy headers or any kind of the cartridges or a lot of these cartridges especially the high-end strong ones like this is that you can find yourself overmedicating very easily because it's such a pleasant experience it tastes so good and it doesn't make you cough and choke that after a few hits you may just find yourself staring out into the window aimlessly and forgetting what you're doing so be careful not to over Medicaid and don't drive or operate machinery obviously anytime but especially in the case with with these heavy headers because they are appropriately named-- you will definitely get very very high off of these all right very easily super high quality very premium premium oil right here [Music] so that comes to my review or my rating for the heavy hitters and I'm gonna give it five stars I really can't find any problems with it the only problem that I have is you're gonna be upset if you let it roll off the table and break it which is only a testament to the product itself just top-notch product so I would like to say thank you to heavy hitters who sent out these pens for us to review if you'd like to learn more about heavy hitters you can check them out online and you could also ask for them at your local dispensary I hope you

is definitely comparable to stizzy i mean see i'm loaded i meant to say definitely comparable to 710 it has an incredible potency it's only 73 thc i'm [ __ ] high though and that [ __ ] overwhelmed me in citrusy flavor definitely tastes a lot more like orange than what it smells like and that's a fact and i love that because it always takes you by surprise when you dab it so all props all shouts

my god yes dizzy is wow i am just so shook on how crazy good their concentrates are like don't get me wrong i've always noticed dizzy's a good brand but personally me like i think they do have the best distillate but i'm not a good fan like a good fan i'm not a big fan of distillate in general so the fact that i gave their constant because their weed is amazing absolutely amazing definitely on the 710 level of flower and so are their concentrates not going to cut i mean their rosin is beautiful so yeah i [ __ ] with this [ __ ] so so far because you you guys know you need to try more than

have to work all day tomorrow so I'm going to just drop it in the water tonight and then hopefully we have some tails tomorrow morning or sometime tomorrow probably when i get off work and there's a total of ten seeds in there and so we're going to be dropping those and see what we come up with all right you guys have a good one hello", "XrcnNDtbdxc": "all right k man kid coming at you here tonight i'm about to show you my new setup that i'm doing here it's all of my strain i breathe so um i'm not getting anything confused this time and i can really get to learn how this strain is going to grow so i can really cater to it a lot better to get a you know better and better harvest and if i like the bud great if not maybe i'll just start something else breathe another one but i'm gonna show you what these look like here real quick and again keep in mind i don't like spending money i don't like going big so this what you see is just pretty much something i built under 20 50 bucks something like that so here it is here i'm about to show y'all she's just kind of rigged up in here the lights probably the only thing i spent money on i didn't spend that much money i think it's about 30 bucks on the light i got a good deal because amazon owed me about you know 10 or 15 bucks and there they are i breathe the new batch ladies coming through here well those are all seeds so who knows what's going to be male and female but i'm keeping the males so i can just keep breathing them getting more and more getting better and better stronger and stronger seeds put this back here [Music] and then if you notice i like built a box put my lamar film on the inside and then builds another top and then just kind of rigged it to the top here right now again this whole setup it

let you know how we're going this is where i used to have the old ones they already reached that ideal bloom the height that i wanted so i put them in here and these are good i can't really get much yeah you can't see them but i can't make it coming at you here i'm gonna keep you guys updated on those because they are growing fast within two days they uh they shot up out of there within a day they had already germinated so they're really strong i think that jack frost in them is really really uh taking that good gene that geno in there and um it's going to be a very resistant plant as well molvers is a pest resistant drought resistant i like it and it should have like a lemony berry smell as well as uh everything pans out i'm looking at a good one here so i'm gonna keep you guys updated on this one especially cameron can peace", "ICDQoQrePlM": "hey guys how's it going I've made a bit in a while I'm really busy I just want to give you guys a final shot before all this comes down you

Kelly wants right now Kelly just wants all the oh cheese that's all they want being that all the clinics closed down last year you know all the growers kept on growing so now it's just a huge influx of just regular pushes and strains like this that you know there's pretty much a stockpile here and they no one can really do anything with it except smoke at all so the shops really don't want it unless they can get it for super dirt cheap and you know growers don't want to settle for that so just gotta up the game just start growing all oh geez because that's what everybody wants here this here's the sfv nice and frosty this one [Music] couldn't get enough food to this one this one takes a lot of food the blue dreams the kryptonite's don't take as much so this one got underfed

get some you know you got some quality you know here and there but they really like it nice and cold 73 74 degrees they like it consistent constantly in order to pull the nice numbers from ER or else

right now why i'm like zooming in and like i don't know the background the light was moving peter said all good yearly gaming with tina on the box yeah yeah i checked my weight i am 128. i'm literally the same size as my sister and we're the same weight but her i told her i was like her neck looks more defined in her jawline i'm like i need to start working out y'all like in the mornings or something real quick do a little push-ups some little sit-ups i don't know because that's where i feel like i just making excuses when i'd be like i wish the gym was open but same time it's not even scary just because if the gym is open oh i'm dead ass going in there and it's like a different little sanctuary when i go to the gym and i work out like our little gym is right there but i don't like first off i live on the second floor and i don't like i do 100 everything 100 jumping jacks 100 sit-ups 100 push-ups now run like a mile but so imagine i can't do that upstairs i'm not trying to do that i could probably do the sit-ups and the push-ups up here and then jumping jacks like outside downstairs or something and then run around the block i could do that see i just made up a whole little thing i could be doing but i feel like with the baby too you never know what's gonna happen so can't really have a steady schedule all right we can actually that's not that's not true get her on a good nap time a good lunch time boom and then a good sleep time but then she goes to grandma so it's like every other every other day is different you know i mean so yeah so 10 minutes out of your day planks are my main workout no me is an hour like my workout that i do it takes an hour it takes a good hour like and then a little bit extra because like depending on how long it takes me to run my mile but it's a hundred jump reject like i stretch real good 10 seconds 20 seconds each depending how sore i am and then i get up i do 100 jumping jacks and then i mix between my 100 pushing push-ups and 100 um sit-ups i mix those in between where i do it in sets and then you know take a little 10-second break in between and then boom hop to the next one like you know what i mean like say i do like 20 push-ups or whatever and then rest for 10 seconds and then i do my 20 sit-ups and whatever and i do side sit-ups too where i was like side sit-ups like this like on the floor and it's just like yeah jimmy rodriguez i seen your thing yesterday and i was ending the live she said what happened to stoner wives yes again um that has been years ago stunner wives has yeah we we've been broke up and [ __ ] like that but yeah now it's the life of tina she's so good though she's still she's doing really well for herself i know that she she's in another relationship a good relationship um and uh like prob like pretty sure better than me than what i was you know i mean i was treating her but she got a good job and stuff like that i don't really know we don't talk at all it's been like years but i'm pretty sure that's her lifestyle right now it's really good peter kelsey is seven a.m here for you after work session tina oh yeah all right lee says [ __ ] i don't have time for an hour workout life a lot only when i'm home so that's a good workout plan though it really is because that's every day a good workout and it's like it's not a lot it's the same [ __ ] every day and it's it and that's for me to tone up my body it's just a hundred of everything and it's not hard like when you break it down to 20s or tens or fives if you need to it's not a lot it's just consistency consistency is key you know being steady with something and um what's the word ashley told me she said you gotta um what's the word well first of all you gotta condition yourself yeah but then julian said i need to do it myself yeah but it's um uh what's it called it's like you gotta be grown with it you gotta be grown and you got to tell yourself what is the worst i want to see or something i don't know sorry to see because you're not punishing yourself disciplining yourself is discipline yeah you gotta have a really good discipline and all that [ __ ] jimmy reggie said i hope texas

it was cool like maybe like um like uh like halloween makeup or [ __ ] like that or just like well first it was halloween makeup it was like that was cool like you know i mean people could actually like design like some crazy [ __ ] like in movies that's what i thought was really cool but then i got older too and i was like ooh makeup is so cool like i wonder i wonder if i could do makeup for women but i don't know i've never tried it at all i want to do it on ashley which i'll do her makeup that's just i don't know i don't know why that is difficult for me because i'm like really artistic i could i could draw i could paint do all this [ __ ] i don't know if i could do makeup that's an artwork right there that's an art form a whole different type of art form and then painting nails too that's a whole different type of painting art like for real would you say guys to fam that would be jokes i want to see i want to do it i bet she uh brandon watley said light skin blunt it's like halfway dark halfway light it's a mix you see it it's like an ombre it's crazy i'm going to say yeah you'd be good if you're artistic look at this ombre of this blend you'll see that it's crazy uh nah i'm like without amanda oh [ __ ] yeah amanda i don't know like i'm artistic but i'm like 90 sure i'm not good at doing makeup like we gonna see though and ashley tushie was like she want to put makeup on me every girl they were like i want to put makeup on you like you would look so pretty with makeup and i'm like no like i might look pretty good with makeup but there's not i'm not no i don't want to do it i don't know peter said hi amanda amanda mohanna it's midday i don't know what time it is yeah i'm gonna be so high then i gotta like man already said you would be pretty laugh out loud try it out it won't hurt i don't know every girl i've been with they're like let me do your makeup and i'm like amanda said hey peter i've um i think i let ashley put a or crystal i don't know one of these girls i let them put an eyelash on me and they're i'm like nah that's it it's not me so there's only one moana all right oh no and then put the eyeshadow and then the eyeliner or whatever there is some [ __ ] i don't even know what it is like if you was to give me like i'm like that's how we gonna do it wait ashley while i want to do her makeup i'm gonna give me her makeup and i'm gonna see what is what because i seen her do her makeup before but i haven't seen the whole process so it's gonna be even harder because i feel like some dudes too when they see that girl do their makeup they're like i don't know i don't know i don't know we're gonna see probably gonna do it tonight y'all want to see it tonight said julianna all about that makeup and did she do makeup actually do her own makeup you know what i mean all that [ __ ] reggie said that should be funny yeah i think i'm gonna do it tonight if she wants to do it tonight i'll be tired i got packed too because i'm leaving friday morning that [ __ ] y'all it's gonna be funny i said thumbs up in the chat right reggie hell yeah right y'all be saying so connected to each other too oh that's just love it's all love on this channel i swear yeah okay i might do a video to it actually doing my makeup but we'll see i'm gonna do her makeup first but i want to see what is what i feel like that sucks because i feel like i want to do a video where you know what i mean like uh i don't know she gotta let me know what is what because i don't know what is what unless i like i'll read it and i guess i could see like okay this is eyeliner and this is blush whatever sexiest said was i want to say would you rock a fake lash one time [ __ ] i guess we'll see because my eyelash you know it's pretty short duct tape said roll blunt the way you showed us and damn is hella good hey the show take them stems out for real like this one it's only one stem you gotta think about it there's a difference between like this look like a very tiny stem you know whatever or it could it's a very tiny stand this one is a fat one as hell and then there's like veins you know i mean these are the veins this is the stem said think you spend your makeup loop on blends tina hell no hell no like what kind of question is that no hell no veggie said prolly that for the gang hell yeah i'm going to tuxedo says stems out in a big piece for the filter and you set for real amanda laughing for real why would i spend money on makeup what the hell that's crazy that is crazy talk man what what kind of it's just funny because like no i would never like unless ashley won it or something you know i mean i'm like okay you but then i wouldn't even buy makeup i don't know what to get her like so you gotta give him money because me i'm like i'm not gonna go back to the store and return it because then that's my job since i failed to get you the right one now i have to drive even more to go return it and then maybe give you the right thing but then i'll be like no let me just give you money so for the first in the beginning just give money women love money everybody love money but different money give different reactions too like he say i gave ashley money or something that's a whole nother type of love she can be like damn because she knew i worked hard for that money working at him anymore that [ __ ] yeah i mean trying to collect all this money from the minute mark usually like damn like you gonna use your minute more money on me like come on not [ __ ] or beside you feeling someone pushing or like someone doing whatever i don't know [ __ ] gets like it up to any and you make more money and [ __ ] i don't know you know because then you could afford more [ __ ] and you could do more [ __ ] but right now y'all

with your tool it just falls apart it starts to crumble so it's stable it's a nice yellow color it's on the drier side as you can see I already took some out of it Mars og is definitely an indica the reason why it's given its name is in reference to its growing conditions these planetary strains usually begin growing indoors and are then later moved outdoors to complete the growth cycle in a more natural condition the end result is a dense bud with high flower to leaf ratio that produces a really heavy effect it's really Hardy with a thick taste of pungent smell marzocchi is definitely something you want to have in your medicine cabinet for pain and insomnia right away when you smell it you get a sweet tiny OG like smell kind of like a diesel fuel II smell to it too right away when

"[Music] hello friends and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy confusing place you call your local dispensary today we're going to take a look at a fairly confusing product um confusing in its origins not so much in its purpose uh it's a good old-fashioned 510 vape cartridge today uh so nothing too crazy there this is a 510 vape cartridge from hush cannabis concentrate it's about as basic packaging as i've ever seen for a legal um cartridge i picked this up at a dispensary in long beach uh haven dispensary in belmont shore uh and i think with taxes it was a little over thirty dollars so thirty one thirty two 32 something like that so really affordable uh quite cheap for a one gram cartridge uh and one that has a pretty high th c percent uh at 87.07 this larry og uh cartridge which is rocking pretty high especially again for that very cheap price point uh i am almost certain that it is just distillate in here maybe some added terpenes but this isn't live resin this is anything fancy this is uh easy strong quick to make manufacture cheap manufacturer distillate nothing wrong with distillate but all the extra cannabinoids and all that is uh foregone to get max thc percentage uh so as i said uh at the beginning confusing product i i sometimes sometimes like to do my due diligence and look up the companies i'm reviewing before time ahead of things to kind of get an idea of what they're all about and i don't really know where to find uh hush it's one of those confusing conglomerates uh weed conglomerates that you know um is run by large investor groups that have a billion different brand names uh and it's just hard to know uh who's responsible if this vape cartridge uh were to give you some popcorn lung not that that's going to be the case for legal cartridges ice it's got to be tested to be in a store um but uh this uh very austere packaging and cheap price point and very shady online uh presence doesn't instill you with a whole lot of confidence uh so what what's so strange about it well there is a hush canna website which has their logo on it and just a bunch of dead links and then like all those like shitty um old squarespace sites that you've seen it's just a bunch of dead links and uh abandoned pages like there's a testing link that doesn't actually go anywhere uh and even more distressing when you click some links on hush's place uh chrome pops up with a hey they're trying to steal some information with you uh from you warning so i don't know uh and then also on the packaging it does have another website uh halocanna.com which really has pretty much the same kind of sort of boilerplate text that hush does but it also seems slightly more professional but doesn't say the name hush anywhere it's very confusing uh and it all looks just a little bit shady uh but again uh you know it's lab tested it's good to go just thought i would fill you in on all the little bit of weirdness with hush so let's go ahead and stop yammering let's shut up and let's get to the product review here uh nice i actually do not knock it for the uh very restrained packaging we'll call it um i doesn't need a lot of materials it should be a very easy thing to make manufacture and not produce a lot of waste so no harm there just doesn't have a lot of information on it um okay well we've got a cheap plastic acrylic tip ah i've seen these cart designs before i'm pretty sure the all of the cheapest carts i've had have this exact very same design i wish i knew who was the manufacturer maybe it's pro canna uh cheap materials all around like shitty glue job there uh and then the oil itself uh let's be honest looks okay but not great um it's a little cloudy uh it's just not as pure of a it's not that beautiful piss yellow that you really want from a nice distillate but uh it's the proof is gonna be in the hits so let's give this larry og uh 87 thc from hush a shot not bad not bad draws are you can even kind of hear it whistling it's there's something a little bit misaligned there bigger hits than i would have thought but it's coming through just fine um not the the easiest draws in terms of uh you kind of have to pull a little bit but you do get big hits uh once you start pulling the oil itself um feels really potent uh it is 87 thc this does feel like a distillate um with some added terpenes it feels like it's got some like just very generic heavy indica type terpenes the piney sort of taste to it not bad um not bad at all uh it is better than i thought it was gonna be to be honest yeah it's fine um i mean there are definite compromises here being a cart at this price point uh everything is slightly compromised it's not the best quality oil it's not it's shitty materials and it's working fine uh cheap packaging and a sort of mystery origin uh of where it comes from but all in all it's for the price it is not bad it is dare i say even i would i would even give it a thumbs up at this price point with as strong as the soil is knowing all those caveats but guys um these cheap carts are the ones that are the most likely to uh have all kinds of issues that pop up uh after you use them a couple of times so i'm gonna review this whole hush larry og one gram it'll probably take me about five days or so to get through it uh and then i'll come back to you guys as soon as i do and we'll make sure that uh no additional compromises problems uh issues arise uh over these next uh couple of days that we're enjoying this and uh but for now it's a uh positive experience for hush again compromises but you uh are getting a pretty good deal so guys that's going to do it for this first half of this review stick tight i'll be right back here in just a bit give you those wrap-up thoughts [Music] welcome back to weeks guys it has been five days since i first started with hush and their one gram larry og cartridge is a little bit of oil left here uh and that's because i did have some serious trouble here at the end getting some draws i suspect that that might be a problem uh with these very cheap cartridge designs you tend to get a lot of clogging and resistance towards the end and that is certainly true with this one at this point it's way too much effort to sort of extract anything uh left in there and that's been true for the past day or so i'd say probably i don't know 20 or so of the product that is in here uh is going to be unless you use it all very very quickly and it doesn't have time to build up any of that sort of uh junk or deposit in there you're probably gonna have some troubles drawing from it it's not terrible uh and it is a very good uh price but uh with that cheap price are gonna come some compromises and one of those is that like you're just gonna keep drawing and drawing and drawing and not a lot is gonna happen let's see if we can sort of replicate that here with a little bit that's left so yeah it kind of took a really long draw to there to get that heating element engaged uh and then like some of these cartridge designs here at the end when you're mixing so much air in uh with not a lot of um oil you tend to get that hot burning thing and that is the case here as well all together i'm gonna give it a pretty decent review it's not um it does have its flaws but at the price point um you are willing to forgive some of those flaws uh it is not a cartridge that i'm gonna come back to personally uh it's just a little bit too much of a headache for me but if you are on a big budget and you want a cartridge that's gonna be a decent oil uh pretty potent and it's gonna get the job mostly done and you don't have a lot of money you might want to look at hush but for us it's gonna be um you know there are better things out there but uh again it's not a total total thumbs downer just a bit of a mixed bag and with that guys that's going to do it for this review here on weeps that's going to do it for our hush larry og review i appreciate anybody making it here to the very very end and as always stay high but more importantly stay healthy we'll see if our next review goodbye", "HpUiIW_QIS4": "so as you can tell this is the og cush locked in lots and lots of colas I like I said that was from overtopping not paying attention rather than some nice a couple dozen colas we end up with a crap load of about I don't know 10 inch so far ones up top or probably closer to yeah maybe 11 but she's a bigan big girls need love too so alright that's it for now thanks for watching", "UIHxcKrBJxA": "what's up YouTube it's a boy surge back again with another episode of the daily session YouTube channel for cannabis patients and adults this episode we're gonna be smoking on some sour OG and we're gonna be finishing it off with a dad with some sfv og so this is an OG filled video all right well let's get to it sour OG is a 50/50 hybrid with its parents being Sour Diesel and og cush so they're two powerhouse you know strains well-known strains so I mean it's got to be dang right let's check it out start with a smell test for you guys that's interesting because I get a little bit of both I get that you know diesel II smell from the Sour Diesel but you also get that earthy cush tone definitely very pungent though it's one of those that just when you open it up and just smacks you in the face oh yeah alright guys while I pack this up in my bong I've got some close ups that I hope you guys enjoy alright guys I've got my little bong that I've also got from the hemp herb box all nice and packed I can get a taste test for you guys now whether you've got wax or bud let's inhale it up Cheers Wow the very smooth taste as you can see from the pictures they have really nice round den snugs just like any aji cush would and they're very frosty guys first thoughts on tasty very good I'd say it tastes more like OG Kush and Sour Diesel it's got a earthy taste but you know different batches taste different very smooth I like I keep saying like that it was very smooth Dean really kill me in my chest overall on the looks definitely give it a ten out of ten perfect nice den snugs very frosty for the smell I'd give it a seven out of ten because while it's pungent I feel like when you have parents like Sour Diesel and OG Kush be a little bigger than that but it's still a good smell for taste I give it a 9 out of 10 it's very good very smooth taste tastes like og cush you know the earthy taste don't really taste a lot of the celery and it honestly and on the high I give it an 8 out of 10 it's definitely a good it's a good 50/50 hybrid you feel good like I can't even get words together right now and I'm gonna have to take that back and do it the high ten hundred ten cuz I can't even put words together right now so ten out of ten yeah gotta stay hydrated all right guys I'm feeling good after those two sour OG hits so let's keep the hide going got some sfv oh gee let's see damn some good-looking shattered got a nice dab here on the little like lightsaber daggers thing from the head per box if you watch my first video you know that I'm a Girl Scouts cookie where I got these shatter and the sour OG was a new dispensary I saw they had a Girl Scout cookies on there so I had a big gap probably gonna be smoking that on tomorrow's all right guys Cheers that's good tasting white guys man I am feeling good guys alright guys if you liked this video make sure to comment like subscribe and share and until next time peace", "7m53NS7xYRo": "they wrote ingredients with that i so i n g r i n in gradients as you probably already know youtube has very strict community guidelines so if you're not 18 please [ __ ] off of my video thank you let's have a nice day what is going on guys tony robb here back for another youtube video i hope you guys are having an amazing day because mine is going amazing like every other day in today's video we're up in my car and we're about to review the wiz khalifa og by pure1 and just thinking about it i could have done this in my room because like vape cartridges don't smell that much but before i start this video i just want to give you guys a little disclaimer to watch out for fake cartridges when i looked up the pure one wiz khalifa og i had seen that there's a lot of people out there that had been scammed with fake cartridges so when buying a [ __ ] cartridge buy it from a reputable source and just don't buy it from somebody who's super [ __ ] shady so please watch out and with that out of the way if you guys want to see more vape cartridge videos drop a like hit that subscribe button check out all my social media links are in the description down below and without further ado let's get this video started whoop all right guys we got the pure one wiz khalifa oh g over here which is a indica strain i got 1 000 milligrams which is equivalent to 1 grams of concentrate and i bought this from a reputable source so i don't want you guys saying in the comments down below that this is a fake cartridge and just looking at the packaging the package is very beautiful you know with that gold tint on the side um with the warning label on the back which i will be reading for you guys on the back of this package it says wiz khalifa og the best hitting ceramic cartridge disposable cartridge 1 000 milligrams it says ingredients and i just want to [ __ ] point out which kind of scares me you know because i just said that this isn't a fake card they wrote ingredients with that i so i n g r i n ingredients whatever in the ingredients it says cannabis oil natural terpenes all right instructions for use screw the cartridge onto the battery to ensure the best vaping we strongly recommend the pure one battery blah blah blah that's just advertising obviously for the brand inhale for at least three seconds exhale repeat they're not saying how many times you should inhale and exhale repeat but i'm assuming like three to four times should get you gently or modestly baked um if you want to take it to a whole other level obviously you're gonna spam the [ __ ] cartridge up until you can't feel your brain but i would not necessarily recommend that as a natural product the color of the oil may have a slight variation without sacrificing quality prolonged exposure to sunlight and heat will cause the cartridge to leak now the government warning this product contains cannabis a schedule one controlled substance which is not the case in canada because it is 100 percent legal keep out of reach of children and animals cannabis products may only be possessed or consumed by persons 21 years of age or older unless the person is a qualified patient the intoxicating effects of cannabis products may be delayed up to two hours i have never taken a cartridge where the delay is two hours it is generally like two minutes right like very rarely no actually it is i think impossible to smoke a joint or hit a cart and the effects hit you in two hours it's not inedible right cannabis use while pregnant or breastfeeding may be harmful consumption of cannabis products impairs your ability to drive and operate machinery please use extreme caution and then there's the final warning which is not the government warning this product can expose you to chemicals including pulagon which is known in the state of california to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm for more information go to www.whatever blah blah blah blah and then you have like the purevape website and purevape instagram with that out of the way we're gonna open up the box over here and i don't want to destroy it right because it is a very beautiful box so i'm just assuming you either push it up ah yeah wow a beautiful push feature wow and i could keep this because this is actually a beautiful packaging so i'm gonna put that on the side and now we got the pure vape cartridge wow the color of it looks amazing like it's not too clear right but it's not too brown it's a right in between color we got one full gram but we got it over here and this is what it looks like it is kind of transparent if you put it up in the sunlight honestly and the color isn't too dark right it's not the darkest i've seen but it's not the lightest color and it is obviously not the same color as the packaging as they said on the back the color may be different blah blah blah blah blah we got the vape cartridge turned on now and i will be putting it oh i turned it off oh [ __ ] i will be putting it on the lowest setting and going to medium and then going to high and i will be telling you guys like what best setting to hit it because there's different types of vape cartridges where if you hit it on a high setting it just burns completely the car other vape cartridges if you hit it on the low setting it just does not hit and sometimes you know the middle setting just doesn't work so you got to try it out all right i'm on the blue setting which is the lowest setting and we're just going to follow the instructions that are on the package so for best use inhale for at least three seconds exhale repeat so like i was saying i'm gonna inhale for three seconds exhale repeat three times for each temperature setting and then i'll be able to judge which setting is the best and tell you guys if it actually tastes good and then finally i'll take [ __ ] blinker because i know everybody wants me to take [ __ ] blinkers right but now the moment that you guys have been waiting for let's take the first three second puff so let's get it guys cheers what the [ __ ] [Music] why did that taste like dry pasta that wasn't the taste i was expecting what the [ __ ] like it literally caught me by surprise bro like i was expecting some sort of like stronger taste because it is like an indica and i was expecting like something you know a little fruity because like you know wiz khalifa og kind of a tropical fruity taste you know but no it tastes like dried [ __ ] pasta but i'll be taking another puff because like i said we're gonna repeat three times on each temperature setting so without further ado let's get it cheers guys okay on that second puff a little bit more fruity maybe needed a little bit time to you know heat up and activate um there's not much of that like you know tingling sense in the back of your ears and like inside of your eyeballs when you're hitting a cart there's not much of that to be honest with that second puff there's like a mix of like dried pasta and like fruity taste so i'll be taking the third and final puff on the lowest temperature setting so cheers guys well i'm just gonna be 100 honest after three rounds on the low temperature it did start to kick for me right i feel as if this was like a productive type of indica buzz because it's not really a body buzz it's not gonna like slouch you it's not gonna get you tired it's kind of like one of those productive ass buzzes in my opinion that's how it's feeling right but we will keep going up with the temperatures but we're on the [ __ ] red setting so that's the medium setting so let's see what the medium heat see if this shit's gonna start smacking and yeah let's get it guys cheers nice three second hit and wow okay the taste is way smoother so with a low temperature low setting it tastes like [ __ ] dry pasta with this it's just a fruity taste to it honestly it's maybe because the combustion is a little quicker but yeah i'm going to take the second puff on this one because it was super not harsh so cheers guys [Music] them three second puffs are very blessed [Music] overall this [ __ ] started to hit man you know the indica feeling is starting to creep up slowly maturely upon me right and i did get a full night of sleep so i'm not tired in that sense alright we will take the third and final puff of the medium setting let's get it guys cheers got that one all right so just overall the key difference with the medium setting is that the hit is a little smoother and it tastes a lot less like [ __ ] ala dente spaghetti you know what i mean so we're going to be moving on to the final heating temperature with the which is the highest temperature of the battery so we're going to be taking the three puffs off of this if there's a key difference or there's something to add i'll add it or else it's gonna be like some sort of i don't know three puff montage or whatever but let's get it guys cheers okay yeah i do have something to add with the high temp you can really taste the full amount the full flavor you know what i mean which is pretty sick so medium and high is better for for this strain there's like i said some other strains they prefer i guess low temperature to hit better but with the wuz khalifa og is tasting pretty pretty good so we'll take the second puff cheers guys nothing to add on that second puff so we'll go directly to the third one cheers just overall nine puffs in it really fries you like nine puffs in i was expecting to be a little slumped like a little you know all right guys this is future robin and i'm currently doing the outro because i just checked my computer checked the gopro and i just cannot find the rest of the video like for some reason it's just completely deleted maybe it got corrupted i don't know but i will be taking the blinker because obviously i promised you guys a blinker so i'm not gonna beat around the bush too much cheers guys alright this is like post post editing rob and i just gotta say that like i did hit a blinker i tried my absolute best to put my finger in a certain type of way where the camera would capture the actual blinking but like my dumbass kept my finger in front of the light so it did not appear in the video so you guys gotta take my word for it that i actually did hit a blinker and like i wouldn't be coughing uncontrollably and not being able to hold on the hit if i didn't take a blinker trust me on that take my word for it this is like post post editing rob i'm like on some omnipresent [ __ ] yeah okay i think i'm gonna leave now but god damn like i was saying the strain is very very like uplifting and it's not like a super indica for some reason like this train doesn't get you couch locked it doesn't give you that natural indica feeling it really uplifts you and it kind of gives you a boost of energy like i just took a blinker and i'm feeling up and at it right and i've been awake for like five six hours but besides the fact that the word ingredients is misspelled i really didn't join this cart and i do hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did drop a like please and hit that subscribe button if you haven't already check out all my social media

[Music] I'm feeling pretty strong man I was gonna stop the video while about kinda late to storm will push that stop window just move the screen it's just open this how was back home overseas no screen you just freakin you have like a stick to like it's a board yeah you walk in the house and you're ruled and there's no freaking windows you look on it was all boarded up that they just lift one of the board's up and just like popped open with a stick that's a window we never have screens well until we move to the other house but [Music] host worry buddy we're back back from taking this for Sochi for a test run check it out we're done well almost one little tiny nug left of this stuff and I've been hitting this thing the whole entire day since last night man nothing but the force oh gee we hit this right before bed waking banks mid morning before lunch after lunch before dinner and here we are on our after-dinner smoke and I figure you know might as well do the beer do the review right now since well since all we've got is this anyways anyhow wonderful straight man she's a book she's kind of well balanced hi to her and this is something you could definitely medicate throughout the day while she's a 50/50 hybrid so but she's nice man um I was buzzing all over she's very stony but a functional stone kind of uplifting stone to it but very functional at least that's how I felt I could pretty much do anything with this train I keep drive around no problem doing paperwork was no problem playing video games watching movies she does have some focused attentiveness to her so she's a great social smoke um but I love the the body buzz on this thing it's kind of tingly and I was feeling that this morning man I hit this on the wake and bacon I was feeling good I went out for do my shopping and everything I was like mmm wonderful shot I wouldn't mind grabbing this again she would get the shatter next time anyhow we got a bowl loaded up right here take a quick hit show you what the coughs are like and uh talking to it more about their strain on the force oh gee [Music] this is one of strains that I give you those no lids brah I caught myself I looked in the browser damn I'll freakin sealed up tight and everything by last night was medicating with this I came to take a shower I was like wizard about nothing oh man she's a groovy strain to medicate weird though especially we got some good news it's reggae I'm grateful dead or something I did her a pretty productive day I got my dishes done get some cleaning and I was pretty happy with this I did my grocery shopping so was it like it hindered me in any way but it is a good daytime strain to medicate with and I kind of feel like if you got the right people around just the good strength she's very sociable and kind of opens you up any sense of my experience with it I can kind of feel it in the head area mostly in the face it is actually where it seems to be I feeling it first Oh brah this might be the Aloha Bowl just jam up in there these are some pretty solid nugs all the dance squeeze them mmm I know this probably somebody watching my video right now just get a grinder dude I like this man you know I've kind of missed this with shatter I'm a smoky shatter for later to be honest man there was just right up to now just recently I was doing shower like it's all I was medicating I never went looking for flour you know and I kind of didn't cuz I forgot what I was missing you know that kind of stuff we can you feel those you smell them I miss this stuff man I'm used to grow and used to like trim you edia and get the finger hash just wore your fingers up like this and put on your bulb I miss growing man mmm I wasn't like a super good core but I was I had fun with it you know I really did anyways for Shoji oh man I'm already feeling this stuff about right here I wouldn't say it's a dating but I'm definitely feeling that that Mazar maybe that's in there mmm the Mazar through the skywalker it's cross with blueberry mmm I'm feeling good have a nice good swim let's think about Arizona even though it's like hard like you'd go swim at night man mmm my favorite thing to do during the monsoon season when I get the lightning storm and I said no more swimming I like it man I just float around do be out and just watch out a lightning man say you're across the sky like miles man they got some really beautiful lightning storms here no they did like seriously man [Music] [Music] one of the things I really liked about this strain was that it gave me that tingly body buzz that really nice stone while not like stoning me out completely I wasn't all vege down or couched out I was stoned Bellis function on mm-hmm it was wonderful was a good strength to medicate with so again definitely grab this again man this is the Aloha Bowl back home in Hawaii that's what we call the last one now like if you playing volleyball or whatever ball and you get the game point the game ball one the last you know oh let's call it the Aloha ball so let's call this the Aloha Bowl my last ball the Aloha Bowl the GPE go oh ho bold mmm the force og a good strain for just going and doing stuff man you know if you're not having fun having a hard time you're blending in and just not your day not getting into the funk of things you know this is a good strength oh man probably good on the temperament cuz it puts you in a kind of groovy mood you just kind of wanna everything just chill everything's I agree you know mm-hmm I guess how I'm feeling right now I'm like oh man I'm sitting alongside the floor on the pool probably roll up a doobie or something that's more of that matter which I think still gonna finish this bow bruh oh smoking the for Sochi use the force Harry Harry that's all she wrote guys the forest old Jean a wonderful strain Bach would definitely grab this again", "odQXb9Y868U": "what up YouTube how's everybody doing time for another update over here in our garden and we've had better weeks over here I've definitely had some problems this week up with the heat it's pretty funny because right at the end of the last update I'm not saying I'm so glad this [ __ ] heat wave is over and then sure enough [ __ ] day later get hit with another heat wave got to like 104 over here was pretty crazy so as I took out the last week as I took out the big asset fee that was over here I dropped the light and I think I dropped it too low because you guys can tell she yellowed out a little bit and that one not as much but she did and I I could tell definitely that i scented their growth because when I topped them it took him a long time to get there second pops this one that suffered the least you could tell that she still has some yelling but not as much as other ones on she developed her tops a lot faster so this one suffered the least out of the the newest ones this is a gorilla glue number for this is a gorilla glue number four and they're the same [ __ ] aged ones and dwc ones in cocoa I [ __ ] this one up a little bit but she'll be all right I'm nourishing her back tails as she was actually a little bit more yellow two days ago so she's already starting to green up so you know [ __ ] not everything can go as soon as you wanted to but you know as long as you can fix your problems it's all good and our sfv OG over here in cocoa she was in number one pot i stitched her to a number 3 pot and she was almost she was just about to be rebound when I did her transplant her circle her roots were already starting to circle at the bottom so it was actually really easy just a transplant her just kind of tap the pot a little bit on all sides and rather send picked it right up she picked up everything I have a he's play pellets or um yeah hydroton at the bottom of my pots before the cocos there and they were grabbing all the height of turn it was pretty cool really good root structure on that plan so I might leave her in here I don't know another week or two and then take her to flower just top her a little bit more push her out a little bit more than ticket of flour so in two weeks she'll be going to flower this girl right here she's really surprising me this terrifically number four she's awesome he's just awesome doing so good pushing out really nice he has really good structure very nice plan very nice plan so these are our cuttings that we took about seven days ago so they've been in here seven maybe eight days but my guess is they've been in here seven days and you got one right there the starting to root so that's really cool I did take more care take better care of these I didn't let the temperatures get too extreme over here so this round you know was a lot better for me when it gets this hot you really have to be more vigilant with your clones and make sure their environments all right because yeah I [ __ ] them up two times in a row and that's the reason why I don't have my Wi-Fi anymore so I can't let that [ __ ] happen anymore but we hope she picks up next week should start seeing her green up a little bit more I'm glad that my prosperity and suffer as much or my Earthshaker og yet they still did I could still tell there's yellowing so but not too bad overall not too bad really happy with that gorilla glue really [ __ ] happy okay guys and basically the same [ __ ] problem over here got really hot and she started to getting like a nitrogen deficiency if you guys can tell some of these needed this one is a lot more yellow yellow doubt this one over here my cocoa one seems to be doing a lot better and she's starting to stack up a lot more thoroughly than my rockville one so with this last feeding you know I bumped up there cal mag I bumped up their nitrogen just you know just to try to correct those deficiencies in them but right now there I there in there six weeks they got I'm going to give them another week and a half of newts and then start flushing them out and I want to finish them right at eight and a half weeks and last but not least we got our sfv OG this big beautiful girl right here yeah this lady right here she's been in she's been in flower [ __ ] for just one week so now that she's been in here one week she's actually made it to her light she's doing really good right now I'm gonna I'm gonna lollipop her really nice to hear and back there atlas paper bags we got our big DWC Wi-Fi plant she's you know doing her thing drying up in there I trimmed her up before i put her in the bag so there's nothing but nugs in there and i've mentioned it before I don't like doing a dry trim I don't like all these little leaves in here you know once these buds are mature and they're bigger these leaves in here when they dry up they suck up into the button it's a [ __ ] half we're trying to get in there trying to trim it that way that's why I like getting a wet trim and I seem to be I seem to get the best results in the neatest trim from my my buds that way and anyone else that I have helped me when when I have dry plants and I have them help me trim those they [ __ ] hate that [ __ ] so everyone else hates it too not just me everyone else that I have helped me trim plants and [ __ ] they don't like doing dry trims they [ __ ] hate it so you know wet trim is probably the best way to go as long as you got some gloves you should be all good so that's pretty much everything that's one on our garden this week I want to thank everyone for stopping by checking on my videos I appreciate if you guys hit that like button every once in a while but other than that I want to want to take care stay safe out there stay faded peace everyone", "-4Sm6krDN4M": "hey the kid who needs are you ready I like weed I really really really like weed so much that if the moment arrived I gladly beat your ass for one ball even though you're my brother I like weed I like balls I even like the leave those games and seeds coming out I still have to see welcome to between two strains uh today we have Josh which is one of the originators of the og movement strain that we all love so much thank you for being on thanks for having me on my pleasure man and tell me something about yourself man where you from I'm from the east coast from New Jersey but moved out here to San Fernando Valley and when I was 14 that was in 1987 and grew up basically here in the valley until about 91 and moved over into Los Angeles nice no how long have you been taught to beg for been doing this better part of 20 plus years I know we're sitting next to one of yours I think you're sitting next to one of yours this it is this is the club 33 what does that streaming to you this strain is defined my life you know where I've moved my work getting this strain out to people so they could have this I always believed that it was some of the finest smoke and it's been a pleasure being a part of it this long I feel I mean I feel blessed to absolutely for crossing paths with this strain when I got it and that was at the very beginning so extremely fortunate to still be working with her and in that now more than ever people get to enjoy her all over the world I get to hear about it and just I take great joy in that oh now you know when I started when I started growing too basically the game was people grew in soil and there were people growing you know indoors in Los Angeles but really I think the hydro game in the mid-90s is what really changed things including this strange so this strain hit the streets at the same time I believe that a new way of growing was developing indoors in Los Angeles let's let's let's get to this the og story how did you get well um in 1996 I had been looking for a place to live and I had two buddies from Florida an old friend in the new friend moved from Gainesville at just finished school at University of Florida we ended up moving into a town house in Silver Lake California at this point I was looking for a house that I could growing for the first time and one of the guys his name's Matt Bubba people know him as and he was one of my roommates so together we kind of you know started growing into this house and he at that time kept talking about this strain that was in Florida and at the time I was growing no5 Hawaiian and l5 purple indica and all these other strains I had gone from Marc Emery up in Canada so he you know I tell him there's no way that you have something better in Florida that we have here in Cali already um so I kind of like edged him on and egged him on and he went out there and he went out there and got some cuts flew back with him in his pocket on the plane and brought it to our place and then showed me how to how to clone and we ended up getting a couple of those plants to root one of them was a cush and there was another one it was a Bubba and there was another variety too that ended up getting phased out did you think it was going to be as big as it was absolutely not oh there's no way like any of us could know what we had right you know though we were of course searching for the best I mean that's what growers do and when we first harvested and had the first taste you know then we knew as we sat there and I mean that was a most stoned I think any of us had been at least for me you know it seemed like somebody forgot to pay the rent for like two months and we smoked it all until it was gone and then it was like wow what the hell was that you know but I had clones of her so we already had another room going and and we were really excited about really real excited about it except that it didn't produce very much I don't that was not you know that was that was the big that was something to be conquered later on you know yeah yeah you definitely conquered that one well I see a lot of people have yeah yeah it's pretty it's pretty great to see what other people are doing I mean I was never I never considered myself you know like a top grower it's been fun to watch now like other communities and other people I know take it to a whole new level and then everybody's sharing the information I mean the the amount of good information now out there that's being shared is incredible I mean I think that is a basis for people to be enjoying you know enjoying this plant at its top form and all over the place I mean that's kind of a new thing right oh geez still hard to come by she's hard to grow right I'd love to light one of these up with you man I got this one you got that one let's just let them both let's just let it both yeah just swap that because it's forever that one's one the other ones the other so just be appropriate so as we light these up man I I think this is the most common question anyone gets asked sure they're in the industry and they're like a budtender you know rowers and all this other stuff that do grow oh gee what does og stand for okay Oh G stands for original okay it was to me it was original to my small crew here that were growing it it was original it turned into original gangster because we live Los Angeles I believe though that the original gangsta wasn't the first name that was added to it to to define this variety you know it was like imagine going around and after the first year of its existence after it had got around town a little because before this strain came out of our crew it was not in Los Angeles so this was a new thing for everybody and people of course started calling um I'll take this yeah we do like that um it was the first time people started calling other varieties that they had cush to sell it so here we were trying to like you know say we were like what kind of cush is this that was the first time it was like well it's the original cush and then you know there are some guys in my circle who were like is the og cush then it turned to the odors and then that was kind of something well we all know that there are different names for this variety as it travelled to different hands to different houses to different counties different cities you know people call it ocean groan I hear that a lot people like it that's cool if it's grown by the ocean for them and they want to call it oh gee ocean grown I mean that to me is fine but it's also to our original circle conative it kind of funny you know because they're claiming in a way as if they had produced that straight they had created that stream and in no way shape or form did I create that strain I was just lucky that it came into my hands here in Los Angeles I was a dedicated grower and I was dedicated to getting some good flowers out there I was happy when I came across the cush I mean it changed my life it created a whole movement out here know the fact that it was oh gee cush after a few years of that then we walked in it's like well what kind of og cush is it you know that it's like you hear all these different varieties coming on talked about this club 33 right next to you actually this is your cut but it is also same as the Illuminati cut right that we do it to coast right exactly it's the same thing the club 33 is just another good example of the plant being cared for by somebody else at a different location and it's with their personality and their style of growing changes the plant in ways because the plants adaptive the resin profile usually stays the same oh but you know the structure and the overall I would say you know quality of the plant and changes you know from from different hands so you know you would expect that right now if you gave the same ingredients to different chefs it would come out you know the dish would always come out different you know and the plan actually adapts to different environments it's fun to watch different the same cut that I had go to different parts of the city even the world and seeing you know how it comes out in different areas different altitudes it's pretty awesome yeah where else can anyone else get you know good if you want the original ojika you can come to coast-to-coast it's the club 33 and the Illuminati this is the this is the same strain that's been going on for 23 years now and if anybody's interested in getting touch with me they can go to my Instagram which is the real og cush story also I just like to give a shout out to the bakery in Seattle my good friends out there and to Oregon kid he's up there and making his way and give a shout out to Soto hydro best hydro store I've ever been to and if you want to see some of my product and it'll be at the bakery in Seattle um and dude I like to thank you very very much too for sitting between two strains with me it's been extremely informative and my head feels very heavy yeah great thank you so much man yeah not so sure thanks for having me on again please thank you this song's done so excuse me while I smoke some weed you", "kvg7etiw8t0": "all right so we're out here right now we do another video and the stranger we got for today is Kirkwood Oh Jean good stuff man and looks like this is uh I guess breaking or oh I like this stuff man I like when it comes on nice it's so cool to check out I love that hello Mei Mei minutes come on nice up you know not just like some parchment paper some guys got his back pocket you know it looks like a lot of time in stuff went into that really wonderful beautiful stuff so we're gonna adapt on this right now I'm actually adapting on this I just make a video you think about it mm-hm what make you one right now hmm all right this is good stuff Kirkwood OG mmm Kirkwood OG is OG Kush crossed with face-off Fuji as soon as I heard that Isaac Oh Frank yeah I love face-off OG and og cush is a classic everybody loves og cush and I was really expecting this to be like a super potent indica but it turns out you know when I was checking online about this stuff there are some people saying that this is a sativa dominant somewhere saying it's indica dominant hmm from what I could experience this feels like it's in the codominant to me but it feels almost kind of well balancing it'd be like a 60/40 or something like that you know it uh it's got this really nice body I and it's also got this kind of a beat cerebral high and you're it's it's really nice because even though you're buying super well out you're super chilled you got a pain relief going on your mind is still blissful it's really really really really nice and I like this I would totally get Kirkwood OG again and at first I wasn't you know because I said crack well gee it just didn't have any kind of indications that it's gonna be something good you know it didn't seem exciting then it's not exciting or some kind of a state park or something like that I said Kirkwood she mm-hm that's where that Costco strain was that Kirkland mmm but I was like honesty I was dating huh huh and then I decided check it out and I did some research on it and I think I love face-off and love oh gee crucial since I read that like mmm I gotta get some and I'm glad I did because this nice taste - it's got a sweet herbally pungency kind of like a chemical fuel in the way a little bit but it's nice I was expecting to be really couch lacking but I mean there is a bit of locked in us it just comes at the end I mean you got some time to play around with the strain like me right now I mean I'm buzzing hard right now but operative I'm like it's kind of like this is good for like to get anti-social if you're antisocial also good for stuff like bipolar a DD ADHD things like that because the highest kind of you know it's kind of focused in a way it's really really nice mmm anyways get this price or keep the party going huh beep dang really really wonderful and it seems to be hit pretty quick pain relief sorry about that pain relief seem to be a bit of a creeper the hi hit quick though very stony but an upbeat stone it's really nice I like it yeah it's great there's like but there is munchies there's cottonmouth there's a little bit of dry eyes and it is the crash but you know there here's some time before it crashes darling you're not gonna dislike start block no when he hit this you know this isn't like that it's got some it's got a epidemis to it though in the initial high and even when you're on even when the body high so I'll just taking over and get some really a sleepy lethargic then you feel something you can just go sleep but it's really really nice and yeah I wouldn't get this again Kirkwood oh gee it's good stuff", "vipqA9qv-LA": "you Oh G stands for overgrow calm all the stuff that came off of that was from that one website there was more knowledge about cannabis put on that one website over a five-year period then the rest of the world has now combined when that place went down in a car to get information out they rip the heart out of like the whole movement for a long time for what we know for true knowledge OD kuce is surrounded in a bunch of mystery right now and I know most of people that was involved in getting it made and one of those things that happen spontaneously when I was even went down three or four breeders such as myself and a couple of other people's best stock was just used to make that and its really like skunk number one it's so true true breeding how so many people have it certain jijaji curses also open ended it can be bred with it doesn't have the Terminator gene in it it's been bred in so many different projects now that that genes spread across the scene that it's going to be hard to remove it my problem with it is is it tends to harm me very easily just like a train wreck one it's like it really wants to show our methodism it's sad of its genome and I personally don't like working with them there's a couple variants of it that are all right but myself but what you're trading and yield and what you have to do in hormone tricks to get the plant to do it there's other ones the same thing but the pedigree on it is really hidden a mystery of BS and I refuse to play along with you I know three different rumors on it but I can tell from smoking at what I think is in it and when we get done with these DNA tests in the future I'll let you know for sure what's it in my experience I've seen OG Kush groaning everyone that you can grow it in and it's um I didn't think he could be wrong it's more with it about finding your own phenotype that's why there's so many different variants of it people crossed it with a hundred different other things as well but really it's about getting 100 or 200 seeds and find that one point you like out of it because it tends to harm me 41 and 42 some of them want a fox tail and there's a bunch of the variance early to have problems so it really depends on where you get your clothes or your seeds that's one of the ones it's mostly grown from calm to I'm not seeing to me people selling other states LG crusing voted out of 50 days and I've seen it but out of 70 days please I how much like you put on it high co2 you give it it's one of those ones its metabolism is very critical to how much yields you get and how dense it is and how fast about it and then how much dark you give it has to do it how much crystals on it oh gee Christians another one of the ones where it gives it you get what you know about it if you do it right you do everything right you can get some decent yields if you don't it's your crappy year door that's why so exclusive I think people go see a green one bud I've seen outdoor OG Kush plants ever elected beds for six months of car treaties in LA really depends on how much you know how to put the hormones into and the vitamins to the plant because really the light feeds the point you", "hn3vgDQf8rs": "peaceful of you to have another stream review today we're looking at triangle cush triangle crushes the indica dominant it's an OG on it originates out of Florida when I first heard triangle I thought about our California the ELMO triangle but on extra South Florida and it's um OTS from Miami Tampa and Jacksonville they went in to making this particular og strain called triangle is a triangle G is very good it's um very um very good oh gee you know enemy has classic og taste smell the more pungent you know it has more pungent citrus funky dinky smell with it it pretty much tastes like I would smell is very um citrus um terpenes but if you ever see this I would definitely recommend it to anybody I'm pretty sure that on nobody will be on disappointed in this is some very good indicator you know anyway it's very powerful is good

milky and seeing how clear and opaque it is I still about forty percent clear still able to see through it on the stems of the trichomes and and the tips of the trichomes you is still clear it's not

there uh this this unit is really really nice i already went into the settings and i set in a hit extender of 30 seconds because i don't like to have to keep resetting the heating cycle and this is

grab a little bit here it says do not fill it more than a quarter of the way up well i don't intend on putting quite that much in there it's a pretty big bowl actually but uh said try to keep it off the sides and down into the center but with this kind of consistency sometimes it doesn't want to cooperate and stay where you want it to be but we'll see how this handles it i have not tried it yet like i said i just finished uh getting it all charged up got it set to blue because i like blue and uh we're gonna drop this there's the atomizer heating plate is this right here and i went through the process of centering that so you drop this on top and then the cover has silicone on top and it's magnetic which is really cool so you just drop that right on top and everything everything looks good inside okay carb cap this is made for cold starts i have this set to 420 degrees so i'm just going to hold it in and start the process all right it says it's heating and let me know when it gets to full temp and we'll take a hit see what it is big shout out to peace water that's what i've got this filled with okay peace water keeps your uh your rigs and your dab rigs clean at temperature here we go cheers everybody wow it is super super tasty oh yeah the night thing i like about this is that you can set that head extender to keep it heated for up to 60 seconds i like to take a few hits this allows me to not have to keep restarting the heating process nice there's still a little bit of residue in there but best practices just swab it out between sessions it has a built-in safety system that if you try to run it too many times in a row it won't it it'll operate between the safe temperatures so you can't damage the unit and now it's ready for another another hit this isn't a real long video i just wanted to show off how it works super impressed with this with peace water solution in here it should uh go quite a while before needing to be cleaned uh you'll be seeing me use this a lot as much as you've been seeing me use the uh the dab x you're gonna see me use this i did pay full full price for this i did not uh this is not a promotional model um but i've been looking at this right alongside the puffco peak and the puffco peak and the carta the the pro models and everything else and what really sold me on getting this particular device over the others the puffco peak pro is way more money this at retails 299. i got it on a website that was selling it from 249 with my veterans discount on top of that it came down to 220. so i looked up and got this device really really uh at a good price now it's gonna of course come down i'm sure but the thing that i liked most about looking at people who had peaks and i'd never owned one of those was the amount of aftermarket glass that they make for those peaks some beautiful art glass well this thing you can buy i didn't purchase it myself but i intend to at some point is purchasing a an adapter that lets you use any uh puffco peak glass or aftermarket art glass on this device which to me makes it worth a whole lot more value not that there's anything wrong with the one that comes with it it's fantastic it's nice and smooth but i think that there's a lot of people a lot of artists out there who have already designed a lot of pieces for the peak and i think that this is a a nice device because you can actually not have to to put those on a shelf and not use them so uh first impressions highly impressed with the design of it it also has pass-through charging so i can leave it plugged in and fully charged and be able to use it and not have to worry about the battery going down they say at full temp which is 600 degrees by the way that this thing will last uh 20 cycles i don't intend on taking it to 600 degrees 420 seems to be really nice for for rosin um i may experiment up or down with that as time goes on and kind of dial things in but again first impressions of this device are just it's really straightforward it's well built the air path is completely stainless through here when you lift this cover off you're you're basically looking right at the air path and it is just looks like it's going to be super easy to keep clean it's high flow you get a lot of nice nice flow out of this thing when you're using it so i am i am suitably impressed uh with this device and and i knew i would be from watching the videos i'm i'm the kind of guy that usually takes a while to purchase something i have to watch some comparison videos i have to see how it rates against other devices and for the price i paid for this for sure but even even compared to like the uh the puffco peak pro i think this is a superior device it's got a bigger battery it's got uh you don't have to use a an app to get the most out of the device like you do with the peak um it is definitely more robust than some of the knockoffs or some of the lesser e-rigs that are out there this is not a replacement for like my my dab x rocket that's a completely different use case but for somebody that wants an all-in-one system and this is also set up apparently that you can drive herb in it so it's very well explained on the box how it comes apart the atomizer itself is a permanent unit that rarely needs to be replaced whereas most other e-rigs that you see out there you have to replace those atomizers every so often because they go bad apparently this is set up to to really be designed to be rugged and reliable so i'll be doing a lot of videos featuring this when i do rosin review videos and things like that so you'll be seeing it a lot you can get one at uh hi hi5vape.com i believe that is the website hi5vape.com and uh i don't have any affiliate links i don't get sponsored like i said i paid i paid for this so um i just wanted to show everybody how how nice it works uh again this is my first usage of it and i am i'm impressed it works every bit as good as the videos from the guys who get paid to do this do it um but uh definitely again big shout out to peace water i really love uh the uh uh the the water that you have for these rigs and bongs it keeps everything nice and clean i use it in my rigs and my dab dab straws and nectar collectors so thanks for joining me for this video stay safe stay medicated be good to each other i'm out", "AzcBBQe-DC8": "welcome back cloud Sam today
