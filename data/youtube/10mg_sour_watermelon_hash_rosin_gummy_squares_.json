{"icuI3WpxQxk": "hi I'm Cass and this is honey and we're here with Matt Natalie and beautiful green sea to retreat into phyno and we are about to do the coolest thing we are making on our gummies so not Natalie they're the experts and they are going to show us so what's step one oh well first of all you want to get yourself some cannabis so this is purple blue so have a look at that and maybe you can pick a decent size and I'll go to that that we can chip apart a little bit maybe they're all done man that number to which you could have a look at a little darker so you both can go ahead and pick some cannabis out of that bag just how much can we pick maybe something close to 2 3 grams whatever feels right you can either choose a big mug or even just a few small notes we're gonna switch this down I'm not to a compressed pop okay so that's gonna be one of the first steps once we've picked out the cannabis so we are making these gummies from rosin so it's a solvent list product so it's a great canvas extract you don't need to use like any weird chemicals or solvents or anything like that so it's a super exciting way to D carb and income means a hundred percent it sounds like yeah pretty much all using is sweet and a bit of pressure to squeeze out the trichomes off of those buds so we're gonna have an extraction process to remove what we want off of the buds and you can play around with the different heats and pressures so the idea is to maybe find the ultimate way to get a great yield of different strains might be different pressures different temperatures so there's a bit of a science to it and a bit of a logging process to see if you can dial this in and get as much out of it as possible what are you doing here so we are going to pre press the flower so basically you're gonna weigh out how much cannabis you're using and we are friends at rose and unity have created this amazing database program it's online so you go to rosin unity our OS I am you and I - I gotta come and you can love all your information so you're going to want to weigh your flour and then you can track it so there's gonna be a little spa there it says how much weight and I'm gonna say 2.5 grams of cannabis and now we're going to put it into this crazy little 3d printer puck press that resin you'll be babe that's good and you're just gonna press it that's the muscle in this room right now I'm gonna let him and we status it is there a way that you could do this that you couldn't press it that hard is there like a machine that you could buy that we're doing are well in some in some presses you put them in a little baggy a little screen it'll lose through but in this case it's just parchment paper so you do need the puck in a sense to make this approach go down mm-hmm so there's a company called Kanna clamp and that's who we're gonna press our Roselyn today which reminds me we should fire them up yeah and they the Kanna clamps come with a little press a little box press so it's like that but instead of a circular puck it is a rectangle and so if you buy a set it kind of clips you will get one of those presses with it right in a sense but the kind of line look at that no there we are we've got ourselves a bit fragile actually you're a nice step president as impressed as possible so now we're gonna weigh that puck again just to double-check so at 2.3 to you or a 2.5 we're also gonna wear our parchment paper before we get anywhere further with this process so on the data base it's going to say paperweight in so this is just your paper parchment paper as it is culinary parchment from paper chef is the best rosin parchment paper to use paper chef's you should probably just make Brussels paper we're gonna basically fold it twice and make a little pocket this is mechanically they're made in the States so it's basically a hair straightener on steroids yeah amazing it's really easy to use one button to turn it on side button turns it up so you can try two different temperatures again you get to log them on your AWS and unity to see what temperature you squish that and see what your yield is like the one thing about the can of clamps it's important is first of all they get hot so do send them down on a silicon mat to protect your comb and the second thing is that you want to make sure you line up your bud in the middle of the clamp so you want to make sure that you're squishing the whole bud and the whole pot in otherwise you'll miss some of the squish so preferably the puck is centered so none of it is gonna okay those guys venture sure cos okay now I don't have much pressure on this yet but we're gonna want to start a timer as soon as I do apply some heavy pressure and from there we'll just see what happens all right I'm not quite there yet once I'm feeling I would say there's some pressure there now and you're at 225 so there we go let's do this so I'm gonna clamp this in as aggressively as I can't we're gonna get this nice and tight the handle is plastic so I'm not gonna go crazy and we're just gonna wait this is pretty accessible though like this isn't totally large of an appliance to have yeah and as the heat compresses this puck I'm able to actually squish down even further so over the minute now we're just over a minute I've actually squeezed it in even further what is the last thing we let it go to two minutes all of this information so the big thing is people are excited about what they've switched with turning this unit you're done is the main safety feature because these are hot so that is the one disclaimer to be careful is turning this off between squishes okay so this is your rosin here it is all this liquid here so you always get like a little clam better pop and don't throw these away because these are still good you can like melt these in with butter you make popcorn topping so they can't recycle then tomorrow can you maybe tilt that towards the camera so they can see what we got out of that now how its strong would you say that is well we'll find out we're gonna win see actually what kind of return on the switch we got we'll see exactly how much we have here and from there we can get a better idea how much rosin we have all right so everybody can huddle in and have a close look at this because any basic dab tool we'll just go ahead and clean all this stuff it'll all stick together so once you've got a clump going you can just literally almost like vacuuming the parchment it all just comes together and actually that may be why you're right it's really yeah it really is this was actually a nice consistency array of squish and just like that we've squished that bud and we've collected all the rosin so that was a an extraction just like that Wow yes it really is and this will be what we D carb activate and use for our edibles so we're gonna take the rose and look at addy carbon in the oven at 275 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes so we have preheated the oven to 275 and you're just gonna put it in a mason jar and cause a lid on it that's going to be carbon because Robin you don't get enough heat from squishing it to be carpet so you're just gonna get a little bit more for your cannabis if you and your awesome if you put it in the oven first so what does D carbon mean then her so deep carbonate is basically activating the cannabis so that once you put it into an ethylene it and your stomach acids will break it down so if you didn't decarbonise aim effect at all that's right yeah okay there we go two minutes all right blue represent movies well the stuff comes the long way to get old lady should now remaking rosin as well and rosin you know what your yield is so on that purple blue we've got a 13 percent yield no not bad 20 percent yield is like pretty fantastic they're not all beggars look at that yeah cool so that will make the bulk of our edibles all right from 30 minutes 30 minutes start your timer so you know so you want to use a quarter cup of water with your bus with yellow whatever flavor you desire no super classy weird jello gummies Angelica mystic so we only had a third cup measuring so you want to stir it yeah red her Brides putting a half gram of rosin if we had a larger ER with more rosin it would swirl more efficiently no we're scraping there yeah we got it nice a second in goes the jelly into the bowl to later go into the molds all right everyone get to see ours Easter Island bolt can't fire grotto like that show to the campfire Stern had to give him something and probably see him on the weekend at the event let me get out of your way Oh gonna put him in that fridge Emily and this guy says the fridge for 20 minutes so look at them how long were these in the fridge for these goes-- were like 22 minutes in the fridge we're just testing out this ice cube tray and it's silicone we did line it with an oil I would recommend using like a coconut oil we use pen a lot well because that's when we had access to it just helps it slide out [Applause] yeah Roz I love these I caught these perfect they make these in like 40 minutes a lot like mr. Z Z is making a cheesecake and so we use half gram of rosin so it's 250 milligrams and we broke it up over 500 their food was I don't know 15 milligrams per piece 40 so I would like start slow you know well it depends where you'll feel like this day don't give that to your grandma you taught us that such a clear easy awesome way and now I have these delicious affordable when I make gifts thank you thank you and huge other two rows in unity for hooking us up they showed us Ryan at rosa unity you go follow them at Rose music on Instagram they're killing it they go to super cool Rosen database and he showed us how to make these two days ago and now we're spreading the love and you guys I see it and we have been looking for and specific resin edibles and now we can make them thank you so much Matt and Ali and you have an amazing story and you're gonna hear about it on our show regular Canadians enjoying weed so with Cass and honey now check them out this time thanks green sea to retreat for having us here gasps gunfire we're hooking up today yeah it's been a [ __ ] wicked day all your eggs edibles this day has been absolutely perfect and kind of interesting so this is just gel our Joan something that kids know how to make thank you", "iNlZ66flp1o": "what's up guys today we're gonna smash an eighth of wifi cake and then we're gonna test our rosin thc percentage on our sage analytics machine after that we're going to infuse our rosin with some butter and show you how to do the math to properly dose your servings let's get started by setting up our bag bottle text style [Music] and now we're going to heat our plates up to 240 degrees fahrenheit so we can decarb our rosin so we're going to head over to our tester we're going to start off by calibrating our machine next we're going to have to specify what we are measuring we're going to choose rosin we're going to input our strain after we set our parameters we have to clean the measurement window next we're going to measure the empty cell then we're going to add our sample raws into the empty cell place it on the machine and hit calculate wi-fi cake is definitely potent clocking in at 68 total thc now let's take the rest of our rosin toss it in our decarb capsule and we're going to decarb our rosin at 240 degrees fahrenheit for 20 minutes once our rosin is de-carbed we're going to toss it in the freezer because it'll be much easier to collect and add to our butter next let's add some water to our double boiler and bring the water to a boil go ahead and throw in your butter and let it melt when your butt is pretty melted go ahead and grab your rosin add it to your butter and make sure to stir occasionally until your rosin completely dissolves check this out this is how to do the math to properly dose the equation is pretty simple all you do is you take the amount of rosin you extracted you multiply that by your total thc content that gets multiplied by 10 and then you divide that by the number of servings we figure this butter has about eight servings so each serving is going to have a little less than 82 and a half milligrams of thc thanks for watching and please dose accordingly let us know in the comments below what you plan on making with your rosin infused butter hey guys make sure you check us out at nugsmasher.com to check out all of our awesome products we also have tons of great information on our site including calculator tools and terp files be sure to check us out there at nugsmasher.com", "SM12-6QEfLI": "what's up everybody we're here in the smash lab and today we're gonna be making some very very strong THC oil using 17 different rosin pucks [Music] the thing about these rosin pucks is they are still loaded with THC we haven't been pressing super high pressure lately we've been doing around 650 to 700 so there is a lot of rosin left over in these the great thing is we've got a new teach egg tester so we're gonna find out just how many milligrams is left inside this oil at the end the last video you saw when our boss drank that entire thing he was completely loaded we are gonna find out just how many milligrams that was and we anticipate this one's gonna be a lot stronger so stay tuned to see just what the measurement comes out to we'll start by getting a little bit of coconut oil 60 milliliters and our beaker over there and warm that up to about 140 degrees for 5 minutes alright so there's our 60 milliliters what we're gonna do is add it to this larger beaker because we're gonna be putting the pucks inside here we need a little bit more space [Music] all right so we're gonna let that heat up for a few minutes it's at about 170 degrees right now okay so our oil is now at around 125 degrees we're gonna go ahead and start adding our pucks like I said we have 17 bucks right here if you want to take a look at these you can see these things are cake this thing has got a nice yellow color still kind of sticky smells great wish you guys could smell this we're gonna start by adding 2 at a time try to save a little time here so I'll take these two right here take a look at these I want you to see what they look like before and after they're gonna be a lot more clear and that oil is gonna be bright yellow by the time I'm done with these two so let's go ahead and have these in there make sure they're fully submerged and boom as you can see we can easily add two at a time in here as we lose a little bit of oil we might have to drop down to one at a time so this all depends on how much oil you're using [Music] all right so it's been about five minutes we're gonna go ahead and take a look at these pugs make sure we got all the rosin outside of them it was about five minutes and we're doing two at a time it's important to know that you can even do seven to ten minutes depending on how your puffs look after we're gonna take a look right now you can see that the oil is already a completely different color than it was originally so these do look pretty clear we'll probably go ahead and let those sit for about two more minutes make sure we get everything out and then we'll completely remove them [Music] okay so it's been two more minutes let's go ahead and remove these our first one here as you can see that was a lot more clear take a look at our oil here it's got a nice yellow color it was originally clear so we're gonna do is go ahead and squeeze the rest of the oil out of these pucks here okay so our first two pucks got them right here as you can see those things are really clear we pulled a lot of rosin out of those here's a one we haven't done yet next one we have done as you can see there's a lot of rosin inside of these puck still what we're gonna do is bill the other 15 bucks in there on a time lapse to save you guys time and go ahead and see how this oil tests out at the end okay so that was the last puck we just did all 17 as you can see these are completely clear now we pulled all the rosin out of those as you can see the oil is way dark way darker than last time we assume is gonna be very potent we're gonna go ahead and test it out but first we've got Adi carbon so let's get that last puck out of there [Music] okay so we just removed that last puck and we turned the temperature up a little bit on our hot plate we're trying to get around that 220 to 240 degrees range we're gonna let that boil sit there for about 10 minutes so we can de carve this is gonna activate all the THC that's inside that oil this should take about 10 minutes but we're gonna pay attention to the bubbles that are forming as you see those bubbles that means it's d carving and once those disappear you're pretty much good to go [Music] okay so next we're going to do is take a nug Smasher 37 micron bag and strain the oil through it what that's going to do is get rid of any of that plant material was left over [Music] all right so what were left with is 20 milliliters of completely activated THC oil what we're gonna do is use our new teach egg test machine a lot of you have been recommending this to us you really want to know how many milligrams of THC was in a in the oil when we were done what this does is it uses light to analyze the oil and give us the total cannabinoid count we know that flour that we pressed was predominantly THC however if you were doing heme it would give you the CBD results as well the only thing is it only tests up to 15 milligrams of THC or total cannabinoids per milliliter so we're gonna have to dilute our rosin oil right here in a twenty to one ratio with coconut oil so we'll do that now all right so let's get our scale zeroed we're gonna add a point 400 grams of clean coconut oil right here alright next we're gonna add point O two of our rosin oil [Music] turn this on alright so we're testing isolate infusion we're doing coconut oil temperatures about 75 and the infusion has been deep carbs we're going to go ahead and begin the test first we got to ensure the tray slot is empty which it is okay let's just calibrate yeah and while that's calibrated we can go ahead and add our oil to the tray right here [Music] all right all right we got the results ten point six times twenty so two hundred the point six times two would be [Music] so two hundred and twelve per milliliter and how many do we have twenty Destin that's that's a lot for one person to drink that's pretty heavy all right so extremely potent oil right here we just got this tea check yesterday we've been playing with it for the past two days really cool device we were really interested to see how many milligrams this was 4240 that's a lot more than most people would do in one dose like we did last time thanks for watching the video and make sure you stay tuned for next time hey guys make sure you check us out at Doug smasher com2 check out all of our awesome products we also have tons of great information on our site including calculator tools & Turf files be sure to check us out there at Doug smasher com [Music]", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what you solo today don't forget to check me out on instagram at the NJ chef don't forget to check me out on medical edibles calm every

got the bunk bed over there [Music] feel me the couches right here you want to grow some garden there have some pizzas right here that is a spot right here trying to chill yeah [Music] toasted and i got that dr unique's blend bro i know you got a flavor with that one too bro our flavor nice shout out to the homie for the diamond dub got that young jig cheers damn that tastes fire brown [Music] [Music] how did that lean have you feeling by the way bro how are you feeling right now you're pretty relaxed pretty relaxed honestly i was leaning for a while but i'm good as i said earlier and i'm just off the diving the joints for sure gonna put me in the right mindset again bro especially after the hike that buff ass hiking is heat 115 degrees plus bro we ate it though we're back but that was it for the video shout out to the homie for providing us with the syrup bro let's say it was fire i ought to get that [ __ ] again bro cause i was leaning for a while but like that she had me feeling good thank you guys for watching [Music] peace out", "dQO7oqdzNfA": "but this you guys is what I'm most excited to show you I've never had one of these before it's a rosin cartridge what is going on you guys my name is Jeff also known as popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe I got a lot of lip videos on the way like today I'm gonna be showing you when I picked up from silver stem cannabis in my last video if you missed that video I got to tour their entire dispensary bring you guys with me show you what it's actually like inside of there it's [ __ ] sick make sure you check out that video a link to it will be in the description but right now I'm going to show you guys what I actually bought and what it looks like because there's some fire ass products there when you buy weed legally it comes with a receipt I spent two hundred and seventy seven dollars it would have been two twenty before tax but there's some hefty taxes in Colorado but it's worth it because hey I can [ __ ] buy the [ __ ] in the store I don't need to have a plug I don't need to fly with my own it's nice just being able to go into a store and pick out some [ __ ] and even with the tax it's so much cheaper than it is in Pennsylvania like you don't pay taxes when you buy weed in Pennsylvania but the growers and the processors and the stores are definitely paying a lot in taxes and that goes down to you so you might not pay a tax but you're being taxed alright let's start with these I picked up these little tablets just cuz I've never seen these before they're called pressies they have desired effects on them like sleep energy focus they only have like five or ten milligrams of THC in them so they're not very potent but they come with some other stuff that are supposed to actually help increase the desired effects that are labeled on the package I try out the focus ones just see what it's like it's literally like a little tablet and says a little THC mark on it's pretty cool I know if you're supposed to chew it or pop it I'm really glad I read that it says right on the bottom swallow don't you alright guys I'll see if that 10 miligrams does anything to me but I'm gonna be smoking a lot on top of it so I probably won't even really feel it you know I get high as [ __ ] all day and I get distracted so much stuff this could actually like help me focus real a little like that'd be kind of cool now let's get to the live rosin you guys picked up some olio I picked up the strain tropic sunset its a mix between slur Akane number 4 and papaya punch number 3 I didn't even smell it honestly like the name just sold me if you watched the video yesterday though you saw him open up a package of oleo they have such beautiful packaging man it's really [ __ ] cool they definitely take the extra step to make sure there's a great presentation with the product and the products really good so you really can't go wrong with them and just like the homie said it comes a little dab tool I didn't let it sit flat last night so you can see a little bit dripped onto the side but that's not the end of the world oh my god you guys this [ __ ] looks so good I was sure you're gonna close up for this if you guys can see that like it's just a beautiful yellow has a very nice consistency to it it's like a liquidy sugar and that's what's so cool about rosin man there's so many different consistencies that it ends up being just loaded up the puff coke peak I hope you guys are smoking with me let me know in the comments what you guys are smoking on every go you guys man I just like flew away and went to heaven that tastes so good [Music] my god you guys even when I look on this you guys truly [ __ ] beautiful job if you guys are ever in Colorado pick up some holy Arase Jim I really like this dispensary you guys they have some top-shelf concentrates there flowers amazing that's what I'm about to show you next but just like with over 300 dispensaries in Denver it's hard to find like all the good ones so as soon as you find one that has like great prices and great products like I just wanted to keep going to it damn I picked up two strains I picked up at indica and sativa flower this is the mimosa this is one of my favorite sativa strains I love smoking joints in mimosa if you've had mimosa before you already know but if you haven't you got to try it man it's some great [ __ ] weed and this is a shame that the budtender sold Deon he was very helpful this [ __ ] like I usually don't for whatever reason strains that have the word silver in it I don't like I don't even not like them I just like tend to just like not look at it because I'm like in my head I'm like gold is the best of silver my aunt but this is called silver OG and like I don't know if we get much better than this like it is a heavy indica it is like that deep green with like bright white trichome still so it looks like it has like snow on it this little it looks like the Tegrity farms Christmas snow weed and like if that was true that would be very concerning I don't know how good the shots do it for the weed but oh my god you guys it is a fire I honestly think I'm gonna go back to silver stuff before I go home and get some more flour because they had some great strains out there I just started with one indica and one sativa preheating the peak right now cheers you guys that was a nice reheat what I really like about the earrings is you can put a decent amount of wax in there and like if you take a big dab it's not all wasted like you can just reheat it and keep smoking it but this you guys is what I'm most excited to show you I've never had one of these before it's a rosin cartridge I paid too much money for this but I had to do it I said I wanted to try some cool cartridges while I was out here and I mean it happened this is from olio I don't want to skip over how great their packaging is they do such a good job on it that I feel like it deserves a little second I love you can kind of tell it has a little bit more of a foggy hue to it than a normal cartridge it's really cool how it says the strain on it too because sometimes you forget what strain you're smoking or if you have a lot of cartridges you can get them confused again using my cloud products rio+ different color but I just love these batteries they're one of my favorites cheers you guys wow that is one of the best AC cartridges I've ever had it's papaya punch that's gonna taste [ __ ] awesome but if being rosin versus actual distillate holy [ __ ] and like I can feel it like I'm getting really high off this like I can feel it on the face in the eyes this is not your normal cartridge this is crazy holy [ __ ] this is like one hit and you're high and it literally tastes like a rosin dab this isn't saying you guys the future man they can work on the price a little bit it would be way more feasible but what a great experience like I'm [ __ ] ripped I am so happy I got this this is the last thing we got through the liquid live resin cartridge I picked it off the name and the package honestly the [ __ ] is really cool and having a garlicy cartridge I've never had that before and it sounds pretty interesting chum the company Green Dot it's a [ __ ] [ __ ] to open here's the inside packaging cartridge is sitting on the side to push right through here to get the cartridge out then it gives you the stats on the back just peel here and don't use this if you're pregnant okay that this cartridge has a little adjustable air flow filter I don't really like these what it does is give you either more or less airflow I'd rather you just like tell me what's good and stick to it I'm gonna try minimal air flow and see how that goes Devlin gives you a hard hat doesn't Asus goes the rosin cart but still a good tasting cartridge well it's actually like kind of bad to the place garlicky it's not like sweet like that's why I prefer but it's like a very dank weed eat aced it's very heavy on the garlic I'll tell you that it's not even really a GMO taste it's definitely just more straight garlic it's a garlic explosion definitely prefer the rosin cart over this I'm going back to the rosin cart I need something with a better taste [Music] much better I think that's what we're gonna wrap the video you guys super pumped to try this for the first time way too expensive but definitely a cool experience that is so amazing this is probably the coolest thing I picked up in my opinion click like if you enjoyed the video let me know what you thought the coolest thing I got was subscribe for more videos I appreciate you watching my name is Jeff beaks", "ZlrTMplIa0A": "and inside the bag for the extended period of time there don't want any of it to come out for the first cycle 10 minutes and 100 degrees second cycles on 110 degrees for 10 minutes and you just bump it up by 10 degrees every time basically so we're just now about to bump it up to 130 and at this point once it's at that temperature I'll put a little bit more pressure on it there's a little most likely hold in place now so you'll start to see the bag wet up sometime around the 20 minute mark or so if you got no pressure on it if you see the bag wet up before that you got too much pressure on and basically gonna waste some rosin so now that's my timer reset the timer so this is actually the 31 minute mark basically we got it at 130 degrees gently apply some extra pressure I really like this particular press the long speak because you can really dial that pressure in your just 1 psi at a time lock it in place right there right around 5 psi now you get in real little tight here for our extreme close-up we got done you can see that the bag is just now starting to Wed up little color a little little wetness to it sit there we go extreme close-up extreme closeup yeah I know that it's good actually zoom in on the part where I'm trying to get it to the right well you get the idea it's very much there at this point when is dripping I'll do it you actually want to do and I'm not sure how damn okay yeah Wayne's World Wayne's World okay yeah but it's uh you get it actually see a little bit of moisture on the bag now at this point on the archery six psi yeah it's still pretty [ __ ] slow and steady at this point there's gonna be a lot of a lot of waiting a lot of thumb twiddling maybe some song and comedy well I honestly I wanted to start up because I think that it is very interesting and the steps are important and what you were explaining to me with all really intense so I was like damn I should play you know I think we pretty much kind of caught up the most part it's like the main thing is is just going slow and steady at the beginning because I have went too fast at it before and the laws and all goopes out and you know there's still THC a in that rosin that oozed out initially so you basically didn't harvest the THC a from that and your first terrine layer will end up being not just terpenes at that point it's well that's a point voice as close up as you can get it apologize for the loud air compressor yeah whatever those mic here here that we're going to end up with the best deal that [Music] the overall purity of this resin ranch there's just not much in the way [Applause] so I'm imagining that the THC percentage of this stuff I don't really know there's no on that sticker there wasn't no yes there's no way to know but imagining that the rosin is somewhere over 80 85 % THC and with this method being as effective as it is you're out really you know losing I have gotten fairly low THC a yields in the past while using a lower quality rosin starting product I'm imagining this time we're gonna have somewhere over 50% that's the hopes so any other weed nerds in there yeah when you actually do start to put the pressure on you'll get a very clear looking drip coming out of it that's the terpene fraction there the terpenes are more viscous than the rosin itself so yeah the first thing that you'll actually see is out might end up being an actual liquid and drop I'm not sure hmm it's just like I said it's my first time doing it with this high of a purity so yeah yeah sure what's respect with it but I've seen some [ __ ] come out before that literally just looks like you know nectar okay but yeah the first couple that come out be like a higher yield of terpenes that come out and then the ones that come after that will be cleaner but lower yield and those ones tend to be a little more shatter II well find out what we're gonna get today pretty much every product and end up with a different consistency mmm pan upon you know how it was stored what it was sprayed on it what it experience in his life cycle which and resident rancher seemed to really optimize his growing environment probably pretty [ __ ] clean oh yeah a lot of times cleaner stuff will be a little more shattering or stable on this side most okay I'm just bumping up the temperature a little bit higher again 140 now you can see that there is a good corner of moisture formed but nothing's actually squeezed out of the bag yet we're just at 7 psi now slowly creeping up oh yeah not really smelling it yet yes yes sir yeah so this is technically mechanical separation process this is what they call it okay mechanical terpene fractioning or mechanical separation of th da hmm we're gonna we'll do a little experimentation with mixing them back together in a form of solvent free diamonds and sauce pressure a bit more around ten well I can see the other side it's got white so witnesses leaving yeah at this point it's slowly starting to separate the more viscous terpene layer will kind of get pushed away TJ there so that's essentially that's the only thing that's actually coming out of the bag his wax is a little bit spencer pains they're like to at some point it'd be really cool to check it out and see like you know what percentage of THC is left in the terpene fraction and you know obviously have to find out what the rosin was going in what the turkey fraction was and then what the THC a just to get an idea of how pure of a separation we're actually getting here mmm oh yeah okay now you can really see it started so yeah there's some different ways we can handle this at the end is uh most of the stuff I see in the stores mm-hmm has a pretty pretty dark tinge of yellow to it that means that there's still a little bit of the terpene fraction left in the thca and the more times you repress it after we get the separation done we can just keep repressing it full pressure and full heat hundred eighty degrees and it'll just get cleaner and cleaner well I had one that I did there just was like perfectly clear crystal another one I tried I didn't go as hard high and it was still very amber colored mm so it's up to you how you want to play that I mean obviously you know weights too much time in this situation since you already off work well we'll just we'll do it at the what I would consider to be like 75% only done okay if we keep going at it and keep going at I mean you could add a whole extra half an hour yeah 40 minutes on total faith and and it doesn't really change the purity of that publish oh yeah you totally honest that's perfect see the diamonds and kind of mixing it back into its own rather than any way I want to see I think it would be crazy cool the way down each time to separating out there's less in the terpene or less in the THC a fraction so right here do you think doesn't work on a larger scale or would you have to like yeah most definitely would you're wondering to a certain point though I don't think you could do like a full plate full of it hmm maybe you can just I feel like you could end up being a lot more of a mess because with the viscosity of rosin you press out a whole plateful it doesn't like this spillover the edges whereas this stuff if it's really viscous it could just like drip down into the mm-hmm the inner workings of the press there mmm that's why some people do the extra parchment folds and get that I mean the directing flow and whatnot right but I've actually had a lot of bad luck with those causing the bag to slip around you can't see the bag properly to like tell when it's ready for pressure it makes it way harder for me to not blow out or [ __ ] like that yeah that's all I've kind of stepped away from the directed flow parchment typed okay particularly when it comes to making actual rosin almost impossible the low-pressure involved with this will be more forgiving those I'm going to be possible to do it without blowing out yeah but it's really I mean sometimes it's hard to see what you're doing when you need those directed flow pouches okay one thing I've had problems with in the past is I get the flow proper but then too much of it still goes out in the back it causes a pressure buildup back there and that can actually cause the parchment paper to explode mmm in the on the backside two more minutes will bump up to 150 degrees and start putting real pressure on this thing okay that's the first big cyclic fold real cycle yeah that's when it'll start to you might have a few drips pulling out of here and I'm not guaranteeing this stuff is gonna be super clear mmm we've had some of the past that came out they were like that's a terpene separation right there oh geez oh you twist the later ones they started being smaller that's trippy and more stable mm-hmm that's what these are yeah so basically it's just climbing 150 degrees now once it's there up crank up the pressure until I started see some action now we're over 40 minutes into it and the the thta's probably pretty well bonded at this point and not likely to accidentally use out hmm it's safer to put pressure on [ __ ] up and I cut this just a little too short I can't mm-hmm clip it up too damn magnet move it right up to the edge of the plate since it's so small and go see otherwise see how incredibly viscous and clear that liquid is yeah that's a first way that's pretty cool you can see it pretty well on your phone we'd live literally clear oh I smell it now Oh oh man that stank mmm really both the garlic and mushrooms and the grandpa house brought the grandpa mouth right out come to call GMO yeah you didn't miss a whole lot as I was saying earlier jots is a really slow process on this start here but it's starting to ooze up pretty good now it's just her peens basically right there I did my job all the thca is still in the bag and that's just the terpene fraction losing out that pure good the strings you got running the Sun and job what you running deep purple and golden goat just I just asked my correctly if I remember correctly and I meant to ask you what what that golden goat is but if I'm crazy so ministry haven't you heard of that one yeah am i right is that that is Red John okay gotcha Oh an IT guy see okay golden girl goes out the purple and raw cookies yes he's gonna [ __ ] what's up sounds like a nice nice harvest on your horizon there [ __ ] yeah yeah I remembered because of the golden goat and the deep purple he said I have a great memory I'm not strange but I happen to remember that but Frank does have a really good memory okay golden goat that's an interesting one though both of us at some time we never heard of that that's dream new to me star fans kind of a plant encyclopedias I was surprised to hear him say as well unknowable yeah I'm no plant encyclopedia [ __ ] yeah yeah is that more on this a teabag Purple's from rip yeah one thing I've grown by him was uh that Apollo 13 law school but I know is there's at least now as well back to well now yeah 150 degrees now we've been doing this for about 45 minutes just now starting to actually eat out hell yeah he said yes the steamboat leaving however I remember perfectly 16 - 17 Dave finisher nice nice mmm yeah I like those uh pineapple Citybus well some really good pineapple taiwan citizens [ __ ] bee's knees i have nine exists but yeah this Frank knows I'm not the biggest fan of three strains but a couple of them every now and then hit right I like those uh stinky foot you know burnt rubber diesel fuels like those things that stink but yeah you like this GM oh boy uh than ever it's just so funky literally it's like uh uh you know this is the only way to describe it in word I'm pretty sure that's effectively descriptive of it funk aroma 150 bumpin temps bump intense at this point we're ready to just go blasting away at it with you know it's not gonna blow up now we're just gonna put the pressure on I'll be back in the chat in a minute I'm gonna use my camera really brought the grandpa mouth right out he says all right we are at full blast at this point heart rate swap heart metallic case oh boy and that's just crazy really yeah literally very clear clear now and that's technically terpene separate right yeah that's just a sure play there should be fairly low in THC compared to everything else okay I love them kept all the Terps or all the THC a in the in the back school all I can say if you want to make a good diamond sauce yeah you mix this back in with that okay get multiple runs of this after it cool off a little bit you can get hopefully get it off of the parchment sometimes they're a little more staffing this one looks like it's probably like so we got a question from Joe or one one he said what strain have you guys press that at the best return uh sfv or this GMO honestly this GMOs it's a six star we pressed it had a 77 percent from hash to rosin but we'll find out what the yield is on rosin ca ca in the past my highest yield on th EA was I got like twenty percent so it's usually like I get like sixty percent or something fifty percent maybe from hash to rosin and then out of that you know a 20% of that to go in the form of THC a so that comes out in the form of this goopy stuff on the parchment paper but I'm feeling like this is gonna be a much higher yield because of the actual percentage of THC in the rosin was higher this probably was 88 90 percent THC a rosin it's a traditional market source so there's no testing though on it but it is pure let me tell you that you know test to its purity there's like no particles in there they shouldn't be in there so listen my Jimmy the tool scraping I call right now it's already still really just doop that's clear oh man that's crazy the jar oh my goodness wow that is a Wow wait at certain angles you can see that it's just a little pissed rip of [ __ ] nothing oh my god yeah right there it's clear it's a bird oh my god it looks just like the mouth it was like attacking this hmm yeah it's not working off through the paper though it's like way to biscuits to get off the paper don't take yourself either huh smell that Wow yeah that's the whole garlic that's crazy usually like a lot more shattering or at least of that waxy kind of pliable material or you know you can play with it kind of hmm this is just straight-up liquid I feel like freeze it so I get it off that way Oh can't see [ __ ] listen now because it's all white it out yeah that's too close to the light now oh yeah yeah yeah that's crazy yeah like I'm hanging out at Black Oak branch and really good bands on the stage and you know Saturday night people are just doing all that Saturday night stuff that they do like over here then the band says something about yeah it smells like somebody's cooking popcorn out there in the crowd sure would like to smoke some pot I mean eat some popcorn this security guard comes over and he's like dance we could smell popcorn oh okay everybody all right [ __ ] yeah security guard enjoy some popcorn and then Karen comes over she's like y'all can't do that here this is Kate Wolfe teach I mean that happened to a friend of mine golly so it's still part thing - mmm yeah uh we'll get a little bit more Terps next time or I mean sorry a little bit less turps each time after this now ya know how well we're gonna be able to do this song that was dining this also well pretty much what I thought we're getting more in the form of THC a in them sauce what I was thinking originally also is like I don't know what the room is from them but it's like it looks like it's like whipped rosin that just has the diamonds in it I think I think it's really rosin it's it's a probably a proportion of terpenes rosin to th EI and then whipped while heated oh Jesus and then the Diamonds added after ours she's hard to say so yeah the proprietary tech is their own method it's hard to recreate but they're the I feel like it's some form of those combinations of things heat whip proportions of ingredients okay so now we're doing full pressure full heat which is a hundred and seventy there's allegedly happened other cables allegedly ladies unless you'd leave the glove did not fit what's the quick actually I will do another did not have inhalation relations with that woman miss Merrow in ski [Music] I'm getting my night and scandals all mixed up hold on [Music] this is my monetary a buddy [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] like the only thing straight up the parchment actually it's angled so it kind of pulls up all right now at this point it's just cleaning up we'll just do this one more round and we'll call it at that point okay that would be a hour and 10 minutes cool yeah and then I think we're just now had an hour in 10 minutes actually since it's 5:14 we started at 4 right you know yeah so yeah any any bit of time from here now isn't really gonna do much else except for just change the color of the TCA a little bit it's why it gets lighter so like I said right now there's still some terpenes stuck inside the bag mm-hmm and slowly over time you're gonna push all of those out and then you'll just end up with a purer and purer the8 I meant I guess is that terpenes come out of darker as you're gone oh no they actually get lighter too Oh crazy yeah it's okay in my experience it's just like less of it each time but it didn't like clear so that little bit of color that is there isn't gonna be there that's for me okay but yeah it's probably not even gonna be enough to actually collect it's just pushing it a little bit further out of the inner bag into the second bag at this point then sometimes what I'll do is I'll actually pull apart and collect it all the THC out of there and put it in a clean bag and then repress it again at this point and that gets like at this point the bag is just being a sponge pulling extra Terps out of it that would be in the ga mm-hmm that's how you end up with the clearest most pure crystals well we don't have to go that far into it I'm sure it's just so he's stupid as is mmm and for the sake of brevity let's just call it now in the middle of the cycle you see this like I mean basically nothing yeah but each time you do that it's just a little bit comes out of there it would be in here Oh guys I think so now this is the goods it's the goods you're right back in the chat I'm gonna be videotaping it so like I said it's like a sponge almost of sorts it's it's soaking up the turkeys at this point okay home amount of the inner bag in the bag will be a lot cleaner [Music] Oh busted out just a little bit Wow that's crazy-looking no dude this is already pure white at this point it's already like oh my god here oh my goodness dude so we're back from Colombia with our goods oh that's crazy-looking that's pretty nuts looks like the absolute [Music] all right I got the parchment tear it out you can figure out how much we actually harvest it here now that it's on a brown paper he can see it better so yeah almost exactly 50% it's probably more accurate way of it ma'am 147 yeah that's great point four seven always one grand it is really good I couldn't maybe not went as hard on it and could have Lily over 50% me just have to slice it yell okay Oh [Music] [Music] just heat the press up to 190 degrees and just let it sit there slowly over time it'll get there but it's for Holi actually have that was off I had no idea so I just found that we can do it that way now here's the cool thing if this was a little bit of light - Wow no it's badass so here's the coolest part about it is this is this is the is the most stable THC substance I've ever played with my life at this point once it's solidified into this crystal just whatever glassy type deal it takes over 200 degrees to reheat it so I could literally just sit there and hold it my hands forever it'll never melt to my finger at all even without gloves on this is the most stable THC product I've ever seen can you go grab those um other turf players so fast yeah we're under the freezer I don't have to breathe yeah hi [ __ ] yeah oh yeah do you know this year still got some THC left in it it's hard to get it all out but what I generally do with that is just like throw it into a little bit of tea you know at the hot tea so I end up with like a little bit left on there so we'll play around with that and make them mix up and stuff and then we'll smoke it later tomorrow or whenever you're free wanna do that oh I'm definitely down to do some salt Atlas diamond dabs yeah [ __ ] that I'm gonna sapphire yeah [ __ ] yeah yeah this still is not coming off it's like [ __ ] on the tasty treats watch the whole rosin press on that and the Diamonds press yeah dude [ __ ] yeah that's awesome so I don't know that we're gonna get any more actual in there and what we should do is just get a different jar and then put th ck again you hear this oh yeah ASMR for you the sound of THC a doobie down [ __ ] yeah no for joining us very much happy Friday we'll be smoking some very soon but yeah thank you very much stars I'm [ __ ] master of ceremonies here thank you sir", "SoVy7emFQOk": "you're smokin man growin and watch it fall down [Music] DGC Scottie real hanging out and doing something very interesting thank you for Jason from dialed in Terps for coming in I am really interested in trying to learn what do they call this they have to make these high-end extracts and now I always thought they made them with BHO and whatnot now Jason comes over and says no you can actually make them using real high-end water hash and pressing that into rosin and then you jar it up is that this jar tech is that what they call this yes jar tech it's um it's fresh frozen material that's then turn into bubble hash exactly like you said and depressed in the rosin and at some point you know you have to decide what you want to do with is our consistency goes right why is it look so different what's it start out so it starts out as rosin right yeah it's really suffered rosin okay we got a picture of that Ross and that [ __ ] is so bright why the hell is that rosin so bright white well you know quality in quality out you know you want to start with the best material possible when you're starting with the fresh products and you've matured a trichome to its full maturity right and still hold a nice color but I've seen things that are yellow I've seen things that are a dark almost like a tan brown and by the way it can be dankus [ __ ] but I seem like the 710 labs they do that real white five-star water hash sure and you're saying five stars kind of this five star material yeah I think 710 would probably be doing more if they're selling it they're gonna be doing a six star but the [ __ ] the difference help a brother out man all right six stars as good as it gets six stars as good as it gets no cars both wash goes all right that's the bright whites they all really light do you holo bright whites a full milk bubble hash okay put it on a bowl there's not gonna be any residue left got it and that's what's gonna burn clean right that's really what they're looking for for a full bubble hash by the way that 6r that's just expensive man I don't even know I bought that a little bit $75 a gram and I had like no second thoughts after I went through it or like 10 15 bucks it's just you want to do a few it is delicious I agree so is that what that way you end up with here or that's what we start with most stuff you're president of rosin would be a five star hash and what the difference is starting material yes the starting material is gonna leave a little bit of residue if you put a five star hash and a puff go peak it's still gonna taste delicious right you're gonna really enjoy it it's just gonna leave a little residue at the bottom of the bowl when you clean it you ever smoked bubble hash and you see that that's gonna be a five star hash or a four star hash and again I'm just trying to understood the difference is the quality of the material going in right so six star hash this is gonna be no residue it's gonna burn totally clean Wow just like you know when you smoke a full mil okay so what does this start out as this is five star what do you what do you call this this is five star material for that okay with I work really hard in house to peruse really nice flowers that I've fries fresh beautiful right beautiful you've been here about ten years right no I think we both heard the calling and yeah left our homes to come and be growers be growers out in public I love it I really enjoyed my 10 years in Colorado it's I'm home now yeah you're relieved oh yeah you're right he's right by the mountains absolutely beautiful beautiful up there I'll come visit you can't visit me I'll come visit you next time man all right all right let's get into these jars guru's got beautiful pictures of the jars over there yeah what what are we starting Wesley this jar tech I totally don't actually get to start material over here it's mousey absolutely yeah we got everybody in the shop hey that's I think it's secure I meant to do an AB you take that live you know fresh frozen bubble hash it goes into a freeze dryer okay so this is definitely freeze dryer right huge how beautiful beautiful that's what happens when my friends come over you all right so I've took 56 grams yesterday or this morning actually I woke up early at 6 a.m. right and press 56 grams of bubble hash okay and that's important you didn't press flour you're pressing 56 grams of bubble hash gotcha and that's how you really get the old dry quality Cessna and the bubble has just been dried in the freeze dryer okay and now what's in a freezer until I pressed it so to help me out I understand why everybody wants a freeze dryer why why that's like the key to super high quality okay a pretty dryer really is gonna preserve all the terpenes all the cannabinoids and it's gonna preserve its freshness and make it absolutely just perfect right so what so and your freeze drying the buds the flowers before you or your freeze drying the hash here freeze rather than bullish she's got imperious drying the bullish beautiful without losing any of terpenes right you're drying it at an extremely cold temperature wow what a trip all right I get it now I get it all right so now we got we pony that was a tad a process something like that this came up rest us this morning and if I were to pressed it and immediately it would have not started waxing up I've got it we came up to the show it's starting to wax up a little which is fine it's just a little bit harder to collect right so we're I'm in here and that's gorgeous it is warm by the way the air conditioning broke they're fixing it up we just fell right yeah we had this in the freezer and I already pulled it apart and the cold temperatures a key to this know right even everything cold right yeah so it started tearing the wax of him that is impressive that's the starting material okay yeah so now what do we do it now that to me I'd be dabbing the [ __ ] out of that as a matter of fact so is that dabble yeah you want to try it yes yeah you know we've got these these are called a puff coke peak is that what this is yeah absolutely yeah awesome you showed up with one and guru showed up with one the beginning in a week and they really do hit beautifully I think so yeah it's my preferred way to smoke I was a double uh double press here Yeah right Yeah right see he already turned it on so oh no what your right hand I'll turn it off because these are cold start tabs always for you now I just changed it to you take this more damaged how you didn't even started up so you're doing alright beautiful I forgot it's the right temperature I like to do it on green I think if you have a high quality product if it should burn really well and hey yeah I'll shout out to Stony scholar who was teaching me about this at the last dvc cup and he was probably the first time I heard about cold start dabs Yeah right great once ready deal alright I'll get mine going to this I haven't tried this yet this is star dog I did a full spectrum start up here ok beautiful star dog is it's JJ from top dog is that right really so yeah alright so back from bubble hashes is gonna be the 45 of you for me 45 of you all the way to the 160 you I don't even know how what say you what do you you have it's the micron size of the bubble bag say use it oh sure I know about that sorry so both bags coming about half that you get half a dozen bubble bags they go anywhere from what about 30 or something like that 30 microns 25 micron yeah 20 yep right usually or 220 or 190 or contaminate bags and then your your 160 bag you have some really nice head to start in and get in there yeah what he means by that so that's ones you keep your ear material and your starting material bubble bags all right hang on excuse me let me date with the puff coke peak oh yes let me turn my own give me some small talk here so we're starting off with this and then what that goes in a jar tell me how we get to these I don't understand the jar we smoke the [ __ ] out by the way this is amazing hang on a second smells good I haven't tried it yet this is my new harvest I do everything in-house and you know in Colorado you're only allowed to do 12 plants so it's really hard to have material all the time yeah absolutely you can put air quotes around your 12 plants your church things very interesting know if I did it right I still got some left oh oh I better q-tip it is this gurus you could double click it if you didn't want oh I guess going yeah that should have done that and sometimes you could get sugar done the double click oh good thanks pretty interesting best tastes pretty pretty delicious [ __ ] great it's pretty much cold Karen right here that's what you have here so yeah so what I have no idea what's going on here so let's go for it we got what I would smoke right there what are we trying to make we're trying to make diamonds and sauce with it we're trying to that's one of the that's one of the consistencies you can make what are they tell me tell me what are their Jesus movie it's almost offensive right so this is grease monkey and I took a little cookie pucker from camerado and mixed it in with the grease monkey from exotic genetics okay kind of spiced up the Terps a little and made it a little Wow yeah it's interesting smell yeah Jesus it is weird man that's an interesting smell so okay so that starts with this yeah it starts with this and you have your option of collecting into a ball right you know you're gonna take all these and collect it into a big ball Drazen that's easy I done that yeah exactly and you're gonna put it in a jar and seal it okay you could have options you could go into an oven at a temperature around 220 degrees okay 45 minutes an hour and we'll go over that later just a simple of them like a toaster oven or some convection oven yeah perfection oven okay I used my oven in my kitchen when I first started here thousands of dollars of equipment so I guess you got a couple G's in the freezer freeze dryer yeah so freeze right in a bubble bags the good bubble bags are getting up there and prints really and I love those bubble bags I spent my last dime I was on vacation found out those existed and spent my last dime on them it's like I got this right all right so we got we get it uh like this now what we put a leg ball it up put it in a jar how the hell is a ball of that gonna make that that doesn't make no sense to me it's like I said oh okay they'll go into the oven right 20 degrees got it or about 45 minutes this jar is gonna melt up and it's gonna foam up and it's gonna start 2d carved in the jar essentially what you're doing is separating your using solvent as a using terpenes as a solvent you're separating THC and the terpenes got it terpenes will go to the top THC will settle the bottom that will go on a heat map and that will sit on a heat man anywhere from 12 hours to 24 hours and so far none of this is specialty equipment I've got a seed heating mat right there I used to sprout seeds and and make clones with yeah that's what you need yeah kitchen the kitchen of an oven and a seed mat is all you really need I mean if you know this is all very high-end product you're working with medical medical instruments as much as possible right if you have a nice clean Breville convection oven that you could get at Best Buy or bad bad thing yeah all right yeah but aside from the freeze dryer which you'll make a lot of friends with that at least no yeah a lot of folks come into the house oh yeah and so how long does something like this have to sit after so you you bake it and it's it's ready or you sit what you're gonna do is you're gonna take that jar and you're going to essentially turn it into a liquid and though though it's gonna foam up and the bottom will turn into a liquid the bubbles will start to rise up the jar kind of like a beer okay when is three-quarters of the way up the jar is all liquid on the bottom and the top are bubbles it'll look like a beard when it was freshly poured exactly right that's when it's ready to pull out of the oven you're gonna take that jar out of the oven and put it on a heat mat like that and it'll sit on that heat mat anywhere if I can set from 12 to 24 hours and it'll the crystals will start to collect and form and that's it and how long so after 24 hours it's good like that that's only a process I would think it would take weeks for yeah I remember making rock candy as a kid that shook took weeks man it could take anywhere from 12 hours to 4 days five days goddess I've ever seen a jar takers been six days and does it matter about the quality if there's not enough terpenes and in the material or it always work I've seen some jars not work absolutely right not every strain does work but for the most part if you have a good quality starting material you do your process right right you're gonna you're gonna have good results did you see this is [ __ ] cool cuz you can do it with a convection oven and just go over to nosies house man he just bought a kid you didn't you just buy your a freeze dryer brother yes loving it I'll be right over absolutely okay so what other consistencies do we have man you know the most popular consistency in my world right now and I think a lot of people are really digging on is a cold here which hold you here come on get us get us up to speed I told you I gotta go to the 7:10 cup the concentration celebration in a month maybe get my [ __ ] together man this is the cold care dude so show that to the camera man that is if they had that in the store I might run out with it I have to I'd have to think I have to conscience man that thing is uh insane how many grams is this first of all so that's one ounce 28 grams okay yeah that's fun that's fun to have in my hand so has it been whipped yet this I'm still caring okay how long is the Cure on something like that so this the first stop is there a cure on that you said one to four days is that what you're calling it cure so what I'm calling on that is the separation okay yeah you're separating the terpenes or the THC and forming crystals is that after the cure this is so Karen so this has been this foot into a ball right and put into a jar right that's it all I've done is take that collected and put it in the showcase I love it how long's that after how long does that cure so this has been in a jar now for two days okay I'm gonna let this sit in a jar for a few more weeks God okay that's what I was thinking I thought there was some stuff he did for a few weeks and that's room for 60 degrees for a few weeks the sweat get terpenes will start to rise to the top they'll get softer where do you keep a room sixty degrees if we're trying to be practical and helped a DGC actually do this so you just take a cold basement like a dresser drawer got it and it's in the 60s clothes or it has to be dialed in 60 degrees I would consider a six a cold Kyra's 60 degree room okay you could also do a room temperature here is just just fine and it goes quicker it works just fine okay no reason to not do a room temperature here I'm still obsessed over it why not brother yeah if I cure something up it'll be just a pocket cure yeah I call it yeah yeah a pocket cure pocket cure that sounds like something I would do and when you're ready when it's when it's secured and you feel you feel it it's good where you like it right it's sweating terpenes it looks delicious sweating to smoke yeah yeah you take care take your tool and you go ahead and whip it like mashed potatoes essentially what's that can you do that what's that look like right we'll do it to this one all right so this one is the same material that this was the second press material so we'll show that material first of all all right that's the second pressing it's [ __ ] impressive normally when I would do the second pressings or at least a second run with my bubble bags it was much it was a lot less quality can you say a lot less quality much lower quality that's limit to say manthe books I didn't mean it's kicking it I've never been known for the best grammar myself you can make great concentrates nobody gives a [ __ ] about your grammar yeah all right so this one thing about this is an ounce that's announcer there's 14 grams okay half an ounce an ounce looks like yeah beautiful I put this in the oven okay yeah so in order to speed this process up you could put it in the oven as well and do cake batters what a lot of people are called so that's when I goes I get that a batter sometimes yeah okay so my batter out of the oven is gonna come out dry like this it's this is unlit so what about this moist you do there's plenty of terpenes in there and it's delicious and you can smell it it just needs to be kind of whipped okay that's not a fast profile yeah you know I'm more of like a no-till guy man so this is kind of I don't know man right I know it's actually the same idea though you know you get everything exposed to a more surface area get it exposed Wow okay that's looking like something to get it at a dispensary yeah then you start smashing it down kind of potatoes that looks good you know misty all looks getting wet and delicious already and you know right look at that so Leo is soft and gooey beautiful show that to guru man yeah come on you really get a nice good mash on that you're welcome to stop by the bakery any time so so what consistencies is coming like I said this is the end this is a second press and I did put it in the oven just to speed up the process of the cold appear for the show oven will loosen terpenes I don't know I think you could bring out some terpenes well it depends on the strain you know some the oven will bring out terpenes on some strains of them will destroy starting really fragile terpenes and some strands as well huh yeah absolutely I like to do a little bit of both I wish that's my tournament entry so I'm just kind of like oh yeah they're like that I can't smell it yeah you know the press of that so you know you so the quality is there it's delicious you want to try it yes yeah you probably don't ask me that any other man let me see that let me see the whole jar I got that cheese man right I'm happy today it's a good day in the bakery nice limit limit let me hold let me know yes Jesus what strain is this what do you think hate the nausea will you put this all back in the fridge it's totally waxed up it's gonna be really hard to click now but yeah the key thing is cold cold is the key yeah it is colder the better you're working at home if you could turn on the air-conditioner or open up some windows if I live at elevation so I keep everything really cool does that make a difference oh yeah damn I try to keep miles at 60 you know like I'll let you handle it yeah you know I just I start making pizzas and I'll be damned you got a really a just [ __ ] for elevation I'm sure making that stuff that's way sensitive man you really got to adjust you're a mile high up makes a [ __ ] huge difference especially with water absorption I so dry yeah it's almost impossible to keep up yeah is there any difference if people are trying to do this in you know up in Portland where it's more humid or anything is there any kind of special precautions they would have to take well Portland's humid yes what I'm wondering is such a different client man yes so the probably was something somebody that actually lives in Portland to ask wouldn't it yeah I mean you want to keep bubble high school most people professionally love make pilaster live and work and walk-in coolers so this is all about a walk-in cooler this would never hit this temperature as a professional matchmaker yeah yeah so this for the show it would have never made it this long and started to wax up already right I would have collected that immediately put it in a jar you put it in the oven for Jam put it in a jar put in a cold room for a cold cure and now what's a jam what's a jam so the jam would be you know the the crackles that's why we call it jhanas okay okay I believe olio cause a jam 710 calls it premium rosin and I believe gotcha you know there's different companies call it different things so help me out with these pro companies it's because they're able to do things like by walk-in freezers I think I forgot must have forgotten to turn mine on I'm still trying to help you with that Scotty I'm still trying to get this thing what am I doing wrong it's gross I see him that's I'm on it yeah so you want to click it once I'll get once all right and then click it twice to get it going and concert vibrates you're ready to go all right I like it I like it it's pretty cool man let's see a couple of these at the at the 710 concentration celebration I'm gonna bring mine yeah I think it'd be a good way to hit them I mean how torches are cool but yeah this is a safe little bit and a little bit yeah couple hundred stoners with torches sounds cool that's then I hit my sword on my place yesterday I heard a lady I was reaching around trying to fold the back up of a piece of paper I'm sure and sure hit my plate my will templates not so low-temp what they're doing that dude I use a toaster for like five minutes a week and I burnt myself man all right so did you get yours yet uh not yeah I don't think it's ever vibrate uh I mean I was actually making small talks ah there we go man there we go that just turned off double-click that again it it sways boom boom there you go now good now you're I like this thing but what stop at the learning curve how come I'm the only wall to learning curve it's bold school job school study all these gadgets I took me a while to I got laughed at for not having a filter on my joint last week the filter gets in the way honestly kind of taste taste bad throws in anyway hey okay it's a double quick hit that's what it is all right cool man I think we actually did pretty good man I think we uh I think I learned some [ __ ] man you run out I want to see this guy definitely but I'm pretty stoked that you if you invest in a freeze dryer that's kind of you're good to go you can all sudden start making super high-quality extracts like this as long as you're growing super high quality weed y'all I think so I think the learning curve here would be a lot a lot less than making butane hash co2 hash any of those types of hash it's illegal as a [ __ ] is illegal but you know there's a lot to learn yeah there's a legal and then there's a legal yeah yeah you know in a legal lab it's a lot to learn isn't very what's your brand called again I know you got a hangout dialed in Terps man died on turbulent turkey diving terpenes and ER yeah this is some pretty cool [ __ ] you got Instagram yeah I'm an Instagram that's about interest on Instagram other than terpenes on Instagram all right we gotta hang out a little more man this is [ __ ] cool I learned to hold this is like opening up a new world to me I had no idea actually I didn't know this existed because I would see the six star hashes and all these all these crazy concoctions at the dispensary but I really didn't know what went into him or how they were made I love the fact that there's there's no external solvents into it this is just what the terpenes act as a solvent right yeah absolutely it's cool it's awesome so that's yeah you know making bubble hash water solvent carrying agent you using water and ice to break off the trichomes just the very heads of the little live flower and it's bad acid into this yeah it's badass I still think I'm doing this wrong but Jason thanks so much for hanging out man thanks for making the trek and extra show me how to use this thing well though it doesn't even seem like I put the carbon cap on at this point that in terms out intervenes over on Instagram [ __ ] with a match take it easy brother Thanks crack take it easy oh yeah [Music] little break [Music] [Music] yeah [Music] medicine [Music] [Music] today [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "A24Y3JyHLAQ": "this video is made of a user's request today I'm showing you how to winterize frozen in a small batch here I have almost a gram of rosin about a point 8 I made just before this video I'm placing into a beaker and adding 10 ml of Everclear I'm adding the alcohol to the rosin so that I can inter eyes it apply like bleep and mix until all of the rosin is dissolved into the alcohol [Music] here importing the rajma and alcohol into a graduated cylinder this is just for the purpose of the video [Music] I meant place it into the freezer and my cool for about 14 hours [Music] after freezing you can see that the wax fats and lipids have separated and sunk to the bottom [Music] here I'm using two syringes to pull out the fats and waxes as well as the alcohol separately this is also just for the purposes of this video to show you the difference [Music] it does help however to pull them out separately as it makes it easier to filter the cleaner portion compared to the waxy portion [Music] here I'm pushing them through a point to two microns syringe filter the syringe filter tracks the facts and waxes and removes them from the alcohol [Music] [Music] in the end I've caused it in alcohol and it's been winterized and I'm removed of any of its fats and waxes alright once you've done filtering you know how fully winterized rosin you can go ahead and use this for edibles or you can further refine it by boiling away the S&L and using it for bait pens or lowell devs my half plate has a built in magnetic stirrer it's a magnet that spins around and spins a magnetic stir bar this automates the steering process and speeds up the overall evaporation it may take some time for all the alcohol to evaporate keep checking back on it every so often so that you don't burn your rosin I don't recommend consuming concentrate that may have ethanol and then often if you are going to do this regularly you are better off getting it back through the final purge process [Music] after you've reduced most of the alcohol up I'd like to put another beaker on top to prevent any ball tools such as terpenes from escaping that having already in this final process removing the last of the ethanol now you can't truly remove all of it without a vacuum so I went to do this for as long as possible kind of medium to high heat right now it's heated at around 95 degrees Celsius I like to let it sit like this for a couple hours from four I feel it's safe to smoke and the ethanol has escaped [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "5ljRikoZgb0": "uh that's what it looks like this is what distillate starts out like that looks like a bucket of doo doo butter cannabis goes through a lot of steps to become nice clear distillate like this but you might be surprised by what is actually used to make all of your distillate pins and all your edibles and all your syringes i'm about to tell you how distillate is made right now on the strange show answers to all the questions you've ever had about wheat distillate is a weed extract but unlike other extracts distillate goes through an extensive process where everything is stripped away from the plant except for one specific cannabinoid if you're new here my name is matt this is the strain show and this is the channel for adults and patients where i teach you the answers to all the questions you've ever had about week if you want to learn all kinds of fun facts about weed don't forget to subscribe and you can put some nuggets of knowledge into your strain brain now distill it looks awesome but it doesn't have much of a smell or much of a taste the distillation process removes all of the terpenes and leaves you with only one cannabinoid usually thc or cbd this is a glass syringe with a one-to-one ratio of thc and cbd oil this stuff doesn't have any smell at all and when you dab it it looks super duper clear [Music] and it doesn't have much of a taste either you can't really taste it i mean you can taste it but it doesn't really have a flavor and this sucks because most of the medicinal benefits of weed and most of the high you get from weed is from all of the cannabinoids working together as a team in what's called the entourage effect sometimes they will add these terpenes back into the distillate at the end of the process and sometimes weird things are added to distillate like synthetic terpenes or maybe terpenes from another plant like lavender to give it a good taste but one of the biggest uses for distillate is making edibles almost all thc or cbd edibles are made with distillate and that means that none of these edibles are going to have any of those important cannabinoids or terpenes they're going to be just thc or cbd although the finished product of distillate is pure and potent it's usually made from the cheapest weed leftovers available to the extractor since all distillates look about the same at the end of the process you can use low-grade trim leaves like trim from a trimming machine to make distillate and it won't really matter with other types of extracts low-grade weed will make low-grade hash but not with distillate that's why some people say from trash to hash when talking about distillate the first step of making distillate is getting what's called a crude extraction oil uh that's what it looks like this is what distillate starts out like that looks like a bucket of doodoo butter this nasty crude oil is usually extracted with bho like most other concentrates but since we started off with such a low grade product this is what we ended up with but this crude oil has a lot of impurities that we're gonna have to remove before we can begin to separate this oil down into its specific cannabinoids and we're gonna do that in the next step which is called winterization in this step the crude oil is mixed with ethanol and that mixture is then placed in a very cold freezer for 24 to 48 hours while this mix is in the freezer all the impurities like chlorophyll plant waxes fats and lipids they all stick together and sink to the bottom of the container after a day or two of being in the freezer all the impurities are filtered out and the ethanol is evaporated with something like this rotary evaporator so now it looks good but it's not exactly very potent yet all cannabinoids that are in their acid form even thc have to be decarboxylated before they will interact with your body the way you want them to in the third step the oil is heated to 220 degrees fahrenheit and this removes the carboxylic acid group and that converts your thc a into thc now this stuff will get you high but it's not finished yet the last step of the process is the actual distillation process itself all of the different cannabinoids in the oil have different boiling points and different molecular weights so in this last step the extractors use vacuum pressure and heat in very precise amounts to evaporate off exactly what cannabinoids they're going after and at the end of the process sometimes they'll add terpenes back into the distillate sometimes they have the terpenes from the same weed they made the distillate from sometimes they add terpenes from different weeds sometimes they add terpenes from different plants and sometimes they add synthetic terpenes so if your distillate is flavored like a great popsicle you can probably bet there's some synthetic terpenes in there now that i know about it i'm ready to dab it so i'm about to go right here or if you just want to learn some more fun facts about weed i got those videos right here and yo don't forget to subscribe for good vibes i got them nuggets of knowledge because when you watch the strange show it's like going to weed college", "IgyuOefja3c": "[Music] it's just flour and we're gonna be doing some dry sieving yeah we have really nice yeah I have some really nice well I well I've been into hash for a long time like all kinds of hash not not solvent-based hash or rosin really but like hash you know like resin either dry sift or ice water not that's kind of what I did before like so when I was like you know like twenty years old and when we were in music school when we went were like in the classical music in Europe was like we were all about you know Europe and doing it how they'd work and so we were I've been making hash like that before I even knew about Frenchie or anything like that where you're like but I would I would put it so he's not know but so this is what I would do is I'd take my dry sift and I'd put it in like like a little like a bag like a plastic bag right and then I would fold that bag up really tight around the resin and then I'd wrap that in a piece of paper and tape it up and I get the paper soaking wet and I'd put that in the oven so that didn't burn right and I put it in there for like a little bit on really low and then I would roll it with the rolling pin I put in the freezer and I take it out and I do it a couple of times and the thing it's pretty much the same thing you know it would be like whatever I could get from my grinder or what you know what I mean like that's kind of how it started and I didn't grow splits and that's what I like so you know like hash I've always just been into hash and then once we got in the farming we were like got more in there like a good hash and doing a lot of ice water but then you can't do that with the current regulations as a farm you know so I mean I just love hash but I want to like you know like I want to make good hash and I want to share that with people but I also you know I don't know if I want to get another license to do that I don't think it's worth it to do that for just my farm you know but the dry see if I can create like I can basically make a similar it's an equally pure product you know like we're isolating to 99.99% pure resin glands and so it's very beautiful some will be better for dry sip for sure but the the cool thing is with the cleaning of the dry sip we're able to use we're able to work with a lot of strains that we couldn't necessarily work with in ice water because well so in ice water if you have a very very greasy melty strain with a thin wax membrane you have to be very careful to not damage those resin glands like in the washing because if you do they're gonna break and they're just gonna stick to your material and they're not even going to end up in your yields and so a lot of hash makers are like like really sand sandy or strains because they break off and they go through the bags easier and stuff like that so we're able to actually dry you know these oily or resin heads and still make a full melt it's kind of a secret proprietary thing yeah I mean I will share it i I don't know if it's like yeah I might as well share it with you do we're gonna do it like we gonna have the edge for so long [Laughter] Carla says I don't know I'll share it with you someday once we get it out yeah I understand I mean that's what it's like a homes an interesting thing all by itself just as far as I'm concerned this idea of like I want to share these certain things but there's all these times and places that make sense and like for me I like the idea of time stamping because people watch this video and be like I remember that dude was the one who I learned this from and I watched that video which was published on this totally and few other people can't be like yeah I mean you can find the info on the internet for sure make sense for you guys but like I understand information sure I mean it's hard to to say you know anything because it's like well we could have you know an edge or any was really trying to focus on quality and I'm picking at the right time and if you're interested in actually producing something with here biomass or with like your seconds or like other than you know smokeable flower and if you're into into concentrates and hash is a beautiful thing and dry sip is amazing because you're not even having to use the water you're really using water in front of farming possible you get into like the Department of Public Health and so it's a different kind of inspection level on your farm that you know depending on the size of your farm may or may not be you know worth it so dry stuff is a great way to go and essentially you know we're using a tumbler and we're we're doing a cleaning on that and when you do iced water are you I'm like a paddle guy and I've also done some interesting experiments with for making vortexes through various means different things you know like I'm I'm definitely so we have like a it's like a stainless steel cone bottom brewing tank and really depending on what I'm doing I will yeah like a like exactly like a brewing tank with it and then I'll have like the little thing and it has like a nice wide valve so it comes out really easily and yeah and yeah and then you know there's a we'll put like a grade inside so it doesn't all drop into the cone and then my kind of like a standard hash machine's friend she's doing but then we gonna do a hand store in that like that's kind of unique um I don't know there's a few of them there's one I know there's a company that sells like like I was doing this and then I saw a company selling these things exact it was like the exact same tank with like their logo on it with like you know little hash thing but they were doing something for they were like shooting co2 in it went into one of the valves to keep it like super cold you know so that you could do a minimal agitation and and not have to very gently melt off your fresh frozen but I'm not I they don't have any ice but we've dug our own ice usually yeah and and so now I mostly am making fresh frozen like for myself because I enjoy it and not doing a whole lot of it like just because of the hole so when you dry said like it's cured material yeah and so like to keep some maximum terpenes yeah well the flavors can blend differently when you cure it so it's a different it's a different component and the melt you know people are very concerned about the melt the melt it's like the thing is with fresh frozen like because I'm I enjoy it right but when you take fresh frozen you put it in a freeze dryer your freeze drying it beyond where I dried my resin right and then a lot of these freeze dryers depending on where you put your settings or whatever they'll have they'll suck out terpenes and you'll lose terpene from your from your hash because you freeze-dried it and that'll get and if you're some people put these cold trap things in there and they'll get the they'll collect the terpenes that they're losing but you're gonna lose terpenes from that rapid amount of drying absolutely and so I haven't really done test comparisons but I feel like the enjoyment level is is equal and the cool thing I think about dry sift is because people are always saying like Oh hash is so hard to drive well these resin glands are dried individually and like because they're hanging right there in your room they're hanging on the plant and they're just they're dry try any fruit drying in the air so when you have finished your trimming and you have your trim in your your smalls and stuff and you're gonna do dry sift now you have these perfectly dried individual heads and then if you don't have to go through getting them wet again you keep them dry and you have and you have the right way to clean them and you you have an equally pure equally dabba Bowl you know equally high-quality product that actually looks like individual single isolated trichome heads just like when you take it out of a freeze dryer and you put it through a sieve and it becomes powder again fresh frozen is like there's nothing else you would get from the garden where you'd be psyched to put it in the freezer and then take it out yeah so how come try comes because they're hard to dry and they take a long time to dry and they're finicky and they do different resin is music it's an expression on the plant right so it's just like which it's only creature it's its own you know it's its own the expression of that being in and so like yeah in the freezer it's you can dried like so if you're gonna be like air drying some of these really greasy strains while you're drying them they're gonna want to grease together they're gonna want to oxidize on the outside they're gonna turn more Brown you know what I mean and you're gonna end up with the brown patty of goo and people are gonna be like dude that's shitty ash I want the white stuff you know what I mean because that's just what happens because like and you're like whoa okay I'll smoke it because it's good but but you really like really the market once wants these these looks you know and there's a couple ways to get them and you you can either dry it air dry it in a very cold room and get those you know and plane it and sieve it and and get them separated into a powder but you need very cold temperatures you need it to be you know maybe a short window in the winter is how it kind of used to be but now people are using freeze dryers or cold rooms to make you know and so that's really to make a lot of ice water hash is energy intensive you know what I mean and and we're seeing like as people are making like 20,000 gallon washing machines you know what I mean and it's like well that's 20,000 gallons of water just to wash the resin off you know what I mean do you really is that route really gonna be the best way to make mass-produced products no and that's the other thing with the dry Steve is like I now AM able to keep all of my plant material in composting and I've just you know made a smaller amount of and a value-added product it's a value-added product I can make you know by just quickly if you guys ever do that when you do a wash you don't use that water back in the soil yeah we put them on the hearth and usually what I do is so you know like I've I've been able fortunate to like hang out with a lot of hash makers and I have like access to some more of the great people who have taught me some amazing things it's like not all my invention totally but you know like what well the best thing to do is to reuse your water you know so cuz you've already got it cold like on the farm when you're doing it small and you're gonna wash it again you you read like you catch the cold water when you sieve your bags and then you put that back in to wash it again yeah and then you have a huge advantage it's only a detriment if you've broken the material and you're making green come through you know if you're if you have it if you haven't done it if you didn't do a clean wash and you broke the green chlorophyll out of the material and that's mixed in with your plant it with your resin then matching hash was rough to then Cobra get with you and that's the thing with having to go through that whole extensive process and there's risk there's a lot of factors that can affect the yield and the ultimate outcome and it's a lot of work and so it it's kind of it's been kind of like a blessing that's been cool and a half that we had that we had a few here that out its scale of like what we want to be wholly full Miller you can something we can make right so it's just our I have some that I pressed out you know like I I didn't just like with a with a little hot thing no I think it's an e wise pocket it's kind of breaking up because it's like glass but you know I just I pressed it out yeah but um this is dry sieve that was just pressed out and it's like shatter so who were happy with the product and we can kind of this is really really nice my my simpleton logic I'm a flower person but I I love this I mean the goal is to isolate the resin heads right so however you do that doesn't matter and like that that look just like you should put your light on this through the clean when you talk about cleaning them I'm not trying to pry all your technicality it's like is it suppose it's a post sieving cleaning so we do okay I might as well share yes so basically we do a rough sieve that's full spectrum and everything goes onto one one surface right so the interesting thing about the resin is that trichomes heads have a static charge so if you create the right kind of static situation you can use the static to make the resin cling to that object and then you can brush it and you have pure it's just like when you were a kid and you'd play with the balloon yeah you know right here like or like pull the iron out of the soil or like any of those magnetic kind of games it's it's just it's just using static electricity and they just come right out and so you'll have all your material will separate out and you'll have this perfectly clean it's just all their heads and then on the other side you'll just have like this tiny little dust kind of which was just like whatever was left through the sifting and to me okay so this is one of the most beautiful things about it to me is because the resin is totally dry when you do press it it retains this like glass marble like texture and stability it's like stable like that it's not gonna turn into a wax it's not gonna butter up like hash makers always complain about when they're ice water has butters which means it's getting moisture in it it's totally dry and it's like glass I totally this was done like like a hot-water bottle press you know like in the parchment and then but I don't do it that hot and then you remember I don't like rosin in it I'll tell you I so rosin you know like do you like just okay yeah and I'm not knocking on rosin this is just my personal thing you know but you know when like all rosin kind of tastes the same to me because it's it tastes like juice from concentrate you know like where there's not a lot of there's no pulp left and there's not a lot of the stuff where you're like this is like like your if you make like the connection to that conference yeah if you like like if you're gonna make like how friend she talks about wine or whatever it's like that if you're gonna make I don't really drink wine or make wine but we like to make like ciders and the moochers but it's like if you're gonna like strain out the cider or you know like a wheat beer it's not quite the same kind of thing you know what I mean it's like something about that is in the like when you when they all stay together and they blend they blend together differently and it's like a fermentation where when you press rosin it's like making juice from concentrate kind of extractions you have a you have a maybe the only the most intense dominant aspects of it really come through and they're powerful but because they're concentrated but then you lose a lot of the nuance and complexity that really enjoy and I got the product initially and I also feel like when you're grown well when you're growing a six-star melt you don't need to rosin press it you know what I mean because of rosin press like making Roz yeah I really like I have been sitting with this like who's the hash thing interests me because it's part of it regards reality like even like I am so into the flower but I know that there's you know there's a lot of I products of this plant so then when I look at it from that aspect I say like the thing that the rosin crowd and people are even even hydrocarbon people is this ultimate refinement in their eyes and they're removing the the excess their ruin the skin from the head however you want to describe that process but that might in some ways be a detractor that there is it's so complex that there's got to be parts of that that aren't just the fats and lipids and whatever they complain about but maybe it is different types of terpenes another minor cannabinoids it I don't know casing is part of the preserving of it and I wonder a big part of it to me is the second to me the second that press goes down and that heat supplied you just see all the terpenes everything just kind of gets first open and so immediately it's going to change and then with the resin it doesn't necessarily burst it open but it bursts it opened and it forces it through a screen you know what I mean so it's like we're stood up into in that it allows it to be now open to the outside world it's not a sterile casing it's kind of like when you get into like olive oil pressing and you're like is it urgent is it extra virgin what are the temps they did it at you know is a cold-pressed you know because like definitely a fresh cold pressed olive oil is something that's amazing and so some of those Rosen's where it's like they're fresh and they're pressed out really low temps they are amazing being so fresh and that I'm not rocking we're awesome because there's great Rossi's out there but not too pressed flower I've pressed dry sieve and the thing about rosin is like for me it was like you had to be at the Machine and to get what I wanted out of the Roz and I was making [ __ ] around so long and I don't just don't like [ __ ] around with machines you know things if you like to do that you probably really get into it it just wasn't me you know and I don't I totally get why people are into it and I totally get like the melt that you get from Rosen's but I like to see like how when I grow my hash you know or make hash from when I grew it's like how good how did I do you know what I mean how how well did I grow it and that's how I get to feedback is how well Roz and also how good is a hash because you know the hash it is only as good yeah so it's it's a great way to like learn about your plants and what you're growing you know and what happens after you - and the ability for the different types it has to really either show-off the quality and the need for that type of hash to have good starting material and then as you move down the line towards whatever the the less that's kind of important because there's all these refinement techniques and now like with the media's that people are pushing product through that's able to hide that but with something like just real hash with sift it needs to be a really good story it's kind of funny because I've been having actually the last couple years I've been having a lot of difficulty with my a shields and they've been really you know kind of on the lower end and with the dry sieve I've been able to like use bigger screens and like a lot of my a lot of big stuff is just I'm not being I'm not able to get it in the ice water like I'm not able to get stuff that's bigger than 190 190 microns in my ice water screen it turns out really dirty and gross but when I'm cleaning my dry sieve I can keep that and I can keep it all together and it's like so it's a cool to be able to enjoy like some of the things that I've been it's like it's working you know like but how do you get to enjoy that part where it gets just lost in the water so it's been cool them to do dressing sorry cuz I don't adopt this this is Amanda you could both touch on this but let's just go Carlo like so is this partially a cultivar thing or you think it's the way that you're cultivating it that you're seeing in these yes I think partly it's the way we I think any calls available and I think it has something to do with our our app like our region it's unique to that we're at a low elevation in a high elevation mountain area we're only at 1200 but the mountains around us are all five you know it goes up to five six and so we get these really dramatic swings of hot very hot days very cold nights like almost we can count on 40 degree temperature swings pretty much and so we get very little coast I mean we get some coastal influence but it's it's kind of blocked by this big mountain range and it's the place that I've kind of found where I'm like okay I can feel like I can grow in door looking weed out side but it's totally different because now the resin is doing different things than honestly I don't know why the resin has they're so huge it's it's a mystery means cool things are starting to happen area do do also have similar pronounced yeah it's interesting because it affects was what they're talking about in about 190 or G that's going to like what they in hash would they call like work bags there isn't a lot of sizes that are bigger than that so really that typically would catch minor contam plant matter of contaminants and that if your guys is glad I can see why it's a difficult situation for making water hash we're like driveshaft all of a sudden allows me more flexibility in that range it's kind of amazing I mean it took us while they even and like the thing is the amount of weight that's in a head that's between 190 and 220 is amazing yeah that's your those are your numbers right yeah people in your region at different altitudes not notice well like we because you notice the inverse which is other people at the same elevation noticing the same you know how we just have started to really explore this further because we didn't really know that that was the case until recent years where you can really look at micro imagery of your trichomes on a regular basis I mean that just started to happen in the last few years and so we didn't and then with with washing technology and just where Jacobs evolution was with passion and like we came to discover by being able to see them on this level that OH there and we didn't know that everybody like it took time to figure out that it was this weird phenomenon that it's unusual oh you want to my little hasher little pieces of glass yeah all right carry on budget production oh no we just that's how we like it yeah we didn't know until Reese this was even a thing like oh our resin pants are huge that's okay cool and then it's like sometimes I see it in people who live in our you know a night but I don't know what all the factors are if it's just that if it has to do with the Sun lunar soil the soil some sort of combination of

with the og way yeah we're gonna pour it in the bottles this time i mean if you guys have seen our other lean videos you know we've done it a bunch of different ways youtube just took down one of our lead videos about youtube for real bro why they be doing that man that sprite's carved that's all i gotta say oh [ __ ] all right it's about time to get into this you guys i drink a little mine because i wanted to have a lot more mixture in here all right i guess i'm going to do the pour first yep this [ __ ] it really does smell like gas too like i feel like i can smell like the thc i don't know it's just crazy but see what this is about you guys yeah let's check this out oh [ __ ] damn they say this mixes really really well yeah it makes it foam up too a little bit yeah you just gotta be careful with that don't pour it all at once yeah don't pour it all once that's what we also sell i'm pouring it all though guys you guys doing this for you guys you got to fam i would normally never do this all right every drip and as he does that it's time for me to do mine look at that mud guys that's dirty bro dirty there you go now i got mine yeah some strawberry you got it [ __ ] yeah oh it looks pretty all right go ahead and get that first turn in get that saucy dude it mixes up really well too like it's already like pretty much mixed in with it do you see how our sprites really look right now it's [ __ ] wild right they're dirty bro that's muddy bro muddy [ __ ] sprite that's the definition right there i think that's probably good enough that's [ __ ] dope man i wanted to get like a cool close-up shot for you guys whenever we pour into the cups so it's just gonna be dope yes i know you all like the close-up shots so we're gonna get this this saucy in real quick all righty here we go oh look at that color bruh it's like so it's like pink lemonade almost yeah it's got a purple color too it's like clearish at the same time wow that [ __ ] smells spam it really does why does it smell like cat really something crazy like a dab or something that [ __ ] [ __ ] gas it looks so dope you guys i don't i can't show you but it looks so but you all [ __ ] saw on that shot like time for me to do mine how does it taste strong wow that's good man i liked it it's a little it's a little on the medicine you know you get you get that medicine flavor oh mine's actually pink lemonade look at that [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah man god let's just hold up let me bring this this camera oh you guys got to really see that [ __ ] color it's [ __ ] looking good now you can see the color difference purple and the pink that's where that's where it's at that's it it's actually like so strong homie just drag something last night another shark that we had yeah bro i just drank some last night and it was not not nearly like this no this [ __ ] actually tastes like death the other [ __ ] was just sweet bad this is like it really tastes like cannabis like the cbd i see where the medication that they're talking about like the people say that the end the aftertaste is like you know medicine but that's like literally the cannabis that's legit shoo i'm not gonna lie it makes my cup like it makes the drink look so much look and we still got more in there too we can't even we couldn't fill up the whole cups that this is gonna be good for you ladies what i'm saying yeah we're gonna try and drink it listen if you guys feel like you need like an extra a mix then do this that's why you got the double chest honestly i still feel like it was just mixed just as good and like just doing what we did with this i wish you all could [ __ ] taste this it really is like a [ __ ] hitting like a [ __ ] cart or some [ __ ] for real really like really [ __ ] crazy i got like a little drip or two it says it takes up up to two hours to fill the effects but i bet bro i always feel it in like 30 minutes i start feeling like a little low you know what i mean i'm probably going to finish this [ __ ] off and we will come back in like 30 minutes and tell you all how the high isn't [ __ ] but realistically i think we're going to be feeling this here in like 15 20. soon i swear you don't have to drink all this [ __ ] like we don't have to drink all this [ __ ] to start feeling it i really feel like it says that the um the serving size is like a teaspoon and there's six in each bottle i really feel like a serving size will probably sauce you up bro yes i'm gonna pour more of my saucy in here i'm trying to get all that saucy today i'm drinking all this liquid fam i'll do it like don't don't don't hate on him for it but yeah i might not end up finishing mine you never know that's a lot once i start feeling it bro yeah well we'll see you guys here in a few guys yeah this shit's [ __ ] gas you can all see it y'all really can see that [ __ ] i'll be back see you soon yo fam this shit's [ __ ] fire i'ma drink all this by the end of it but i'm already feeling it that shit's [ __ ] gas i'm feeling it too cuz hell no it ain't playing but we'll be back hope you all [ __ ] with the video like and subscribe for more gas like this stay crunk stay chronic yo fam i'm i'm pretty much about don't this [ __ ] [ __ ] little stray still gots a good amount of hiss you know happy she's [ __ ] straight hitting bro like we're goddamn guests oh we don't recommend this at least at this amount just get a teaspoon hey guys we're back we're [ __ ] sauced as [ __ ] guys oh it's just strong brush i pretty much got all my finish i'm just the bottom of the bottom of the liquid oh [ __ ] you poured a little bit on there it's just nice we're that hot i didn't drink all of it i drank like a good half and then i poured some more sprouting to make it taste better so i got like melt left this shit's so strong like we had to pour a little bit more [ __ ] spray in it just to make it taste a little more you know freaking strong yeah i don't recommend doing the six servings it's ridiculous it's not like it's bad strong it's just really medicating you can really taste the disc not really it's not distally but you can taste the live rosin in there you can really taste that salt we've had like two two different lean videos now and this is the strongest soap and i have all the animals that we had out of all the edibles that we've had [ __ ] these these little pieces of shits right here [ __ ] rocked our damn heads the smallest milligram of all the edibles we had stony patches we had nerd ropes we had a whole bunch of different [ __ ] a bunch of [ __ ] you got this [ __ ] no cap one teaspoon bro one serving i swear you'll be saucy i'm telling you 30 minutes in it because i've been drinking on this dead on the couch bro i was just chilling man i swear like after the video i literally went and sat on the couch and i did not get up the whole time yeah it's been like hours like it's been a good hour yeah you saw him in that mid clip right there he was just chilling i was up moving around trying to like i was trying to get my head kind of calm you know i mean because my heart pumping this [ __ ] is strong like this this stuff's high quality you know what i mean like it's not played but definitely man recommend that for sure go check them out go run us up too underscore hotbox go check out our instagram yes we're gonna be posting about this for the next few days for sure yes so run that [ __ ] up man daily dope content stay high we are high are you high for real make sure you understand this is thc syrup not actual you know medication like coffee syrup [ __ ] we're not trying to promote none of that this is some you know official legal cannabis healthy cannabis you know cannabis liquid right here for real and i'm pretty sure this is all organic you know what i'm saying like this is really good high quality [ __ ] right here because it's got cbd in it too it's got like i'm pretty sure it's five to one cbd like ratio i'm pretty sure that's what it is that's where the slime is strong that's where the slumpness is coming from like i'm feeling really really heavy my body's really heavy my lungs i would say my chest more like not really lungs because it's like we're not smoking it's just my chest is making me want to stay towards the table like i could lift life down this little nap bro i swear man this shit's gonna be good though i'll be drinking this all night you know we really [ __ ] appreciate all you got to support man like running up right crazy i can subscribe for more [ __ ] like this our analytics are really just blowing

it's really designed for travel personal use trade shows um to go and set up heat up quick and uh then extract either a gram nug or three quarters to a gram nug in a piece of parchment paper with no [Music] bag that's one of the presses that it's made to do which we have here in the back some dosey dough and then in the front we have some chronic kush it's also made to do a three and a half gram smash in a three and a half gram bag like this bottle loaded bottle textile um we advocate that extraction method so all of our surface area to pressure calculations on all of our units have been done assuming that you load the bags bottle textile like i said the mini was made for two two different smashes a single nug smash and a piece of parchment with no bag or a three and a half gram bag smash loaded bottle textile now both of these different uh ways of extraction the different weight of extraction are going to require the same pressure because at the end you're going to get the overall same surface area on the extracted material so if you're up to a one gram nug with no bag it's probably gonna be a little bigger so it'll be a little less pressure that you're applying you know um if you go closer towards three quarter of a gram nug with no bag uh it's going to be uh more pressure on that surface area because it's going to be smaller so you'll learn that as you get a unit and you start to extract you'll see the different different results in and out from the different product and whatnot especially if you're on the growing side so we're waiting for this oil to melt over here

one now production is up well shady 580 we got the nug smasher pro ready for you here just give us a call and we'll get this sent over whenever you're ready what else we got better than watching porn nick garden i'd agree with that porn for stoners i dig it complete wash 86 i could see there's a some similarities there so jared stallman how much material did you start with to get that much bubble hash at once was it nugs and trim or just nugs um for that i don't know the exact amount because our friends over at 11 11 cannabis company uh provided us with the bubble hash but it i do know that it was a fresh flower trimmed right off the plant it was still live so if that answers your question let's see what else danny thompson it's like watching da vinci paint i'm seriously considering picking up a nug smasher at harvest time this year i used to be into the whole backyard blasting thing but figure now that i'm growing the garden of my dreams with all my favorite strains why half-ass it when it comes to concentrates that keef was beautiful i'll always have a soft spot for keith full melts i definitely agree with you blasting is cool but rosin is a lot cooler all right i think that's enough for now let me know you guys thought of that we can keep reading them off like i said we read all of your guys's comments so try to keep it positive if you can [Music] so [Music] [Music]

do it the right way so throw away those hair straighteners and let's get right into it rosin is a concentrate extracted from the cannabis plant using nothing more than heat and pressure the result a translucent sappy and sometimes shattered like product that is potent and flavorful enough to rival any of your favourite BHO products but what is the difference between rosin and other concentrates out there one word of solvents most concentrate extraction methods require the use of a solvent such as butane propane for co2 rosin however does not but how does the simplicity of heat and pressure transform cannabis into such an overwhelmingly great product the accumulation of trichomes trichomes are those small shiny bubbles that appear on marijuana believe it or not those microscopic bulbs actually contain most of the cannabis plants cannabinoids which provide most of the sense flavours and effects but can anyone easily make rosin themselves yes yes you can and will tell you how before you get started you will need a couple things a nug Smasher fresh flower micron extraction bags parchment paper and a dab tool grab everything you need aside from the canvas of course in a bundle at knucks master comm so now you're good to go let's jump straight into one very important factor starting product you may ask which nuts master gives the best results well the answer is all of them you get back what you put in it's as simple as that fire in fire out that is the number one most popular saying in the world of rosin because your extract will only be as good as your starting product if you put garbage into your oven at home it's not going to taste very good now how about a pizza it's gonna be the best thing you've ever tasted same goes for rosin if you put extremely potent trichome coated flowers into a nut Smasher mini well you're gonna get back some amazing rosin if you want high-quality results you need high quality products for tons of information regarding various starting

this is some crc ran oil right here um it's all by altered alchemy this is some budget stuff here in oregon going from uh 13 to 15 to g on saturday 15 to 17 on a normal day i'm here at the dysport i go to this one's a little bit drier this one's one of the 13 ones and those are those other ones are the 15. now let me like get into crc just for a quick second before i start dabbing these crc is color remediation for those of you who don't know it basically strips some of the color out of your oil but it also strips some of the terps so it does make it kind of a more bland terpene profile a very light crc will strip some of the color but also leave enough of your terps intact where it tastes different a heavy crc is going to taste like in my opinion kind of tastes like dog [ __ ] it's it's a very bad taste to me um i'm just going to be straight up this one right here i'm probably not even gonna dab during this video i just got one gram of this to try it and we took two dabs yesterday and it is just i'm not gonna lie it's not very pleasant it just tastes like straight crc which i'm trying to explain the flavor in the smell when you smell a gram of straight crc it's almost a lemony smell like an artificial lemon um almost like a capri sun you know where it's slightly orangey but it just like has this this like i can't put my nose on exactly what that smell is it's it almost smells like a tiny bit artificial to me but it's not it's not um that's just the smell that it gives right so on the heavy side of crc you get everything tasting exactly like that having a crazy clear color like this guava skunk right here but then on the lighter side the lighter side you get stuff that maybe it slightly takes out a bit of color and leaves enough terps to where you have a difference in flavor profile that being said even when it is a light crc as some of these kind of are a little bit lighter you know maybe the color didn't go crazy to light you're left with some of the terps but then you also have some of the crc flavors so it goes both ways so for a budget line like altered is doing this is anthology's budget line pretty damn good deals how can you beat 15 and gram out the door right well let's try them let's see how they taste and uh let's go from there and i'll review each one of these i'll tell you which one's worth it which one's not worth it and how i feel they compared to what i've been buying recently which is viola which is 24g here in oregon 22 a g on saturday so um speaking this is 50 less being 17 a g on a normal day 15 a g on saturday that's seven dollars less which is pretty much fifty percent so it's significant so now i'm going to try to tackle in this review is it worth paying 50 more for viola or is this budget more worth it for your buck we'll see um i guess i'll just start it by heating up the first [ __ ] damn let's go all right we got it heated up and ready for the first dab here some guava skunk this one's the lightest out of the four and choose everyone [Music] yeah i mean that was a really nice uh nice size dab it was rather large oh no i got a glob of reclaim on my finger let's see if okay so let's get to the review it's not harsh at all actually it's very very smooth um yesterday when i took my first dab of it i was like is it slightly harsher than the other stuff i've been dabbing i think my answer for that is no it's not it's actually very smooth that one especially it's really nice smooth the flavor though it doesn't like smack you in the face with terps or anything you know sometimes you get sometimes you get a gram of oil and you're just like damn the terps on this one are just so good they just make your cheeks pucker and they just really just give you that feeling we're just like oh terps um i don't get that feeling here i'm not gonna lie that being said from one that oh [ __ ] me oh [ __ ] okay sorry everyone i dropped my uh my insert on the ground which you really don't want to do they're hot do i have carpet burn to this now i don't want a dab carpet bro [ __ ] i might be able to get it off let's [Music] yeah i think i'll be able to get most of it yeah here we go i got it we'll get the fuzzies out of there all right give me a second we'll tune back in once i finish this", "dc9wL5oTNWE": "[Music] Cannabis itself has been has been consumed for thousands of years and ever since people have been consuming cannabis they've been making cannabis concentrates and typically how these concentrates are made or just beating the raw material to extract the trichome heads and make what's called hash and there's a lot of plant material mixed in with this concentrate hash needs to be smoked hash oil can be vaporized there's actually no plant material involved hi I'm Mike I work with Rosen technologies I helped develop the pneumatic rosin press [Music] [Music] typically what people do to produce oil these days is with the solvent they'll take a solvent and they'll run out and over the plant material to where it dissolves all of the essential oils the problem went that way is there's those people that take butane and they pour it through glass to very unsafe settings like in a garage and one of the reasons we're so excited about this method of extraction it gives people a way to be able to get these essential oils of the plan without solvents you take the cannabis you put it under the heat and the pressure the oil will run from the heat and now you have just the oil separated from the plant material this is a cannabis oil that is made from just heat and pressures hi I'm David with rasen technologies I'm the innovator of the pneumatic rosin French we designed this product around being able to control that extractions right here at the top you have the digital readout the temperature that the heat Playstore at top and bottom is both heated on the side over here you have the ability to adjust the pressure we also have the two-hand anti tie-down features that keeps the user from being able to have their hand caught in this machine when operating this is actually an OSHA certified design just in case anybody action only took a toke and isn't paying attention they're not gonna hurt themselves yes you could say I'm that type of person that just builds things out of necessity if I'm doing something on a daily and I want to make it better make it more convenient then I'll go out and make something that does that for me we're perfecting our art I feel like it's always interesting to me to see something go to the next extent I think it benefits everybody to see the cannabis industry have an evolution forward [Music]", "EOgPlzu0YNY": "[Music] [Applause] what's up the elevators a little hard to everyone that's locked in locked on coming straight to Babylon and from Babylon we shall always escape today I have something for you but it's not the normal it's just me sampling some has frozen that I've had for a while but before I finish it I want to share it with you because basically let me tell you what has frozen is hash frozen is when you take hash put it in a fine screen paper and press it in the machine it's not same difference as if you wants to play press flower cannabis but still oppressing the cannabis you take the trichomes or the part of the THC that has the psychoactive properties and distract it from the Berlin but once you get that extraction you extract it again from the hash and make rosin so it's taking away all the fatty greeny stuff out the rosin has whatever you want to call it that you don't want it makes four per clean-tasting high THC goodness matter of fact just let me show it to you real quick you see that yummy goodness you see the color you see the parenting and the smell is so strong the smell is - smells like Purdy we'd like the best and the finest weed you ever smelled it's really good this one let me see if I can get a better image for you guys that's about it I don't have my camera I'm using my cell phone hey the smell this one I don't know much about this I don't know what strain where I don't know any genetics of this one but I do know it smells vainglorious makes me wanna holler get out the game but too many people already know my name mmm-hmm okay next step let's taste it see what is uh see what the effects are I can't give you the I don't know the genetics but I can't give you the taste in smelling the physical properties okay quick summary has frozen not just regular bouncing has frozen you got to remember that so if you're looking forward and you want to pick some up remember to ask for fresh frozen hash Ronson it has a process to get that color it has to be fresh it has to be frozen it has to be made then it has to be immediately freeze-dried if you want the color and sustainability and taste but anyway let's start with the heating process yeah I know this is a real whack torch is what we have to work with today to get the results we want we get our nice and hot we're gonna taste this hash rising right before your very eyes [Music] I like low temps so the probably almost perfect for me see the flame on there you see who see nice and high anyway let's go and see what she thinks about [Music] take this take this really fresh it's really clean it has almost like no no expansion on the long snow Carson to throw just like a real heavy start filling in your eyes immediately I love everything about hash which is my favorite way to consume cannabis still clean no other particles unwanted chemicals there's like finest of the finest wine Terence of the clearest water tears of the stars at night with the twinkles in the eyes just saw the goodness you love about cannabis you know if you really in the fix are all set immediately I could feel the euphoric sensation just teaming up and down the back side of my body and I'm pretty sure that in 10 to 15 minutes that will produce its final course of helling activity to make sure that all the benefits of having a per hash sample it's going to shine through and shave that the best results come from the finest material", "XQMHIiu1JFs": "hello I'm venom 4:20 and today I'm gonna be showing you how to make caviar [Music] before we get started with anything else let's go ahead and take a quick dab so one of the big keys to how I'm showing you to do this for cheap is because I'm showing you how to do it with some reeds and you'll notice when you take a nice low temp dab you're gonna have a little bit of reuse I tend to keep mine in this little jar just like that got that out of the way so first off the things you're gonna need are some nugs something to do this over I'm using some parchment paper you're gonna need a little Bowl or a little dish to hold the key then you're gonna need the actual Keeffe itself just from the bottom of three-part grinder you're gonna need some type of oil to cover the nugs in so the idea is you're going to be covering the nugs and oil then rolling them and Keith this is all stuff I have already at home but it's even better to use like honey oil another good one you can use is distillate another good one is rosin and you're also gonna want some gloves too because this is going to be a sticky mess at some point so it's then good to sticky in here [Music] so now the goal is to wrap this whole bud in oil let's go ahead get this going and we'll just take a nice see there [Music] see that's just pretty gettin towed it already just coat it as much as you can [Music] now that's fully coded and then we're just going to take our little jar keep like that and we're just going to start pressing it down just like that [Music] [Music] and now it's probably starting to look a lot like something you've said you know we're expecting [Music] that is what I'm talking about right there that is a fully formed ball perfectly round Moonrock for you oh one down we're gonna go ahead and do this one more time I'm gonna go a little bit lighter on it than I did last time because this one's like a little bit like a play-doh ball you know it's it's too soft [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah that one's this one's mostly hash oil kind of the difference is a little bit this one feels a lot better just a little bit less oil I spread it out a little bit more even this one has a bunch better texture as this one's like a [ __ ] gooey mess I put on so much hash oil but it's just I mean look at that that's too much there's a little nugge pot in there but I mean not much so I'm actually I break that little tiny piece and make it its own little moon rock so that guy too he's an hour like it's so so and this one I can I'm just flying away that's just so like kief so oh yeah but way to get my channel on this one I am like I'm just pulling off the hash oil and rolling it in the key I think I'm creating my own new thing right now I'm calling these comments with AK a little venom comments and that's just pure hash oil and Keith rolled into a little low ball making new things the cat see Ziggy likes a chef I'm just glad he's sleeping on the chair next to me and not [ __ ] getting involved with this one cuz it's too messy those are cool they feel like a little like candies or something a little caramel balls but they're just pure oil drops rolled and Keith from the excess I had made off that moon rock just pulling it off now that I pulled off all that hash oil look how much smaller that is I was able to take all of that off of that by pulling out so I weigh over did the oil you don't want to do that because that actually sucked like this one and this one now are like perfect you got these perfect ones so now these ones have like a great consistency and these are kind of cool I like these little new inventions I came up with I'm sure it's been done I'm sure someone's had it if anyone knows about these put it in the comments below and tell me if anyone has a name form or anything like that because if not I'm coin in that [ __ ] they're little little comments but okay so got your moon rocks here and now these ones feel really good they're really solid and they're gonna break apart fine we got this little mini moon not here another way I like to do it is to take all that oil we got it and just start spreading it onto there we're gonna touch it for two seconds and really [Music] it's got all these little chunks honey there yeah Randy the same thing just go spread it over anything it sticks to alright so there you go that's another way to do it right there to is to take a paper cover it in oil cover it and keep and there you go I've heard these called caviar or moon rocks I think moon rocks is more of a thing that's been coined to a certain brand I think it's corrupt its corrupts moon rock that's it yep so I believe that technically moon rock is coined by that guy and that's like a brand that he grows and that's his thing so technically this is all caviar so let's let's clear that up I've been calling it moon rocks and a little insider knowledge on that as well as when caviar was first coming out I need someone who had you know the hens had just a dispensary they knew what was going on in there they worked there and he always told me not to get caviar and I'm like why and he's like well okay did the coming Aaron type thing is like the thing is is sometimes we get bud that's just really really shitty it looks like [ __ ] there's no crystals it just doesn't really do much for us so what they started doing is rolling it in oil rolling it in Keith and hiding it just like you know you could take something that's not very good and turn it really good you know what I mean you could take pretty much swag and make it besa got one more thing for you now the last one we're going to do is something called Sun rocks so what we're gonna do is actually instead rolling it in Keef we're going to roll it in all this and you'll see how there's all these shards they actually work a lot better if it wasn't so [ __ ] warm right now and every time you break it up you know there's a little tiny shards all over the place little flecks so we're actually going to be using that we have that all piled up put that to the side I'm gonna steal one last rap [Music] he's pretty much covered now we're gonna go ahead and take that and start rolling it [Music] [Music] [Music] and then you got one of those guys it's like a quantum Jim Rohn [Music] [Music] [Music] this is an OG Mike Montgomery double bubble bubbler Mike Montgomery is one of the original artists at the Chong glass company and this is a UV one it lights up really nice I'd like to eventually own a piece by like all the dudes who used to work there let's go ahead and load one of these [ __ ] up so I'm gonna go ahead and break that apart you can see it just [Music] crumbles and there you got the layers like to give a special thanks out to mr. Chuck I'm gonna put a link to his Instagram he helped me acquire this bad boy I love this thing so it's got the Homer smoking a blunt [ __ ] Satan Flanders to Satan Flannery's I should say and playboy Oh Marge oh yeah that's [ __ ] awesome awesome piece awesome moon rocks again gather so it was a little son rock here made ourselves some new little comments I don't know if that's a thing and also just I think the easiest way is to just roll it on paper and smoke it that way a lot of people put down the outside of the paper but that's kinda I feel like for show more which is fine sometimes because it's cool to can I don't look at it do its thing you know but it makes a mess I think when it's on the inside it only makes sense anyway so that's how I make my own caviar for next to nothing that's all from reuse I saved from my dabs and put my jar for later it's all from Keef that I collected on the bottom of the three-part grinder and it's from you know just any type of bud you want to use like I said I like making it myself because I know what ingredients this is the cheapest way to do it not the best you know what I mean you know all stuff that we've collected now if you get some really good distillate or some really good rosin or you know all these different ingredients you can make it yourself and excellent excellent quality this is just a really awesome link to experience if you even like it again super awesome thank you to everyone who helped make this happen thank you to everyone who watched go ahead and let me know how you like to make it I'm sure this is kind of an open thing this is you know what I'm doing isn't the way to do it it's just a cheap way to show you how to do it if you have other tips on that go ahead and leave it I think that's awesome anyway go ahead and check out some older videos be sure to LIKE share and [ __ ] subscribe from me and Ziggy take it easy keep it keep see you next time", "swXm_XPodwY": "alright guys so let's make this short and sweet I have six grams of gummy bears inside my peer pressure rosin bag I go over here open up my plate excuse it in there and I'm gonna get this in the center of these plates I can't do it one-handed so it will be very bad start off a little bit of pressure oh sure Jews I don't expect no big downpour like I said this is 6 grams so I'll probably get about one point three grams of return from it somewhere around there 1.2 1.3 man definitely looking good a little more pressure now be careful though because you had too much pressure you will bust the bag or the parchment paper this is really strong parchment paper it's not from the grocery store this is from peer pressure also but you can still only take so much before you rip it wide open alright guys so we're at about the 2 minute mark [Applause] [Applause] so there we have it looking good peace", "i2e0VGP2PQo": "[Music] a heads Manitou roughout studios and welcome to counter basics today we're going to learn how to make extremely potent cannabutter or cannabis oil using freshly pressed rosin we are going to be using the tea check THC tester version one in this video today if you'd like to pre-order version two of this awesome device please check out t checked ami and use the code roughhouse to save money now the first step into making rose and press cannabutter or cannabis oil is going to be to make some rosin wax now rosin waxes if you don't know that already we've covered this in some videos before so we're not going to go into too much detail but basically it's making concentrated cannabis by pressing between heat and enormous pressure your cannabis buds to squeeze out the rosin for concentrated form and this method we're going to use both the rosin that we press the concentrated version and we're going to use the leftover pucks to make this very strong can of butter so whichever method that you're using to make your rosin you're going to go ahead and do that first and I'm going to be using about three and a half grams I'm pressing about two grams and my first pressing I'm using this rosin TechEd products smash is the name of this device I'm using here I'll put links on where you can get different kinds of rosin Press devices and the description of this video as you can see there the pressure and the heat combined together and it squeezes out the concentrated cannabis now this concentrated cannabis is what we're going to be using as the basis to make this high-potency butter but we're going to go ahead and separate at the beginning the puck from the cannabis itself from the pressed out rosin because we're also going to be using the puck which is this piece here that you see to make our counter butter and the first infusion so go ahead and press the amount of rosin that you're going to use I'm going to use about three and a half grams so I've pressed twice and then the next step after you've pressed your rosin is going to be to infuse it now I'm putting my oven on 200 250 degrees Fahrenheit so make sure you do that at Fahrenheit or you'll burn your canvas up so pre-heat your oven to 250 degrees Fahrenheit and I'm gonna be I pressed the rosin twice I'm only going to use one of the actual concentrated forms of the cannabis but I'm going to be using both of the pucks that are left over because the rosin press is not the most efficient way to pressure cannabis or between concentrates out of a cannabis there's quite a bit of THC left inside of those puffs so the first step in this is going to be to first infuse and whichever kind of oil you want you can use butter you can use olive oil in this case I'm using coconut oil and we're going to take our rosin pucks in a very small container I'm just using a metal and 1/2 cup measuring cup have broken those into really tiny pieces they're pretty easy to break it's already been decarboxylated by the pressure and the heat from when it was originally pressed so we're gonna be able to skip the press or the step that we usually do have decarboxylated I'm gonna go ahead and add in I'm using one tablespoon of the coconut oil into both of my pucks which is what's left from three and a half grams or 1/8 of cannabis I'm going to put that in my oven covered with some aluminum foil to keep down to smell for two hours [Music] now during this time I'm going to go ahead and scrape off the leftover or the rosin that I've pressed out in the original pressing and what are you gather this up and collect it on a small very small piece of paper smalls can trim down for the parchment paper there so I've trimmed that down I've got all my rosin right in one little spot here and we'll be adding that to our butter and a little bit later but before we do that we're going to filter our butter so what I do is I put the little Roz and paper down in the bottom of my filter pan and I put the filter on top because I don't want to combine that rosin into all these rosin pucks again the last thing we want is it for it to absorb back into our cannabis pucks so just for testing purposes here I've only infused the cannabis pucks here this is without the rosin add into it and just for our reference I'm going to note how much we have here for cannabis so we've got fifteen point five that's milligrams per milliliter there we're going to look at it in the tablespoon version so it's a bigger number that we can figure out so looking we've got two hundred twenty seven point eight milligrams per tablespoon prior to adding in our actual concentrate so now what I'm doing is I'm filtering out that plant material from the pucks and I've poured it right on top of that rosin that's on the parchment paper beneath there and we want to use the heat of the oil to remove the the actual rosin from that parchment paper so it's important that you do that later and put it back into that 250 degree oven for about 20 minutes after that oil gets up to about 250 degrees it's going to make sure that all the rosin has come off of that parchment paper and you can just take a spoon or a pair of tweezers or something and just slosh it around in that water and that that all that rosin that was on there it's going to absorb all the way into that and now we're ready to do our final filter and what I do here is I use a much finer mesh than I did before I'm just using a coffee filter and what's it leaks through your coffee filter good then you can squeeze it out to make sure that you get all of the cannabis out of your filter there I'm just gonna make sure that we have all the plant material out of our butter or our oil have a nice refined oil and at this point it should be very very concentrated because we've added in all of that rosin from the original so the next test now is going to be to just test it with our THC tester and see what kind of potency we have I can tell by the color of the oil it's probably going to be pretty strong but you can't really tell definitively that way so let's go ahead and test it there with our tea check let's see what we have over over the limit that's a good sign but it doesn't really tell us much because we really need to know the exact but it's over the limit of the device the testing limit so what we're going to do there is now we're going to dissolve half-and-half so we've mixed one half part of the unenthused oil with one part of the infused oil and then we were to retest it again and now we'll be able to multiply everything times two to get the accurate reading so our Teeples tablespoons is 574 milligrams per tablespoon that's great that's really nice and strong it's 39 milligrams per milliliter 190 1.4 milligrams a teaspoon and that's 4.2 percent total THC and our powder really happy with that and really it would have been amazing if I had added in all of the rosin from that we'd have had closer to 800 milligrams per tablespoon and amazing amount and now what I'm doing here is I'm taking one table or actually one teaspoon which is just about 200 milligrams per teaspoon and I'm adding that into about six ounces of melted chocolate and what I want to do is I'm going to make some candy bars and I'm going to be able to know how much THC is in these candy bars it's going to be plenty strong enough and without much taste so the one thing about this oil is it because we used a very small amount of oil we've got a high potency there but we also use the concentrated cannabis we have a much more pleasant taste that what if we had to add a lot of cannabutter to get the potency that we wanted or if we had used a full plant extraction on the whole way because the rosin has a lot more say pleasant agreeable taste and then does the full plant extraction in general so with these two candy bars I put two teaspoons and a little bit more still would have been equal to 400 total milligrams so I've got two bars here that would be 200 milligrams each bar but you can take those and chop them in half and what you'll end up with is 100 milligram candy bars which is a great thing to know and it's also a great amount of dosage with the this kind of candy bars too you can break off the little pieces and you know have like 33 milligrams per bar or like 8 and 1/2 milligrams per little section there and so that's just one of the many things you can do with a high potency infused oil I would like to thank the guys

to reduce plant fats and enables a more dynamic range of cannabinoids terpenes and flavonoids because of this process jelly sauce is going to be a bit darker in color the naturally occurring flavonoids are molecules responsible for a wider variety and spectrum of flavor exhibited through natural representation of the blend of the cultivars used the separated blue river snow is fully converted into THC and range reduced back to the refined rosin sauce to boost overall potency and onset of effects the flavor profile of this oil is something you've never had before my trooper bust mixture of right blueberry and gas coat your mouth as the vapor delivers a powerful 93 percent total cannabinoids containing 9.6% terpenes mercy and Kari awfully in healing and little ole being the highest testing terpenes in this 50/50 blend of refined rosin sauce and activated THC a in a zero tolerance oil free of any impurities pesticides or heavy metals also once you grab them for yourself

using everclear and some of the pucks i have left over from pressing yeah and don't worry guys uh nylon doesn't dissolve in you know alcohol unless you're adding extreme heat so i'll add a few more and then i think uh we're ready to add the everclear that's why i didn't play basketball all right so now i'm going to add the everclear and pretty much fill it up to the top so yeah guys like i said earlier uh you don't have to worry the nylon's not gonna dissolve in the alcohol so yeah uh i'm sure i'm still gonna get a few comments even though i've said it twice now but [Music] all right so got it to pretty much where i want it and uh just put the lid on just going to make sure the lid's uh nice and tight so you can take a quick look i'll let this jar sit for a week until i touch it again [Music] so after the week i'll take it out and see if it's ready to use or if i want to use heat to expedite the process so yeah that's how i go about making my tinctures take it easy guys", "CoHhuHboSAA": "while medical cannabis is already available in more than half of American states and recreational cannabis nears its cusp of national legalization ensuring that the weed you buy from your local dispensary is as potent and as pure as advertised is still a bit of a tricky proposition especially when it comes to shopping for concentrate when you're buying flowers themselves you can check for the presence of chirping crystals on the surface for at least a rough estimation of its potency and give it a quick sniff to clue in on how it will likely taste but when it comes to concentrates you're generally at the mercy of the person behind the counter to set you straight of course if that sounds like a bit of a bum deal you can always make your own and that's where the rosin bomb rocket comes in this 13 pound tabletop rosin press is designed specifically to convert the THC crystals present on the surface of cannabis flowers into a solvent les dabble hash it does us in the same manner in which diamonds are formed within the Earth's interior through a combination of heat and pressure it's super easy to use just plug in the press turn it on and wait for it to heat up to around 210 degrees Fahrenheit while that's happening you just need to take the biggest stinkiest stickiest nug of cannabis that you can get your hands on and wrap it in a piece of heavy-duty parchment paper once the press is sufficiently hot separate the press plates wide enough to fit the paper wrap nug between them and then press the plates back together over the next two minutes or so the combination of heat and pressure will liquefy the rosin causing it to flow out of the flower and onto the parchment after you've extracted the rosin just wait five minutes for it to cool and coagulate then boom you've got yourself some concentrated resin which can then be scraped together and used in whatever dabbing method you prefer whether that's vaping it straight with a peak or crumbling it into a joint or over a bowl of green to give it a THC rich kick while the rocket is much quieter than similar presses that rely on hydraulics for pressure rather than its electric motor it is purpose-built for home use so don't think that you're gonna be able to start your own hash production business just because you happen to pick one of these up the other stumbling point for the rocket is its price this machine will set you back a solid six hundred dollars roughly the price of a mid-ranged average what's more you can achieve the same general results albeit with a much lower level of accuracy with a standard laundry iron or hair straighteners and some wax paper still if you're serious about your dabs or just don't trust the man with your hash stash the rosin balm rocket is worth a look", "RQppj42jV7M": "what is up it's your boy chronic i don't know how much of this you guys are going to be able to see in my face i'm going to try to angle it just right um it's your boy chronic we're back with another how-to so this time we are doing dry ice hash so as you can see i have dry ice in here um i've got my trim this is just just all the excess trim that was uh from hera so this is jack herrera trim we're going to be using one of the this is the 220 micron bag i have a set of bubble bags that i use and basically what i do is i go ahead and make sure all of this is in here and it doesn't slide out i make sure that i've got it all in this container sitting on this dry ice make sure it's uh really getting cold and then from here i go ahead and i give this a nice tie and now there are easier setups this is just my setup this is what works for me um you know this is just how i do it it's easiest for me you guys will see here in a second now another important thing i'm going to bring you guys over here hopefully you guys see this is this collection tray you definitely want a collection tray of some sort that's like a stainless steel or medical grade stainless steel or something uh you can collect with and uh the last thing you'll need is hey would you be able to grab me one of my business cards can you have a second okay last thing you'll need is a card to collect with i use a business card uh they're clean it's easy so let's uh start the process so basically i'm gonna scoot over towards you guys bring you guys a little bit closer and angle this down hopefully that stays there basically you just uh flip this over as you can see i mean all of that already and you wow and you basically just shake it up you just give it some tumbles thank you sweetheart business card keep it close to the tray uh basically guys you're gonna do this dry ice hash sifting for about 30 to 45 seconds maybe a minute until the color starts to change once the color starts to change that's when you're going to go ahead and collect you know do your first collection move it off and then do your second collection um basically as uh wow there's so much here as there as a it collects and breaks down with this dry ice more plant matter is going to come out so it's going to be more uncured so i usually do about 30 seconds um to 45 seconds minute tops for my first run because this is all trim and i know a lot of this is actually pretty quality i'm gonna go ahead and just do a minute so we're going to keep shaking just for a little bit longer i'm going to do my first collection and show you guys what we got so i generally also go based on the color tone so i am not only watching uh or counting in my head just like you know how i i am at i'm watching the color of the hash that's actually coming out so we're gonna go ahead and stop so i generally set this off to the side just like that take our collection card and we start collecting and we just have mounds and mounds and bounds of hash so this is uh the way to collect dry dry ice hatch guys so you're gonna watch me a few more times basically uh do this and i'm gonna do the rest with uh the rest of hera and i'll come back after i uh you know you guys will see the time lapse and everything of that but this is basically the general concept um 30 to 45 second intervals one minute max you really want to watch your color color is everything your nice golden tones are where you want to be sitting for your first run your your mid golden tones with a little green is where you want to be sitting your second run more green towards your third and fourth runs fairly green on your fifth and sixth run uh the seventh run i usually just don't even do i put the the material uh to use by doing edibles or putting it in my magic butter machine so that's how i make use of the last little bit of material that has trichomes on it so there's that so that is what we just collected um we're going to go ahead and do a second run don't do that guys do not do that barely got any out so we're going to scoot this over generally i don't like mixing these so i do actually press these separately these are my different press runs they all taste different they all have different quality for sure i press at about 190 degrees to 200 degrees for about 100 seconds and uh right now i'm using 90 micron i usually do 35 micron for hash but i have to use what i have to use uh so yeah that's what i'm using you guys will see that in the next video this one's just going to be uh the dry ice hash extraction so we're going to go for round two and it's looking mighty golden and nice still so that's a good sign lots and lots and lots and lots of heat so guys another key thing um you want to freeze your product before you actually use it this trim has been sitting in the freezer since i actually trimmed her um it was dried and cured everything was dried in here not cured sorry everything was dry so it was all dry product proper humidity um i didn't trap any moisture any unwanted anything unwanted but i definitely uh i definitely froze on my product the next bit of run we're going to be using is actually sitting in the freezer now i always suggest freezing it um you know the colder the bud the easier the trichomes are going to fall off you don't want to make it too too cold um you know you don't want to keep in the freezer for prolonged periods of time you can damage the trichomes you know a lot of people think crypto freezing is actually like really good to store your butt there's actually studies that show it it reduces the potency over time so you know there's generally if i'm gonna process um right away you know within that first three to five days i will go ahead and put my stuff straight to the freezer from um you know trimming however if i'm not going to process i go ahead and cure my bud or cure whatever i want to cure and um once it's you know cured i'm ready the day before i'll throw it in the freezer you know that way it has 24 hours to sit so we're gonna go ahead and stop this is gonna be our second collection i'm gonna kind of scoot it away from this edge here so i can set this down man just loads and loads and loads of thc guys just insane set that down right there you know what i actually have a tool for this let me grab it i don't even know why i'm not using it alrighty so now that i got my actual scraper that uh is designated for this because i'm a dingus i forgot i had it um oh my god look how easy that is the card was i was struggling with the card all right guys so there's our second run looking nice and uh pretty still gold still fairly golden brown golden still fairly tan like a sandy color with a little bit of green that's what i want so we're gonna go for our third one here in a second and i'll show you guys what it looks like and then i'm gonna get to doing uh more more dry sift hash here's the third one we're gonna same thing 30 to 45 seconds maybe a minute max looks like at this point it actually is coming to a halt on how much is in there so yep this will be the last run that i do for the trim and i'm going to trim with the used rest all righty she's getting pretty green so it's a good sign that more material is coming out than actual trichomes so we're going to go ahead and call that the last run for the trim and i'll go get actual hair bugs next which you guys will see some time lapse footage of so what the hell little fuzzies came falling down alrighty so then from here i take this out there's going to be dry ice in here and i'm going to want to as quick as possible get this stuff out guys don't touch dry ice with your bare hands it's bad it can hurt you but uh basically i take all the dry ice out because it's not done it's definitely still good all right guys we're back all right so i got my little collections and i need a sharpie alrighty so here's what i do here's third run of anything so all my third ones are going to go into this one this is how i stay organized keep myself clean and not contaminate my product it's important guys if you're going to do your own stuff at home damn it shut some of these lids don't shut whatever that's good enough um okay we're gonna be pressing today i don't give a [ __ ] about these lids so there's three there's two [Music] uh all right then let's take our product so we take the excess stuff that we did we're going to be using for the edibles go ahead and dump it all perfect so here it was seeded out so i'm just going through here and picking out any uh last seeds i see and we'll find they're healthy because you know here s ones are always awesome alrighty let me show you the last little bit of this before i go uh ocd picking through here with seeds which i'll be doing before i uh probably sift it before i put it in the stuff that's amazing so i'll show you how to prep this if when it's not already prepped and then that'll be the video guys so uh with product you definitely want to take it all off the stem so make sure that you take all the stems out um break your product up that works as well as just like you know chunking it off it is going to get broken up but i prefer to not have stem in my uh dry sift just makes it easier that again guys over top shake shake shake and you know what's up i want to say thanks for tuning in uh be sure to

some other [ __ ] from there this is trippy Duval trippy - this is mediocre not as cool as this is a I've implemented all of Duvall's dabbing in streaming habits and just turn the camera on brow and thumbs up holy [ __ ] call this [ __ ] people are hearing that I'm gonna dab for every like so that shit's going up guys are [ __ ] I guess I could get this out of the shot right the artist formerly known as do Paul LaGrone Duvall homegrown 7/10 everyone goes subscribe to his second backup channel my videos are getting better karma pop is saying my videos are getting better thank you so much it's fun making them say I definitely enjoy that [ __ ] probably hungry huh yes thank you so much I appreciate that a lot did you bring me your ball oh my god you're so smart let me feed you done we're smashing it and indeed smashing it it's you smashing it all right doggie is bad way back yeah he'll jump on me eventually cuz it kind of freaks out when I talk to the camera for long at a time I noticed some the second lives are the first live stream also happen Andy you're heading out much love if you don't know what I'm dabbing now some sappy live resin I'll probably have a video on it eventually but it's uh it's called dayglo it's a local growers own but turned into the librarian you don't know the difference between live rosin and hash rosin I'll try to explain it explain it so with ash rosin somebody that knows their [ __ ] uh probably okay basically passed rosin is made from taking fresh bud like a large amount of it and depending on the way you make it you could it's two different way so I'll explain the the water hash way so you can make hash rosin by agitating a bunch of weed with water and shaking it up and straining it into bags so like the trichomes fall off into the bottom of each bag you scrape that let it dry out and then you take that product and you smash it on the rosin presses something like what I have and that's how you make hash doesn't like this [ __ ] it's all super pure solvent Lissa doesn't take any chemicals like most wax like has butane co2 or propane in it to extract it but any type of rosin is solving this no chemicals no [ __ ] other than heat and pressure water but then with life rosin slightly different hash rosin me made with the hash of the weed this is made from fresh fresh buds they're probably super fresh right off the plant frozen and then thrown in a nut Smasher like that it depends the type of weed it varies I've press stuff at the same exact temperatures and you can get many different variations of colors like super dark putty or [ __ ] you could get light color like super shatter II stuff she's still here yeah yeah it's cool didn't like good types of weed and being able to press it and figure out the types of consistencies because some weed doesn't press good at all another strength and steel [ __ ] get like the best best looking [ __ ] lighting color claiming this stuff is so shattering though that's sort of saying that hash are not hash causing any type of rasa specifically rosin from pressing nugs neither can have crazy different textures and stuff this one's super shattering it's been out of the fridge for weeks and it's still okay had to get the tool hot to get it off with the did it I did it a dad time do balls about to pass out Duvall one more DAP time and you could you have my blessing to fall asleep angel say dad time one move over one dad time yes captain sleep tight my friend just might be my last stab out of this pretty toasty hour-and-a-half is what I was probably gonna do in a song sick oh those real taste holy [ __ ] b-ball good night man thank you so much okay [ __ ] okay what's the dog's name his name is Benji Benji he's wild he's a wild pitbull candy yeah

__ ] and I'll see you off for the next step load now I will awkwardly I'm trying to figure out in this", "THzn8apDpKs": "ok everybody we're back now you saw the last two videos you got her pucks we've got a whole bunch of them here there's probably 40 different strains here this is heat safe because it's used for canning a regular mason jar this is what I use I use liquid coconut oil because this is the most bioavailable of the coconut oils and it works really really well for making edibles so take it there is 16 ounces in here that's 2 cups I'm going to use so oil now we got to do put the lid on give it a nice little agitation here make sure everything gets covered in the oil and we're gonna stir this occasionally during the process but now this has to go in the oven this is going to go in at 240 degrees for two and a half hours okay when we're done we're gonna strain out all this material what we're gonna have is a highly infused oil that we are then going to add to lots lots of gelatin flavored unflavored and that's how we make our edibles just go right into to a form usually see they're gonna be the usual halves my favorite are these I like these gumdrop ice cube trays work really well they got the little little squishing on the bottom to get these out of there it works really well so this is what we're going to use everything else is probably going to go into a bulk container that I can just portion out in a later time but this is going to make a bunch jealous so follow me we're going to take this in here gonna put it in the oven it's already preheated to 240 just in case there's any kind of pressure we're off so we're going to come back in two and a half hours when this is done and strain the material out when you take it over here and show you how I do my enemies everybody's got their own technique this just happens to be mine done by many many requests to see how I do the edibles that I made so please join me in a couple of hours thanks for joining me on this first part of the two-part video we'll see you soon", "Z9xCmaeWQYk": "so you like clear color remediated shatter huh it's got to be clear it's not clear it's no good I'm sorry to tell you that's not the case at all color remediation has given us the ability to further refine our extracts and that's that's nothing but but reason for joy however it does not need to be completely refined to this point to be enjoyable and unfortunately in a lot of cases people that are refining it to this point are robbing the plant of some of its natural essence shout-out to Murphy Murray dread pirate and I'm sure many others but those are the only two I could think of off the top of my head the shout out to the processors out there that are that are doing this crc thing and and truly they understand ads or banned chromatography and they understand that this is this isn't bleaching and when done properly the Terps are even louder there's nothing to to get in the way of them your percentage is skyrocket there's so much less plant matter to be in the way of your terpene to cannabinoid ratio and then how much of the hundred percent that makes up so CRC is an absolutely wonderful thing it's the the natural step for evolution as far as cannabis extracts go but I guess just buyer beware you know it could could be the best stuff you've ever tried and it could also end up melting kind of dark and leaving very very interesting colors this is pretty clean no but sometimes you'll notice some very very dark reclaim and you're smoking white clear shatter or almost white clear shatter but it's but it creates dark dark reclaim and of course when it melts it melts dark this stuff as as you can imagine when it melts it should look almost like water and that here if you see pigment appear during the meltdown then obviously the anthocyanin chlorophyll plant matter filtration wasn't successful it was clearly still plant matter there and even if your melt is okay but you think well a little more color than I thought they would be but but it still looks great that's that's not bad so check your reclaim if you reclaim start showing up dark like dark reclaim look like the kind of reclaim that shows up in your rig when you're taking dabs every flame it looks like that you're smoking on some polished hurts if it melts like this and you know you got yourself some fire so once again shout out to Mary Mary the whole team over at Santo Gardens and dread pirate shout out the future 4200 for all the information and all the love that he puts out into the community and I guess to that to that extent shout out to the entire good life gang but as I mentioned your CRC oil should melt and or vaporize and/or reclaim as follows okay guys probably should have saved you on some heat up time there but what can I say I'm not a filmmaker so let's use the heat up time some shut up 7:10 Montana shout-out to you guys we're having some fire clear BHO some some properly CRC material and shout out to the 710 extractions that's me we're making all this solvent that's fire that it's just just shattering the analytics and then of course tighten that shut up dude Glaser highly educated Gordo's scientific and of course mr. Connor still don't know what this is well of course you do it's a thermometer to very very accurately take the temperature of my quotes and if you're watching this on Instagram I'm sure you know it is right now if you don't know what it is congratulations somehow you've hidden from most of Instagram for a couple months anyway if you're on YouTube that's very possible this would be the first time you're seeing it and no this is not a dabber or anything even though there is a diving attachment for it I personally like to leave it on or not threaded in so that I can stand my Yosi so there we go we're green 5 85 86 so we got a couple seconds I like to leave the dab robbed of it because I like to stand it up in that little 3d image 3d prints damn this is what your clear should melt like ladies and gentlemen I hope you all are having a great week great weekend and a great start to year no chirps left behind hmm oh I see why you call that grape soda okay god [Music] right okay so before we get in here do any swabbing or anything like that let's take a look at what we're left with okay a half ounce of weed yeah that's all right and oh thank you tripod you did a great job of holding that phone still no look should be at least at least one little spot of reclaim sorry guys can you see it it's not reflection there it is look at the color of that very reminiscent of hash when it's being freshly made that color if it's a very very dark reclaim let's go right here on the front there's almost always something just underneath it now it's not another good sign is that it doesn't very heavily reclaims a bunch of your oil is we condensating and turning into reclaim in here I'm by that I mean it seems like you're creating more reclaim than you normally do then obviously we have a color up job they did not technically refine or filter anything they just lightened up the coloring particulates in plant matter and things like that things other than the cannabinoids and the terpenes reclaim a little faster and they reclaimed very ugly very dark not like a very very light sandy here so ladies and gentlemen hope you're out there enjoying all your crc clear clear clear clear if it's not white it ain't right or some dumb [ __ ] sounds racist this [ __ ] if you ask me but anyway um for those of you out there you know banging on your clear and being all hype man about it sweet I'm with you I'm glad you're excited about your missing make sure it's truly clean now because some of us actually know what's up by some of us I mean many of us know what's up so don't be the hype man for some clear that reclaims dark with it melts down dark that's just polished turd hope you all having a great day didn't really have any more of a reason to make a post than other Jin really just to share this clear shadow with you and my my thoughts as a chemist behind it and then of course I wanted the opportunity to shout out the people that in my opinion are doing this process properly Brent you know who you are 710 Montana you know I love you guys and specifically or more a little more a little more notably Murphy Murray and the entire Santo garden team which to be honest with you they of course they don't make shatter they make fine fine live resin sauce and THC a so they wouldn't even produce a product like this but if they did make shatter I bet in Murphy's would be even more clear just know hate 7/10 I just I gotta say it she's good and and dread we don't really know each other or anything but I've seen your work and I'm always impressed so I'm very confident that that I'm shouting out to of the right people and again I think a lot of us would be either a little bit further behind or maybe even worse maybe have some information that we paid four-oh if it wasn't for the likes of future 4200 so to wrap this baby up shut up future 4200 shout out dread pirate and shout out Murphy Mary and the whole team down at Santo Gardens alright guys just because it's clear doesn't mean it wins the prize peace", "87H7zH7g6ls": "[Music] rosin these terms get thrown around a lot from dispensary counters to national newsrooms there's a lot of questions being raised about cannabis concentrates one part art one part science the sticky amber oil has a culture all its own i'm off to explore how it's made and why many consider these forms to be the future of cannabis i'm roxy streier and this is the art of extraction [Music] true to form it was raining when i arrived back in washington this time we're headed north to visit pioneer nuggets and learn more about solventless extraction and this rosin thing people are talking about the rosin process is fairly simple you use heat and pressure to squeeze out the essential oils and then collect your extract due to rosin's low yields it can be tedious but the results are almost immediate originally from louisiana pioneer nugget's founder fitz is a free spirited fish fan welcome to the nursery this is where life begins his humble approach empowers his employees to try new things and take risks so rosin tell me a little bit about it for the people that don't know well rosin is it's a new you know it's another form of concentrate made with just using heat and pressure um so it's real simple uh kind of all-natural extraction method uh that sort of got discovered by people doing it at their house with a hair straightener and so we built a little bit bigger machine to see if we can squeeze larger amounts of rosin out of some of our leftover nugs and trim when you say a hair straightener you literally mean a hair straightener yeah i've never actually seen it done like that but that's how these guys were doing it for a long time they were just taking a hair straightener and squeezing their nugs and uh messing up their hair straightener and messing up their girlfriend's hair straight so now both of us are pissed about that makes sense but now i'm happy okay so it's been working out well for you then it's an art so it takes about five minutes to learn and a lifetime to master and we're just trying to find a balance between having some good material that we grow in-house and turn it into a good oil for everybody why would we do something like this instead of i don't know extracting through a co2 extraction process or butane propane it's just a different way to do it you know those machines are closed systems they uh they can handle a lot of material at once with this method it's a little more simple but you know it's just an all-natural way to do the same thing well i would love to see how hands-on this rosin process actually is i think that you were going to show us to the freezer yeah let's take a look at where the material comes from and then we'll come back and see how the machine works it's as simple as just a drop freezer okay he's got some uh pouches pre-made that he makes and then puts back in the freezer and then all the frozen nugs and material right here so we'll grab some of that out too a bunch of snoop's dream nice hello again aloha ethan could endearingly be described as a cannabis nerd his passion and intelligence when it comes to the plant truly sets him apart okay so this is what we start with then you turn it into these and then we put it in the freezer and this is what comes out yes cool i have it come off the trim table and get froze so all the water molecules in there go back to a crystal form of ice crystals allowing it to heat back up quicker and also keep the trichomes in a better state so they don't oxidize as quickly so why do we want it to be able to heat up quicker why is that important well i want it to reach its stage of viscosity faster so it can flow quicker so it can cool down quicker the longer time it spends under heat it'll decarboxylate and you'll get a lower grade product forgive me if this is a silly question but why are we putting it in bags well by putting in the bag it allows it to hold all the material together and lets the oil escape through the bag and get away from the trim so there's less plant material that can escape and get around okay cool so let's check it out then [Music] i have a piece of parchment folded in here and i will take a singular pouch and i'll put it in i'll apply pressure to it and i will slowly watch as the oil starts to steep away my correct intake is pretty hot right now it's about 200 degrees by having the heat it allows the trichome to go from its more crystalline state to a viscous state so it flows why do we pick 200 degrees why not hotter than that hotter will start to decarb more as you press so i want to run at a lower temperature all right so how do we how do we run this baby well generally to operate it you apply pressure with the travel arm and then once you reach where you have some pressure you slowly increase pressure through air is it moving yes it is uh oh that just slides right back in okay make it pop break it thing keep going all right that should be good and i'll operate it from here with the air how long does this whole process usually take it can take from a minute to about two minutes depending on strain and when i'm pressing and how much product will this yield well in there i put about 40 grams so i if it maintains the 10 yield that i've been getting with this specific process i should have four grams of oil on this sheet of parchment by the time i'm done or around four grams oh i'm starting to see it yep i can smell it as it comes out and as you see i did have a bit of a blob but most of the oil flowed out in this direction so this is actually an end product yeah you can take that right now and use it so i'm gonna actually get to try some of this product later any recommendations of which strain is best with rosin my favorite is blueberry silver tip mostly because i like the color it comes out and the flavor that i get from it okay but that's also a favorite strain on a flower [Music] well first let's uh open up this lavender take a look at that one to me that smells i mean it smells like lavender it smells very floral it's very floral yeah if you really spend time looking at the terpene results and smelling stuff you can learn a lot about why you're smelling what you're smelling you know you're going to see tiny and limonene and these are flavors that people like and the strains that have better mixes of those flavors seem to be the ones that consumers enjoy the most this is acapulco gold it's sweet but earthy not as floral this smells more like the plant to me though right than that one does all right now we'll try the blueberry silver tip which will be a completely different smell you should get a little bit more of that floral smell but with a blue with with blueberry assigned to it but blueberry like blueberries out of the garden legitimately it's going to smell like blueberries let's try it smells spicy like it's like a spicy tree i think it smells very similar to uh to back to back and small different they are well based on the way they smell which one you want to try definitely the the blueberry okay i like that one and it's bet you know when you're starting out it's better to go small than too big and if you want to do two small ones that's fine a lot of times i think people take too big of dabs at first because they're trying to recreate the same sensation in their lungs that they typically get from smoking and that's that's not really going to happen you're going to find that the flavor hits a little stronger and stays a little longer and then the sensation is going to last longer than your typical smoking experience okay did i do it yeah that's a good one to start out with it's small but you know it's a good way to i'm small every the only thing it's small i'm small it's huge it's way too big it's massive okay i'm gonna do it go for it you can't really mess up swipe it and then get that cap [Music] see the way the pressure allows it to kind of finish cooking off and it's cooking on the nail while you're eating it it's a nice nice dab without overdoing it well did you taste blueberries with hints of flour and sage i find that about the blueberry silver tip as well let me ask you this could you tell the difference uh between a rosin dab and a bho dab or one of the dabs you've had before do you find that this has more of a true cannabis flavor i think that this one had this the best flavor so i don't know if it's more true because the other ones were different strains right so i don't know if those are truer to their strains but this one had the best flavor um and it felt the least harsh on my throat maybe that's just because of the size of the dab i did but it tastes more like flour to me like when i'm smoking flour but just more of a taste in my mouth well our favorite thing to hear is that it wasn't harsh on my throat fitz thank you so much for the rosin dabs and for showing me around pioneer nuggets i really appreciate it absolutely thanks for coming [Music] when i heard that rosin could be made at home with a hair straightener the idea seemed wild but after watching the process its simplicity was put into perspective after exploring many extraction methods i find rosin to be the most natural because we never added any solvent to me rosin is a closer representation of the flower than the other extractions i've seen [Music] you", "bYQ48pJqLuQ": "hello everybody welcome to another great episode of strange city um today sorry madam today we're gonna be smoking on a good little variety here of this concentrate and I just I like going over concentrate because it is a new thing and people really know about cannabis already they know about the flower they know about weed and what it all is but not a lot people know about concentrate and concentrate is just like if you're gonna take an olive and squishing squishing squish it and get olive oil out it's the same concept except we apply heat some solvents and sometimes it's solvent Liss so it just really depends on what you're getting what type it is and that's what I'm gonna go over this but people you know not in Colorado and not in a legal state that can get this kind of stuff or even knows what it is that they can be careful and that they can they can understand what this is and that it's not crack it's not heroin it's not anything like that and I kind of get the sense that people think that because sometimes you need a torch to smoke cousin just no concentrate and you don't really need that we've got our email set up which is an electronic mail a lot of people know what these are some people don't it's an electronic mail it has a titanium coil and it wraps around a titanium nail let's see if I can get these separated here so yes this is my email what it is is a type this is my titanium nail and what it does is this part is wrapped around a center see if we can get yeah you guys can see where that little hole is and right in that ring where there's not the hole is where I put my mic concentrate or you know my man I like to call it my medicine because I actually do smoke for medical purposes so one by one will slowly go over what these all are I have wax I have shatter my co2 so this is gonna be I'm not sure visit I would call this an oil so I've got an oil or shatter in a wax so without further ado this wax this is gonna be a wax now wax can be anywhere from clay light consistency to a buttery like you know play-doh like consistency you know from a hard clay to a really soft play-doh so this one right here specifically is platinum blueberries so the color and the name don't really correlate all the time but that kind of shows you guys kind of what wax is like it kind of has a see if I can get a good it's kind of it's kind of chunky I tried to break some rock but that's not gonna be able to see that too well so we've got a wax that's kind of buttery like and kind of play-doh like consistency alright and this is this is really good for like bait pins anything like that I enjoy it butter and stuff more in bait pens and stuff I don't really vape at all of them so this is gonna be another wax just to kind of show you guys this one's a little bit harder consistency and a little bit more grainy but you guys can probably get the gist of what I'm talking about a little explaining it correctly so those are waxes I'm gonna move to a shadow which has a more glass like consistency to it and a shinier and is more solid I guess in a form so this is shatter and this is very beautiful shatter at that this is another name is cuz my favorite critical mass that's what it is it's my favorite strain this is very good for pain this is a very high CBD count compared to other strains so I'm honestly gonna be taking a DAB to this first - tbh you guys but this stuff is really really beautiful I'll go ahead and give you another little there's through the song but I do enjoy all different types so chatter is more glass like and more and more hard I guess a more hard and harder my girl might be so mad right now and then harder and it's consistency and it's glassy that's the best I can put it is pretty much like glass or like plastic you're gonna snap it it's gonna break so this stuff it's in a syringe and a syringe dumping needles crack down on all that chronic crap so this right here is full of you can kind of see it's got a shim not shimmery but it's kind of an amber e color mmm this right here is a used one obviously but it only comes with a gram of concentrate in it and this is made with co2 so the difference this is an oil so if I if I do this with it it's gonna this little string of oil come out and that's in that soil so you've got oil which is really runny now we've got shatter which is glassy and hard and we've got wax which is play-doh light consistency is the best way to put it so that is a run around of all of not all of the types but a good mix of the types of concentrates the consistencies they don't really change like live resin can be shatter YX come you know oil it can be all of those so the the main ones are gonna be oil wax and shatter until you get into like the crystal lines and in the crystal it and that kind of stuff so that's a that's a crystal and I would still call that shatter at that so with that being said we'll take a DAB for you guys what do you need to mean you need a ver Cheers oh well guys I appreciate you watching enjoy", "SDTzMDPQUew": "gobble-gobble [ __ ] welcome to mad body TV the 21 plus medical cannabis channel actually I think now we can say 18 plus medical cannabis channel because I think YouTube's easing up on us here a little bit Community Guidelines anyways guys there's something I wanted to preface this episode with it was cut off while not cut off blocked during my WAPA episode my waffle press so I'd like to restate it for you guys just to just to reiterate that even though we had a victory the other day in the Senate the fight for legalization is far from over guys I mean we got ways to go we got to stay active we gotta stay knowledgable and vigilant you know we got we have to be on point to get these laws passed how we need them very fast so that we don't get stomped on [Music] according to the most recent FBI Uniform Crime Report police made 660 3367 arrests for marijuana related violations in 2018 that total is more than 21 percent higher than the total number of persons arrested for the commission of violent crimes which is five hundred twenty one thousand one hundred three of those arrested for marijuana crimes some 90 percent was arrested for marijuana possession only if that doesn't make you sick to your stomach I don't know what what would as a fellow member of the canvas community that should get you angry but I'm hoping that 2019 has better numbers as I said that was 2018 2019 is coming to a conclusion now we'll see what the numbers are but across America police making a marijuana related arrest every 48 seconds there you go guys there are still illegal states people are still getting arrested for the stuff people are still going to jail for this stuff I went to jail for this stuff prison not Jail prison that means I went to jail and got sentenced and went to prison not just all I went in the drunk tank for the night [Music] it's not a joke guys you know instead because you know in States whether we have legalization this is an important note too there's there's not it's not adversely affecting the community where we have legalization in fact it's the opposite okay [Music] also there's these [ __ ] concerns about like the youth using now that more that more than before because of legalization that's also the opposite now the youth is educated on it because we're not lying to them anymore when you lie to the youth that's when they go [ __ ] you I don't believe you I know I'm not stupid you know and then they go it smokes smoke a bunch of weed before they probably should I mean you know smoking young is never a good idea cuz your brain still developing I did what are you gonna do anyways guys I just wanted to preface this episode with that note because it got blocked and I thought it was something really important to tell everybody and let everybody know join the National Organization for the Reformation of marijuana laws and stay informed write their representatives stay active dance anyways welcome to mad botany TV thank you for joining me and we're gonna get in it let's hop into the dispensary hall here and then we'll go down the press chamber and stop and smash surprise and baby thanks for joining me guys to get a minute what's up ladies and gents we just got back from fine fettle Willimantic and they had a great sale going on 20% off for Thanksgiving happy Thanksgiving everybody gobble gobble um we also got a bunch of cool swag that I'm gonna show you start off with that huh got a couple of AGL I mean a little disappointed in any idea why didn't you use Bix we got a couple AGL lighters at least they're in my favorite color combination blue and green but they might cheap oh I don't know why because they're a plant also gave us a lighter but it's a bag it's pretty cool right so we got a couple lighters three lighters [Music] fine fettle pan [Music] we got an AGL pen in my color combination full of grief these are really nice shades of more of like a kind of reminds me of that glass color agua Azul and I like this navy blue so we got a couple pens a couple of these AGL stickers these are new we grow for good I like that kind of looks like a nametag like you have your name tag right there a couple of those and these are some new fine fettle stickers yeah I'll show you what the old ones theorem what you almost think they were the same but they're not this is the old ones a little bigger with a white ring around it [Music] cool little notepad [Music] AGL this is gonna be really useful I always write stuff down him I don't have a pad like this I have a bunch of scrap paper that I saved just random pieces of paper a lot of its from pre-orders from dispensary pre-orders um I saved it as scrap paper just so stuff I want to write down I can write down well now I got a pad for it so that's cool and for some reason I always have pens that don't write so hopefully these pens are good and absolute pens now I'll finally be able to write for some reason I pick up heads in my house that have like no ink in them so I don't know why I don't ask all right so besides all that is that this is the cooler part [Music] AGL t-shirt you go for good navy blue and [Music] Farah plant t-shirt medical cannabis producer in black very cool t-shirt and everything was 20% off today as well oh and this too I've got a cool little uh one of those little rubber pure leaf bracelets Cele USA Felix EP all right well let's start digging into our our bud first off we have a stream that I like to get whenever it's in this is animal face into call FG as you can see it's 31.5 seven percent so we're looking at almost 32% here THC possibly also we have 1.2 9 % CB chief CBJ is a precursor to THC and the rest of the cannabinoids they would meaning they change from CBG into that other than that no CBD I didn't really expect to see any CV ocbn not CDC also CBN and is from THC degrading our decarboxylated farther and usually you don't see you see the N in flower unless it's until it's been extracted or processed that's when you start to see CBN showing up or if it's old very old been sitting for say a year you might start to see cbn even even less than that but uh it's got to sit for a while let's pop this open and take a look good beautiful looking bud all right so we got a couple of those they're little Smashing Pumpkins going on right now today first song was manning this song I actually from a David Lynch film Lost Highway I love David Lynch did a theater of Twin Peaks along with Mark frost but he's a movie director first and foremost in an artist and I really actually like the movie Lost Highway which this is from that sound drive so we got two of those into college Jesus see how the buds look at this one [Music] I'll definitely press this in so Endicott FG is it's called animal face which is face off oh gee I animals sweat no animal mints I think it is I think it's animal mints my face off oh gee it's on the screen so just check it out you know how we do and one more flower here we have a new one for you some ferret plant blue Lika kind of getting that reflection on the carton there but you can see that 32 percent THC and this is a public push bike em dog got some lemonade some mark scene and carry off lean and that's about it for chirps oh yeah 31 and change I almost have 32% as well so good take a look very nice [Music] [Music] but very much at all so I grabbed it by the stem [Music] very nice looking bud [Music] it's a great smell to it chirps are coming right out of there we got ourselves one of these into call FG pure oil cartridge beep and cartridge taste it this is on the same strand as the kg of flour that we got about 75 percent THC this oil is I mean actually let me check I'm pretty sure it's about 75 say right I'd say it's about 74 74 percent nice color to the oil as you can see yeah that is a nice oil I switched it up I almost got Tom another pack Sarah this week but it's always good to conserve and get the smaller cartridge because it takes less dry weight off of your prescription Connecticut we did two and a half ounces allotted to us a month which is guys it's not a lot it's maybe two and a half ounces sounds like a lot to you but if you have to spread it out over the whole month it's not especially for somebody who uses a lot for a lot of different aspects of their life a lot of ailments or a lot of symptoms that you know give you issues it's not a lot you need more than that to be honest with you and I think it's something we need to work on as a whole community it's just not enough I mean it's close its close it's not like it's terrible like I can make it but it's just I feel bad for people who who have worse ailments than me that need much more I mean there are different ways to medicate as well which use more dry weight than others so you can't expect somebody who's medicating that way to to um you need the same amount of somebody who's just smoking you know dabs all day that's it if you're say you're buying maybe like flour or pho sure you can get by with the two and a half ounces but if you're crushing your own rosin some monks might be tough if if you're trying new strains that don't give you the greatest yield I usually don't have a problem because I have a consistent press I'll usually get pretty consistent yields so I know what I'm gonna get I have a strategy at picking strings that are gonna be good for it well yeah not everybody's gonna be able to do that so and and say you make move you want to make your own edibles say you want to do something like that I mean it's gonna require a lot of buzz and if you want to do it consistently throughout the month it's gonna chop down your prescription allotment really fast and I don't think we should be limited like that that's not that's not how this should be this is holistic alternative medicine and there's no danger to it so that being said we got the Lulla cup packed up public push by cam dog 32% [Music] it's called drown another one of my favs by Smashing Pumpkins [Music] [Music] oh that's good I was a little worried because I didn't have much carry awfully and that's a major turf that I like this is righteous mad botanist approved guys [Music] it's given another hit first before we give up that stamp of approval [Music] [Music] [Music] it's really nice flower and I wonder how it's gonna smash but today we're gonna smash something

keeping this micro slide min like look at the walls you can still see all the way back from the inside because I don't let any resin build up that's how you keep heady glass clean and you should do that with with anything that you spent a lot of money on because if you want to keep it you want not to have resin buildup if it's something like a $20 plate then you can let the resin build up and just toss it all right got a little pink floyd going on in case you didn't know i love the classic rock now and like dark side of knowing is just an avid piece of rock and roll history [Music] me then

filmed this one because would you look at that gorgeous thick beautiful coin of delicious animal face rosin tell me you don't wish you could smoke that it's like it oh this stuff is incredible get you a nice look how shiny it is it's just gorgeous and the only reason I say I only kind of wish I filmed it was because it didn't really show from the front over the back we had this big of a puck it was a very small rosin puff but the yield was fantastic I love it when that happens it's such a great surprise I kept sitting there like oh man it's not showing out the front so I shown at the back I hope we got a good yield I mean there's 30 percent 31 percent almost 32 percent but how could it not be yielding and sure enough I open that up it was beauty at its best I mean this stuff looks like ash rosin look at it I just dug into it like I mean it's got that beautiful texture to it I've got a nice big dab ready to try it keep the lid on so that the Terps don't escape should always put your lid back on your rosin when you're having a session take your damn bow and then put the lid back on real quick we have to temperature yep 555 on the 710 light female we got my sherbert log that I love so much this was the first sherbert pencil I ever got and it's a Chad G glass by sherbert glass our collaboration very special you guys want my other one you guys can buy this if you don't DM me on instagram @ Matt the Matt botanist and half the money goes to me and half the money goes to sherbert we he sent this to me on accident so uh we kind of just said hey if you can sell it we'll split it and that was our little agreement he's my he's me I consider sherbert a friend even though we're not like really friends friends like through the great fun he's I mean he's a friend you know he did some really nice things for me and I really appreciate him let's go in on this [ __ ] animal face Cheers homies we got a dirty heavy glass it's not super dirty but it's pretty dirty I I wish I cleaned it the the nails fresh and clean so we're good [Music] so good eyebrow oh my god the Terps artists are amazing the flavonoids are [Music] only problem with not having a spinner cap and using a bubble cap to try and spin two roses takes a little more suction from your hit you really got to kind of give it a little more suction so I have to keep my water level a little low when I use it to pull on this you don't want any sibich but this this function is really nice and I don't get any sip it's really even when I have the water pretty high a barely if I unless I'm really falling off the thing I don't get sick [ __ ] it's amazing like how well these all my pieces function amazing that's kind of what I look for those function with the art [Music] I love this chippy cheap weave is so sick man this rosin is good guys wanted to share with you how amazing that turned out I was so happy L a loaf I going they call it's no fight I love putting on this the loaf i mixers on youtube that have different lengths season themes this one has snow going in the background it's kind of nice to watch so if you like lo-fi check it out on YouTube snow Phi it's just a mix there is low Phi artists stuff is amazing you guys can do this to a man you can do this oh my god guys I'm so happy with this stuff really great when you get a great you know that has just the perfect flavor flavor and the beautiful smell coming off it nice medicinal effect alright I just feel it right now it's just going through me relaxing me very relaxing hi see how I'd kind of jerk the piece a little bit like that back and forth that's just starting the tur pearl cuz it's stuck in the center we get it out of the center and once it gets to the edge this creates the vortex that just spins it you keep this straight down into the middle that's how you get a bubble cap to spin your tur pearl you have to plug up the holes if you have a hole on your bubble cap plug it up let's create my thumb is I plug it up in play it right down the center oh damn [Music] this stuff just keeps going and going the email is to always do that I recommend email emails some people are but just like torches better which I mean I am good enough at getting the right temp but I still would rather have the email because for one you don't have to worry about the temp your tempest you're good in for two you can just keep taking damn after a DAB after I mean you see me in these sessions I take tab after dad I don't have to [ __ ] sit there with a torch heat it up and then sit there and go twiddling my thumbs are holding my dick going wait okay it's a minute in 20 seconds now I can take the hit no I just [ __ ] take my piece up and blame hit a [ __ ] dab and put it back down and I don't put it right back down because I have to hit it [ __ ] six times before the dab is done it's a beautiful thing really I mean I love that they came out with emails I mean it's a godsend because you also go through a shitload of butane with this bad boy I mean I love this torch this is a really nice torch if you don't have a blazer go ahead and get it this thing rips or a blazer I would recommend either one this thing rips um these guys make a really nice torch if you look at the holes and just the craftsmanship of it and it's they have a lifetime warranty I think they say they have a freaking lifetime warranty on this thing so that's pretty cool and you know I have the lifetime warranty extends as far as the company's lifetime not not your lifetime so think about a business then you kind of could I have to go get it blazer but it's a good alternative it's like a $20 torch might even be less than that I can't even remember cuz I I got this torch so long ago but it has all the good settings here I'll show you you have the safety on the back safety it's fire ready to go so when you have that safety on black when the black is showing that means you can't click this when you have the red you can click this now you have on the side here your continuous switch so you turn that where the arrow is pointing to go off go right to go on wait is it what you have to turn it on for us let's see and then you go to the left and then the left which way is it supposed to go this way I think this might be broken nope okay to the left I thought it was broke for a second keeps your continuous flame going then you go to the right to turn it off turns it right off on the other side you have a plus in - gage just like your uh yeah no lighters do these bad boys it's got one of those so you take that and you go right to turn up the flame - really really hot see that but as a wild flame right there right I keep it all the way down because why waste fuel when you got a nice flame like that actually I keep it a little bit higher than all the way down like right a little bit less than that I like it sighs why did I mess with it like to be right about there goes through the fuel a little slower when you keep the flame lower goes through the fuel slower when you keep the flame over that run sorry [ __ ] goofy idiot shouldn't talk [ __ ] on myself it's not nice oh my lord it's [ __ ] awesome and it's so clean guys this is [ __ ] flower rosin and it looks like hash rising hardcore this looks like [ __ ] hash rosin guys I'm telling you if you saw this in real life you'd be like what's that - frozen no that's 37 micron flour rising guys and my bangers not even that dirty have already done a couple of dabs usually it'd be [ __ ] dirty [ __ ] Cheers had to get you before the exhale I swear this will be a filthy banger at the end of this session I will get it back to be clear to being clear with only this and q-tips that's all you need start crystal clear some people like using old isopropyl to once their banger cools down they take the email off and they do their DC clear a little bit get it as clean as they can and then you do extra cleaning once it's cooled down a little bit with their uh 91% I saw you can still be a little warm it's not gonna kill you're buying a key you just don't want one that's warm it's not recommended to use it on a hot banger people do it though I used to do it just because I have an email and it's it's like well what am I gonna do with tons of rosin residue because flour Oz and will has fats and lipids that leave a little more of a residue on your banger than ash Rosen well that's actually the main difference between hash rosin and flour rosin is that hash rosin has wax waxes and lipids from the plant more more than plant now you can when you use a really fine micron screen I think you own sort of curb that a little bit and clean it up but you're still going to have that problem whereas with hash rosin you'll have way less than you thought you won't probably won't even have any waxes and lipids if you do it right other than that though I mean the effect is there thank you guys for joining me tonight I'm sorry you didn't get to see the press but I got another eighth of this stuff I think I might press up I don't know cuz I kind of wanna save some flour to smoke this stuff came out so good I think I might just press it though just go plow and [ __ ] press T always cuz I mean this I pressed on after I smoked a butt out of it so it was probably a little over three grams and I got oh no they're probably a little older grant this was probably one of my best deals recent in recent presses I think I got proud I don't have I apologize guys I wish I had a scale to give you exact weights and everything but I'm pretty good eyeball you guys can tell me what you think it it weighed I don't mind if you want to get us I mean but you can't really see the thickness and this is a really thick patty that I pressed down to the bottom it's this is a curve to bottom jar it's a really thick patty and it's it was all the way when I had this on top it went all the way around the top of this jar and I had to push it down in for it to fit it was pretty sweet it just fits so perfectly but uh we're gonna hit the ball cuz we still have some of the flour backed out oh you know what we should do first is we gotta swab the banker and keep it as clean as we can for a time being because we want to have tasty dabs all the time cannot wait to use my heaven sure any glass art collaboration banger but I'm waiting for a female coil to get here 710 life still waiting on you but they said they were gonna send me a gift and I think they just got it got the corner that I sent back that they sent me the wrong size with they got that what like a week ago so they got that last Tuesday so we'll see what happens it doesn't take much longer that's cool we'll see what happens as far as things have gone the previously with 710 life I have nothing but good things to say about them and the way they handled the phone call with me look at all this crap I just got out of there and you let a few dabs build up you're gonna have a really dirty q-tip excuse me yeah the 710 life has good customer service they're not bad people they have to blow their phone up a little bit to get them to answer it because I don't know if he just wasn't was busy doing something filling orders or if they just don't answer the phone unless you repeat call but definitely try them again if they don't pick up the first time if you have problems when you need to talk to them they'll pick up they just want to know that you're not some idiot who's trying to call them and you know who doesn't does it has a done business with them in is gonna be you know or it doesn't intend to do business with them and it's like a robo call or something that's the only thing that I think would stop them from answering the phone I think that's what it was because he picked up the phone and was like eager to talk to me the man that picked the phone I forget his first name but he was the manager and he spoke to me said that he was gonna send me a gift and then he was very sorry that I got the wrong size coil and he explained that um and this is very logical that all they just hired a bunch of people for the holidays and the people are nice familiar with the coil sizes so they probably just thought hey this is probably the right size I'm gonna send him this one just to mix up a big deal as long as they get it back to me in relatively timely fashion I'm happy um and I love my seventh time life you know as the coil that I have on my twenty millimeter finger has lasted forever knock on wood because I don't want it to just [ __ ] the bed now that I said that but uh it's been a few years now that I've had it and it's been running strong oh my she's got a bigger banger so I had to get a new coil for it and I have to get the drop down because the banger is um a male banger and my pieces are female right uh they need female bangers right now but I just had Rick Burberry make me a drop down for my area cross to convert it into a female piece so wait on that to come in as well he should be finished with it though so as soon as that comes in well well not the drop down but the Bing is for Christmas so we'll be using it then it's coming up all right we will swap out the banger let's hit the bong yeah we'll take a good night dab tea for you it's a good night everybody but we gotta take a hit from the ball first see I like I like the low father side right now this stuff is cool I like when it's just kind of abstract you know just chill abstract got a hip hop there's some piano I love piano piano and horns you got me if you got piano horns maybe some acoustic guitar even electric I like electric guitar a lot too depending on how you rip it cheers guys and they call FG flower [Music] Oh out of the seed of life glassworks peace good I extinguish the head like this I just clean the other day so I has a nice clean water I think I cleaned it yesterday pretty clean I've only taken a few rips out of it so there's not much residue in there love it see a plastic job blase perk Sita life shout out to see the life class works and huffy Glass Works and heracross and sugar glass art and a Negro glass for the turtles Yoshi egg status and kind of a glass

to show you how to make moon rocks at home so we've got the what ifs moon rocks moon rocks on and I get some we've usually hand-selected covered in oil and if Keef so here I have a beautiful example of moving off and you'll see those in the pictures as well and I'll show you the inside of it so when we cut into it we could see the inside is our bud covered in a layer of oil and then dusted whisky mmm this smells wonderful this also had some terpenes added to it to make it smell like green apples so you can do that as well to your oil so of course where do we get all the Keef well if you have a large bust edge such as this you could get Keef collected in the bottom of it quite a bit of team that comes off of it as you can see on the tray and this key is the same teeth that you could use to dust you our butts with as well so before we go to the kitchen to show you the process we will show you the hand selection of nuts that we want to eat so guys that our next step is nugget selection so we have different kinds here on our tray some moonbeams some of the rest by Cove some be hazed and some Keats so here you definitely do not want to use anything long like this even though it's a nice snug you know we don't want to use it for our moon rock application what you're looking for is dance heart none something like this would could work if we take out the bottom so if we sniff that piece off this top piece could be a perfect little moon or nothing same with this this is a perfect example of what we want to use again something big like this not recommended unless you're going to take off the bottom and just use the top piece and of course in your bags you're gonna have lots of best stuff and this is perfect to use for your oil and anything you don't want to use if you have if you have no other way of producing our oil you don't have your homegrown your best bet is to research some methods of making oil or find somebody who knows how to do it because not we're not going to come we're not going to recommend you using highly flammable substances to make it concentrates of this woman but if you're if you have oil and you have found your terpenes that you'd like to use the next step is in the kitchen so come on by and see what we got brewing [Music] [Music] [Music] is a double boiler with some oil and our brush that we're gonna use and when they weaken the code these guys with it so these guys are prepared little nuggets that we hand chosen and then we use toothpicks in order to hold them up once once we coated them to keep them dry so let's see how we do that [Music] [Music] so we have tried many different brushes before this one and none of them successfully worked or was really hard to clean so this so far we found to be the perfect brush for doing the job and getting clean afterwards of course you don't want to mix your if you're using different terpene flavors to make them you don't want to mix your brushes because the flavors will get right into your product and will mix and with undesired results so here we have perfectly coated nut ready to be dried and then we're gonna show you the next step [Music] would give my all to get to you if there's a chance what can I that's what can I do you can make it you can make it happen would give my all to get to you if there's a chance [Music] [Music] [Music] would give my all to get to you if there's a chance what can I do you can make it you can make it up would give my all to get to you if there's a chance [Music]", "1MYRxVpMgWA": "all right we're back with another small but really really nice scrape for you guys today we have some white strawberry by one of my favorite growers big Bill's buds I mentioned it before but I guess it's worth mentioning again that he grows and I know all organic method and I'm just kind of kind of like with the work good work of this because I have so much work to do today shopping business because I am bad about that and I just was so busy you know in the past sometimes in the past I would just give people pictures that [ __ ] was easy here have a picture have a poster in the middle that video anyways close up this white strawberry almost my dear like it's been flipping someone my videos upside down lately and then I'll try to put them together I can't figure how to flip the damn video back up right anyways I'll probably hit a picture a video of this towards the end nice little honeycomb patty that will make beautiful deal beautiful color man look at that alright alright there we go about this white strawberry finished up and I'm actually shooting this video late I i I've I've had this this strop white strawberry ran for weeks now and I've been smoking off of it and I just been slacking on on doing the the finished video but this this stuff ended up hurting so so fast it's the been the fastest purse that I've had in in months and I think it's just due to the quality of the trim the freshness of the trim the the the higher quality the the fresher the trim I'm not I don't mean fresh as in wet I mean fresh as in it was it was trimmed it was dried and it was cured properly and and then and then fresh fresh from there and ready to ready to go but the stuff is almost it has a crazy consistency it's the most like it looks like seafoam or like I don't know it's very it's very delicate you can see it kind of it'll break quite easily all these little tunnels pieces but it's a really really beautiful color and inconsistency and it's just it's just a pleasure to smoke it really it's it's [ __ ] awesome it tastes incredible I

all I do is I take a gram at a time or you know two grams whatever take a gram snap it off with your rosin pie oh there look at that baby yeah I love it and put her in with this they say two milliliters per gram which I find it too much so what I usually use is 1 to 1 and if it's too thick I'll add a little bit more after I heat it up you put it a microwave in here and with the lid off for 10 seconds at a time stir it up and then you get it to the consistency you want did anyways that's it guys they got a few flavors this is grape blueberry mango pineapple and regular flavor and

helping to support Rafal studios here's what you'll need to do this you would need a rosin press of course and you'll need some high CBD hemp we'll talk more about that in a second you need some parchment paper a pollen press a cold pack that you'll want to freeze in advance you need a scraper tool we use that to scrape up the oil at the end and also a scale now when it comes to the materials what you want is to probably get hemp the hip is high CBD in this case it is 16.7 6% which is really high in CBD and it has a 0.23% of THC very lows to eat THC so this would be good for our purposes the first step is going to be to preheat the press we're going to use a pretty high temperature of 220 degrees Fahrenheit that's higher than I would normally use for cannabis for this experiment today we're going to be pressing 2 grand pressing and then a 1 gram pressing so first you'll want to weigh out your head and then you will put it into the pollen press and then you add in the weights and then some pollen presses have a little t-bar this is just a simple screw together on both sides but you screw together really tightly as tightly as you can and then when you press it out you have a nice concise puck that'll press a lot more efficiently now you want to take that puck and you want to place it in your parchment paper I would recommend using 2 layers I'm only using one in this demonstration but that's not how I know you need probably to use 2 because it can bleed through because it's a real hot temperature and then once you have your puck centered in the parchment we're going to now place it in the press and you're also going to Center it and depress and now we're going to what I call a pre press and then over the next say 30 to maybe 45 seconds we're going to be slowly lowering the lever adding a little bit more pressure every few seconds and not to a fully press it yet but just this is to allow the heat to distribute through so for about 30 seconds we're going to pre press and let that heat fill all the way through from top to bottom on that after the 30 seconds or 45 seconds you're going to finally close down the lever and give it a full press after about 30 seconds or so of that you'll start to see the hemp oil protruding it from around the edges and it'll bubble and run and you'll want to leave this on full press for one to two minutes because we're using a high temperature you don't want to go too long because you don't want to burn off all your terpenes but it is more tolerant than cannabis is and you can see we got a really good yield there so the next step is the cooling step and normally I would have not opened it up and removed the puck to show the camera like I did a second ago I would have taken it directly from the press and put it right until they folded over a compressed bag like you see there and let it chill for about one minute and what that will do is to slow down the heating process and to preserve our curve beans in our flavor profile the next step is to scrape it off and collect it I find doing that with the compress as a backing to the paper makes it a lot easier to remove the oil and you see I garnered about 11 percent yield on that first pressing with the 2 grams then I pressed a 1 gram pressing of the same hip and I can see now I did I have that less of a yield but with one grandma have a better percentage of a yield and in fact on that one I got just at 17% yield a really great deal so it's really happy with the way that my press did it pressing the CBDs if you'd like to purchase one please

they both say blue dream I see well here we go I don't think this what I'm trying to get what I really got up a hill yeah we got one blue dream okay that's all right and the other is green crunch purple alien dog so the dream sativa won't go with that first thing we'll do is take a look at these there is the truffle fish [Music] most of smaller type buds nice to have that other it is the lemon

"q9oZhsc3gd4": "hey it's found at roughout studios and welcome to part two of our special series of cannabis expert aching dry ice Keefe turning it to rosin and then to e juice in this part 2 we're going to be taking our dry-ice Keef and then we're going to press it into rosin what you're going to need to do that is you're going to need some micron bags we're using 25 micron screen bags those are the ones that came with in my press rosin press we're using the dry ice key from our last video we'll be using some parchment paper and the my press solvent list machine you can pick that up at my rods and press calm and save money with the code roughhouse the first up is going to be to load the micron bags this could be kind of a tedious process and it helps if you freeze your material first so we have frozen that Keef and it makes it a lot more sandy and easy to deal with and less sticky and we're taking about two grams of our Keef and we're going to put it into our 25 micron bag now I got my cameraman to help out a little bit because it was a little bit tedious but it found the easiest way was to kind of spoon it in and then we're going to just kind of tamp it down lightly in the bag to just sort of evenly distribute it we're not like jamming get into or anything like that just sort of kind of make it even across the bag as much as possible okay so now we're going to go ahead and fold and trim and seal it the plates on this machine are square so we're going to try to keep it as sort of a square shape as possible and then I'm taking the back of a grinder and just sort of very gently just pressing it flattening it out just trying to get it to distribute evenly across it and also to sort of discover where seam is going to be and in that case I'm going to go ahead and trim off some of the excess bag so I'll have enough to fold over but I don't really need it to fold over all the way because the bag can trap some of the rosin and then you could also use the machine if you want before it's heated up and I press it down that just kind of sealed a corner of your bag to get a harder seal there don't squeeze the rosin or the kief itself but just the edge and then you can fold it over it's a little easier okay now we're moving on to the next up we're going to actually press the rosin I'm using it inside of a doubled parchment paper just so we don't have any blowouts or anything and then I'm sliding it in right into the center of the press we're we're heating at 180 degrees Fahrenheit that's we're gonna press that and it's all the way up to the hundred eighty degree heat just about there are two degrees away so we're gonna go ahead and start closing that down now instead of just clamping it all the way down originally what we're going to do is for about a minute and a half we're just going to like to let the press barely touch it just to distribute the heat and then after about in a minute and a half or so then we're going to go ahead and close it all the way down for the remaining two to two and a half minutes of the press now we're gonna go end up pressing this for about four minutes at 180 degrees and we're leaving the temperature the same the whole time after about two and a half minutes or so it starts to ooze out and come see after three minutes or so is oozing out the side in the backs and just a few seconds short of four minutes we're gonna go ahead and pull that open you can see they always love these shots here of pulling the paper back and seeing what you have in there and this really nice looking good amount of yield in there and just the smell I know you can't smell it in the video but it just had a really great smell and the consistency is really nice as well sort of tacky and sort of thick all right so it's looking really good and so now we're gonna chill it before we scrape it I've had that for a couple of minutes inside of a little cold pack just sandwiched between the cold pack chilling and you can see the little pieces of it flying off as it has turned into a shatter now really nice consistency here and also a really nice taste really looking forward to the next episode where we're going to take this and turning it into a juice now if you don't have a press I'd like to check out a really good one please check out my rosin press comm they have a really awesome press a great design it's lightweight weighs less than 15 pounds it's very portable and you can get it at a good price at a discount with a code ruffhouse and the checkout so again the thanks to my rosin press comm for setting up and sponsoring this video and I could just gonna take a second here just finish collecting this up it always so much fun I'm collecting up your rosin when you've done it it's kind of a most fun

back got you yeah and now we're doing a quick little video because I get a million questions asked about this subject pretty much every day I get at least 10 to 20 comments or emails asking about this subject and the subject is how to make THCA from shatter or wax or pho all yeah so uh there you have it you got some saucy turkey diamonds the diamonds are around anywhere between 96% eighty to ninety nine point six percent THC a and you can see the nice derpy a little bit of Terp sauce layer in there with the Terp sauce will contain random cannabinoids from CB g CB d CB and stuff like that and then all your Terps whether it be in lemon een pining and the rest of a mercy and all that stuff but um yeah this video is in explaining what diamonds are it's explaining how I make my methods of making THC TAC a or diamonds or sauce turf sauce or turf diamonds or whatever you want to call it you can see that the crystallization is fairly big with the strain and yeah you can see the diamonds themselves are nice and clear and the sauce layer is nice and golden okay so let me break it down alright so first step is you got to make your you got to make a BHO pack the columns pack the tubes wait uh this is exactly how I do it I do fresh plant right off the plant right into the two pound columns on a closed loop fold you axis then I go from best value of x mmm I use only try ice I don't use liquid nitrogen right into that I just packed the column the jacket on the column with dried ice I packed the tubes full with my material which is a fresh off the plant you could do it with dried buds whatever you want but I just the best herb profile will come from live plants or fresh frozen something like that and then I do my run just like anyone else I'll blast through the column and then I'll pull the ball valve and then once I pulled a ball valve I will it'll dumped into the dewaxing chamber and then I'll let that sit for a little while let it be wax I'll pull that ball valve and let that dump into the collection pot I will then heat the collection pop however you heat your collection pot I just use a hot water bath and then while that's heating and evaporating back into the solvent tank getting yourself in potty or BHO I will then look through the sight glass and I'll leave a good amount of butane left in it now that's up to you how much you ran in and all that so I'll make sure it's nice and soupy so I could just dump it right out now when it's nice and soupy I release the pressure and then pop the cap and then dump it into a jar just like the bigger the bigger versions and these balls right here the big quart jars I will then cap the jar I'll put it in a cooler that the cooler Pole has some dry ice in it so it stays nice and cold and then BAM I'll leave that there and I'll pop the jars maybe once or twice a day burping them and after about five days you'll see diamond stone form at which point I will not use dry ice anymore and I'll keep it pretty much every room temperature and then I'll perform a two three four times a day I check them randomly and I'll burp the jars just you probably don't have to do that but I just do it to make sure the pressure isn't building up so much that's going to pop the capsule off or break the jars for anything so I check on them from time to time open them up and check on my own see how they're growing after a week you'll see bigger diamonds after two weeks for the biggest diamonds something similar to this now it is all strain dependent some strains have much bigger Terp Terp layer and then some strains have smaller diamonds more turf some strains have bigger diamonds less Terps yada yada so that's all up to the strains but that's how it's done I don't you know pentane wash the solvent I use for extraction is just n butane from best value back switch is 99.9% pure butane medical grade extraction grade comes in the green tank you can buy all that stuff right up best value packs they got a good prices good material and I never did me wrong but out yeah that's how it's done so uh I know I did a video with the robot voice trying to explain this and I feel that video was uh sufficient and I think it gave all the same thing I just said broke it down much quicker and you didn't have me up in there saying and all this shift so for everybody that just wanted a little revamp of the process that's how it's done that's exactly what I did to make these that's what I do to make all all my Terp sauce or diamonds or whatever you want to call it that's how I make it I hope this helps anybody out and if you liked the video smash the like button subscribe if you haven't already and throw some comments and you could shoot me an email visit the website whatever you want to do and I'll get at

let me show you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay now this is a 37 micron bag 37 screen my car I usually use 160 but since I'm trying to make nice good / rasen I decided to use a smaller micron 37 micron stitched on the inside you can order these off of Amazon all day but the main goal is to show you how to pack it it's called our bottle take style you're taking you bend the corners in your bending the corners just like that see that corner right there see that corner right there just basically been in the corners in like that then you pack your bag fill the bag all the way the whole for friends dad just what the finished bag looked like you weren't DUP you want the edges to be round so you get like a round poke at the end see how I force it all down there like that and then you would just take and cut about a half inch above the Prado so that way you have enough room to tuck and fold see my small fold ready to go we also go in about 190 usually about 210 but today we want almost perfection see how with the bag is according I'm going to sit right there for about 32 seconds then sit by there till she starts to make oil not pore pressure okay now it's time for four pressure see that please don't run down there see the ooze and that's what we like liquid gold imma let it stay a little normally longer but I will show you the final results okay let's open her up see what we got

the taste change through my buddy right here okay let's taste it hope y'all got one too ooh very nice very nice real smooth boy it's pulling in there I can't keep hitting this thing boy by about six seven more hits in their flippers real nice no choke I already know I'm going to oblivion I could just feel it shaking in my knees and many weeds you know there's an listen to the bass line let it rise and then move your waistline no I take back with y'all I'm not ready for that don't let the smooth taste fool you", "Y9-IPXIDwrw": "it's good you to mass fam I'm Cathy this is dad wake up grab your torches torches angular just let's get to it today we got some golden hash honey how's everybody feeling today you ready to get over to Super Bowl right they didn't win but you know I said in my opinion I would have probably gone ahead and said like somebody was asking me I felt about it I probably would have looked at her like you know I'm rooting for the Panthers but like if I was putting money on it I probably put money on the Broncos you know that's just the way golden cash I feel like a lot of times I should probably share with y'all where I get it from but then again it's like there's gonna be so much coming in or out it's like you know you know I don't know yes I feel like if I share the good ones with you then obviously I have to share the the bad ones I can't just like you know like I don't know maybe it's just gonna dedicate to share but I don't know I feel like I'm rather just review the strain instead of so much the place business that could get market you know like you could get good and stuff and I've gotten it from people that you know so so anyway it's almost sweet it's almost sweet if it didn't have so much I'd like an OG bite to it you would probably have a lot more sweetness to it like I think I'm gonna start shortening up these videos in order to you know fit like maybe like five minutes something like that so that way came to America instead of stuff YouTube jams unless you got something better you know you can submit to me you know any stuff that you'd be willing to have me be listed so in the background you know any music player I do

CBD or THC question mark consider these alternatives reason for this video and many others that I'm going to share with you is due to the vaping illness and the associated deaths of this illness as of today as of the recording of this video there are over 1,600 illnesses documented and 34 deaths related to vaping associated pulmonary injury or lung injury whichever you want to call it so if this is something that would be of benefit to you as well as the other videos regarding this topic please subscribe to the channel so I can keep these coming your way keep you educated and keep you up to date on what's going on and obviously give you some advice and some suggestions on how to perhaps avoid being one of the numbers associated with this illness secondarily if this could be a benefit to somebody you love you care about somebody who is vaping somebody who does like to vape please forward this to them so that they will be educated and have some other alternative methods perhaps to utilizing CBD or THC if they have a medical card or if they're a recreational user this this again is going out to anybody and everybody who is currently vaping or considering vaping or maybe has been who has stopped and again if you liked it give me a thumbs up if you don't let me know why so I can do a better job moving forward I'm gonna get on with it I'm gonna take you back in time because before vaping became something that was cool and the thing to do smoking was pretty much the way in which CBD or THC would be utilized if you're going to use it in an edible or use it in oil or whatever other methods that are out there let's go back to the original way of doing this just go back to the 60s okay so it all originates with the flour ok so this is the bud which is now referred to as a flower it doesn't look like a flower to me it looks it still looks like a bud but it's referred to as flower today but this is where it all originates and so we're gonna go back to the simple process of one method is smoking the flower and you can smoke the flower a couple different methods obviously you can roll a joint never really have been very good at that so I'm not going to show you an example of that today but you can certainly use this in a one-hitter or a pipe okay I'm going to show you a one-hitter that is a more discreet means to smoking flower okay so this is a case for the one-hitter and the material would just go inside here okay and then you would essentially pack the material into your one-hitter and then you would smoke it this way looks like a cigarette okay so somewhat discreet obviously it's gonna smell a little bit differently than a cigarette would but it is somewhat discreet now the challenge with a pipe with a joint with a one-hitter a little bit harsh okay you know again it's gonna burn a little bit if you don't mind that fine if you do you have to go to other methods that aren't is discreet such as a a bong so this is a bong tried and true and around a long time this is something that's going to cool the material via the water that's in the bong that's why it's called a water bong okay and this is going to cool down the smoke obviously so it doesn't burn much better as far as that's concerned it's gonna be cleaner but obviously not as discreet can't be carrying this around with you and doing this in public as a general rule okay something to save for home perhaps and those are the really the the methods that I would recommend in terms of utilizing flower or bud okay in terms of inhaling this now let's get on to concentrated forms of flour or bud now concentrated forms are beneficial because there are trichomes or resin glands that exists and it's very difficult to see in this particular case you'd have to get very very close to see those but that's where the majority of the CBD and THC the cannabinoids and the terpenes reside so again if you look at this probably the 80/20 rule right 80% of this is plant matter you know and 20% of it is really the good stuff the cannabinoids and the terpenes where they reside is in these resin glands these trichomes on the flower on the bud so there are ways to ultimately extract these cannabinoids these resins trichomes from the bud and there's a couple different ways to do that now I'm gonna be talking about methods that are not solvent based today I will get into other videos regarding solvent based methods in terms of extraction okay I'm not going to get into that today I'm just gonna talk to you about the non solvent based extraction methods so one is Keith or which is also kind of referred to as hash or hashish been around a long time and this is just an example of that so if you look here this is just kind of like a very I don't know powder okay now it didn't really come in this form came in little blocks and then I just kind of broke it down to this flour so you could kind of see the consistency of it what this is this is Keith it essentially becomes hash Keith is the process of utilizing silk screening or screens of varying densities to essentially shave off the resin trichomes from the flower the bud okay so that's going to give you a more potent highly concentrated form of the same okay so the beautiful thing about this is you don't have smoke near as much and you don't have the plant matter that you're smoking so it does lessen the carcinogens associated with inhaling plant matter okay another thing to to pay attention to very important with regard to the bud the flower the hashish whatever it is you're you're inhaling whatever it is you're smoking I want to make sure you stay away from pesticides mold contaminants things of that nature make sure again that it's a trusted source if it's a source that can be that's been approved via the hemp Authority which again is kind of the hemp industry's FDA in terms of having some testing that has been performed and backed up you know because the whole third-party testing that's all great but at this point time we know that the third-party testing isn't gonna a hundred percent of the time be something you can rely on because somebody some companies claim that they're doing a third-party testing and they're not or maybe they're doing it but they're not showing you the actual results I mean this is stuff that's just out there so my advice to you if it's a company that the hemp Authority has on their list great I think that's the best place to start to just make sure that what you're getting is a product that is not gonna be contaminated not gonna have a pesticide it's not gonna have the mold things of that nature because obviously that's the stuff that you're gonna be inhaling okay so this is one way of getting the the kief or the hashish okay really the difference between Keith and hashish is Keith is essentially then pressurized and heated to make hashish which is in a bowl a ball or a brick in terms of its shape again the material is really the same either way you're really getting the same stuff either way now this can just be smoke by itself I keep mine it's gonna be much more concentrated than a flower or a bud so you have to pay attention that you don't need to use near as much of it and again be very very careful in terms of the quantity start with a small amount go from there figure out what's going to work best again I'll try and add some additional videos to this so you get a better idea in terms of milligrams what you're actually using what you're actually inhaling what you're actually getting so you can make sure that you're getting the correct dosage if this is CBD example with THC that's really just gonna pend on you know what you like and what comfortable what comfort level you have with whatever is that you're smoking at the time based on the percentage of the THC within the concentrate okay so some things to think about there now there is another method of making hashish that is a ice-water method send you a video on that in the link as well as the dry sift method those two methods I'll send you links for both in case that's something you want to learn more about again the ice water methods gonna be something it's gonna be a little bit more concentrated and really used more for dabbing than more first than smoking predominantly so I'll get into that a little bit when I get into the concentrates and the solvent methods related to concentrates to design more for dabbing as opposed to smoking dabbing is a whole nother thing we'll get into that in another video follow-up videos there's going to be other videos coming along now one last thing I'll talk about is what's it called here Oh where's Raza yes so rosin tech is one other way of utilizing the flower or the bud but again this kind of gets into more of a dabbing scenario so we'll get into that later if that's where this is pressed and heated so that the actual resin is taken from the plant and then you can actually collect the resin at that point time and dab smoke the vape that residence so again this is all stuff that a little bit complicated lots more to show you I'm still learning myself a lot of this but as far as actual smoking predominantly it's going to be flower orbit or the kief or perhaps the hashish those would really be the three main things to smoke anything other than thats that's a solvent-based concentrate is going to be designed more for having which was more vaping than smoking okay so just to sum it up in this particular video we're talking about smoking which is inhaling smoke so this is not vaping okay and we get into concentrates that is gonna be vaping but it's gonna be vaping not utilizing a vaporizer now vaporizer can be used but I'm gonna really be focused on methods that don't require that reason being there is also evidence that vaporizers are part of this epidemic and part of this problem it's not just what people are vaping okay and again I'm staying away from anything that's related to oils liquids thickeners you name it I'm not gonna be talking about any of that because that's the stuff that I'm concerned about and you should be concerned about - given what's going on with this epidemic that we have I'm gonna be talking about ways to utilize THC and CBD without the involvement of those other things that are related to using vaporizers eeeek arts illiquid all of that okay so stick around if you want to see more on this subject and you want to learn more about this again please subscribe to my channel so I can share more with you thanks for being here I appreciate it again if this is something you can share with somebody that you love or care about so that they can perhaps look at other let's just say tried-and-true methods of utilizing CBD or THC from an inhalation standpoint please pass along appreciate your thumbs ups and your likes and again if you have a comment to make please feel free questions to ask please do that as well thanks for being here appreciate it for talking you soon bye bye", "059ZsVUl-3A": "hi and welcome to kena basics today we learn how to make rosin lozenges rosin lozenges are cannabis infused honey lemon ginger hard candies or cough drops that can be used for a medicinal or recreational cannabis use they use rose and pressed wax Akif to infuse the cannabis it has only four ingredients it's all natural and healthy so let's get started here's what you need to make rosin lozenges first you need 1/2 a cup of honey you can use raw honey or regular store-bought honey you need 2 tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 teaspoon of freshly grated ginger root and 1 gram of cannabis rosin pressed wax or one to two grams of Keef I do not recommend using eh-oh or butane extracted hash oils for this or any other recipe because making hard candy can be a very time-sensitive endeavor you do need to make sure that you have all your ingredients ready to go so the first thing that we're going to do is go ahead and squeeze out our two tablespoons of fresh lemon juice make sure you strain out all the seeds and pulp and have that ready to go and also you want to go ahead and prepare your ginger again we're using fresh ginger and if you get organic that's even better but you want to go ahead and make sure that you peel off the skin and then use a grater and we're gonna grate finely grate about a teaspoon of the fresh ginger root and then it'll also be very helpful if you go ahead and pre measure out your half a cup of honey again I said you could use raw honey here or you can use just regular store-bought honey such as we're using here but you need a half a cup of honey and you have all your ingredients ready to go before we move on to the next step which is to put a small saucepan over medium-high heat and then we're going to combine in all of the honey as well as the lemon juice and the ginger and we're gonna bring that up over medium to medium-high heat and the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to sort of boil out the water and some of the other impurities and cook down the ginger so after we've combined all of our ingredients in our pan you want to go ahead and give that a little bit of a mix and let them combine together and then as the heat comes up we're also going to make sure that we have our candy thermometer available okay as the heat brings up a little bit you'll the honey will melt and you'll be able to come coorporate those ingredients together make sure that you have your candy thermometer ready and a candy thermometer you need to make sure that it's the kind of thermometer that goes up well over 300 degrees but you're going to want to make sure that you carefully monitor because what's gonna happen is and once you get up to about 212 degrees or boiling for water we're gonna start boiling out the water from the honey and there's also a water and the lemon juice that's going to boil it out and condense down the honey then honey and the lemon flavors both but what's what happens is a lot of foam occurs when this happens you need to be right beside it and make sure that you have a pan that has tall enough sides to accommodate at least triple um the depth and foam and then as the foam gets to the top of your pan you need to pull it off the heat and let the foam subside it just takes a few seconds for the phone to subside and then you can put it back on the heat but like I said just be there with it because this is going to occur several times but over time as the water boils out it's going to foam less and less and then you can bring your heat up to high and go to 295 degrees Fahrenheit and you would be very precise about that temperature leaving a little bit room there if it gets up to 300 degrees you're fine don't go over 300 degrees but 2 and 95 or 300 degrees Fahrenheit should be perfect if you don't have a candy thermometer you can also do this by having a cup of ice water available and take some of the candy when you think it's getting close and drop it in and let it harden and the high water if it hardens into a brittle hard candy then you've reached the right temperature and we're getting real close you can see it's really darkening till you don't want to go so far also that you earn and get a really better flavor so you want to be really careful you monitor your temperature and when it gets to 300 degrees or 295 degrees Fahrenheit pull it off the heat and immediately it's gonna start to cool once it's pulled off the heat so we're going to act fast make sure you still monitor the temperature when it gets to 250 degrees Fahrenheit we're gonna add in our rosin or our Keef what we're doing here is we're we're using that temperature so the one it'll melt into there and be easy to mix but also because we're decarboxylated are still activating the cannabis rosin pressed does use heat and pressure so it may possibly be decarboxylated but what we're using this heat just to make sure that we've activated our cannabis and if you're using Keef then that's gonna be necessary also to activate the cannabis so starting at 250 degrees and then as it cools over the next couple of hours we'll be decarboxylated them remaining cannabis well once you've added in and mixed in your cannabis you're going to now pour your candy into the candy molds the video always slows us down a little bit and so the candy is a little thicker than I would like for it to Bend when it poured in the molds here it would have poured a little more evenly if I had used it a little bit hotter but when I pour it into the molds but that's okay and those little drops that I put on parchment paper would also have kind of out a little bit more circular and nice so just make sure that you move fast enough when you're doing your candies but after about two hours and you don't need to put this in the fridge or anything just let this cool on the counter after about two hours your candy will harden into a hard rigid candy you'll be able to pop those out of the molds with no problem and this candy can be really sticky so you might want to coat it in powdered sugar which will help prevent them from sticking together and whatever storage container you put them in and if you don't have powdered sugar you can also use crystal sugar or you may want to anyway because it gives it a nice kind of a cool looking coating there and also adds some sweetness to the candy which can be a little bit better because of the lemon and the ginger but these are really good and they're the flavor of these is not so much like a sweet candy so much as more as like a lozenge and you get the the lingering numbness from the gingers are really good this episode is brought to you by the Rafah studio smoke

for watching [Music] you [Music]", "TjA1NEGXif0": "hey it's mad at Rafal stereos and welcome to a special three-part episode of canna basics first we're going to make dry ice cave then we're going to press it into rosin and then we want to convert that to e juice this episode is brought to you by dayz screens glass screens quality reusable glass screens and cleaning supplies are available at parley car Matic calm and we'll talk more about them later now in this first episode we're going to be making our own dry ice Keefe and of course we're gonna start with cannabis flowers to do that so the amount that you use is up to you but we're using about 10 grams and if you're using less than an ounce you'll want a one gallon bucket more than an ounce at a time you'll want 5 gallon buckets and then micron screens I'll put links to where you can find these micron screens on Amazon but they're bubble bags bubble hash bags there's what they're generally called and you'll need at least one about 120 or 93 microns around there and then probably a larger one like 220 you'll also want to make sure that you have some good protective gloves for your hands when dealing with frozen co2 because it's very very cold colder than regular ice and also you'll need about 10 pounds or less you usually have to buy it at 10 pounds at a time and that should be enough to do a couple ounces ok the first thing we're going to do is to load our bucket for this demonstration just to make it easy math we're using 10 grams of cannabis flowers we're going to put that directly into the bucket and then on top of that we're going to add our dry ice the dry ice I broke it into little smaller chunks with the hammer a minute ago and I'm using about pound and a half or so with this 10 grams [Music] and once it in there you want to cover it with your bag and for demonstration I'm using this - 20 microns green bag but you'd want to start with your smallest micron screen probably around 93 or I'm using a 120 micron but then once you have it in there you can just toss it around for 30 seconds to a minute just to make sure that everything is nice and cold before you start actually doing the shaking process okay so now we're going to go with our first run and this one I'm using the 120 micron which are smaller screen so once you have everything cold and children ready you're going to turn it upside down so that the cannabis and the dry ice falls on top of the screen and then you start shaking it gently up and down like a pepper shaker and make sure you have a nice clean surface I have a stainless steel table that's very clean but you could also use parchment paper [Music] and then after you've sifted and you start not getting much the sift coming out when you shake the bag it's time to start collecting it you can use a credit card or just a business card or some sort of flat edged material and then just grape it up and then you can put that on a parchment or into a bag or whatever you wanted to use to store it in we weighed this and we had just about a grand about three-quarters of a gram there so now we're going to switch and we're going to do a second run and then just kind of show you a demonstration of what the difference green sizes will do now we've got a two 20 micron which is almost double not quite double the size holes and you're gonna see now when we're starting the same plant material that we use before we're gonna get a lot more through of course we're getting through a lot now of plant material but this is a good way to make sure you're getting all of it out of your out of your cannabis all your THC [Music] and you'll see on the second run we've got a lot more than we did the first time like about five times more yield but the potency of this is going to be a lot less because you're getting a lot more plant material so for our purposes moving forward we're going to use this for cooking and different things like that and then the first batch that we use before is what we'll be using to press for our EGS in the end we're just showing you what we were able to achieve there we had 3.2 grams there just over three-quarters of a grand there so we had just over four grams of Keef in general which was about a 40% yield [Music] before we move on I would like to talk a little bit more about Daisy screens and thank them for sponsoring this video but Daisy screens are like your classic glass screens I remember these from back in the day and the 90s we used to use these kind of glass screens quite a bit but one thing that's really cool about them is other than they keep your bong a lot cleaner and you know a better way to smoke by using a screen is that they're reusable unlike the mesh screens that just burn through and wear out over time these glass screens as long as you keep up with them you can always bring them back to new put them back into your poll and so you're good so one pack of these our last year a lifetime so again visit polychromatic comm to learn more about their products and cleaning supplies make sure you stay tuned to roughhouse studios because our next video or our next canopy 6 video is going to be pressing this into rosin and then we're going to convert that into EGS so be sure to visit ruffhouse studios.com for hundreds of cannabis culture videos made just for you this is matt from FL studios thank you for watching [Music] you", "nUEVpOUqRmA": "thank you for that report Derek well getting the biggest bang for their buck is putting some marijuana users at risk the trend of making butane honey oil is growing across the north state as are the fires and severe burns that often come along with that process I should use reporter bit Carlson got an inside look at these drug labs and has more on law enforcement officials concerns in a special report Bret yeah Alan and Kyra this butane honey oil or some call it hash oil combines the leftover remnants of the marijuana leaf and the highly flammable gas butane these labs are popping up more frequently across the north state and with the high rate of accidents associated with the process officials are working to nip this trend in the bud and if you combine this with smoking marijuana at the same time it's almost like lighting a stick of dynamite an internet sensation and now a marijuana trend in the North State manufacturing the plant form of the drug into a sticky oil similar to honey we're actually seeing more butane honey oil labs only are not stopped from Paradise to Bangor the Butte interagency Narcotics Task Force has broken up several butane honey oil labs in the past few months alone it's a way to knock off the microscopic trichomes with a few simple products a Schedule one drug becomes a firefighters nightmare butane is heavier than air so it'll go to the floor it'll leach its way out until it finds an ignition source and once it finds the ignition source it'll violently explode very hot very fast that's how they're often discovered too after the lab explodes or starts a fire the unsafe practice has taken its toll on experimenters and surprisingly many are very willing to share their dangerous experiences online the moral of the story is butane is flammable and will think twice before your actions I am an idiot now the Internet is littered with information on butane honey oil even video clips including how-to steps so it begs the question why on earth would people put themselves and their homes at danger for just a small vial of THC according to most of the pages we found online it's a way to use the entire plant and provides a different type of high but the way law enforcement sees it no high is worth an explosion or several years in jail it's the same punishment if you were making methamphetamine there's no exception for making hashish with butane you can possess it with your medicinal marijuana recommendation that you can't make it what the lab has gone bad marijuana users have the scars to prove it and usually the people that stop using it are the ones that suffered some kind of injury scary stuff well officials hope education will prevent people from even trying this at home because this is a lesson most people don't want to learn firsthand for Action News I'm Britt Carlson", "0UKGMh-vT8Q": "[Music] hi it's mater Rafal studios and welcome to cat Abay six today we're gonna learn how to make cannabis infused dried fruit using fresh pressed [Music] allowed to thank the guys in my rosin press comm who sent them my press rosin press that we're using today in this video you can save money on to my press with a code roughhouse if you want to pick one of these up you can check that out at my rosin press calm now here's what's gonna need to make cannabis infused dried fruit you're gonna need your fruit and use fresh fruit and you can use any kind of fruit pretty much that you want you can use pineapple banana apples pears or common things to use you could also you're gonna need cannabis gonna need about one gram per fruit serving you also gonna need coconut oil you can use refined if you want less of a smell or flavor in your oil and then more unrefined if you want more the coconut flavor and use organic if possible and the tools that you need you gonna need our rosin press some wax paper and a pollen press now the first step is gonna be to prepare your fruit and start it to go ahead and begin dehydrated because dehydrated fruit can take for a few hours up to almost a day or two so I'm using some pineapple for one portion and if when it comes to dry fruit it's gonna shrink a lot so you're gonna cut a lot more than you think you're gonna need but this is gonna be one serving here of these four pineapple rings here and so I'm cutting them about it's a little over a half inch there I'd say it's about two thirds of an inch thick and you can adjust the thickness of that but pineapple shrinks down a lot when it dehydrates so these are gonna be very thin rings even at that thickness now if you're using a banana bananas don't shrink down as much as the pineapple does so you cut those at about a quarter inch thickness and for the most even chips you can cut them right directly across but if you want kind of large ones if you have an oven or if you're using a dryer that rack that doesn't have big spaces in it you can cut them sort of julienne style and make them a little bit wider although those those edges that are a little bit tapered there might dry out okay once you have your fruit prepared though you're gonna go ahead and set up whatever kind of dragging mechanism you have I don't have an actual dehydrator but I'm using an oven that goes down to 150 degrees and I saw has a convection fan in it it actually turns into a pretty nice little dehydrator itself it's a small oven also and so I'm using the rack that is provided inside the oven to place my items on it and you want to leave space between them if possible and you can see I'm putting the pineapple on on the outside and I'm also loading in the bananas but I already know in advance that my bananas are gonna go a lot faster than the pineapples so I'm gonna be prepared to take those out and I'm putting that in that oven at 150 degrees Fahrenheit and mine goes at two hours at a time and it took several times to do it to get even the bananas ready it took a little over four hours and in the meantime then so now I'm going to go ahead and start preparing my rosin and to prepare my rosin I'm first making these little pouches and we're gonna be reviewing this my press rosin press very soon and when we review that I'll show you a lot more detail how to use this according to the manufacturer's instructions but what we're doing now is we're also after we prepared our pouches that we're going to use for the press we're also using a pollen press these are the items that you can find on Amazon I'll put links in the description for where you can find the pollen presses on Amazon or you can use something similar like that but we're making a puck that's almost a gram of cannabis with something compress down into that tiny little puck and then we're putting that puck inside of the pouch that we made and again in the next week or so we're going to be putting out a video with a lot more detail about how to use this rosin press machine in particular but however you're using your rosin press the reason we're using rosin is because we want to concentrate a form of cannabis but personally I don't feel safe using any sort of concentrates that's made with any sort of solvent and this is a way that you can make solvent free cannabis extracts at home and be safe to use them especially if you know that the cannabis is safe already so if you have cannabis that's already been tested then you'll be able to safely use the rosin and I have to worry about pesticides or residuals of solvents and you can see there I have the press going down there presses about a minute and this one at about 220 degrees Fahrenheit and you can see it's pumping out it's almost like it has a pulse inside of it it just keeps pulsing out these little globs of wax and you'll see once this press has done that it's a really beautiful amber color as well I'm pressing a an OG strain of an heavy indica I obtained that at Club 52:52 in East LA shout out to those guys and there you can see that the rosin that comes out is it's just so beautiful it's it's even in glob that for him like that it's still a very almost opaque amber color and it's got little tiny little pieces of plant material in there but that's nothing compared to making a an extraction with butter or oils using the whole plant ground up into it and so you can also get those out later so I'm gonna press about two grams because I have two different servings and I'm making hair so form one for my banana and one for my pineapple although I already know in advance that the pineapple is gonna get a lot more of the oil than the banana so it's gonna be about two thirds for thee or actually about three quarters of it for the pineapple and about one quarter of it for that small amount of banana and there he goes the second pressing pretty good yields on that and those pups can be repressed again and obviously you can use those pucks to make butter oils as well so we'll go over a lot more detail about how to use the press to efficiently and future videos but for this video we're we're sticking to the to the task at hand of infusing some dried fruit so I've taken ten milliliters of the coconut oil I've have some organic and I'm using unrefined coconut oil because I don't mind the flavor of the coconut I actually think especially with the pineapple and even with the bananas that it gives it a nice little kind of tropical flavor and it really is nice though I like that and another tip - you can also soak your fruit with a little bit of lime juice or lemon juice in advance if you don't want it to tarnish yellow and that can help too if you if the yellowing bothers you start digress on that back to the rosin though you can see I've taken all the rosin that I pressed and I've dropped it into my coconut oil and now I put it in the oven for about 35 to 45 minutes at 250 degrees I did that for two reasons one to dissolve the oil the solvent the oil and the rosin together and one also to finish decarboxylated because that that press D carved that cannabis some but I also want to make sure it was fully activated so that oven for 250 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes we'll achieve that and I'm also just out of curiosity I want to test the potency of it and you see the tiny amount of wax that I put over the rosin that I put in there and it made an oil that was 141 milligrams per tablespoon or 9.6 milligrams per milliliter which is the ratio that I'm going to with here which is almost perfect it's it's nearly 10 milligrams per milliliter and I have a syringe that's 10 milliliters but it actually filled up with about 11 or 12 milliliters there so what I have is just about a hundred twenty milligrams of THC and you could see that the oil there was very light-colored and if I had made a can of butter with that potency it would have been a very dark green cannabutter so you can see that the flavor is gonna be brighter and it's gonna be a lot more say palatable you hardly even notice the flavor of the cannabis at all actually it's a very lemony high lama named flavor to the cannabis anyway the terpene is strong with limonene and so when it's reduced down like that it just kind of almost just adds a tartness you don't really notice the candles okay so very efficient a very effective way and you could have pressed it one or two more times and put that wax in there and you would have really really strong you would have like 250 milligrams and this just little sauce serving of fruit here and you can see my fruit is not finished yet the the pineapple still has a lot of moisture at that point and so what I did there you could see me when to syringe while I was talking I was using the syringe to evenly spread that cannabis out and then brush it into both sides of the fruit before I finished drying it so about halfway through the drying is when you add the coil to it and then over the last couple of hours of drying it'll absorb into the fruit but you see the bananas actually came out a few hours before the pineapple that pineapple took a good maybe 10 12 hours to actually get dried in that oven and then I actually trimmed the pineapple down into little pieces like that it looks a lot more servable if you just trim off the little kind of rough edges again I like to thank the guys that my rosin press calm they sent out to my press rosin press that we use in this video it worked great and like I said we're going to be reviewing that product but if you'd like to check it out in advance you can save money on it with a code ruffhouse at my rosin press calm and stay tuned for more about that again also I hope you enjoyed this video on how to make confused fruit if you did please hit the like button and subscribe to ruffle studios for

cannabis infused coconut oil so first off let me cover the items that you will need you will need a pot metal spoon coconut will bubble bag or cheesecloth metal tray glass bowl and a cannabis product optionally you can have a candy thermometer as well I am going to be using refined coconut oil and this is 14 fluid ounces which is just under 2 cups refined coconut oil has less of a coconut taste than unrefined coconut oil coconut oil is a healthier alternative than butter for cannabis occasions and this is easy to infuse as well I'm going to be infusing hash into my coconut oil and I am aiming for 6,000 milligrams per 14 ounces or about 2 cups to calculate at 6,000 milligrams I'm going to approximate massages 30 percent THC or 300 milligrams per gram that means to reach 6,000 milligrams I will need to weigh out 20 grams of hash for this infusion [Music] once you have calculated your dosage and weed out the product spread out on a metal tray and put it into the oven at 210 degrees Fahrenheit for 45 minutes to D carve the cannabis you after 45 minutes removed or decarboxylated cannabis product and you are ready to begin your infusion the first thing you'll need to do is scoop the coconut oil out of the jar and into the pot you will need to keep the heat on low while the coconut oil melts down and throughout the infusion you can also stick the coconut oil in a microwave for two minutes and pour the coconut oil out if you are using a candy thermometer aim for 160 degrees Fahrenheit give or take 20 degrees once the coconut oil has melted go ahead and add your decarboxylated cannabis product and stir it in [Music] [Music] [Music] every 10 or 15 minutes for the next two hours you should stir the cannabis coconut oil to complete the infusion having the cannabis product directly in your coconut oil allows for more even extraction from the product than if it was wrapped in cheesecloth or similar product after two hours relief or coconut oil from the stove and pour it through a cheesecloth or bubble bag this will separate the cannabis product from your coconut oil that's all there is to do to infuse your coconut oil of cannabis if you want to solidify the coconut oil simply stick it into the fridge and it will begin to harden coconut oil can be used in a ton of recipes and can also be used to cover popcorn or even spread on toast I hope everyone enjoyed this video and learned something new and I will see you all next time [Music] [Music]", "wVCw8W-Ao6s": "oh love was young [ __ ] moving at Joe never got used to be a pro keep smoking

gonna be November when I post this but anyway got a rep all the the pink called the breast cancer my mom had breast cancer so it's nice to it's nice that they represent breast cancer with all their pink stuff on that's relieved so today I'm doing a review of what's it called northern hash plant it's a pre-roll I never really liked the pre-rolls cuz they grind it up too much names hurt the trichomes but no it is what it is pre-roll northern hash plant I'll tell you how I feel about it this smells nicer hmm like berries almost all right so I've said it before I'll say it again why I'm doing this as they pack it too tightly in these pre-rolled joints and it's just unbearable to smoke so this is the way I smoked all my pre-roll so far from truly I don't have a problem with that all right here we go tell you my review on this that one tasted really nice upon inhaling it's one of those really likes you can you can almost tell that it's gonna be good as your inhale so as I was going to my lungs around here or I'd realize that it was gonna be good then my lungs that build up did bother my wonder - and then I started coughing and I kind of sting a little bit a euphoric sensation right I went up from here up to my head and went on further to my hands solid euphoric feeling I wouldn't say it's the dating I wouldn't say too much about it other than its euphoric let's see what's supposed to be it doesn't say on here oh it's an indica hmm in the current euphoric well just goes to show that none of the none of the descriptions for any of the weeds are truly indica sativa it doesn't really matter if you're gonna read if you're gonna get a strain read the description because didn't because see what really doesn't even mean anything anymore honestly like it's supposed to mean something but when you go to truly when you read the descriptions you'll get yourself a sativa that works like an indica and an indica that works a good sativa and like I said okay what is anything anymore really right so I'm gonna try one more boy I really liked it one more one ball kind of made me feel made me feel good I feel like there's somebody just handed me a bowl of this stuff I'd been like but since I got more I might as well go for the second one and up the feeling I've got right now I feel like this if I were to just like choose to smoke to relax I don't think this would be it honestly I feel more alert but calm now if you look like a do stuff and still be calm with one fat hit of that so let's do it another hit let's see if I can like be coherent still in a social environment no I'm not social right now it's just me obviously on screen but the thing is you're listening to me and I'm kind of being social even though it's not in real time I'm socializing with you I mean you could write a comment down there and I'd probably respond um if it's something like worth responding to something they're just like oh great if you say something I'll generally not let's talk let's start a community let's network this one's for you I hope you have something in your hands so it could smoke together stolid strain not to relax them even feels nice to cop you've been a nice coughing feeling the first one hurry the second one I'm enjoying this cough there's even like a subtle taste and on the exhale my car even when there was no smoke I liked it well that's my

you have one gram of pho it's that 50 percent THC the other 20 percent is probably fats waxes lipids it's then that seventy percent total and you have 30 percent of the solvents terpenes everything else the yeah winterization is removing your fats your waxes in your lipids so it's no longer present and then your oil and therefore you have 70 percent THC and the only remaining elements or your solvents in your terpenes everything so the idea of winterization would be to take your crude oil soak it in ethanol you want to use you want to use a hundred proof ethanol just kids or dissolve everything better except in a particle but once it's fully dissolved you want to breathe sub-zero just saw your fax that your wax and will coagulate together therefore you can then filter them out through a filter and then reduced it and retrieve your ethanol and then that encouraging everywhere as well yet to recommend so this would be like a crude oil with just you know BHO down to the last of it and it's full the colorful and full of fats and waxes and this would be after it winterized and then we distill down Wow so this is starting product and there's not a finish this beautiful here
