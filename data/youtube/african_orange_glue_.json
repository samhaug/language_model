Moroccan Kunduz farm in gaki location male central and you will be met with a rolling plantation of orange trees covering 100 acres maroc is passion for orange farming was nurtured during his days as a university student from the eyes do I went to the airport or de cachi export inspection unit some from there I developed a lot of interest in farming because we won during most export of agricultural crops after retiring in 1988 Meraki seriously embarked on orange farming starting with about 500 orange trees went to plant origins because I knew the aspen tree and the care that should be taken my plantation has been Emir multiplying was current 11 with they have about 10,000 trees orange trees grown from seed take three to five years to begin producing fruit and they can continue producing fruit for up to 15 years with pruning and lots of care for Indies are ready for harvest within 3 months which means one can harvest the fruit four times a year and in muraki's admission orange farming requires a great deal of attention oranges are a good source of vitamins A B and C and also minerals such as calcium and potassium but for Meraki these fruits are a source of livelihood bearing in mind that he is one of the few farmers in Murray County cultivating oranges commercially although moeraki is shy to disclose to us how much he earns Meraki says one orange tree gives him fruits worth at least six thousand shillings it is about an average of two hundred kilos per tree whether the season is good you can serve your fruits at that a shillings a kilo I am reasonably rewarded for that some when the market is good as it is right now I'm getting off web - Ling's a kilo most of his clients hail from Meru and the surrounding counties of turrican ET Neary & ambu although he tried his hand on the export market Meraki says he was frustrated by what he termed as cumbersome procedures and conditions he needed to meet to export the fruit all in all he is satisfied with the local market for now it has Oliver not been an easy journey for the 60 year old farmer our cost of production is quite high I shouldn't say that take care of the fruit to have you to give you good color to give you the good taste you have the fertilizers to be done I've been using this row for irrigation for 60 liters in an day off of diesel so you can imagine when this route the price goes I and his advice to potential orange farmers out there is look whatever specialty variety check your climatic area you are pleased so that you don't plant varieties that will disappoint you

little bunch there and we just asked a guy who was just walking by if it's edible and he said yes it's edible and what do you say the name was there Lana karana me some Indian tree yes he says it's sweet and you can eat it but we're a little hesitant so we're gonna actually like do a little research first yeah before we eat it let's take some we're gonna we're gonna see if we can ID this a little bit better just to make sure Miller yeah just like bright orange like that I don't know a little concerning but let's figure it out hello we have cordilla sentences yes cordial sentences this one we weren't sure that was edible everyone's like oh it's a goji berry it's not a goji break grows on a tree looks like a goji berry but it's absolutely not a goji berry this is related to Glu berries yeah is kind of amazing there's blueberries everywhere and there's also this one so it kind of makes sense that these are a growing around here mm-hm and this one is endemic it is endemic actually this is a native it's only from here and the people here think it's from India they call Indian tree that's kind of interesting right yeah so probably not going to taste very good probably gonna be like super slimy and gross but who knows maybe we'll be delicious and slimy and gross I want to get first a slime assessment before I eat this yep that slimy doesn't seem quite as slimy as blueberry but that's pretty slimy tastes like mango salsa you know it tastes really really sweet and has this pout bitter aftertaste but it's really sweet I like I like the first 70% of that it's like super sweet mm-hmm really really sweet maybe like an 8 out of 10 mm-hmm super slimy as you would imagine because it's related to glue berry but the flavor has an oniony taste to it are you getting that that onion taste yeah it smells making my mouth kind of stick together and it's also a stringent it hasn't stuck to my thing has a very strange odor it smells like pumpkin like raw pumpkin mmm like when you when you carve a pumpkin for Halloween it's got that kind of an odor the slime enos is like intense and it's not slimy like oh just like slimy it slimy like glue like I feel like I just put some superglue in my mouth I think of my tongue dry out yeah from the beginning part tastes really good but like a chia persimmon it's like oh yeah that she it wasn't quite right yep like a little bit of like an unripe persimmon taste mm-hmm but I'm getting onions onions I'm getting onion taste it's got a funky smell like onions or garlic garlic fruit stuff that has that kind of flavor it's difficult one there's a bit of usual look around the seed yeah no kidding it's like stuck to my fingers like stupid seed yeah you know what that actually has a surprisingly interesting taste and not entirely bad it's far tastier than the glue bear oh yeah it tastes way better glue Bradley this the glue bear all day blueberry tastes a little bit like melon look bad this one tastes like to me mango salsa a little bit like persimmons yeah you're not sold on that but weird fruit explore here okay I don't the mango part okay I gotta eat more of it more maybe not mango but it's got like a sweet fruit taste and oniony taste to me okay I'm getting like a set like a sweet salsa and not left like tomatoes at all now tomato salsa but that oniony tastes with the sweetness makes me think mango mango salsa maybe persimmon salsa would be a better way to put it but that's not super relatable to people the skins are a little bit bitter I need the skin yeah probably should go chances to eat this has more of the weird aftertaste yeah the skin tastes about the same but actually kind of stronger my battery is dying cards fold time to go guys I hope you enjoyed that and we'll see you fruit

story it was hugh jackman's first acting gig and he played his future wife's love interest whenever they're seen in public especially at the beach comments about furnace are brutal fans criticize both her flabby body horrific sun-aged body and joke about how horrible it would be to sleep with her it's come to the point that some fans believe jackman has to be either gay or bi to endure his marriage number 8 jesse williams and aaron drake lee recognize this heartthrob from the hit and heartbreaking tv drama series grey's anatomy jesse williams is famous for playing the role of the ruggedly attractive dr jackson avery before that he was just an average teacher in new york imagine all the eye candy that was laid out on his road to fame but the one woman who locked him down had known him from a young age real estate agent erin drake lee before anyone asks aaron how she managed to capture those mesmerizing electric blue eyes know that the couple are divorced because williams wanted to become the hot single guy in hollywood over time their relationship had become strained because people kept wondering why he wasn't with a hotter woman or a beautiful actress number seven clive owen and sarah jane fenton a real life romeo and juliet maybe not is it just us or is clive owen getting better looking with age his enthusiastic fans seem to think so as well but for as much attention he's getting for being attractive his wife is getting the opposite to counter all owen's best works which include roles in sin city king arthur closer and derail sarah jane fenton is also an actress the two met when they co-starred as romeo and juliet in a traveling production of the tragic tale they tied the knot later and now have two beautiful daughters hannah and eva the hate directed towards sarah jane seems to be more focused on her quote unquote dour face but if you come at his wife owen snaps back when he describes his wife he calls sarah jane an absolute diamond and says their relationship is everything to him number six aaron johnson and sam taylor johnson one of gq's 50 best-dressed british men has a thing for the older ladies we wouldn't go so far as calling him a cougar hunter but no one can deny the glaring age difference between the kick-ass and quick silver star and his wife sam taylor johnson who's 23 years his senior this is where the ugly part comes in she's been called a sick old hag and predatory by fans who wish she could croak away when seen in public and on the red carpet the couple is often mistaken for a mother and son when they met sam taylor johnson already had older children from a previous marriage now after tying the knot in 2012 the two share two children together number five paul rudd and julie yeager the secret to paul rudd's immortal good looks is that he doesn't care about his good looks fans see that clearly now with his wife so whether you loved seeing paul rudd in his breakout role in clueless or from his iconic role in ant-man and the marvel universe you have to admit paul rudd looks like he's barely aged a large part of that is because of the lifestyle he indulges in including one that's completely off hollywood he's notoriously private when it comes to his plain jane publicist wife their privacy have protected them from the worst of the hate but unattractive and ugly comments still roll their way number 4 john legend and chrissy teigen next up we have john legend and chrissy teigen fans may have loved the singer and his wife in the all of me video but that's where the compliments stop all tegan needs to do is post a video in a bodysuit or swimsuit for both men and women to jump on the ugly wagon making fun of her curves and well everything there's one iconic photo of chrissy holding up their son miles and john looking down very disappointedly at her body and how could we not mention her in famous ugly crying face when john was winning an award fans think chrissy is an attention seeker and she destroyed herself with plastic surgery number three tony goldwyn and michelle muskie is this why he always takes his daughters to events having kerry washington on your arm may have set the bar too high for scandal's fictional u.s president fitzgerald grant iii in real life he's married to production designer jane michelle muskie and has two daughters with her when out in public you probably won't recognize goldwyn and musky as a couple scandal fans who dig up tony goldwyn's personal life couldn't believe what they were seeing one tweeted google's tony goldwyn's wife two expectations versus one reality another fan commented on a forum i know his wife is six years older than him but she looks like his mother looks like she borrowed her shirt from monique's militia wardrobe number two omari hardwick and jennifer fouch coming in at number two is omari hardwick's wife jennifer fouch maybe people are too used to seeing omaree's romantic on-screen endeavors as ghost with angela and tasha so they're shocked when they see his real-life wife jennifer fausch they're so shocked that they believe she's transgender and resembles steve nash they've also mocked her for looking like gary oldman from the fifth element unfortunately when you get married to a hollywood star in a show that attracts an extremely dedicated fan base you're vulnerable to getting hate and faush has faced tons fans often take to discrediting omaree's wife and marriage on social media flooding even the heartfelt posts with racist remarks but guess what omar hardwick is nearly as intimidating as this character he quickly comes to the defense of the love of his life next time someone tries to hate on jennifer fausch either for her unconventional looks or whatever excuse they can find just remember that she's the one to push amari into taking the lead role in power number one david beckham and victoria beckham we've saved our most controversial couple for last and number one is the thick and thin couple david and victoria beckham are they still together for love or for their brand we'll find out long before victoria married football star david beckham she was a world famous pop starlet as posh spice from the pop group spice girls you can guess why victoria is notoriously unsmiling whenever she's photographed but that's not the only reason why she gets a lot of hate and why some people go as far as calling her ugly it's because of her weight no matter what she does victoria beckham has always had people comment on her weight when she was young she was once called a fat puppy by her mother maybe that's what made her lose so much weight later on and why she suffered from low self-esteem issues suffering from severe acne for the majority of her life didn't help either now most and nearly all the hate she gets can be attributed to her too thin physique she's been described as anorexic bulimic a stick figure and everything under the sun one person even creatively said it must hurt to sleep with her due to how thin she is other people also mentioned that david beckham is only with her to keep their business empire successful despite having four children with her and being married for 20 plus years it must be tough to be in her shoes and that's a wrap for today's video do you really agree with why people hate these celebrities wives let us know your thoughts in the

ago and has over two million views titled homemade mousetrap bull avoid people want to know if this works in the video description they tell a story where they had some extra cooking oil they left it in a bowl on the counter overnight and when they came back in the morning there was three mice trapped in it the walls were too slippery and they couldn't jump out now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna set up a bowl here I have some peanut oil we're gonna pour just enough in there that they'll be slippery but they can't get out then we'll set up the motion cameras and see what happens now I'm assuming the mice will come be curious jump down in the little bowl be caught in the oil they'll get all slippery they'll try to get out try to jump they can't then in the morning we can see what we have so let's go test this out I have a barn with a lot of mice let's see if they like peanut oil when I first saw the video for the bowl of oil mousetrap I thought it might be a hoax it didn't seem like it worked that well but after testing it out this thing is the real deal it's so simple all you need is a shallow bowl a little bit of cooking oil and then one night I was able to get seven mice that's incredible usually my videos I'm catching wild deer mice but the barn has recently been infested with house mice these are a non-native species but because this is a live animal trap I'm not gonna let him go I'm gonna clean them up and keep them as pets and use them for future mousetrap Monday videos where we test out live animal traps so let's go clean these guys up and put them in their new home we're now ready to clean up our mice that are covered in oil I have a shallow tote here with a little bit of water in there into the water I'm going to add a little dish soap that should wash off the oil this brand even says it helps save wildlife so I'll give it a squirt mix that up a little bit and then add our mice it's shallow enough they don't have to swim and as they move around that soap should wash off the oil these mice are really exhausted from being in the oil all night I built them a little nest so they can rest recover and dry out I'll give them some food and water and you'll see them in future videos helping us test out live catch mouse traps for mousetrap Monday I never thought a bowl with a little bit of cooking oil in it would work so well for a mousetrap but it does I'm posting between four and five videos a week testing out rodent traps so if you want to see how to catch mice rats squirrels chipmunks moles voles and Gophers stay tuned you", "gtuBpWjwLW4":

I said no so the moment I become thing I give you my word I am going to build a fits in hospital the biggest we have in this country I will build it in this village to prove to you all that it's not just word of mouth and no action I've written a letter to the Ministry of Health informing them of what I want to do and I have their support so we are going to have a brief written hospital in this village and this is just the tip of the iceberg what you see all these things will only be possible if you choose and support a young energetic vibrant rich well-connected well expose young man like

some mail coming from floor others gonna be some mail dropping down in from Maine yeah maybe we get some Amazon mail maybe occasionally a greasy lunch bag [Music]", "bE3cn6R9khs": "today I'm going to show you how to make a candle that actually smells good you're gonna need a bunch of things you're gonna need some soy wax I prefer soy wax the paraffin wax but if that's what you have we use that as well you need some measuring spoons and cups you need a container you can repurpose old containers old mugs use whatever you have on hand I'm using this glass you also need some flavor oils I pass them you like essential oils so here I'm using lemongrass essential oil you also need a glue gun or glue dots which is my personal preference you also need your pair of scissors to cut the wick and then this is so important you need a thermometer thermometer is like super important for this recipes so important don't miss don't skip it you also need your wicks but you need the right size of wigs and then you need some skewers I use skewers where you can use whatever you have on hand here's a spoon dice dedicated to making candles and then you need a double boiler like this first you need to put some water in the pot and this is just so that you have a double boiler system just so that the wax doesn't explode is so important now put 4 cups of your wax in your container and while you're waiting for that to melt you want to put your glue on the wake you want to glue the wick to the container here I'm just using some glue dots but you can use whatever type of glue you have but make sure that it's a pretty strong glue because you don't want the wax to melt while you're pouring it into the jar press the wick down make sure that it's firm press it really firmly down you don't want it to come off during the time when you're pouring though though I'm wax and then use your skewer to Center the wick this is so important just so that if your candle doesn't look amateur a wait for your wax to melt this usually takes about five minutes [Music] once it melts you want to measure the temperature while it on the stove or burner whatever you have here I'm making sure that the temperature is about 85 degrees Celsius this is the perfect temperature to put essential oil or your flavor oil and why because you want to have a good scent through now make sure that the temperature was slightly over 85 just so that when I take it off it will climb back up to 85 do you understand but make sure that even if it's not up to 85 put it back on the burner till it gets there 85 and then you can add your flavor oils or your essential oils here I'm using lemongrass flavored essential oils and you need two tablespoons mix that thoroughly in the bowl make sure that it mixes really well you want to mix it really thoroughly at this point my whole flat was smelling like lemongrass it was absolutely beautiful but that temperature is so important because you want to have a decent Center you know what do you make DIY candles and they don't smell well sometimes it's the temperature that you put the essential oil in there's a science to this thing so check the temperature again now it's time to pour but you want to make sure that the pouring temperature is around 51 to 50 54 to 51 degrees that's the exact temperature that's perfect for pouring and you won't have any clumps or lumps at the top of your candle now don't make the same mistake I made the same place that your pour in your candle is where you want to leave it to sit and Harden I moved my candle around a lot and that caused a bit of you know some textural issues but just make sure that it's the same surface where you're going to leave it too hard and undisturbed is where you're gonna pour your wax into your candle trust me guys is the easiest best recipe try it and let me know what you think let me know if the scent flow is actually as decent as I promised and I will see you in my next video don't forget to subscribe I really hope you enjoyed it leave me a comment below if you did love you guys bye", "QaIg8t46ZP8": "hey guys thanks for joining me again today I'm gonna be showing you a really fun and easy to do air drying clay project using the Daz brand so I've got canvas here and I've just slightly sketched a woman African woman with a pot on a head and I'm gonna be adding some background with float roll and float all have got this new packaging and it's really easy to use it's a 500 milliliter bottle and I will add where you can buy this I would so do check out my description box for further details I'm covering the image with there some masking tape just because I didn't want the paint to go all over the image that I was going to work on with clay and here is the mixture that I've already pre-mixed and I'm going to go straight onto the canvas with a swipe so I didn't add any silicone or DeMatha cone in my mixture because I wanted the background to be quite subtle as the foreground is going to be popping with the clay and I wanted that to stand out a bit more than the background so the background literally has just floral and the golden fluid acrylics and no other ingredients to get any cells but um if you notice when this painting is is drying you will see some kind of cell action going on even though I haven't added anything in there and I guess that's the float role because that's what float role does so I I kind of like this lacy effect that I've got even though this and there's no silicone in there now that their backgrounds dried I'm gonna peel off the masking tape and reveal the image it's still there yeah I mean I didn't really need to add the details on an onion pencil because I was gonna cover it in clay but you know that was just for my guideline I'm using does a air-drying clay for this project and this is in white and it dries pretty much gray grayish white so I'm all you have to do is really just work straight from the packet because there's no mixture there's nothing that you need to add to it and just soften it with your hands and just go with the shapes I'm using a very strong glue I'll link that in my description box as well so you can check it out and it does just hold very well no cracks and it doesn't fall off and I've used this in my previous project where I did the elephant clay project so I'll also link that here down below so I'm just using some water to soften the edges and make it smoother although you need a lot of patience to really get this smooth but you know what I just did what I could in the time I had to do but overall I'm sure you guys know what to do with clay and really it's just about being you know just trying to blend in and try to get the right shapes and it doesn't have to be perfect but you know you can do as you as you do or how you can do their best and just try different ways of trying to create that art that you want to have in the end on your project so I'll leave you with this and if you have any questions please do leave them in the comment box for me any advice any tips I do apologize for my head being in the video as well and I keep saying I need to work on my lighting but you know I will do that as well very soon and I hope to see you again soon and one more thing before I go I also wanted to say the float role that I've showed you in the beginning of the video you can get that through the link that I'm going to post in my description box you will also get a 10% discount if you buy it through that link and I think that these bottles are amazing

friends and community [Music] and off we go hey guys good morning it's dr bacon and it's a little after five and we are bringing down plant number five from our uh barbie house children of the summer six series i have to say i'm really sold on this super cropping technique um more really recently i'm letting the end of the plant have a chance to make it up to the top but for a technique where you don't really remove any material i mean this is a clone from one of the plants from my summer summer six so this plant is not that old it maybe got birthed now maybe three months ago four months ago our harvests were in september um so it probably only got to grow a month in veg uh i popped this off of one of the outdoors and then threw it in the tent to make sure it's in flour grew it up a little bit and then threw it back outside and that's all we did oh here is our throwaway leaves and this is the last one i have to go through so i'm clipping off anything that isn't sugar leaf um so any of these leaves even if they're very green will not contribute to potential butter so they have to go and one thing that's cool about this jack glue is these leaves are really soft and and i wish you could see how how gentle they are here is the rest of our modest harvest so i'm going to say this is probably going to be on the order of again about an ounce and a half which is better than a sharp stick in the eye um here in the back is our african orange and that's got at least three days to go so we're going pretty slow this is on the order about 65 uh 65 degrees and real humidity in here is closer to 50 percent right now it shows that that gauge is wrong but my gobi is correct and so it's about 50 and it's just kind of cold for curing i'd rather i keep saying curing for drying but it'll get there and um it's got to be patient and it'll be super that's our big basin redwood from um up in big sur and that's doing pretty good that was from our friends jeff and liv in long beach so i have one plant from the clones from the summer six left gen one the rest are gen two this is second gen from the summer six this is our african orange this guy i think i'm gonna pick some leaves off want to get a little free time and we got some weather coming it's about five days out but it's gonna be crappy weather for a while and i think i will just harvest this guy when the weather arrives because another week in bad weather is not going to make it any bigger and certainly not going to help with uh it doesn't have mold yet but let's keep it that way um i just got some more mammoth can control and i'm gonna spray all the inside plants too during this um little down time and make sure i get the mite situation nailed down um as well as spray the two that are up there in the house right now um this can control seems to really do help with the mold situation and i haven't had hardly any bud rock and winter growing is never never the easiest so with that i'm going to sign off say thanks guys for everything we're coming up on a couple drawings i got to check my p.o box and see if we've got some seeds in there but the next one will be seeds and then the tent very shortly so i'm looking forward to that we got connected with rachel and she has some packages in the mail um and that's awesome as well so you guys like and subscribe uh if you're watching on your

and you come here look at the outside like everywhere here these are all glue berries which I reviewed in the past I made the curry out of it they eat it in India it's called gunda and they make curry out of it absolutely terrible and Steve and I are gonna try it ripe but it's just what's wild is that all throughout here these are all glue berry trees like all everywhere these are all glue berry trees just on the periphery of the avenue of the bail Bob's so really weird and we have we've been seeing these like here in there like on the side of the road but this is like the largest concentration of them just like right here which is very random so here are ripe blueberries we believe but they're yellow and I thought they're supposed to be pink so not sure we've been told that these are poisonous interesting well that one looks better nice like slightly pinkish yeah you want ones that color so well dude you'd be right next to it well did you be right next door that's pretty cool yeah okay he's eating well jujube the weird aftertaste what is the weird aftertaste even it's some other stringent yeah some little red berries over here too we're attempting to go to the avenue of the bail Bob is over there but we had to stop the car because there's fruit nearby all those are flowers what is this palm here the little one yes that's the same foam that's a male those little teeth that we found those little date berries are from this column right here which is a Phoenix species of palm so hey this is a good place to stop the girl is okay okay I don't eat here okay little girl says that you don't eat this and he's eating it apparently is that what it looks like on the inside yep like glue I like that this girl is just like don't eat it don't eat it and you're like all right don't eat it what does it taste like Stephen I don't know like lychee like I guess but kind of weird aftertaste okay all right if you're gonna do it I'm gonna do it come on it's not that sticky really slimy texture like a mild sweet cantaloupe flavor but with a very musical a it is slime to it these are used to seal envelopes here it's not something people eat it's not poison but you don't want to eat it for the obvious reason that it seals your mouth shut and super slimy but the flavor that's there is actually not that bad a little bit like melon a little bit like lychee is kind of sweet a level of one to ten you got like a six there like five or six little about the sweetness of an apple move a little bit more but I mean what you don't want is just like that is just like terrible slimy consistency but we had the flesh on the side the middle part this stuff is not cool it's really really yeah around the seated stickier but yeah that's probably not so much flavor they're just flying right yeah covered flavor too it's a very different flavor great so I'm gonna try it yeah it's like a bugger yeah that's a little bit different but oh the texture is a poker and flavor it's milder taste like a little bit more like actual blue yeah I think I'm done with this thing I got like glue all over my hands yeah alright thanks for watching thank you merci well I really hope you enjoyed that video guys if you did you may want to check out the video that is below me right now that should be good too also if you haven't subscribed already it is a huge help to my channel so please do consider subscribing or clicking that bell that does something too not sure what it is also check out the description below there's all sorts of other things I have going on I don't even know anymore but guys I will see you next time take care", "tlvjXgNwF1o": "[Music] [Music] hi welcome back to my channel so today I want to show you guys what I've been using lately to hide the grits on my lace so about three maybe four years ago I did a video to show you guys what I use to hide the grits on my place so my grits on the lace I mean the tiny little holes of the lace of the actual unit I'll insert like a close-up picture somewhere for you guys to see for those of you that don't know what I'm talking about um but yeah I used to use the scar way so close scar way is a silicone sheet that you use for like when you have scars obviously to help flatten them out and they sell it at like CVS Walgreens Target all that stuff but it's like twenty dollars for our box of those and I was searching on Amazon for a cheaper alternative you guys and I found another version that is way better for wigs I don't know those scars but for weeks it is freaking bomb okay so the weight that I'm gonna be using today is from awhile African it is this pretty curly unit right here she's really long I'll have all the details and things for this unit down below in the description box but I've already cut the lace and I did pluck it a little bit more but it did come pre pluck and it came with the knots already bleaching so that's always a plus you guys but let me show you guys what I'm talking about so I wish I had a scar away piece to show you guys but I don't have any because I threw them all away because I started getting old but it is this right here so this is what the box looks like I got it off Amazon I'll go ahead and leave the direct link down below because there's a bunch of different ones but this is the one that I got and this is what it looks like you guys so it's still a silicone scar sheet um but you get way more I've already used I don't know a couple of these already because I've been using it for about three weeks now just to test it and see exactly where to place it so this is what it looks like you guys and you can tear it I had the little dotted lines where you can tear it and make little squares you can leave it as long or as short as you want it you know you can always cut it and make it fit to how you want it to I'm gonna go ahead and take a piece off so you guys can see what I'm talking about and then we're going to apply it to this wig okay so this is a super sticky you guys so you do want to be careful with it because it will stick to each other but this is what it looks like it's this really thin layer SuperDuper thin and it's freakin perfect so the other one was a little bit bigger than this or maybe a lot a bit thicker than this cause it had like another layer on top this one is so thin and so flat you guys that is like perfect for underneath the weight so let me show you guys what the weight looks like without it first and then I'll put it on and show you guys what it looks like where's my earring so under all of my lights like it doesn't look that bad it doesn't look like you can really see the grits on the lace but trust me if I get super duper close you could totally see all the little grits right here and when you go outside you can see it so much more and I know that's when people start freaking out about wigs because they just don't want people to know that they have a wig line I don't really see the problem with people knowing that you have a wig on as long as your wig looks bomb like yeah it's a week so what like I changed my hair so freedom I said if you think this is my real hair you are crazy you like I do get it cuz when I first started wearing wigs I was the same way I always felt like people were staring at my wig like really looking at them a wig my wig sliding back is my Latian Shore I don't know it's lifting up it's just like I get it I get it but this should help ease some of that tension you guys I help you guys be more comfortable with wearing your wigs outside especially if the lace issue in the grids because I know like that's what all the memes are on Instagram I'm like I can see that a little screen door I can see the screen door and you're part but you're not going to be able to see it with this yeah so let me show you guys exactly how I apply it and I like to use my tweezers to get it off because sometimes if you use your hand it balls up around each other and then the sides get stuck to each other and when they get stuck to each other it's really hard to get them apart so I started off and then just pull it off and be really careful like this okay so I have my head in my part I'm going to go ahead and take it and I like to do it the longer way I'm just going to put it in place and kind of like press it in and then it'll look something like this and then I'm going to add one more just because this part is kind of long I'm going to add one more behind it so I know Nadia eyes are playing like that's too light for me this is too light for me too but that's okay just take your foundation like you normally would and go ahead and tap it right on top I'll show you guys in a minute so I put it on and sometimes you can kind of see like the ins like the square part so I'm gonna go ahead and round those out and what I mean by round them out I'm just going to cut like make this part rounder I'm gonna cut the edges off I just peel a little bit of the corner down and then I take the scissors and I cut it you guys can see now it has like this arch to it it's not just square anymore so when you put it on it'll kind of like do the curve of the top of your forehead instead of having like this square patch if that makes sense so now I'm going to go ahead and reply it on the ticket out show you guys what it looks like [Music] [Music] where you don't sleep around you wouldn't change me you got the same [Music] you wouldn't change Osby my never [Music] okay let's so I am done you guys see what it looks like in the natural light this is what it looks like inside the house I do have all of my lightening things on lighting it lights hitting lightning and things on you guys know it's bright in here um and this is what it looks like in here it still looks super good inside and outside and you cannot see the grids in my party guys so yeah I hope this gives somebody the confidence that they needed to rock a wig and not be scared of the screen door in the middle of their part but yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you're not subscribed go ahead and hit that subscribe button it's a little notification veil so

how to make slime with just hand sanitizer and nothing else so basically I have some hand sanitizer this is Hansen desert this is not glue I promise you guys I'll put it inside my hands right now and I promise you guys it's just hand sanitizer and nothing else was if it was glue it would have stuck it became sticky and this is no joke the way how to make slime with just hand sanitizer and a freezer of course and if you want to die but a lot of people on my last day which was seven months ago it's been a while and I can't believe it's already seven months later after I post that video but again sorry for the horrible quality but the lighting was really good here so yeah so we see I'm gonna show you guys had me quick outside cuz other people thought there's blacks in the dye go of course you'll have your freedom of speech and your own opinion but I would show you guys just to clarify that this does actually work so these materials nothing else and a freezer so let's go ahead and get started you just get your hands in here and you put it in your container you like I know I'm wasting this but there you go guys and then just go ahead and mix up you can add your dye you know guys if you want and yeah just continue adding in your hand sanitizer and then add your diet and succeed a little bit on the green side and I noticed in my other video that after in the freezer you guys say that's the hand sanitizer it will not freeze it just is like scientific we can't freeze but the one that I use if you use an aloe based hand sanitizer and not really like one for like too much of like a cleaning purpose if use like a bath and Bodyworks it's definitely will work but yeah so we need a very elevates as you can see this is very Ally so so I add it inside the freezer as I'm gonna wait about five five to ten minutes you don't want to wait any longer than back 10 minutes or because they won't really do any good after 10 minutes it'll just be weird so I'm bad guys and it's very gross but what am I gonna say it works as you can see I did add more handsome attire in the bowl but I didn't add enough to make this big of a slime it just expands like you know like those squishy challenges how slime expands so here's the slime and I would say this is not worth your time and this is definitely a slime that is more for lice experiment if you like to make it but once we need it a lot it's definitely pretty squishing not really for the poking or ASMR yeah there's the slime it's not very nice but yeah guys thank you for watching and happy guys enjoy this video yeah

Everything here is down. We've got a generation to lose if the\ngovernment does not step up. This one makes us feel better. The cheapest way to get high \u2013 $5. The police come after us,\nbut we don't give a damn about them. If they come we give them\ntwo bottles, they go back. The streets of Harare are full of\nbrown cough syrup bottles, a sign of the addiction epidemic\ncurrently ravaging the country, particularly affecting young people. MARLBOROUGH\nHarare, Zimbabwe KUZIVAKWASHE MHLANQA\nFormer user In 2016 I started drinking BronCleer. So per day I could drink four bottles\n- 400ml in total. I wasn\u2019t myself. I was someone else or something else. The cough syrup, often of the\nbrand BronCleer, contains codeine: an opiate that can be used\nas a painkiller. It\u2019s relatively harmless in small doses,\nbut can be highly addictive. BronCleer also contains alcohol,\nso when you drink a lot of it, it will make you feel both drunk and high. In large quantities, it can lead to\nrespiratory problems, dangerously low blood pressure, and permanent damage to\nthe brain, heart and liver. I did it because of my friends. They were like, if you don\u2019t do this,\nwe won\u2019t play with you. When you start doing it, afterwards\nyou think it\u2019s a better way of life. My mother is a widow, and she\ndoesn\u2019t go to work. So some of the time, when we get piece jobs, we have to go and get some money,\nand bring it home to buy some food. This is my house.\nI stay here with my five children. I\u2019m a mother of five. LINDA MASARIRA\nKuzivakwashe's Mother With my son, unfortunately, we didn\u2019t pick it up\nbecause he was in boarding school. My son, he's the quiet type. We couldn\u2019t really notice a change\nin him until last year. You'd come home, he'd be on that couch,\nholding a plate in his hand, and you're speaking to him and\nhe's not responding. That is what BronCleer does. It even went to a stage where he started\ntaking things and selling them, maybe to buy his BronCleer,\nor whatever he was taking. He stole a lot of things \u2013 my laptop, cellphones, even food. He even went to that extent. One time he ran away from home. He was staying on the streets doing his drugs. The economy is in ruins, 90% percent of the population is\nwithout formal employment, and families are plagued with\npoverty and addiction. Back in the 1980s, Zimbabwe was prospering, but former dictator Robert Mugabe\nran the country into the ground. He was ousted in November 2017,\nand in July 2018, the country held its first democratic\nelection in four decades. But people are still feeling the\nconsequences of Mugabe\u2019s 37-year rule. We drive to the slums of Mufakose, an impoverished area in the\noutskirts of the capital. Here, we meet Feiton, he works as a\nmusic producer. Welcome to Mufakose. This is my ghetto. But when he was younger,\nhe lived on the streets and was addicted to BronCleer. Today, he is trying to help his friends, who are all stuck in a vicious cycle\nof cough syrup dependency. This is some of my ghetto youths. They don't go to work. As you can see that.\nThat's what they take, that's BronCleer. Four years ago, the government\noutlawed the sale of BronCleer. But the illegal import of cough syrup, especially from South Africa, has continued, and it\u2019s very easy to get your\nhands on a bottle. Even a young child, if you ask\nhim what is this bottle, he or she can tell you that\nthis is BronCleer. Everyone is selling, even in the shops over there, there's a lot of people selling these things. Feiton takes us to the local marketplace\nto show us how cough syrup is being sold and used on the street. -Here, left. For the sake of those guys, maybe\nthey don't want their place to be out, so we will get into the bar, then someone\nwill come out and drink then you can [film]\" Soon we\u2019re surrounded by young\nguys drinking BronCleer. We do it like this.\nEach and every day. The guys are already high. When you drink a lot of cough\nsyrup every day, it can cause your teeth to rot and fall out. So to protect their teeth, they pour\nthe liquid directly into their throats. -How long does it take until you feel something? -Something like 20 minutes. This is for half a day,\nthen you need another addition. The main reason which makes us\ndo these drugs is unemployment; you don't have things to do. You don't get stressed or worried about a lot of things. I've been sitting at home for two years now. This one makes us feel better. Stress... You don't think too much,\nwhen you take this. Every day I take one bottle.\nThen I feel high and I don't think anything. In a day we sell for about $100 to $250. We make a profit of about $100,\nfrom just one box [50 bottles]. We've got some buyers outside South Africa.\nWe contact each other. We send them some money\nand they bring the drugs by bus. Adcock Ingram, the South African\ncompany behind BronCleer, told us they are concerned with the alleged\nmisuse of their cough syrup with codeine and that, since the product is not\nregistered in Zimbabwe, it's illegal to export it there. They acknowledged that smuggling\nmedicine across borders is common and told us they have internal\nprocesses in place to flag unusually high or\nsuspicious orders. We want to understand what\u2019s being\ndone to help young addicts. So we head to downtown Harare to\nmeet up with Hilton Nyamukapa. He heads up one of the few\nNGOs in Zimbabwe actively working to help addicts. There are quite a number of reasons why\nthe youths are taking drugs. The number one reason is idleness. Some of them cannot afford to go to colleges, so it\u2019s a way of coping with the\nstress associated with idleness. It\u2019s hard to pinpoint the\nexact amount of young Zimbabweans who are addicted to BronCleer and other narcotics. The government states that no official\nstudies have been conducted to quantify the scope of the issue. That\u2019s why various interest groups\nhave made their own assessments and even though the results vary\na lot, one thing is certain: The number of young people living on the\nstreets as drug users is alarmingly high. From the information we\u2019re getting\nfrom various sources, we can say that probably more than 50%\nof the youths in Zimbabwe are taking drugs. And once you\u2019re hooked,\nit's hard to get help. Because the only specialized rehabilitation options\nin Zimbabwe are privately run\n and unaffordable for most users. Hilton tells us how the government handles it. If you use drugs, you\u2019re a criminal,\nand you should be sent to jail. So as an organisation we\u2019re saying that\nthe legal system should have some kind of rehabilitation or treatment. We want to ask the authorities about the lack of state-run drug rehabilitation clinics. So we drive to the Ministry of Health. The treatment for drug dependence is\nonly available in psychiatric institutions. By keeping them in the hospitals, and giving\nthem Diazepam [anti-anxiety medication], to make sure they don\u2019t take drugs. So eventually they forget to take drugs. Hilton Nyamukapa doesn't think that\njail sentences and psychiatric treatment works. The NGO is pushing for the government to run rehabilitation clinics, where people can receive proper,\nresult-oriented treatment. The problem of actually putting those people\nin mental institutions is that kind of treatment is actually\ndetoxifying them, it\u2019s not actual treatment. You are detoxified today, and tomorrow\nyou are also craving for drugs. That\u2019s not the proper treatment. We want a proper treatment, where there\nis a gradual treatment until the person recovers. Zimbabweans pretend to be conservative, and they don\u2019t want to openly talk\nabout these things. So going forward, we\u2019ve got a generation to\nlose, if the government doesn\u2019t step up, and Zimbabweans themselves don\u2019t step up\nto try and find a solution to dealing with this drug problem,\nthat is bedevilling our nation. My way forward, was to dump all\nmy bad friends. Close myself in my bedroom. When I started getting serious about my\nmusic, I had no time for drugs. That\u2019s what made me lose my interest in drugs. I have four siblings, and they all look up to me. My hope for the future is to be a source of\ninspiration to the youth. Kuzivakwashe found a purpose in\nmaking music and hence a way out, but thousands of young Zimbabweans\nare still in the claws of addiction. But to treat the root cause of Zimbabwe's\ncough syrup abuse: the lack of opportunities for the country's youth, it will take real political change that\noffers them future prospects. Since we filmed this documentary,\nthe Zimbabwean government told Reuters it intends to open proper state run drug rehabilitation clinics. A statement they are yet to commit to.", "r5l2XiOx-3Q": "hello everyone in this tutorial I will be demonstrating how to make fabric covered wooden earrings this is the perfect project to make use of

direction all right go ahead and let this dry for ten to fifteen minutes now if you are deciding to use a different shape wooden piece you're going to do the same exact thing place it right on top cut out a shape that's big enough then you apply your glue going in the same direction and also let it dry for ten to fifteen minutes this is optional but if you want your wooden piece to be covered on the front and on the back then you will need to cut two additional pieces and you would you can go ahead and do those both as well so you will have two for the front pieces two for the back pieces all right now that your front pieces are dry what you want to do is go ahead and flip them over to the back and we're going to apply some fabric Mod Podge directly on the back you okay make sure that your Africa Kafka's are pointing outwards okay for your front part and you're just going to set it and then go ahead and put a little bit on here you you now I'm doing the same thing for my rectangular pieces I'm just flipping it over to the back applying some fabric Mod Podge then I will take a little bit of Mod Podge and put it on the back of the rectangular piece and place that right on top of my fabric if you have any excess glue coming out of the sides of your fabric in your wooden piece you can just take your sponge and just clean around that area and just clean off the glue all right go ahead and let this dry for 10 to 15 minutes okay go ahead and grab your exacto knife and we're going to cut this out so what this flipped up like this you just take your exacto knife and you're slicing off the fabric you you you would do the same thing for the Africa one now this one is a little bit more challenging because you have to get into every corner once you get to the end of this piece you may recognise that you have some little stray pieces of thread hanging off and that's okay you can take your exacto knife and get as much off as possible if you are deciding to cover the back of your earrings go ahead and take your back pieces of fabric and flip them over to the back add some Mod Podge to the fabric and to your wooden piece and then place your wooden piece right on top just like we did with the front something do the same thing flipped it over to the back I'm adding some Mod Podge to my fabric and to my wooden piece and I'm placing my wooden piece right on top and I'm gonna let this dry alright now that you have the front and optional if you have the backs then sew on the front and the back stone what we're going to do is just put a top layer I'm just adding a top layer of glue to the front part of my earring just to seal it off now with the Africa one this is especially important because if you have any fraying edges this helps to lay down any little scraggly pieces that may be fraying helps to lay them down just like those edges okay if you're going to do the earring post option go ahead and have the your glue some clips and a little piece of sandpaper so what you want to do is take one of your pieces flip it over to the back and you want to take your sandpaper and I'm just going to right where I'm going to put my post I'm just sanding I just sand it just a little dot where I'm going to put the post then you grab one of your post and you're going to fan the top part it's going to help the glue to it here alright so now I'm going to take the glue going to put a little in that area take my post put in a little on that area and going to press that down in place now with the Africa flip it over and you're going to want to put your pulse will that get fit on your ear like up in up in this area you [Music] you all right if you're going to do this option go to grab your pliers eat two jump rings and the wire piece okay first thing you want to do is take your piece and you want to find something sharp all right you want to find the side that has the hole in it and you want to stick the sharp thing inside could be whatever you want to do both sides so find the hole and you're just making it so that now you have a visible hole so once you have your hole through poke through grab one of your jump rings and open it up so I have it opened up and you want to take the piece and you're just gonna so now I have the jump ring through that one take your second jump ring open it up take the Wired earring piece slip it on there close it back up so I close it up then you want to grab the earring piece the one that's still open drop it on there and close that back up and now you have it connected all right everyone this

3d effect of the picture however you can use other color craft paper if you don't have tissue paper let's begin firstly we need to prepare strips of different shades of orange tissue paper begin by rough tearing wider strips of all the colors of tissue paper you will be using then carefully sculpt the edge of each paper strip as it will add a unique character to the background of your picture now we will tear the edge of the brown paper that will create the horizon next we are going to glue all the strips to a card start by gluing the dark orange strip at the top of the card next apply enough glue to hold the second strip down but leave the top edge free continue layering the remaining strips to create a blended effect all strips need to be overlapping each other lastly glue down the brown paper that will create your horizon now cut any excess paper and your background is finished let's begin the drawing initially i am using soft pastels to get an idea what i want the sunset to look like they are easy to work with and you can also rub them over the tissue paper if you make a mistake i'm using darker orange and lighter red to create the highlights of the red sky a little tip for you it's good to clean pastels before use on a bit of tissue paper i'm adding a bit of white highlight on top of the red here and there to give a sense of light coming through as i want the sun to stand out from the picture i have now switched to hard pastels and i'm drawing over the initial drawing with the soft pastels for the main body of the sun i'm using bright yellow pastel and i'm making a few highlights with white to create a texture of the horizon i'm drawing over the brown paper with black pastel you could leave it looking like this but i've decided to blend it further with a cotton bud as you can see there is a lot of black dust coming off the picture so always make sure that you clean your workstation before you continue now it's time to draw a tree each tree has its own distinctive shape so before you begin drawing find pictures of trees that grow in africa enjoy the one that inspires you most i'd just like to say that as much as it is exciting to try new materials it's always great to find new use for the ones that you already have so please use this video as an inspiration and explore with the materials you already have [Music] [Music] we always love

munyong wears so today i'm doing a look inspired by her and i've already done my foundation so we're just doing the eye shadow and let's get into this first i'm using this maybelline fit me concealer to prime my eyelids before i go in with the eyeshadow [Music] and i'm just blending that out with this beauty sponge that i bought from mr price it's not bad i've been using it for months now for this video i'll be using the beauty glaze reversal planet eyeshadow palette and i'm starting off with this light orange color and i'm just blending that above my crease and kind of tapering out the edges we don't want rounded edges at the corner of the eyelid and luckily i have this color switch because we know all of my makeup brushes are hella dirty now once my brush is clean i'm going into this darker orange color called garnet and i'm putting that in the crease and just okay and work on that tapered outer corner of the eye and be careful not to make it round next i'm coming in with a light warm brown and this is in the shade sand and i'm packing that on the lid now at this point i was really questioning whether these three colors were any different because tell me that doesn't look like i'm using one color all over my eyelid but anyway trust the process that's what i told myself next i'm going into a warm red toned brown and i'm going to use that to kind of smoke out my lower lash line but then i realized i didn't use my color switch to clean the brush and it still had all of that orange on it and that's why my under eye was just coming out orange but anyway and next i'm taking a flat angled brush and i'm going into a dark cool toned brown and i'm drawing a little wing and yes this is the same color brown eyeshadow that i used to fill in my eyebrows yeah and honestly this is when i started questioning this makeup look and i was just asking myself did i make the right choice don't know then i was just like you know what let's just see how this plays out so i just went ahead and did the other eye and it didn't come out as bad as i thought it would next i'm taking this gorgeous pink glitter liner that i purchased from a random chinese shop it's absolutely gorgeous it's very see-through so it's perfect to just apply a light shimmer over your eyes i have not gotten any eye infection using this product i highly recommend and i'm just lining that on my lower lash line and you can use as much or as little glitter as you want depending on how dramatic you want the look to be i'm just using a little bit and this is when things started to go wrong now i took this iridescent sulk topper and decided to just put that in the center of my island you can see i'm debating whether or not i should do it i'm like should i shouldn't i and then i just did it man why did i do it i didn't have to do it i could have left the look alone it would have been fine but i did it and then i realized you know i really shouldn't have done it and i'm just like trying to fix this thing but it was too late because i couldn't remove this makeup and now i'm just doing the same thing to the other eye then i'm just highlighting my inner corners with a orange shimmer shade and that's it i was not going to do anything else with this makeup look i had done enough damage already and you can just see me regretting my decision greatly as i was blowing this lash glue i was just like i really messed this up didn't i i wonder if lashes and mascara can fix this mace and that's it that's the final look that mascara and those eyelashes came through because it doesn't look bad it doesn't look bad at all i must say it was quite the vibe thank you guys so much for watching this video don't forget to like comment share this video don't forget to follow my socials which will be linked down below in the description i'll see you guys in the next video bye [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "Ryf0248Od60": "so today we went out in the woods you know wherever our favorite trees are we collected the sign would off of them using the pole pruners Clippers whatever means necessary to get up there and the tree and get them out we cut them into small enough pieces to fit into these quart size ziplock bags freezer bags I use one bag if I'm using storage tight bags I usually double them up and a bigger bag make sure they're labeled rubber-banded tied up nicely and then then all you've got to do is put them in the crisper box some people say to add the moist paper towel I usually do the key if you do that as you need to check them from mold occasionally or make sure they're not too wet if they're too wet you can just kind of open the bag in the fridge and let them air out for a day or two and then close it back up that's it I'm gonna put them in the crisper box until grass today okay so we're out here this is our first day of graft in this spring its middle April we've shown you already how to collect the scions out of your your favorite tree that produces a lot of fruit okay so now the bark is slipping the buds are breaking leaves are coming out and it's time to start grafting so we're gonna do the most simple graft and it's the one that I use the most often it's called the bark graft really all you need is some kind of saw to cut the tree off like that you you need a grafting knife some people use just a basic knife I've got a Swiss Army grafting knife here's a regular knife you're not making a whole lot of precise cut so it's not that big of a deal to get all fancy some people use these retractable you know box cutter type knives no big deal the the tape you use to tie the graft off I use simple flagging tape I also use grafting tape people also use this to stake a tree tied around the tree and a stake to hold it upright you use some type of sealant to seal the graft off I'm going to experiment with this with this caulk I've been using a type of wood glue that they don't make anymore so I've got to find something else some people use tolet Bowl wax some people use that asphalt type pruning sealer that black stuff lots of things work the key is you know you want to seal the moisture off you don't want it to dry off okay like I said earlier this tree has has sprung out for the year you know it's the sap is flowing the buds are starting to get bigger and become leaves that's real important so you start with your dormant scions I hate that word start with your dormant scions you got out of the fridge and they're still dormant this is not dormant anymore it's starting to grow that's important all right now we're just going to cut this thing off [Music] so this is your route stop this is a BART graft again you just make a straight up-and-down cut you're not really cutting you're just pushing it into the bark you're not doing any slicing and then you just you use your knife to kind of pry the bark back it you'll kind of hear it pop and you're separating the bark from the wood inside here is called the cambium layer that's the most important you want the cambium of your rootstock to touch the cambium of your scions we're going to just make a a long v cut so we're gonna have a cut on this side and a cut on the exact opposite side and you cut it down pretty thin if you mess up it's fine you can just make your scion a little bit shorter it really doesn't have to be perfect for bark grafting [Music] okay that's good enough all right we're gonna slide this yeah use my knife to pry it back open [Music] okay there's people that can do that a lot better than me but works just fine I'm gonna make another cut and put another Sion in okay you see how that's peeled back it just pops off easily because the bark is slipping this this bud right here is kind of in the way I want to make a bigger cut so I'm just going to take that off [Music] there's people out there that are way better at this than me that can just make one cut there and one cut there and it's perfect the key point is it really doesn't matter it's this easy okay okay so I'm going to pry that open and slide my Sai on there [Music] okay so what you've got here is cambium of your rootstock now cut touching cambium on two sides of your Scion we need to wrap this guy up now I'm gonna use some simple flagging tape that you that you can get at the co-op all you do to get it started as you wrap it around and overlap it and eventually it'll catch get it really tight especially up top where your Saiyans are and then you just do a simple half hitch to tie it off [Music] kind of your hand like that to get it good and tight and then you're good you can use an exterior type you know waterproof wood glue unfortunately they don't make this one anymore but if you can find it and grab it [Music] I'm sure you've got it really good around each of your Saiyans so no air can get into that crack cut and you're good to go some people will wrap aluminum foil around this to keep the Sun off do all kinds of crazy things I've never noticed it any difference like I said I get 90 95 percent success this is my third year of doing it it's it's it's this easy it normally doesn't require all of that and that's it let's go to the next tree", "-Yth_7TJQ1Y": "[Music] hi everybody so today our activity is making musk in africa people make masks different types of mask so they wear masks in different ways african masks often represent spirit times you will see one person is wearing that mask and dancing through that dance they believe they can connect with their ancestor means they're the people who came before them their grandparents great-grandparents that's what they believe yes they have been doing this for many many years but these days they don't use masks very often and the ceremony the celebration is not very often in

today hope you are going to make your own mask bye", "f1qui4d4vww": "well hello everybody so here's another one that I got in Jackson Heights Queens which is a Indian community in New York City and I got this at an Indian supermarket it is Gunda English name for it would be glue berry you see this is actually sold unripe you can eat it ripe but it's very difficult to find it ripe because it's extremely perishable and in areas where it grows usually animals get to it before people can it gets the name glue berry because long ago people used to seal envelopes using a plant adhesive and these things are full of it they are extremely newsom a genus and if you take one of these berries you can actually just have ripe one anyway you can actually rub it on an envelope in order to seal it it's probably not going to taste very good you know before you cook it but you know why not what other opportunity will I have so I'm going to first flip this open look at that limey oh yeah that is that's gross whoo yeah it's the slime appears to be just coating the seed there so it's a slimy little seed oh yeah that's gross and you actually take that slimy butt out and you just use the rind of this fruit that is um that is what you would used for the vegetable but let's try all of it awesome first I will I will take this seed out and just kind see what that's like the sliminess is gross but doesn't taste that bad tastes kind of like watermelon rind maybe a little bit like a green bean it's not especially anything it's giving me like a little bit of dry mouth which you know that's kind of what you get for eating an unripe fruit I think you actually feel my lips kinda like getting stuck together well I'm eating it I'll try a little bit of the outside this is not something you're supposed to do so don't write to me and be like you're eating it wrong I'm going to cook it who buys this uh just out of my own curiosity I'm going to try it the skin on the outside is not as slimy that's good but yeah not not much to it just like a kind of bland green vegetable flavor but you can pickle it that's usually the most common way of using this either using it it's coming Indian pickles really like spicy crazy things or in Taiwan these are actually popular and they're used kind of like olives I don't have the patience to wait like weeks for pickles to be made so I'm going to actually treat this as a vegetable and follow a recipe I found that uses this just as a vegetable okay step 1 get some boiling water and dump in the Gunda fruits and every recipe I've been seeing even the ones for like pickles and things like that they all require you to boil these first I guess I think it gets rid of some of these slime units today so this cooks until they start turning tender and let these cool down oh and now that they are cooked and cooled it is time to cut them so just kind of like slice them in half like so check out seed nobody wants that and take off the cap so this is the only bit that you want here and it is still very very sticky and in case you're curious because I certainly am I'm going to try one of these just cooked not a slimy it's got a very soft texture and has no flavor it's got like a remnant of that little bean taste here like a green bean the watermelon rind taste is kind of dissipating a little bit with the cooking no astringent see that's gone but doesn't really taste like much basically I've got 1/2 teaspoon of cumin and 1/2 teaspoon of carom seeds in here carom seeds also known as aged wrong seeds these are I picked these up in a Indian supermarket and they just kind of taste like herbal cough medicine and I put 5 tablespoons of oil in here in here there is oh gosh there's a lot of stuff there's tumeric there is chili powder there's coriander powder there is fennel there is hing which is a very stinky sulfur kind of spice there is mango powder there's salt there's I think that's it I think so but go to the description below for exact measurements if you want to try doing this but that just gives you an idea of what I'm putting in here don't I cook the spices in here first for just a second and then and this cooks for about four minutes in all of these lovely spices here goes so quite hot hmm still slimy the texture of this thing is like the bloated grape that you would get at the bottom of like a fruit cup the flavor is inexistent it doesn't really taste like anything it just have it has a texture and a sly meanness spice mixtures good I could take that spice mixture and put it on anything else beans on a squash on eggplant another kind of like mild vegetable and it would taste just as good only it wouldn't have that sly meanness not a fan of that if you like slimy things power to you this this would be right up your alley you know like when you pickle this it's supposed to get rid of some of that slime you know so maybe that's a better way to go but using it as a vegetable as I wanted to do I wouldn't do it again I wouldn't go out of my way to get this thing and maybe if we're like growing in my yard I would pick it and utilize it in this way but I wouldn't go to the store and buy it again but it is an interesting fruit it's kind of interesting history it's the fact that people used to use it to seal envelopes like that's fascinating no regrets not bad but I wouldn't do it again hey so at the end of this video there's going to be a preview of weeks fruit so stay tuned for that the first business I want to give a shout out to all my patreon supporters patreon is how this channel happens so if you

something different and it came out looking great so i'll be using i believe about this three this four this five that's six i mean it just came in six of course but i think i ended up using about five and a half of this here guys and oh no i actually used six packs of this one because we only had um i think about 15 um strands per pack so that was the reason why i end up using about six or even seven but yes i am so so excited so in my i'm about to you know prep now but i'm just gonna say some stuff before i prep or just as i prep so i am prepping right now and usually as you know i always start with two strands but for this one i wanted that like nice bob look that's going to fall that it's not going to be stiff or you know just like um [Music] just looking up or something like that so the what i did was that i started wrapping with one strand and then i continued wrapping with the only two strands so i was wrapping with one strand that was how i started and then i with two strand and that's how i prep my hair so the one at the top is only they only have one strand and that was how i started wrapping and the one and the bottom your two strands and that was how i finished wrapping i also have the link to the hair in my description also you can use any spring tools here and i believe some passion swiss hair will work for this but you have to be really really careful because of some of them come looking silky and i and when it's silky it's really hard for me to wrap with and it's hard for me to steal my ends without having to burn them so that's the reason why i would keep using spring two's hair until i find something better or something you know something nicer basically so we're gonna get right into it and don't forget to like comment and subscribe and yeah as you can tell i was i'm just so so excited because this is my first time doing this um style in color um 1b like in black because um i've been trying to like when i see um pictures on instagram like how did she have it looking really really nice like skinny too thick and i was just like let me just try using one strand at first i was okay so one is trying to make is going to make it look really really skinny but honestly sometimes when you think about stuff just when you imagine stuff just try you don't know like just try it out and then see how it comes out and it came out looking really really good and i am in love with this bob look i have um done something similar with um different colors before and she also loved her hair but i just hope i wished i was able to like just do the same thing for hers but since she loved her that's all that matters to me but i will be using this technique for the rest of my um for the rest of my appointment so when um for the braid count because i always forget i think i it was about 48 48 it's always in between 48 to 47 to like 52 counts of locks yeah and per lock i would say i started with one strand and finished with two strands so basically for this bob look i only ended up using about three strands of um the spring two's hair and i am going to be doing three parts for her i'm only using that extension um for that part just because i don't want it to unravel like i don't want her locked i just wanted something um what am i trying to say so um that part of my hair is really really short so i wanted some type of you know strength or extension to it but you're going to see how i am going to end up i'm going to end up you're going to see how i'm going to end up um just um doing the bob look regardless of how long her hair is anyways anywho stay tuned for more so now we're done putting the hair as you can see i don't break the hair all the way down because there's just more time on yourself like as long as you can just braid to the middle and then you can just twist the rest of the hair you don't have to waste the time to braid everything down only if you know your clients want it for protection wise but honestly it doesn't really matter just braid half twist of the hair and then you'll be good to go trust me the hair is not going to come out of her lock trust me so yeah now we're about to start this um nice shorts bob look so imagine that to be your client's actual size so if your client hair is longer than um the bob or the short length all you have to do is you know put your crochet hook at the roots of your client's hair and then take the ends of your clients hair and just crochet it together and then just twist it just so it's um it's way way shorter than the length that your client is going for for example if your clients want um bob or you know shooter length just make it really really short so that when your client is trying to cut the ends of a lock to take her locks down she doesn't have to really um worry about where her hair stops because you make it really really easy for her as you can see from my clients right now so again all i did was take my crochet crochet my um crochet the ends of my clients here and then boom just twist it and didn't have it to be that way so now we're going to start wrapping them so so excited so i mean as you can see since our hair was kind of like thick towards the end it always makes sense for me to use one strand instead of two shrine as you can see my client here is going to be half of the lock so when she takes her hair down she is safe um she's not going to end up cutting my hair like she's good to go so this one is the like distressed lock as you can see i am going to try to do slow move for the first one i'm just going to use my thumb and i just know take it out and then just keep going like that probably just like i'll probably just like um wrap twice with wrap one time and then take out and then that's how i'm going to end up doing it but at some point i would have to attach to my second piece of hair and you're going to see how i attach it and also how i sew my ends and you're going to see how this hair falls guys i just cannot wait for you guys to see the end result i have also seen people who have heard of people using the nail glue to seal the ends but i haven't really had any complaints from my clients about your end of the lock unraveling and i feel like nail glue is gonna make my um it's gonna be so hard and i don't like when it's just like when i see like that sound like i don't know it's just i just i don't know i just cannot i don't like when something's gonna bother my hands or my finger or anything like that this is the reason why i don't really use no glue because i've never really have to i've never really had to so maybe in the future i don't really know but i don't intend on using it and i've never used it before all i do is just um get to the end and then wrap back up to seal the ends of my um lock and you're going to see me doing it in this video as well as you can see it's looking really really nice and at this point i was like hmm what is going on but just wait just wait for it guys and don't forget if you have any questions i would always try my best to answer all the questions but if you um if you turn on your notification and then i end up posting the video when you have a question and i post a video and you want to ask me a question as i post a video i would be there to answer your questions like the first two three hours like i'm always there to answer all the questions i do try my best so let me know if you have any other questions you can see i am showing you how i wrap my clients hair up i'm just going to take the ends the the remaining piece of the um the spring to sand and just wrap up and then that's exactly what i do so you can wrap up and like still do the dumb thing yes wrap up but i usually don't but i i usually i originally don't like it doesn't really matter because i mean i'm not really going all the way back to the you know to the roots it doesn't really matter to me but sometimes when i need to i do use my thumb just so i can still have the nice looking distressed look to it from the root to the um to the ends of the lock as you can see it looks really really nice guys like i was just like well like this is really really cute so they'll be all for big detail and i'm also going to be doing this other one i'm going to also be doing um the slo-mo so you guys can see how i do them so um with them i'm just going to make it really fast because i don't want this video to be too too long but anywho um again don't forget to like comment and subscribe share um share the video tell your friends and um yeah i'll be seeing you guys in my next video as you can see um that's where the hair is gonna stop her natural hair and that is how long it locks it so basically our hair is going to be forever safe like safe

night under the stars first of all you're going to need a container which light can pass through so it can be glass or plastic but as you can see i'm using an old coffee jar here next you'll need some tissue paper or crepe paper and you want them preferably in colours of a sunset so yellow orange or red i'm going to use a base layer of yellow and moving on to orange by rolling the jam jar along the bottom of the paper you can guess how much you need you can make a mark or use some scissors roll it back out and then cut it out so you'll end up with a strip like this which will be ready to go around your jar before i actually put it round the jar i'm going to need to cut out some more layers of tissue paper i'm moving on to orange here so lay your first layer over the top you can draw around it and then cut it out so that you'll end up with three layers of paper like so next we can start sticking so to stick your paper onto your jar we're going to start with the base layer [Music] you'll just need a glue stick and you basically just put glue all over the jar with the glue all over your jar you then just place the jar onto the paper and roll it along smooth it down and your paper should stick nicely that's your base layer the other two layers we're now going to actually cut out so first of all you need to draw a line and this is going to be like hills on your first layer so just it's very rough it doesn't have to be neat or anything like that and we're just going to draw hills then place your next layer over the top and we're going to draw some more hills but not as high this time so now we have to cut those out so you should have two pieces cut out your larger piece is the next piece to be glued onto your jar so this time just place the glue onto your larger piece as you can see you don't have to be neat and tidy just try and get the glue onto the paper and then once again you're rolling your jar onto it smooth it down that's your second layer done with our third layer we are going to be putting on our african scene here so using the silhouettes that we sent to you this is the really good part we're now going to be placing our tissue paper over the silhouettes and drawing out out the silhouettes so as you can see i've done a tree there and an elephant so i can decide what i want next perhaps i would like a giraffe so this is the nice thing about it you can position these animals wherever you like and then you just draw out your giraffe being very careful just to go around the edges but don't be too worried if you make a mistake because this is a silhouette at the end of the day use a biro because it just gives you that little bit more ease to go around the silhouette so as you can see i've gone round the giraffe there when you come to actually fill it in you can use the biro it's a little bit hard work but you can use a black felt tip but you must put something underneath the black felt tip as it goes straight through the tissue paper and i've got a thinner one here and as you can see you just then go around the outside and then just fill it in and it makes a beautiful silhouette for your lantern so this is just so you keep on going around the outside try to keep in the lines as much as possible so using a thinner one like this you can just fill it in you could use a thicker one but some as you can see it does go through if you use some thicker felt tips you might find they spread so just be careful for the finer details but filling in large areas like this you can use the thicker one but just be careful near the edges because it will spread out but that does fill things in bigger better maybe on the trees to make the trees and as i say it doesn't matter if you go over the edge a little bit on the trees because these could be branches and leaves and everything so you continue to do that until you have a strip like that so once you've got your strip of your silhouette animals and trees we've basically just got to glue it onto the lantern now so apply your glue to the back of your strip just be careful with tissue paper it does rip quite easily just do it as best you can making sure the edges get a good glue and once again we're going to roll it onto our lantern so as you can see you've been doing a layering effect so hopefully that will come out when we put the lights inside so as you can see the glue takes quite nicely just the normal glue stick and there you have your lantern all ready to light so we suggest to light it by using the battery operated tea lights for safety if you are an adult you may use a normal candle but we suggest that these are far safer so all you do now is pop your light on open your jaw drop it in and you now have your african lantern thank you and goodbye

prepping my lid space and for that i will be going in with my l.a girl pro conceal in the shade phone [Music] and now in my makeup revolution bubble dress palette i'm going to grab the shade here just

burnt orange shade and i took it on this base shader brush by real techniques and for my mobile lid i went into this very dark brown shade right here and i took it on this dense shader brush [Music] and for the glitter part i used a combination of both these bouches glitter glitters and i'm using this short shader brush just to get some glue off a palette and then i'm just going to dab it along

by wet and wild and just go over all over my face and to blur out any harsh lines and now to get rid of that powdery effect i'm going to go in with my nyx matte setting spray to snatch my nose i will

started off with a cheap mask that I got from Michaels and then to make the features a little bit broader more like an African mask I took some cardboard to make the nose have a bit more definition than machine then I put some saran wrap over the mask because I was concerned that the paper mache would stick to the mask but in retrospect I actually don't even think that would have been in a concern so if you get a mess like this you can ignore this step that I so diligently did to be sure that the newspaper wouldn't stick to it mask okay so then you want to mix the glue and the water so the mix of the approximately one-third glue to two parts water and then you just want to shred up your newspaper in distrib set you can place across the mask you need to be sure that the strips overlap each other a couple of times because the more they overlock the thicker you're making your mask so at least go over your mask a couple times with the strip's you want to be sure to leave any part of the mask that you don't want covered blank like I leave if part of the mouth and the eye area without the strips [Music] to dry overnight once it was dry and you can go over the design using markers so it's nice to use the marker you can make sure you get everything lined up symmetrically exactly how you want it okay reposition things and figure out your design on the mass next I make the accessories to the mask so the ears and the triangles that are gonna stick up off the top of the mask I also cut little slips where I'm gonna slim swear I'm gonna glue them onto the mask so that don't fit the curved edge of the shape of the mask now it's time to paint I'm just using some basic acrylic paints I'm using the red and the white to blend together some pink but I actually add a an orange or red and get the peach color to use for the cheeks whenever you're painting it's always good if you can find brushes that complement the shape that you are painting so it helps you to stay in the lines that you have the right-sized brush to fit into the shapes so here I'm painting the sockets eyes I created a lighter brown for the forefronts part of the mask and then later I'll be painting the further away edge of the mask in a darker Brown [Music] bigger brush so I can cover the surface more quickly it's great if you can get a little variety pack of brushes so this is what the mask looks like when I'm almost done I decided to leave the space around the nose white and then at the very end I decided I wanted to add a bit more detail with my design so I went ahead and mixed some more paint about some white paint and I'm going to add some design to the edge of my bear mask again I tried to find the right to brush so here is a brush that comes to a nice point that will help me create the dots of the design that I'm about to put on all the African masks were handmade just like this process so it might not be exactly perfect but just as close as you can to keeping your design symmetrical will will be wonderful almost done now my bear has a bit of decoration on her head so there you go that is the lesson on a mache African mask I hope you enjoyed it see you next time",

this cancel you want to make sure that these a bit like two shades watching looking girl with para shades like huh right but then I always prefer to go with one shape to my skin tone so you don't be looking like if you have that white cast like you know where you can see that the eyebrows are outlined like with white that is nice please don't do that unless of course that's what you like and do anything with makeup anything you want with it so I'm just giving a better advice like and this is the touch neck key so you wanna take using a flat brush that with a very small flat brush that I probably spoke from my friend I don't know I don't know I don't remember but if I did buy it then it's very good so it works so you wanna outline I chose what are we gonna do since we don't have a white face we are gonna use that concealer that is a bit more lighter it's also from any girl it's in the color creamy beige and when I use the same brush that I was using to even out my eyeshadow let's hope it's a bit white because we are colorful today ladies and dental it's our using it history guys but it's clean and it's damp okay do not say oh you beauty blunders daddy that's why your face is breaking because yeah that my five days of the week just Vaseline Papa selenium and Mota yella mmm can you imagine I hope guys she made us apply was lamenting 3:12 like outside was it until met Ricky but now who still applying is oh I guess mothers are always right I was minding my own business online men men usually I mean my business are on the beauty section of things so so when I was looking I saw this colorful palette from NYX it looks like this but guys here's the thing online me this thing looks kind of big at look guys she's so small and it was around three hundred and something I think so guys I went on and put I just applied the all the mature if you can see it I think if the old packaging cuz you see has a small there's a small font than the newer ones so yeah I don't want to wet the brush cuz I wanna see this is this gold maybe I'm just get to put you guys and so scaped let's be bold let's be beautiful because I feel like there's no much color coming out of this breast actually this but I got examine this can with an adult color so when I use the flat one and see if the application really better actually as well to save time so that puts I met a bit of orange guys know what let me just open the dy as cut it and see our how's this gonna work [Music] unless looks like this was ice hybl Oh [Music] Rhys was always empty oh it's a complicated failed fool okay we're good okay we good but he had so the next kind of are we gonna use as from this yellow oh it's a bit shimmery so I use it to blend the orange [Music] let's see me when you wanna use the yellow and okay it's also getting okay the next kind of a time when I use is the top hooks and then I'll go in with this dip prep who is their kind of called you people I don't know you know what let's just play the brush to make sure the colors are movies like this because yeah so you're gonna apply your purple going back to the same orange to blend these two colors together and after that guys though we are going to cut our crease using back a page from a vehicle put a lot in the middle of my okay to get the shape [Music] [Music] not that I got my concealer I'm going to bring back the purplish on the top the next thing that we're going to do a taking the same dark purple that we used next color that we're going to take same orange the one that I used for the next is this orange whatever color is a great dish whatever color right you're gonna put it in the center of the eye and the next color that I'm gonna take this trial or instead of from the day as pilot and see how it looks like [Music] and I have the orange on the NYX palette so you're gonna go in with the one from beautiful it's this one and see how available just next to the purple one of a congressional panel better the very same year that we started with this one [Music] Oh [Music] so using the three side I'm just blending all the colors very so I went on did the other eye because my camera died on me so I'm not sure where I ended I think I just landed the purple like all over my eyelid and tried to match the other eye guys huh it's so difficult to match eyes but I tried I think still I'm a bit off but it's not bad so what we going to do then I take the same consonant kind of fun to clean our eyes so just want to do a straight line to at least have still my foundation so I'm gonna be using the baby skin instant pore eraser by maybe of six you can see that face as my pal MOSFETs are you gonna do this messy so unless is that I'm gonna be using our they're called noticeable Eilis this one guys

me again with another hair video in today's video I'll be reviewing this Brazilian lace week Bob from cranberry hair you can check out more of what they have on Instagram and Facebook so behind this box there's like maintenance tips and I actually watched straightened and I did quite a lot today you will see that in the video and I followed these maintenance tips please make sure you follow them so that your hair can last longer I actually chose this blonde hair guys because I love color and I think it's actually safer to buy color hair than bleaching at yourself because sometimes you don't always get the color you want so to save yourself the stress of bleaching by hair that is already colored this is how the hair looks on the inside and I actually like the fact that I don't have to bleach the knots and I actually reduce the lights so that you can see the original color of the hair so this is how the hair looks on me I didn't like the meat part and also I didn't really like the shape so I actually washed the hair to give it and some volume and give it the shape that I want I like the fact that it's very accurate on the head on the head I mean I will have to cut an excess Hey to wash the hair I used Vida is life shampoo for blonde hair this shampoo doesn't really change the color of the hair it just the revives like the color of the hair and also protect the color because every time you wash here it loses color so the shampoo just protects that color you can actually check them out on Instagram and they are available from clicks and if you want a detailed video on how to wash hair I do have like two videos on how to wash here I will just link them at the end of this video after washing the hair I just rinsed it and I just let it air dry and don't let your hair get sunburned just let it air dry in an area that doesn't get Sun or you can leave it in the house overnight it will dry and this is how the hair looks after wash I like the fact that it's a little bit soft moistured and it is a bit fullness like it's different from how it came and the wet volumous is not the correct way to use for hair but it sounds corrects so aspect to it so I've easing this and serum from Vita is life is also a nice serum for here and I'm just using it to protect the hair from heat and dryness I'm sure you guys know that when you straighten a bob you must straighten it in sections because it's not the same size all around the head and even for long hey I always like straighten it in sections so I just create creator it's English a section and I'm using this new straightener I got from flicks as you can see it has like side plates I like that that's the reason why I got it it has side plates that will assist with like killing the hair at the bottom so if you like it's actually you should get it there's no need to like it as a very nice straightener it is amazing and it's currently on sale at cakes so just go there now before they take it back to the normal price and I straighten the hay by sections all the way to the top when I got to the top I actually opened a pad a side part like and actually poured some water just to not really define but just to make sure that it's there you know I'm just gonna use a mousse to define the pot so you have this water thingy really works you must try it when you are trying to create a part [Music] so this is the installing part of the most interesting part this is the part that makes you hey if you ruin it dead your hair will be ruined I'll get it guys but this is the part that makes your hair guys and as you know I use the mousse for my friends house just to give my lace color that matches to my skin color so that it looks natural so you just apply it all around the lace like that even towards the edges as you can see it looks a bit natural you see some brownish they brownish roots yeah and I'm also gonna use it to define that side part I wear my frontals with you guys because I just like how they like stick to the skin like I wear my friend's house with you and at this point I like it and yeah I went with like the white gel from God to be and then I also went in with the spray as you know I apply the sprays in sections I start with a middle section and then go to the sides so this is what I did also this is like a new method that I'm trying out like gluing down the front hall before cutting out the lace and I must say it's actually nice it actually makes the lace more natural you will see when I cut the lace it looks a little bit nice it's nicer than when you cut the lace first and then blue what is left [Music] you you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you so this is the part where I cut off the lace the lighting looks nice I think it looks nice for my skin color I don't know why my light like messes with me so much guys I need to learn how to control lights and I start in the middle section and cut it off like that and then go to the sides as you can see it looks natural already guys like I'm gonna go in again and cut what has left like just defined like you must palate you know define it so that it matches your skin color [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so after cutting off the lace you must clean up the front part guys because there's always like excess glue so if you apply makeup on top of that excess glue it will look like white layer and it really looks ugly you don't want that so I used my is it my seller micellar water to clean up the excess dream you so I post the video and beated my face cuz this hair really needed some face bead so that it can pop so I'm using my resume mousse just to make the hair flat in front and maybe cover a was like small baby hairs like just to cover the line in front it's not really visible but I can see my hey I have hay in my forehead but I can see it so I'm just gonna use the Tresemme mousse to cover up the hay I absolutely love this hey guys this is my final look and I honestly love the hair

the top one as well i'm starting in the middle and then i extend the bottom line to the what to the to the beginning to the beginning of the brow my reason for that is that um i do not want to create

is very crucial for you to blend out your concealer properly for my top of the brow i'm going to use my foundation which is the maybelline fit me foundation and the shade 350 and the name is caramel i personally don't like using my concealer at the top because it's too light the reason for me using a lighter shade under my bro my brow is because i want the the colors of the eye shadow to pop out a bit more [Music] [Music] [Music] now you're just gonna blend out your foundation at the top just like you did at the bottom with your concealer [Music] i do apologize for the change of lighting i do not know what is happening with my camera uh you take the same fluffy brush to just blend that that up no man what the hell am i saying to blend it in did i just say blend it up wow okay i'm sorry about that as you can see i'm done with my eyebrows now i'm gonna take my eyeshadow palette [Music] i'm gonna use the color pink first this eyeshadow palette literally has 70 shades guys saving to imagine i'm going to apply the pink shadow directly on my eyelid [Music] i don't know what that part is called but i call it an eyelid guys but you can see most way i'm putting it [Music] oh for the brush you can literally use any brush it doesn't have to be specifically a blending brush just any brush to apply that pink it's cool now i'm going to use the color orange this time i'm changing my brushes i'm going to take my blending brush my eyeshadow blending brush these brushes are very essential if you want a proper eyeshadow look because they help you blend out the eyeshadow and it helps so that the eyeshadow shouldn't look how can i put this it shouldn't look too harsh [Music] the swirling method i'm using is when i'm blending it in blend blend blend blend blend [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now i am going to take the shade yellow and literally place it on top of the orange the orange where the orange is placed it's called a crease so i'm assuming the yellow is on top of the crease just beneath your brows [Music] [Music] [Music] once you're done with that now you can apply your lashes by the way guys i get my lashes from caleb i will link her channel my description box she's my lash plug because many of you guys have been asking me where i get my lashes from so now you'll [Music] know i'm going to use the lash grip eyelash glue [Music] so what i do different since i'm not perfect in applying lashes like i don't get it right the first time so i don't allow for the glue to be too tacky so that when you place it it's already there i allow it to be a bit tacky and a bit wet as well so that if you misplace it you can be able to place it properly [Music] as you can see it is a white blue but as soon as it dries up it's going to become clear and then you won't see the white [Music] anymore i honestly feel like the baddest ever with these lashes like oh my god they are so beautiful now i'm going to use my essence setting spray i use my setting spray before and after i apply my foundations and all of that shenanigans it just helps my foundation to lay a bit better like it just it lays nicely on my on my skin i'm going to take my foundation and make little dots all over my face i am directly applying it to my face because i am the only person that uses this [Music] foundation oops sorry about that [Music] now i'm going to take the sponge which is not a blending sponge just a little cute sponge and i spray the setting spray on the sponge and then i blend my foundation as you can see i'm using a dabbing method i'm not dragging the foundation [Music] [Music] uh i might look a bit lighter but it's just the camera [Music] i do look normal okay so i don't look too light so don't let that scare you now i am going to take my concealer conceal my under eyes my chin my forehead under my cheeks [Music] i do not contour and conceal my nose because i have a flat nose and i just i love it like this it's fine and i don't see any point of trying to contour this little flat nose i'm using the pro la girl pro conceal in the shade espresso it's not that dark because i'm not very big on contour because i have a chubby face and i would like for it to stay that way and the whole aim of a contour is to make your face look a bit smaller [Music] so i'm going to take my ugly absolute trust trans oh my god this word just keeps on doing this to me translucent powder and place it where i placed the concealer and blended the concealer step is not exactly necessary if you are not big on baking a face but if you like baking like i do then definitely do this but do not put the powder on for too long while i wait for the baking i'm going to go right ahead and line my lips with the eyebrow gel i used for my eyebrows [Music] and guess what i'm going to take my concealer and put it on my lips yes you heard me and then i am going to take my aven lipstick in the shade nude and i'm going to go over that whole concealer [Music] and look at that now i am going to brush off the excess [Music] look at that girl already looking pretty [Music] setting spray [Music] now i'm going to take my bronzer from scarlet hill [Music] and i'm going to highlight my cheeks my little cheeks you know and i'm going to highlight my nose a bit of my forehead and my chin and just below my eyebrows as you can see i use like a pout smile method because i have cute little cheeks so i want that highlighter to sit on those cheeks [Music] now i'm going to take this little circle brush and use the bronzer to highlight my inner corner my eyes just has a nice effect and then i'm going to take an angled brush [Music] using the shade orange to just do my under eyes [Music] my under eyes are extremely sensitive so i'm not going to use mascara and yes look at the gale [Music] now i'm going to use my lip gloss my essence lip gloss and look at that like what [Music] like what do you mean guys what how dare you look at this again you like imagine

clay vogue tribal woman on bottle and I have added lots of techniques and textures to this bottle so without any further delay let's start with the procedure for this we need any stencil pictured paste paint brush wall tool scissor some beads ball chain some mirrors any air dry clay liquid glue some acrylic colours thread jute twine tissue paper and the glass bottle on which you want to add your design first I will wrap white color thick thread on the top of the bottle that is the neck of the bottle this thread you can find easily from any craft store I am just adding little glue and wrapping it around the bottle [Music] so this is done I'm just cutting the excess thread and securing it using glue [Music] now I am taking little mixture of fait we call or liquid adhesive and some water applying it using brush and adding some small pieces of tissue paper on whole bottle [Music] like this so I have covered whole bottle with tissues now I am taking my polka dot stencil and using textured paste or mixed-media paste I am applying on top of the stencil using my palette knife if you don't have textured paste you can create it at home by mixing little ceramic powder and little glue and Wando create a thick paste and your texture paste is ready so cover this whole design properly and now I will slowly remove the stencil like this isn't it looking beautiful in the same way I will add pattern or other two sides we need to keep one side empty so all three sides are covered and fully dried now I'm starting with the fourth side taking little quantity of air dry clay I'm using she'll car clay making a teardrop shape and adhering with the bottle in the center here I am making the face of the woman [Music] just smoothing it using little water now again taking little clay rolling it on the surface and cut it using knife and now I will make up agree or turban [Music] now I will add features like nose eyes eyebrows lips ears [Music] [Applause] now I am adding earrings by adding small dough circle like this and adding the texture using backside of sketch pin now I am making the neck so first add little glue and I have already prepared the piece of clay like this shape [Music] adding small curved pipes of clay for the necklace [Music] and making a texture using ball tool [Music] so this is done and fully dried now I have already created some small shells using clay I have just created a drop shape and cut the center part using paper knife and I am decorating the bottle using these collations [Music] like this now I will start coloring the whole bottle except the woman using hot shades like yellow orange red and little black [Music] so this is done now I will color whole woman face using dark brown acrylic color [Music] [Applause] so this is Dan and right now I'm taking little golden acrylic paint on my finger and just applying slightly on the raised parts to give little texture you can also do this process using brush but I think your finger will do much better work [Music] now I'm making the necklace using some small beads [Music] I have decorated the whole part using some small beads ball chains and some mirrors also have decorated the upper part and now I am decorating the turban using ball chain and beads [Music] so this is Dan isn't it looking beautiful now I have connected two wooden beads with the jute rope and now I will add these two hangings on the neck of the bottle so to tie this I am taking one small piece of jute thread just make a knot add security [Music] also I am adding these two clay frames which I have created using the frame mold if you don't have this you can skip this step I am adding these two frames on both the sides I have colored the frame using black acrylic color and added little golden texture like we did for the woman and added some small white colored dots here and there isn't it looking very attractive I am sure you will decorate your old bottle very soon to give the new look so my project is done for today hope you enjoyed my video please subscribe my channel for more interesting videos and don't forget to click on well icon for the latest updates thanks for watching see it's time bye bye [Music]", "3XvGlZByYhw": "You probably think that you can only meet\nsuperhumans in movies and comic books, but in reality there are some genuinely extraordinary\npeople out there that were just born with unbelievable and straight up unusual traits\nthat make them closer to superhuman than human. Today I\u2019ve gathered up for the most incredible\nof these wild individuals who have naturally become famous sensations from their insanely\nunique traits. After watching this video you\u2019ll never forget\nabout these unusual people for as long as you live. Ready to meet them? Let\u2019s get it on! TRAN VAN HAY\nSometimes you might feel lazy and put off getting a haircut for a while, but Tran Van\nHay seems to have never gotten around to it. The 73 year old Vietnamese man is said to\nbe the man with the longest hair in the world, not having cut his hair in nearly half a century! Van Hay says that after he fell ill following\na haircut he got at age 25, he swore to never cut his hair again, and he never went back\non that promise. His absurd head of hair measures an unbelievable\n22 feet and 3 inches long at the most recent measure, and with its naturally dreading nature,\nit\u2019s realistically probably even longer. Plus it all weighs in at over 24 pounds, meaning\nthat Tran Van Hay might not just have the longest hair in the world, but also the strongest\nneck to be able to hold up all that weight all day. JAMIE KEETON\nIf you thought superhumans only existed in movies and comic books, Jamie Keeton would\nlike to have a word with you. This real life X-man has a completely unique\nand as of yet totally unnamed skin condition that gives him the gravity defying ability\nto stick objects to his skin, which he\u2019s managed to turn into a career by showing it\noff. He goes by the nickname Can Head because he\nfamously sticks bottles and cans to his head naturally, even casually pouring a drink from\na bottle stuck to his head during an interview. According to specialists, what gives Jamie\nhis amazing superpower is his pores having a property that makes them act just like suction\ncups, but a really cool party trick isn\u2019t all Jamie\u2019s got. His body temperature is naturally higher than\nthe average human, which somehow allows his wounds to heal faster and makes him age more\nslowly and get sick less often than most people. One definite upside to his power is being\nable to talk on the phone without having to use his hands at all. ERIK WEIHENMAYER\nOne of the biggest reasons people climb mountains is to see the incredible view at the peak,\nbut that couldn\u2019t be less the case for Erik Weihenmayer. Blinded by a rare eye disease at the young\nage of 13, Erik never allowed this impairment to be anything but a motivator to him, and\nhas spent his life training to conquer one of the hardest things in the world for even\na sighted person to do: climb mountains. And not just any mountains, but the 7 highest\nmountains in each of the 7 continents. While naysayers told him throughout his entire\nlife that his ambitions were impossible, Erik never let that get him down, and he managed\nto summit the 7 tallest peaks on each continent, including Mount Everest by the time he was\n50 years old. Still that doesn\u2019t mean Erik is anywhere\nnear satisfied, and he keeps training to top his already seemingly impossible feats every\nsingle day. KYLE MAYNARD\nKyle Maynard is without a doubt one of the most extreme and determined people ever to\nhave lived. Born with a condition called congenital amputation,\nmeaning in simple terms that he was born without any arms or legs, he\u2019s accomplished more\nwith zero limbs than most people with four ever will. From a young age Kyle was interested in sports\nand athleticism, and he\u2019s participated in mixed martial arts, published books, and possibly\nthe most unbelievable accomplishment he\u2019s ever attained, climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in\nAfrica, the tallest free-standing mountain in the world. Oh, and did I mention he did it without any\nprosthetics? Using custom-built equipment made for his\ncondition, Kyle was able to summit the mountain all by himself, setting an incredible example\nfor all of us who have a dream that might seem impossible in the process. SEVEN\nBangalore in India is a big bustling city full of all sorts of people, but among all\nthe people who get dressed to get through the day is the most unique man in the city,\nwho has made dressing up into a lifestyle. Seven is a man with an incredibly interesting\nstory. He only ever wears red and white, following\na tradition in his religious family who only wore white when he was growing up, until he\nhad to get a tie for work, got a red one, and well, the rest was history. Seven was the 7th child born to his parents\nso they had probably run out of names and just gave him the number, but he\u2019s taken\nit to heart, making his phone number, his license plate, and the number of buttons on\nall his red and white clothes seven! He\u2019s even gone out of his way to learn seven\nlanguages, which is more than most people could even name! Seven\u2019s entire life is centered around red\nand white. His cars are custom painted red and white,\nall his clothes are of course coordinated with the colors, and his house is full of\nan ever-expanding collection of fascinating red and white items. Whenever he\u2019s driving around and sees something\nred and white, even if it's something as simple as a ladder, he stops his red and white car\nto buy it. Seven became pretty famous around India, with\nhis color coordinated family and him appearing on magazine covers for their unique passion\nfor the match color scheme. For as long as Seven\u2019s around, Bangalore\nwill be a lot more colorful\u2026 at least, in the red and white department. RICHARD LUPKES\nRichard Lupkes has well earned the title of the biggest arm wrestler in the world. Weighing in at 315 pounds, most of which has\nto be in his massive arms, it\u2019s not hard to tell that his age isn\u2019t at all going\nto stop him from being someone you seriously wouldn\u2019t want to mess with. Richard began arm wrestling way back in the\n1970s, and after only 4 years he was ranked as the second best in the world at the sport. Several years and major victories later, the\nincredible athlete was scouted for a contract by WCW to become a professional wrestler,\nbut he ended up leaving the career in order to stay close to his family, which just goes\nto show that even the toughest of guys put family above all else. Richard actually retired from professional\narm wrestling in the 1990s, but unlike most athletes, he actually came back more than\n10 years later and despite being nearly 60 years old at the time, he was back on top\nof the rankings in no time. To this day Richard holds more wins than losses\nin his career record, and he continues to train to maintain his champion physique all\nyear round. SHAUN ELLIS\nBased on popular conception most people think wolves are some of the most fearsome and vicious\nanimals on the planet, and well that's correct! Shaun Ellis, however didn't heed the warnings,\nand decided to try and join a wild wolf pack himself. Known by many as The Real-life Wolfman, the\nBritish naturalist went into the wilds of Idaho and found a pack of Grey Wolves who\nwere caring for their young. By staying nearby and observing their ways\nfrom a distance, the wolves came to trust him over time, and grew to view him as one\nof their own, even giving him the incredibly important job of caring for the pups while\nthe rest of the pack hunted. Ellis ended up spending a full year among\nthe wolves, eating only what they ate. During this time, the pack treated him like\na wolf by feeding him and playing with him, but occasionally even by fighting with him\nif he ever broke the pack's wolf laws. After a year he went back to society, which\nmust\u2019ve been hard after pulling off something as out there as joining a wolf pack. The wild lifestyle wasn\u2019t something the\nincredible naturalist could quite leave behind, and to this day he works with wild and captive\nwolves. SULO KARJANAINEN\nHand feeding a one thousand pound grizzly bear might seem like the absolute quickest\nticket to an early grave around, but for Sulo Karjanainen, it\u2019s just another average day\non the farm. This 73-year-old Finnish man has become famous\nand renowned in his home country for his unique and frankly unbelievable bond with all sorts\nof large carnivores. He\u2019s affectionately referred to as The Bear\nMan in Finland, and he\u2019s even used by the country\u2019s tourism board to advertise the\nincredible wildlife and rural countryside of the Nordic country. Sulo runs the Kusaamo Large Carnivore Center\nwith his brother, a wildlife refuge that has been the lifetime home of over 20 orphaned\nbears, all of whom Sulo has the innate talent to bond with, and who seem to turn into puppies,\nnot predators whenever he\u2019s around. Sulo\u2019s even able to hand feed the bears,\nor share his own meals with them right off his plate. While you would expect a one-ton bear to be\nripping a person\u2019s head off if they were to get this close, when Sulo\u2019s around any\nbear they just lick him or try to give him a warm embrace. SPENCER SUDERMAN\nUsually when you train to fly planes, rule number one is doing everything you can to\navoid tailspins, yet when it comes to acrobatic pilot Spencer Suderman, it seems like he does\neverything humanly possible to perform as many seriously death defying tailspins and\nother incredibly daring maneuvers as he can. This daredevil pilot is totally obsessed with\npulling off inverted flat spins, which are less flying and more the plane falling and\nspinning rapidly while it\u2019s upside down. He\u2019s repeatedly set the world record for\nthe most inverted spins in a flight, always competing with the only person crazy enough\nto even attempt such a record: himself. He set the Guiness world record with an absolutely\ninsane 81 inverted spins, and still wasn\u2019t satisfied, following up in March 2016 with\nan even more unbelievable 96 spins, which means he had to complete a spin every 1.4\nseconds for more than 2 continuous minutes, exposing his body to extremely dangerous g-forces,\nnot to mention how hard it is so get out of the maneuver while still disoriented and upside\ndown without crashing into the ground head first. Somehow Spencer still isn\u2019t satisfied, and\nhe spends every day planning and training to not just break the record of 96, but demolish\nit, with a goal that other pilots constantly tell him is impossible: 120 consecutive inverted\nspins. But if there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s certain\nabout this fearless flyer, being told he can\u2019t do something only motivates him to prove the\nnaysayers wrong. STEPHEN WILTSHIRE\nIf you\u2019ve ever taken a vacation to a major city, you\u2019ve definitely got some vivid memories\nof the place, but Stephen Wiltshire takes that to a whole \u2018nother level. Stephen probably has the best memory on the\nplanet, at least for cityscapes. When Stephen was 3 years old he was diagnosed\nwith autism, and doctors told his parents it was very unlikely he would ever be successful\nwith the condition, but little did they know that this wasn\u2019t a condition, it was more\nlike a superpower. He has the incredible ability to draw any\nsubject perfectly from memory after looking at it for less than a minute, and that includes\nthe entire panorama of a whole city. After a quick helicopter flyover, Stephen\u2019s\nbrain somehow catalogs every little detail and saves it perfectly, allowing him to perfectly\nrecreate everything he saw onto a canvas entirely from memory for the rest of his life. He\u2019s drawn massive cities like London and\nJapan without a single flaw and he\u2019s one of the most famous and revered cityscape artists\nin the world today. Now that\u2019s a story that should make anyone\nbelieve that they can achieve  their dreams.", "vwspEiqg5pA": "hello welcome to the daily political tarot readings here on the black and orange channel

let's do this thank you so much for being here thank you thank you nancy appreciate it kathy anderson's here hello wonderful okay so we're going to start with march 23rd all right so we'll start at 15 30. okay 15 30. chris autumn you do your best you can't answer every question we're happy with what you do thank you chris thank you thank you i appreciate that sylvia madison has very ugly energy oh goodness thank you nancy kd hello ottoman everyone let's do this for sure yes actually it's more like 16 okay 16. all right hello planets okay so the um when you're talking about aspects between planets uh for what it's worth it's not really important for the general foreign general um but in in the way the astrologers do it's generally listed in order of inner most inner planet to most outer planet so it isn't so much mars square mercury it's mercury square mars that makes sense or it's going to be mars square saturn or saturn square neptune uh it's so the the closer the one is the that's the one that's usually listed first so uh levine a fantastic astrologer who's been in doing this for he has a lot of experience he's known this a long time and he was saying apparently he was saying that mercury is squaring mars three times in short order because of the retrograde so it went past it it's and it's squaring mars it squared mars for the first time when the insurrection happened which makes sense because squares you get a grinding the energy i asked marjorie orr because she would sometimes say she was she has the most positive takes on squares so i was asking her why she sometimes saw them as good um as opposed to just always negative and she said it is it is the grit that can create the pearl so if other things are good i get that but it's still the grit the grinding the the uh and mercury's communication mars is aggression can be aggression it's a god of war god of communication god of war messenger of the gods god of war and they're grinding up against each other and lo and behold trump said i'm going to go with you to the capitol and well protest and the protest got violent and difficult so apparently the first time it squared was the insurrection then it went into retrograde so it went back over that point and as it went back as it was going backwards we got the impeachment and we saw how that turned out and so now mercury thank evans has gone direct again from our from our perspective the planet looks like it's a retrograde of any of the planets it looks from our vantage point as if the planet's moving backwards which messes up the energy so mercury is going direct again moving direct again and it is going to square for the third time on march 23rd so three weeks from now so what is going to happen three weeks from now when mercury squares mars for the third time okay march 2013 it's not about the time that the um national guard is scheduled to to go delete the capital it could be court cases it could be more court cases more people indicted maybe people higher up um the court cases starting maybe some of the lesser ones could be code b let's see what else the cards say he was we listened to trump we were taking orders uh-huh yeah we you you carried these these you used these wands to kill someone and attempt to kill others including the democrats you were the message you had the message you had the message oh interesting for those who are new around here i get cups for democrats i get pentacles for republicans and then about nine months or a year ago i started getting the wands started splitting out as like the party of trump thank you chris thank you it helps a lot thank you uh so these are the weapons that the insurrectionists were using those are the democrats to huddle together this is the message that the insurrectionists seditionists were trying to spread and look at this it's just kings and queens in the republican party really you don't say let's see if there's any more information thank you for being here all right so is this because the the thing about any planet going retrograde is you can think of it especially mercury but you can think of it as um it's kind of like if you're going to leave your house in the morning all right and you've got you picked up your stuff you open the door you go to step out maybe you even take one step out and then you go oh wait and so just at from ease or what have you it's like you take a few steps backwards and you're like okay did i yes okay i did get my keys okay yeah i did put water down okay for the kit for the cat i thought i did okay just wanna make sure okay and now i can move forward and that's it's when when plants go retrograde they're going back over the same ground again and it's like did i leave anything behind did i miss something did i oh okay now we can move forward again so if the first square was the insurrection and the second square was the impeachment and the problem with the impeachment is mercury is in retrograde which is not good for communication for people being held accountable to be honest um or can be so with the third thing that the third and final time with with mercury going direct do tell us more oh do do uh does rat is listing the things uh to check for your life is a lot more exciting than mine that's all i'll say a lot more exciting than mine okay four of swords okay let's see what the other cards have to say that could mean a couple of different things oh thank you though chris tax reveal would make me happy dave impeachments are good insurrection bad yes fire battery pretty oh really really it ends in legal heartache who's got legal heartache look oh my gosh it's republ a republican who's sitting pretty you don't say um this was seriously traumatic including the center card this was seriously traumatic for the people who went through this especially the democrats who it's hard to live with this idea that someone has tried to kill you that's really hard and if if anything like that has happened to you never be ashamed or afraid of seeking help okay it's very important and you're not alone i there are any number of people right here um who someone has tried to kill them and something happened when i was very very very young so it's something that can sit and fester over long periods of time so it's but it's hard but don't be afraid of getting help don't be afraid of asking for help and you're not alone okay so but meanwhile in the middle of this republicans came back and still said there are republicans who came back and still said don't um not justify don't uh certify the election for biden really you're working on this really legal heartache right now we have legal quiet as a tomb right now it looks like they're going to get away with everything that doesn't look quite so nice that's legal heartache so i'll i'll see if there's anything else just because oh there's a justice card look at that oh and there's a communication card right beneath it let me just have a quick look just three more cards kathy anderson truth is out trump is out trump is a self-made poor man i like that that is true hello sharon yep trump is a self-made poor man you were a millionaire by the time you were eight because of your parents and you are so bad a business person you blew it repeatedly true aspie third eye every ounce of trump is one big one big walking lie okay communications really i wouldn't think see the thing is i'm a little dubious because like in three weeks really something will happen in three weeks that doesn't seem like it's very long until that something would happen oh do tell anything else that's because we're not used to biden being president with his new ag in place um i'm looking at this card and i'm literally hearing in my head giving aid and comfort to the enemy and that's they were trying to kill pelosi there were people people there to kill pelosi that's what that's just what's out there there's biden who is now president and who can and and have so he's he if even if he doesn't send merrick garland after them there could be other law enforcement uh they're very aggressive this is the i call this the loudest card in the deck because you can just imagine the galloping and the clanking and the the uh the whole the wind and the that's very aggressive so i like it i like it it's what it's saying will happen in three weeks it seems like it would be too soon to me but something along those lines i'll take it i'll take it all right all right 31 30. okay goodness i did go on about that for a bit didn't i all right 31 3130 did cpac hurt trump support because it was fairly embarrassing did cpac oh card's right off the top of the deck unusual unusual for anything to do with uh trump oh he definitely communicated fair enough fair enough let's see we've got here people are they that's a card of i'm exhausted and i'm tired of your belligerence and your message it didn't help it didn't help it's just more the same he just keeps coming out there even though there was the whole insurrection and people were arrested and he didn't have didn't pardon them and all of this stuff he's still swanning out there saying you know maybe maybe i'll go and i'll win for a third time i'll beat them for third time and it's like okay yay but you know my family's not talking to me and um you didn't help people and maybe i'm tired so it's not everyone who's walked away but there's some it didn't help him okay all right let's look how let's have a look at reality winner whoo man 33 that wasn't actually 34. there we go 34. reality winner all right reality winner will reality winner be released and or pardoned from what i i do not know the situation in depth my impression from what i've heard is that it was extremely unfair that the way that she was treated when compared with other things that have happened and and and so let's see here reality winner will she be released and or pardoned okay that's kind of two questions so let's do three for will she be released and three for will should be pardoned should be released from prison reality winner will she be pardoned okay well i've got a i've got a um pinnacle card but um it is my before all of this this was my favorite card in the deck because it's the card of generosity it's the card of helping the poor and the sick and the falsely imprisoned or the the unfairly imprisoned or prison length of stay or whatever the situation is it's it's a card of mercy so that's there will she uh more paper please says she's due out in november i think okay she be released okay watching [Music] okay there's i'm getting aggressive la um could be lawyers legal action something very very aggressive to get her out the card in the center is languishing in prison but that's good will she be pardoned there's biden i don't like that let me see if there's reality winner let me just do a reading on her i'm talking about reality winner reality winner will she be released and pardoned she is basically my understanding is limited but my understanding is she was a whistleblower who wasn't being listened to so she went to the press something like that all right it's reality winner what's going to happen poor thing just wants to go home it's very sad insult to injury justice ian autumn just popped in to say that the last three months you've been approximately 80 to 85 percent correct while other readers have not really been that close coming for me that's a really good time now to listen thank you i appreciate that thank you ian uh this does not look good guys this is serving out your time this is legal waiting please bless me sending her a blessing well that stinks okay hopefully it will get a better answer on this next question 39 30. that's very kind of you ian do you keep track hello crystal do you keep track craig she tested positive for the illness oh geez okay so i don't know will racial tension become better for people of color in our lifetime gosh i hope so will racial tension become better for people of color in our life come on people wake up racial attention that's the past now i was actually watching uh last night i have um i've actually been to monticello of jefferson's house and for some reason i was there twice and i don't know why i ended up there twice over the years but i i have been there twice and but it was it was quite a while ago and it's only in the last 10 years that they have finally opened some of the upstairs rooms so i never saw the upstairs room so when i saw a video last night that was you know a video showing off the displays and what they've got up there and then the dome room uh i was like oh i never got to see that i'll watch this loved it and the reason i really loved it was because they are finally fully fully explaining what the reality was there and the slavery and it's who spent the most time in this nursery this woman she had 11 kids a lot of them were children here they had a nanny who was a slave she was married to another slave but he was owned by jefferson she was owned by i guess the family they were separated for big chunks of their marriage when this family would go back to their own estate this slave couple enslaved a couple never had children why maybe because they didn't want their children to be slaves we don't know she was absolutely apparently from all of their accounts she was absolutely wonderful and as wonderful as could be to the kid the kids adored her she died before her husband and he was devastated and so he actually sat down and he carved a headstone for her and it is the only headstone at monticello for a slave do you know how hard it is to carve a headstone with all the writing on it yeah hard that is you did it so anyway but that's that is the story that's what was who was in this room it wasn't just the kids it wasn't just the slave owners it was the slaves and how this affected their lives they also on a slightly um slightly nicer note there are holes in the doors surprisingly kind of high up i mean surprisingly kind of high up like halfway up the one of the lower panels but it turns out they're cat doors there were holes in the doors for the cats because they had rats at monticello and what have you so the cats could get everywhere for the kitty anyway i thought i'd share that okay will racial tension become better for people of color in our lifetimes you know uh those who have been watching for a long time you know sometimes this is my sometimes it's a lovely card of a bright new day things coming to light too often it has also become my card of um white supremacy but that doesn't what this feels like it feels like we should we should be we should be ashamed and we should we should be ashamed of of what was done absolutely we should be ashamed of a lot of what's being done now but in in remembering that cruelty there are people willing to stand up and this actually feels more like this turning from being a card of white supremacy finally turning back into a card is what it should be which is a bright new day so it it feels positive things really shifting i mean even in this the the meaning of the cards are shifting so the very fundamental stuff shifting for the better so i am getting things definitely moving in the right direction so i am i am mim's transformation sun card wasn't there something else oh yes let's go down to reparations 47 let's say 47-15 will reparations for african-americans pass well partially i think that and this is so stupid so this is don't come for me i'm just gonna tell you um part of it is the wording the pr of it i know i know that's stupid i know it's stupid but uh it's like when people were saying defund the police well you and i know what defund the police means it means moving resources from arming police officers like they are swat every single day or quasi military and putting that money into social work uh people more familiar with with um just just very positive more more positive more let's lower the tone here medical help that kind of thing but on the right they have taken that there to mean defunding all law enforcement and letting the worst of the worst of the worst run free and as soon as i heard the word i'm using the word defund the police i knew it was like don't use that word don't use that word and and i reparations is still i think i know it's stupid but i think they need a different term for it i know i know i know but if you if if it's a way to help people would calling it something else really matter really you could call it re-rebuilding we you could call it um support or infrastructure a type of infrastructure economic infrastructure something economic infrastructure how about that reparations or whatever they call it no reparations um that old expression stick it the stick it to the man that's the man authority as it has been disappointment talk of it disappointment uh if before we get to things like reparations could we get to equal voting equal rights that would be that would be great k thanks legal decisions love your brother love your sister love each other i'm not getting reparations here what i am getting is more of a moving make decisions that move to more toward illegal equality to start um preparations yeah because so much was stolen from them institutionalized racism well i do have a justice card here so there's some balance there i i'm not getting a whole lot but i don't think it's a done deal i don't think it's like a never i don't think so but sorry i wish i had i wish i had better i was getting better energy on that one okay 53 oh the q-nuts the q-nuts in their those little q-nut cases um as trespassing in your home oh my goodness goodness hey sienna sienna rose metaphysical is in the house thank you she is so great i have had both a reading by sienna rose i've had a reiki healing both were fantastic i highly recommend sienna rose she is great she is up in canada and um i cannot cannot recommend her services more so anyway okay sorry 54 i need to get back to this though okay are the q-nuts going to give are going to cause trouble on july 4th well the q-nuts cause trouble july 4th the q-nuts 4th of july my grandmother's birthday uh this is a lack of i mean this is republican not trump stuff but it's still uh it's a lack of energy power money see we got here quiet all right there's some republican funding oh look who's in the middle it's the idiot what idiot you may ask you're new around here that would be trump uh fruits of labor i'm not getting 4th of july i'm getting trump being a pain surprise probably you know running the the soup his super grift and whatever else i'm not getting the i'm not i'm not getting them acting up in any i'm not getting a tower i'm not getting a a night i'm not getting uh there's a whole there's a there's a whole there's there's some well this is like walking on a golf course levels of exercise here other than that it's standing sitting um a statue sitting yeah so unless they're gonna have a sit-in i'm not seeing it uh jam dave they keep making new dates to keep the myth alive yep yep indeed all right 56 30. will fema get better at emergency response uh and i i know most i know most people um oh thank you sienna uh i know most people uh probably know this but i just thought it was so fascinating that whenever there's a hurricane speaking of fema whenever there's a hurricane and fema or the red cross are having to respond um they they informally judge the or semi-formally judge the severity of the storms they get in the south and east based on if this restaurant chain called the waffle house whether or not the waffle houses are open because in that chain they will they want to stay open as long as possible and they offer for food and you know warm food and coffee to emergency workers so there is literally somebody who phones around to all the waffle houses in the area are you open are you open are you open it's very clever i feel like the last to close so fema will fema get better at emergency response people hurting people scared people worried uh yeah under under the orange menace there was let's just say that people's needs were not exactly top priority in the government there's new sheriff in town oh yeah this this feels like if it's not new regulations it's new policies because if we have a new president that when there's when people are displaced and there's chaos and flooding and you name it these are policies it feels like these are policies because things have changed now before now and in the future because we have a president who cares because elections matter yeah i i think they i think technology in general is going to help them but um kathleen autumn have you eaten i was sending you energy because i usually do and i feel dizzy and aware of my stomach either nerves or need food uh nerves nerves i'm okay though thank you sorry if i made you ill fema yeah i'm doing some i'm doing some recordings today and then i've got some other stuff hanging so but i'll be okay thank you hey is frosty being here mr and mrs frosty bean hello thank you for your help it's become my night camera my evening recording camera perfect thank you okay communicating uh looking at the globe how do we get people here organized technology is going to make a big difference in fema in the future see here yep yep they're going to get funding they're going to um this is before that's the center funding is as long as you don't put republicans back in place because when they're when it's about when you're around them the republicans you end up with a lot of people out in the cold i mean i'll see if that's if that's make sure that's what that means fema response definitely taking action organizing funding in the worst of the worst this energy doesn't feel great and we just went through that massive those horrible horrible storms this is future and i'm wondering if we're thinking hurricanes or tornadoes or floods or it's not going to be an easy year but we don't we don't have less co2 in the atmosphere we're not um we haven't fixed climate problems kathleen don't worry about me it'll fade sending you reiki oh thank you that's very kind thank you i appreciate that you guys are so sweet you guys are so sweet anyway okay 102. now back to the back to the the trumpster fire meanwhile back at the trumpster fire why did the trump storm get vaccinated in secrets in january oops did we did we not mention that jeanette's saying other readers have seen earthquakes in the fall okay well hopefully nothing too bad i am honestly i've never been in an earthquake i'm pretty sure that would freak me out i hear that actually the ground actually like moves up and down oh boy why is anybody i mean when i spent time out in phoenix um it was like you know when it's warm in the winter it's like oh i can understand why people are here and then when it's 115 degrees for three months it's like why why why is anybody living out here why you going to get in your car and literally the glue holding the the upholst like the whatever that upholstery fabric whatever it is is is literally like falling you get in your car and you're pushing the this your bits of your car back in place on the inside because it's so hot it has melted the glue why are you there why do you live here jeanette's saying grew up in california by the last one i didn't even get out of bed okay anonymous it moves under your feet like a rolling pin rolling under you oh jeez mims earthquakes are better than hurricanes and tornadoes tornadoes yes tornadoes are pretty much as bad as it gets um yeah you do not no um tornadoes no no and uh i've had i've had a tornado go like right there most terrifying thing this guy went bottle green and it was right anyway anyway so where are we oh we're looking at trump i'm sorry oops okay 1 0 5 30. okay yeah okay oh did they did trunk it back trump and animal and the trumpster fire and ava braun did they get vaccinated back in january just forgot to mention it huh [Music] oh yes come give us the shot but we can't tell anybody because we're not and we're not going to show weakness because he remember he's immune now that he's had it because that was his thing that you just you don't let it mess with your life and you just get over it and now i'm immune if you're not yeah get the yeah medical care he's just so awful why did he keep his secret it was all political this is this is now this is this is how he sees fauci by the way but now the democrats are moving forward and getting vaccines and i don't know it feels like we're back in reality which is nice he's he he didn't tell anyone because he's awful and a liar and the walking embodiment of all seven deadly sins and i cannot stand him i don't hate anyone but i despise trump 107 107 30. will chris ray be replaced by june june 2021 oh my gosh katie i saw saw mount st helens blow the second time back in 1980 talk about energy changes wow oh my gosh i'm glad you're okay man i remember that and i remember people were scooping up bits of the ash little vials like sharing it like at schools it's actual volcanic ash super super fine powder chris ray chris basically are you on your way out of here oh this those republicans today fishing for information oh so um do you uh how how good is the tracking of cell phones about who was where and communications um yeah what kind of information do you already have about that really please okay this is a card of it's a card of refusal and basically in it since i get cups for democrats there may be something where he's uh not being there may be something coming up where he's not going to be as nonpartisan as he should be i don't know let's have a look this seems like a lot of sweating going on oh big legal stuff coming all right we know what he's been through and he does have the fbi there's biden isn't the fbi supposed to be one of those jobs where you have it for like 10 years so it spans different um president presidencies alright aggressive law enforcement as long as he's doing his job it feels like he's doing his job any other was ignoring emotional appeals and doing his job or he does something that is sort of right wing but he he's it feels like he's getting the job done i had justice in the center of the other card this is america um democrats empowered republicans out of power legal heartache our forensic accountants and people can get into computers during law enforcement investigations and i don't i i it feels like he's going to be there a while so sherry mueller stayed on a few more years when obama became president as a request from obama well it i i'm it it there'll be some you know i think it's just normal kind of mirror i want this but uh but la but or maybe merrick garland will have some issues with the way that rey is doing some things i but it doesn't feel it doesn't feel like he's you're out of here jack enjoy life ray said he was holding up releasing info to congress because of the durham ongoing investigations marie he said the virus was a hoax i'm not saying he should be there but let's have a quick look since we're at 113 113 let's ask about those republicans asking rey some suspiciously possibly self-serving questions the republicans asking interesting questions of christopher wray today uh nervous boys testing the waters they're so trying to cover their tracks slime bags so [Music] in general do they those those asking this suspicious questions those in congress who help the insurrectionist encourage the insurrectionists will they get will they be held accountable will they be truly held accountable for what they did they'll cooperate with investigations as much as they absolutely have to bye but politically wedded to trump big endings wait wait wait wait wait but i but but but but but but but see we were we were we were in there with them we were we couldn't have possibly politically wedded to trump and a chapter end of book forget it but but but but but but but it's infuriating oh no go away sorry something just pop up on my computer it's infuriating okay that's right the butt butts yes all right who is this madison cothorn madison oh him member of the republican party representative for north carolina's 11th congressional district born august 1st 95 in north carolina he's 25. handsome guy in the evil kendall kind of way and women are alleging sexual misconduct huh okay him eeps all right madison cawthorne are your lies going to be enough to get you booted i assume the lies have to do with the um harassment charges is my guess oh his latest lies about how he ended up in the wheelchair wasn't he in a car accident or something i don't know but this is this is a tough one this is a tough one because being in a wheelchair stinks but potentially abusing your power it doesn't give you the right to potentially abuse your power jeannette lies about everything yes said friend left him to die friend dragged him out he i don't know i know he's talked a lot but politically he feels like small potatoes i don't know if that's true but and i know he talks on the the right a lot but he just it he just doesn't feel very important um legal heartache um the harassment allegations may be more the um terry lied about getting into a military academy kd just because you got hurt doesn't mean you can hurt other people yes exactly um he's he's been kind of entitled guy and um he needs to worry about this because this ending this is not these are not good cards to get if you are a republican who's being accused of sexual harassment [Music] those are not good no that's not what you want because that means the power is not with you if i get anything else on this jerk du jour right wing jerk du jour and we get the term right wing from the congress convened it's basically at the start of the french revolution but the the the only insults i know in french are things i don't say on this channel [Music] i think dude needs therapy i think he needs a lot of it i think he's got a whole lot that he needs to work through that's what it's very thank you clarence uh yeah there's a whole lot he needs i keep getting at least some legal cards for him is he still involved is this just the harassment stuff is there some legal stuff there no keyboard he's going to stay as a republican [Music] he's he's got some he's got some um some troubles ahead of him but mostly what i'm getting is dude there's still a chance you could have a long happy successful life i have had a lot of therapy in my life i have not gone through what you've gone through everybody has their own things they've been involved in jeanette also involved in the insurrection is he also involved in insurrection but seriously there's no shame in getting help it feels like you need help do it for your kids do it for your future wife do it for or if you're married i don't know do it for yourself get some help no i'm serious [Music] hang on william's saying autumn he's a dumper and acts like a mini me well he's he's got trump right here in this center i'm just seeing if there's anything um he doesn't feel well i shouldn't say that [Music] i think there should

brand-new bomb wings from used brainy a period what's good beautiful people it's a girl here back again with another live video featuring us for the first time welcome and if you are attending thank you so much pitching back in so you guys have you been inside so actually I'm going to be showing you guys how I made this wig from used braiding hey now in December 2019 I had this braids and I really love them I love the color but when I went back to repurchase the braiding here it wasn't they so I thought to myself I might as well just turn the brains that I had into a wig and how er so we started NIF ado let's get into the video please don't forget to Like comment and subscribe so chain the family and I'll see you guys my next upload you want to start off with the dome cap and then I'm going to take my crochet needle that I also got from the beauty supply store and with the crochet needle I'm just gonna pull it through the dome cap to grab the hair that I fold it in half then pull through their hair and then take both of the strands and pull them through the loop that whoever really creates it if that was a bit too fast for you don't worry I will leave timestamps in the description box down below I will also repeat the step in case you didn't get that part I know a lot of people are about to ask me why I thought of this idea so in December when I had these braids right everyone keeps on complimenting me oh my gosh it's all your braids are so nice I'm like thank you and then I decided that I would make a wig what the hair but then when I went to the beauty supply store to get the head they said that they were out of stock and they didn't know when they were going to get stock so I immediately said that when I cut these braids I'm gonna keep him so I can make this week so here we are making a wig and I think it's pretty cool and by the way this is one of like the deleted folders that I managed to recover so I'm super grateful to show you guys that you do not need to buy expensive stuff just to have a cute wig I am making this wagon so it shows your wings so that's why I have my lace on that small pot I doubled this lace because it's on the thinner side and I don't really like that so now I'm going to sew it down my lace and make sure that your laces superflat Hills I used sewing pins just to ensure that it's flat I could have easily made this into a frontal it will of looked so much better but do you guys want me to make the exact same weekend so friends oh because I still have a little bit of parades left that I hate to make a different wig from that if you have like more than three centimeters of lace remaining make sure that you try and keep that because sometimes you might need the lace you never know so right now I'm putting the wig on my head and making sure that it's in the middle so that I can mock my middle part using a white liner this is I'm optional but because I didn't want to have like a free parting that would have been so much work that's why I did this if you guys can see I still have some hair left from the last time I did my braids so I'm just going to separate that I'm not really fluffing the ends because I don't see the purpose of fluffing the ends I don't know I could be wrong but I really do not see the purpose so right now I'm just crocheting the outside edges of my lace because like I said the lace is on the thinner side and it can unravel on the ends and I just really do not like that so that's why I'm crocheting the outer ends just to make sure that everything is nice I am using the invisible parting message to make sure that my list looks and very very natural over the colors off anyways you want the section some hair not too much because we do not want to have big knots and then you're going to take your crochet and try to get as close as possible to the white line or whatever line you creates it you do not want to get on the line because that will just mess up your parting I'm going to perk my crochet through the lace and then grab the loop that I created by folding the hair in half and then grab only one strand and then just pull it through to make sure everything is tight if you do not get that I will repeat that again once you have they fold it over your finger you want to pull through the crochet needle and grab onto the loop that you have created and then only grab one strand and pull it through then make sure that it's tight by just pulling it through with your fingers consider the stay up throughout the entire lace you don't have to do it throughout the lace but I mean it's just easier and it will give you like a very natural Evie because I do not make the wigs for anyone else at this moment I'm already thinking about how natural it has to be so I'm saving myself from plaid cane I'm saving myself from all of that good stuff well not so good stuff kids plucking is actually a nightmare but anyways I am not bulking the hair I'm not putting see much here I'm also taking into consideration that I do not really want to pluck so when you crochet they hear you wants to make sure that you put as much as you want and you leave out as much as you want I don't know if I'm making sense but I hope I am you guys will see in a second now what the invisible passing method does can you guys see like it looks like I've got multiple pots I can do that method over and over again throughout the entire lace but I just do not have that kind of energy okay so after we have appreciate down the parting you want to make sure that the second robe is as flawless as the first one because that will determine how your lace will look and how natural you lace will be if you are a beginner I would suggest that you try and crochet your hair and rows so basically in a straight line this will give you an idea of like the next time you once you do your hair you don't really have to do it that way but I mean I still do as to use that way it's much easier and it's less frustrating you don't have to take your wig off and on just to make sure that you've got everything in oh damn so right now you guys can see that the band of the wig cap is not really crocheted doesn't really have enough here so I'm just going to go in and crochet some here I'm not really fussy about this part because it's gonna cover up with the hair that's on top anyways I'm that type of person who feels bulky waves with their entire life so you guys will see that I'm not putting too much hair around the closure which is not right because my closure ends up looking a spa's which is a little bit weird okay but I rather have as a sparse weight than a bunkie wake I don't know if I'm making sense but I really don't pretty much here I know this hair looks very full of missha's but that's because it's Kalei from the twists that I had I will shade from the wig I also tried - like creates natural curls in this wing which I did not show in this video but if you guys would like to see that video make sure that she saw me in the comment section down below because my mannequin head still has some hairs on it I decided to put a stocking cap before I turn the wig upside down so now I'm going to crochet on the stitching and that's on the elastic band do you not crochet an elastic band it will restrict your wig and it'll also make you wig a little bit smaller that's something that we do not want some crocheting when I'm creating this area and put in both of the shams through because there's no need to do an invisible party this is what the hair looks like after one's done and it's a little bit crazy but I went off camera and I played around with it a little bit and then the final look is straight to it okay but this lace I didn't really want to do too much I didn't want to glue it down I didn't want to do anything so I cut away the dome cap that's on the lace and when I put her on my head I can still see the stocking capitalists bothering me I didn't have the space perfectly I didn't cut it to the way I would have liked it to be at but it's okay if I glue it down it will look very very realistic but I mean the color would have looked realistic to me okay okay okay let's stop even taking this so right now I'm using my foundation brush and some foundation just so can the up the lace and make sure that everything is really natural as you guys can see you can still see the stocking cap suffered some foundation on my stocking cap so that everything camouflages I put the stocking cap closer towards my hairline because I really really felt so irritated by that line of demarcation that she could see I mean there's ways to fix this I'm using the bald cap near there but I wasn't even willing to go through that process and everything oh my gosh it's such Jade for predecessor came see you guys can see when I style my hair and when I pull the hair back you can't really see the dari\u00e9n cap although we've got like a little bald spot that I have to fix but you can't really see the bald cap so even when the wind blows people will see that wig you guys know that will you look yeah I don't like it but other than that that's all I did to make this way [Music]", "Ptr_9pIP7pc": "[Music] hey beautiful people welcome back to my channel so in today's video i'm filming a dab powder nails at home using acrylic powder so what i'm going to be using is a top coat base coat uh nail clippers files and a buffer a bond to clip my nails just to protect my nails i'm also going to need a nail glue i'm going to use the acrylic powders i'm going to be using i'm going to use the clear acrylic powder and also the red acrylic powder and i'm gonna also need a an activator just to harden my nails and i forgot what they call this thing and a i forgot the brush and up also cuticle pusher and also the tips nail tips so i already paved my nails off camera i filed them i also glued the tips so right now i'm applying the bond just to protect my natural nails i'm prepping them also to remove excess any excess oil [Music] so right now i'll be building my nail so i'm using um glue and this clear acrylic powder and i'm doing this because i don't want my nails to be too thin to a point where they break and i also don't want it to be too thick so i'm using um i'm gonna go ahead and do three layers of the clear and three layers of the red acrylic powder so right now i am building my apex and to do that i'm applying glue in the center so only on my natural nail so where my natural nail meets the fake nail so i'm only applying the glue there and then i'm pouring the clear powder over well on my nail so i'm gonna do that for all the nails and then after i'm gonna dust off the powder [Music] so right now i'm applying the glue in the middle so i'm only going to do this where my natural nail meets the fake nail till the tip and then i'm going to pull the acrylic powder over so i'm going to do this with all the nails [Music] oh so after dusting off the excess acrylic powder i'm going to apply another layer of the glue so this time i'm not only going to do it on the center i'm going to apply on half of the nail and then apply i mean pour the acrylic powder over so i'm also going to do that on all the nails and then dust off the acrylic powder [Music] baby [Music] so [Music] okay [Music] so now i'm applying the glue on my full nails making sure that i don't touch my cuticle area and then i'm going to pull over the acrylic powder [Music] so do now that i'm done with the clear powder i'm gonna spray the activator just to harden my nails for filing so right now i'm going to find my nails just to smooth them out for the color acrylic powder [Music] [Music] so i'm going to do the same process with the red acrylic powder as well but instead of using the what you call it the glue i'm going to use a base coat so i'm going to apply a layer of the base coat i'm going to apply i mean pour over the red acrylic part off and then i'm going to cure my nails in the um uv lamp yeah so i'm gonna do that with all the nails [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm going to repeat the same process so i'm going to apply the base coat and then pour the acrylic powder over and then cure my nail i'm going to do three layers of the color acrylic powder and then i'm going to apply another layer of the base coat and then the clear clip pour the clear acrylic powder sorry about that and then cure my nail and often i'm gonna um spray the activator just to harden my nails and then file so the reason why i'm pouring the clay acrylic powder over is because i don't want to damage my the color of my nails [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] baby [Music] [Music] so after spraying the activator and waiting for it to sit for 10 seconds i started to file my nails [Music] [Music] okay [Music] along the way melodies and then after everything i applied the top coat just to give it that gel final look [Music] all right guys that's the final look that's how my nails looked after i was done with everything and that is it for the video i hope you guys did enjoy and i hope to see you in my next video [Music] bye [Music] you", "zoClnPUkGfA": "hey everybody so today I am here to talk about detangling natural hair so I realized recently that I don't have any detangling products like nothing to detangle my hair for you guys I followed my natural hair videos my natural hair routines and stuff like that you know that I always detangle in the shower on wash days when my hair is saturated with conditioner and I will go ahead and detangle that way and that works great however every time I wanted to change my hair in between wash days it was a total disaster my hair just gets so naughty so tangled so unmanageable and I pretty much just go ahead and do my home wash day routine I go ahead and wash and condition my hair and detangle in the shower like always so I wanted to see if I could find something that helped to get my hair more manageable especially between washes just in case I wanted to change up my style or do something different and I couldn't do that so what I did was I went on Amazon and I was searching for natural hair detangler is like the best ones and I sorted it by highest rated and I came across a bunch of different products with a lot of good reviews so I went ahead and picked out six of those products so these are six of the highest rated detailing products that I found at the time that I bought them all of these had a rating of 4 out of 5 stars or greater just wanted to do a kind of like a test with you guys I have not tried any of these products before I have not opened them I have not done anything with them I wanted to give you guys my first impression and show you well my hair how it worked and see if any of these actually work for me so really quick my hair right now I did wash it and I actually only shampooed it I did not put any conditioner in it I did not detangle it in any way shape or form so this is just clean hair and it's air dried and as you can see my hair shrinks up a lot and it's very very tangled right now I'm kind of nervous how this is gonna go I have never tried to detangle my hair in this state it's pretty much just like 95% dry and my so this will be interesting so I have six products and to make this fair I'm gonna go ahead and try I'm gonna attempt to separate my hair into six equal ish sections so I can use one product on each section and see how it goes so let me do that now these sections will definitely not be perfect because this is a struggle just trying to separate it oh my goodness so you guys see why a lot of the time I work with stretched hair that has been previously detangle because trying to work with this whoa this is a lot all right got one this is making me hat just trying to do this a little out of work whoo okay so finally have my hair divide it into six sections not the neatest but we're gonna work with it all right so let's go ahead and see what these products are talking about so first up I'm gonna use this oil calm detangler this one says it smoothes coils for soft tangle free hair adds shine and moisturizes strands made with pure shea butter the directions say to spray onto their hair section by section comb through and style as usual smell test smells good smells kind of fruity a little citrusy let's do it on this section all right so I have a bout of water I'm just gonna dampen this a little bit gonna spray on this coil calm detangler I don't really like the spray bottle just first thoughts it's kind of hard to spray it's a little slippery and then trying to press down it's kind of falls out of your hand so I don't like that I wish this were a squeeze bottle alright so I feel like I have enough so I'm gonna use my favorite brush that I use on wash days this is like my holy grail start from the bottom and work my way up here is the detangle section let's see if I can find my fingers through it oh well once Meg but other than that I can run my fingers through it so that's good so on a scale from 1 to 10 for the coil calm detangler 1 being absolutely horrible and 10 being like the best thing since sliced bread I would give this a step and a half a solid 7 and a half because it really did do a nice job but the thing I don't like about this is like I mentioned the spray bottle it gets pretty cumbersome to use this especially if your hair is damp and you're trying to spray and hold and detangle it just gets too much also the smell is nice however I think they should tone it down just a little bit cuz it can be a little overpowering and it did help tremendously with the manageability I just wish it gave my hair more luster I feel like it didn't it's not looking as lustrous and juicy as it could and I wish I had a little bit more slip to it so those are my thoughts about that but holding on good products solid yeah next up I have the black vanilla moisture and shine 4 in one combing cream this says it is for dry dull and brittle hair instantly detangles deeply moisturizes and it says natural shine and preps hair for manageable styling I wanted to try this because I've tried some Carol's daughter's products in the past and I really didn't get good results from it but this had you know good ratings so I wanted to see if this was different because I've never tried this particular product we shall see in a second let's see what it says it says use on wet hair to detangle and add shine again apply on damp hair I definitely would not recommend especially if you have super kinky hair that draws up like this and gets really tangled I would not recommend just trying to put products on to dry hair and detangling it dry whoa that's a recipe for disaster so don't do that let's dampen this up a quarter-sized amount I don't feel like that'll be enough but I'm gonna start with a quarter and work my way to more if I don't feel like that's enough that's a little bit more than a quarter kind of like a quarter right alright so put that on really get those ears I feel like that's good let's do the figures through the hair test pretty nice I like how it makes my hair feel springy it makes it feel really hydrated I like the way it makes my hair feel I definitely feel like it has more slip than the first product and I just like how it feels overall this is good it did take me a little bit longer for me to detangle this then the first section but I feel like despite that it better if that makes sense and I'm not sure if you guys can tell but my hair looks a lot more lustrous with this than this one so I am pleasantly surprised by the four and one combing creme this did detangle nicely my hair feels amazing it feels moisturized I like the packaging I like how its dispensed for my rating for this I would give this an 8.5 this is good stuff if it would just penetrate my hair a little bit faster give it a tiny bit more slip that would increase my rating but for the way it is right now extremely decent see why they gave it high marks and I will give this in 8.5 okay product number three gonna do this section the Tahitian gardenia flower and mango butter curl defining detangler this says that it detangles add shine and hydrates to enhance curls and the directions say to you spray onto damp hair and comb through style as desired my hair feels so dry without any conditioner in it geez alright so let's try this pearl defining detangler oh this is another one I don't like spray bottles for detanglers I'm just not my hands are wet slip it down it's hard put some more here this is a headache just off the bed I don't like the way this makes my hair feel it feels like I'm just spraying on water that has a little oil in it it just doesn't feel like it has slip it doesn't feel manageable I'm gonna try to detangle through this let me put it a little more on my ends I don't like this I'm hoping it's no I'm going to use a little of this Carol's Daughter on this section I'm just gonna stop with this to finish detangling this and I'll tell you my thoughts the curl defining detangler I do not like this product at all I don't like the spray action and I didn't like the way it made my hair feel when I sprayed this on it made my hair feel rougher than it did dry I'm not sure how that's even possible but I didn't like the way it made my hair feel wasn't a good detangler for my hair didn't help that much it helped a little bit but it was just not not good out of 10 I would give this a three like if I had to use it if it was a last resort I would use it but I would never buy this again alright credit number four we have the coconut and hibiscus kids extra moisturizing detangler another spray bottle yay saturate it with the water [Music] let's see how this is very lightweight don't know how I feel about that yet I like the scent it's light and refreshing but just from spraying it on I don't feel like it's doing a lot this says this mod moisture rich treatment detangles defines and tames children's thick wavy or unruly hair without grease enos restores luster to dry dull hair while conditioning applied to wet or dry hair spray it a good amount on this section let's see do you hear that that helped a little bit but not much this section is detangled finally this is another thing I went back game I know I said kids but even on the reviews that said adults were using it so I figured if it weren't for kids why would it work for me right it's just so like it didn't feel like it was doing anything to hydrate or to detangle my hair also I had to use quite a lot of this just to get my manageability at a level where I could actually get the brush through it the good thing about this is I like the scent and it does help to detangle but you're probably gonna have to use a lot of this to make a difference if you have hair like mine or if your hair is even thicker don't even think about it it makes my hair look pretty juicy but I'm not liking the feel of it it doesn't make it feel soft and luxurious like I would like it to it feels a little rough still so I would give the coconut and hibiscus kids extra moisturizing detangler I would give this a four for me number five we have the great detangler I immediately was drawn to this just because of it says the great detangler so it's like you know that's a bit clean it says it eliminates tangles on contact softens hair and defines curl pattern stops breakage while combing curly kinky coily and wavy hair so the directions say to use on wet or dry hair and apply a liberal amount use fingers to work the product through the hair to loosen tangles and use a medium to large tooth comb to detangle that much my hair still feeling a little rough with this a little bit more work it in it actually does detangle pretty well and it worked to smooth my hair however I'm not I'm not liking too much the way it's making my hair feel it feels like it has a lot of product in it but at the same time it doesn't feel like it is moisturized it doesn't feel nice I just don't like the feel of my hair with this I wouldn't buy this one again either even now that I'm getting to the end my ends feel rough with this so for this I would give it a 5 it's not terrible but it's not great either and the last products we have to try is the kinky curly knot today this has been out for so long I've been wanting to try this for ages and I've just never tried it but I've seen it for years always passed by it alright so this says can't get that comb glide through your hair well not today this creamy herbal conditioner is enriched with botanical extracts and is designed to smooth the cuticle and to remove nuts snarls and tangles from thick curly hair all right nice and creamy definitely makes my hair feels like a head slip and like it's moisturized so I really like that but as far as a detangling action I felt like it could be a little bit better it wasn't torturous but it wasn't as easy as I thought it would be and as easy as a couple of the other products I just tried but it's certainly a decent detangler and it did help to get my hair a lot more manageable and what my hair does feel nice with this it is pretty coated so I feel like if you use this too much you might get a lot of product build-up with this but not bad at all so for the kinky curly knot today I would give this a I will give this a seven a solid seven just want to show you guys really quick I put the formula on combing cream all over this section just to show you how manageable it is right now and I can part it super easy and it's just really springy and bouncy feels really good so just want to show you okay so recap the two detanglers that I like the most worthy Cantu shea butter for natural hair oil con detangler and the Carol's Daughter black vanilla four in one combing cream with the combing cream coming out as the winner this is the one that surprised me but it came out as the one I like the best out of the six detanglers for natural hair that I tried the one that I like the least is the natural mothers Naturals Tahitian gardenia flower and mango butter kernel defining detangler this did not work for me at all so these two I will definitely keep using the other ones I'll probably give them away to somebody that could use them but yeah I'm really happy that I finally found some detanglers that I can use because I would never have been able to done this between wash days or if I hadn't previously stretched my hair to get it sleek and up like this easily that would have crap and so I'm really happy that I have some things that I can work with now so I hope this was helpful to you guys you guys let me know if there's any detangling products that you use that I haven't tried or maybe the ones that I have tried let me know what your favorite is let me know what works for you you know just leave them below in the comments thanks for watching guys and I will see you very soon on my next one bye", "CikkZ2-8iTI": "hi everybody I forgot to shoot an intro for this video so I guess I have to do it this way we are going to start by applying my Revlon concealer to my eyelids just to make sure that when I apply my eyeshadow the pigment is you know on point because as you know women of color we do need to kind of conceal our eyelids because sometimes the pigment of the eyeshadows don't come out the way they should because of the color of our skin which is not exactly fair but hey it is what it is so I'm taking this flat concealer brush and I'm just distributing that concealer evenly across my eyelid I'm now going to go in with my favorite eyeshadow palette guys I do not know where I got this eyeshadow palette because I just got it like that I don't even buy the whole set I think it was a same I just got um the nude palette grief all of it I don't know why I did that but hey I'm using my evil fluffy brush eyeshadow blush that I got from clicks it's a three set and I am going in with a darker color I'm now going in with my la girl Pro highlight palette and I'm going in with the flash part of it which is very pink and I am going to start applying that in my crease and I'm just bringing in that pink I'm going in with my pointed eyes shadow brush just to add a little bit more color in a very controlled defined way just remember when you hold your brush closer to the tip you apply more product and when you hold it further you apply this product I am going in with a fluffy brush I think I bought from an old eyeshadow palette I've never let it go because I love it I'm going in with the sparkly pink which is from my HD chrome eyeshadow palette I got it at least I will be sure to put all the product of everything I am using in the description below I'm not going in with a darker shade of pink which is very very sparkly I was obsessed with this think I've never used it so I was really really excited and I am applying this on I am applying that on my lower eyelid I'm just going to blend it up using a little bit of my brown and I'm adding a little bit of more smokiness just a little bit more using my fluffy brush I am now going to apply my eyeliner this is a horrible way to apply your hair your eyeliner by the way but it works you just pull out your eye a little bit and you just apply a straight line it does get a little messy but it's nothing that you can not fix you know there we go you got your you know you got your wing you see say well it's really really easy but that's not the correct way to do it like at all but it works if I'm doing poriyal and I'm going in with that tank again just to add a little bit more color and just fix you know I'm sort of a mistake that I have made like in the corner of my eye as you can see to not do what I just did but it works and I applied my eyelashes off-camera of course these are plenty clashes I'll be sure to put the name of these lashes in the description below I am now trying this new technique that I saw on Instagram and I'm here for it you take a very very light concealer and you apply it underneath your eyes pretty much where everywhere everywhere you would highlight and for me that is the top of my lip underneath my eye on my lower chin my forehead and my nose I'm here for it this technique is so bomb so that's exactly what I'm doing I am using my ashes concealer palette you guys should be accustomed to it and I'm using my flat concealer brush of course I'm now going in with my ashes concealer also in a very dark shade and I'm just going to apply that everywhere I would apply my control which is my cheekbone the top of my forehead around my hairline you know I'm here for it and just you know blend it out just we're not really blending it out with distributing it in such a way that it actually makes change so just make sure when you do this you get all the spots right I am going to darken my [Music] contour using my la girl in express all because I didn't feel like that was dark enough for this technique I wouldn't normally do this but for this technique you do need your contour to shine through sir : a little bit darker is okay and I am using my favorite foundation of course which is my signature in caramel or signature liquid foundation in caramel oh I'm using my foundation brush which is my flat top foundation note my flat foundation brush and I'm just damping tapping the foundation on top of the work I have already done we shall not to drag your brush you just you know tapping it as we please if you drag it you're going to move all of that product around and all your hard work would have been gone through it so we're not doing that we are just tapping it on the foot breaking it up you know just take your time tap tap tap tap tap make sure you cover your whole face the way you would when you're applying foundation so that means your ears your neck you know the whole who are you not just tap it on guys do not drag auditors any as my earrings were ridiculously huge so I had to listen to get into certain areas but you know means anything that over-the-top unhelpful and if I am being honest this is heavy makeup it is really really heavy so this is not something useful every day no I was going out with the girls as you guys have seen a couple of my pictures on social media and you guys really like the look so I did it again for y'all you know not going in with my beauty sponge that of course stamp and I am just dabbing it on pressing that foundation and making sure it is long I'm not going to you know fix my eyebrows because when I was applying foundation I miss them up a little bit so that's what we're doing right now take your time you know make sure everything is fresh and I'm going to go in with this pressed powder from my Belvedere set which comes in I shadowed lip gloss blush and contact model I am just going to press in that powder everywhere I highlighted I kind of mix that yellow toned and orange pressed powder because the orange helps you know with the fish back because we do not want to be taking pictures and then we've got horrible flashback so that orange just tones it down a bit that yellow just make sure that my highlight is bright enough and I'm dusting it calls because I am not baking I'm just sitting there's a difference so I'm taking my favorite fluffy brush which I call my everything's brush and I'm just going to dust all that excess off my face I'm going in with my la girl palette and I am contouring sitting my contour with this angled brush from my brush pick of course if you guys have any brush tips that you think are cute because I need to get a couple more just put it in the comments please and I'm going around my forehead you know my cheekbones I lowered your line I didn't contour there but you know just makes it look more natural and defined I guess so just take your time making sure that you are set I'm going in with the very same contact pot I was using just to clean up my contour a little bit by applying it underneath it and dusting off the excess product now it's time to do the lips I'm going in with my disc cam pink lip liner and I'm just lining my lips since this look was kind of inspired by Kylie Jana I am going to over line my lips just a little bit just a little bit just a tiny tiny bit but you know the bigger you look look I'm here for it I am just shading in the inner corners and I'm lining the center of my lips that will just give my lips that appears that you know a huge you know early but it works in some weird way and just fill in there is a little slightly press them to give them I am going in with my came up a one lipstick in Rose something it will be in the description below I'm obsessed with this lipstick shout-out to Marissa cause you know she hooked me up with it now I am lending out my liner in my lipstick together I'm going to apply some cloth I am of sisters lip gloss it is Avon plumbing HD something I'm going to put it in the description below it makes your lips look huge even when you're wearing it by itself yes girl I'm here for it I am going to go in and add some blush and I'm using my Avon blush that I use also in my eyes hello pink and never hurt nobody a little pink I'm using my fluffy brush and now I am going to contour my nose I'm adding just a little bit of stock powder on the sides of my nose and I'm going to blend it in using my fluffy brush but you don't want to listen fake I'm not going to go in of course with my highlights are my favorite highlighter which is my ashes highlighter and yes that's what we are about look at that am i cute I want to go in with my la girl highlighter also just in the center on my nose and yes just using an angled fluffy brush is more than enough and you know means to never have too much violence so there we go that's a look and I am wearing this red dress that I got from the very same shop that I got my black skirt from from my last video and I told you guys it's in town it sells reject but you can also get this stress at new feelings Axio today I will be sure to put it in the description below my shoes are from solo of course and young they are like nude with strings of course some code details and I am obsessed thank you guys [Music]", "bmb6eLFovKk": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome back to another week on dollar creative TV so this week we are going to play with the plaster of Paris band Beach and I think that we are going to make some African pots so what we will need to do this is obviously our bandages will need some brushes and some of some acrylic paints and some craft paste and then I am also going to use the acrylic coarse texture paste and yes then we will also need a balloon and some thread and then of course some bowls to put water in with water that we will dab our fabric pieces in this before we continue I need to tell you about the additional dollar products that I've used in this project I had so much fun and just got carried away so I also used la style regular plaster of Paris smooth texture paste and chalk markers the chalk markers did not quite work out as I planned and I'm going to leave this step as part of this video on what to do when you use the medium and it does not work out for you I like to use paints and mediums in unusual ways but sometimes there is even a limit to my thinking so let's get going and make beautiful pots first we are going to blow up the balloons for this part you will need someone to help you tie the thread around the end of the balloon [Music] with the not secured we are now going to push this part through the middle and grab hold of it on the other side once you got a hold of it you can ask someone to help you tie the thread around it so that it looks like this one this is going to be the basic shape we are going to work around to create our African box now this is where the messy but totally fun part starts cut the bandage into smaller pieces to make it easier to work on the rounded sides of the balloon to create our first pot we are going to take the small square simply dip it into the water and layer it over the balloons starting at the top lightly rub it to ensure that the plaster of Paris falls all the tiny holes in the fabric I am going to overlaps my fabric pieces the same as with paper mache I am also going to do two or three layers to make sure that my pot is sturdy even though these pots will not be waterproof you can still use it for dried flowers tweaks or even leaves of course you don't need to fill it with anything and just use it as decorative art [Music] I just love how silky and smooth this feels when I rub over it this is the first time I'm working with this product and it is really easy to do you cannot really go wrong anywhere if your fabric Falls and sticks together and it's not easy to open it up use it just like that in a double layer just blend it in with the other pieces by rubbing over it [Music] I'm going to do both top halves of my pot and let it dry completely before I do the bottom while I wait for the plaster of Paris to dry I am going to cut rims from board papers to finish the top of the pot I've already cut the rectangular shape that I'm going to use for the one pot and for my second pot I've cut a rounded shape okay so the pots are dry they have three layers of plaster of Paris bandage over it to make it nice and strong and now I am going to show you how to add the rim to the top I already completed this pot and it is ready for painting you can see that I've already added the rim to it and I've already covered it with the bandage but don't fear I am going to do exactly the same with the second pot I had secured the rounded shape with packaging tape to make sure that it stayed intact packaging tape is glossy and I don't want to run the risk of my cluster of Paris bandages lifting from this tape so I'm just going to cover it with some masking tape like I always to win our work with my air dry clay sculpture [Music] I am going to place it on top of my pot and Mark the position with a pencil I am NOT concerned if it is not exactly in the center and once I have marked it I am going to use a cutter to cut away the excess of the plaster of Paris work very careful especially if the pot is not completely dried for now I am just scouring the plaster of Paris to ensure that my pot does not right now just remember that while you are cutting your balloon might just pop and catch you by surprise very carefully you can trim the edge of the opening to the pot it is very easy to cut the plaster of Paris even when it is completely dry we can then just shake out the dry bits of plaster and the balloon and it is as easy as death with a hot glue gun I am now going to glue the rounded rim to the top of the pot work very fast but be careful not to burn yourself the glue dries very quickly and we need to secure this rim to the top of the pot before it does then hold it in place for a few seconds to ensure that it stays in place and when you look at that beautiful African spot I have never used plotter or Sanders bandages before and I'm really impressed with what I've done so far I am going to cover the rim with plaster of Paris bandages so that it matches the texture of my pot [Music] and there you have it our second part is done now I have to think of ways to paint and decorate the pot this pot is going to be painted with a layer of plaster of Paris I've mixed it into a liquidy paste and I'm going to paint the pot with it make sure to work fast because the plaster of Paris dries quickly when the paste is too sick to paint just add some more water [Music] you can add as many layers as you want to one layers was enough for me to resemble a handmade African spot with the rough texture you can only get from the handmade clay they use in rural villages to paint the inside of the path I simply mixed plaster of Paris with water and some black ink to add liquidy paste and poured it in so that I can swivel it around until the inside is fully covered the reason I use plaster of Paris with my watering paint is because it dries very quickly and I don't have to worry about any pain running down on the inside of my box it also has a smooth layer to the inside of the pot you will notice that the pot is wet again and that is because the plaster of Paris absorbed all the water that are mixed with the paint just put it out in the Sun and let it dry again I've already painted bulk of the parts on the inside and they are completely dry you will see that I've also painted the bottom half of this pot with the coarse texture paint unlike the postage to paints because for me it looks very much like to meet the top half of this pot was painted with smooth texture paste and a palette knife I also decided that I would like to blaze the inside of these pots and for that I'm simply going to pour a pretty Glade into the pots swivel it around and let it dry [Music] I'm using a paintbrush to make sure that the glaze is spread evenly on this part I would like to paint some African patterns I am just going to follow my instinct and just draw like he with a pencil so that I know where to play you can decorate your part however you want you can paint this you can stencil on it whatever you would like to do it is up to you [Music] I am just drawing basic shapes the finer detail will be added later I want this pot to really make a statement so I decided to paint it a warm rusted dark orange with black and white [Music] to get my orange color i'm simply mixing red and yellow croc type [Music] I am going to paint the bottom half of the pot in this warm rich dark orange color [Music] [Applause] [Music] most of you already know that I like to use alcohol ink in my mixed-media backgrounds because I just love the dripping effect I normally mix dollars acrylic ink with rubbing alcohol to make my own alcohol in today I'm going to do something completely different and use dollars last time to do the drop effect on the bottom half of this pot I mixed some of the orange and the sepia color to make a rich dark warm orange color I also added a little bit of rubbing alcohol so that it can run smoothly and with more ease [Music] I do not want to solve all the pot too much because I do not want the drip effects to run in any other direction than downwards while I wait for the glass thing to dry I am going to take black craft paint and start painting in my pattern [Music] I finished painting with the black and I also painted the top half of my other boards with the orange the gloss paint is dry and I absolutely loved the glossy effects it has over the mess acrylic paint I am going to do the exact same effect on the top half of the other pot [Music] I love using this effect it is exactly how I wanted it to be I think what I like most about this technique is that you cannot really control the flow of the paint or the ink it is almost like taking a risk it's being fearless just a way to express yourself and I love it even more but it almost every time turned out to be perfect I also really liked the course bottom half of this pot and decided to paint the top rim of this pot with the same coarse texture paste to balance it out now I am going to use a white chalk marker to add some dots to my patterns and like I have said in the beginning of this video it was not a good idea and you will see why a little bit later in this video I could have easily edited this part out of the video but I wanted to keep it a part of the lesson to show you that not every product now matter how versatile it is can be used for everything that you want to do as this part of decorating the pot it seems to be working fine the chalk paint runs smoothly and I can draw really fine lines on my pot whether it is the first time that I'm using these chalk beans and I'm really impressed with the result but like I discovered a little bit later in decorating my pots it is actually meant for writing on a blackboard and you raising after you are done as soon as I wanted to paint some glaze over my decorated pots these white lines smudged as a quick solution I've thought of spraying it with artist fixative before I find the glaze then is turned yellow when doing art or craft not everything will always work out the way we want it to be but we can be innovative and creative and try to fix it and it's exactly what I did [Music] just look at my pretty African body while I'm waiting for the pot to dry I decided to paint the course bottom half of our first pot with some Crofton I am going to use a tan craft paint and I'm going to create an ombre effect with dark brown acrylic [Music] [Applause] [Music] I wanted this course bottom half to look like handmade clay that was made in the rural villages with mud [Music] I really like it I can see myself using this coarse texture paint many more times now this is the part where I realized that my beautiful white chalk lines smudged and turned yellow after I tried to seal it I wanted the top half of the pot to also be glossy and shiny like the drip effect on the bottom I've learned a lesson today and lucky for me my paint work has not been ruined completely and I can so save it I am going to paint the top part of my pot with the glaze medium because it's already been sprayed with fixative and I can no longer smudge the pace once the glaze is dried I will simply use my paint markers to fix all the lines and in future use my chalk markers for the blackboard [Music] the acrylic paint on my other pots is dry and I am now just going to paint the rim in the same time color as the bottom [Music] and just look at that a beautiful decorative piece of art that started out with plaster of Paris bandages and all I need to do with the pattern pot is to fix the lines with white and black paint markers and I did just that what I thought is to be ruined is also a piece of decorative art that I would be proud to put in my house I hope that you have enjoyed this week's lesson with me and I'm looking forward to next Friday bye for now [Music]", "exnIttC7CJc": "[Music] [Music] there is no messy for me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

and i'm just wrapping up a patron only uh all weekend long episode for our financial supporters so very many very many thanks uh to our patrons it is [Music] uh sunday evening our three plants and flower and the t510 are ready for some water and i am heating heated up some water because my reservoir is freezing so i don't want to give them cold water so here we go we're going to need 15 cups of water for our 15 gallons of plant mass i'm also trying to coordinate a little time away which will mean timing and not watering because i don't want to leave it to my roommate to water the plants this is my keeping track of when i water the plants so i just updated this says this was tuesday it's now sunday so the t5 plants in their five gallons are making it five days on a um on a watering um impatient i'm looking up for this so today's recipe i'm going to do half a capful cow mag this is the food we're using right now for early flower some sweet some sm90 i'm gonna do half a capful of our ph down because our water tends to be on the basic side in a ph check that's the yellow tennis ball color we're looking for this is the end of this plant and today we are untying it because we're not going to get very many new shoes since it's now in flower and so we really don't need that there anymore we're going to let that thing let this thing stand up so it's yeah one more useful flower this one was not super cropped where's the end of this guy oh this one this one got broken off i forgot that one turned into a unintentional clone because here is our hibiscus afghani so we're gonna just give these a little water to start with and kind of wet wet the soil and let them soak in a little before i hit them with too much here's our wonder cake looking wonderful hey guys we're gonna have a a good day today throw some stuff in a jar and go see our friend george for a shirt for michael who's contacted me with a shirt size so that should be fun i'm gonna go outside right now and let the ladies out and start my coffee i'm making my way back here to the back nine and i can see this little trail of mites now that i know what mites look like and some strands coming off of this avocado tree they are everywhere flying insects coming off of this this is again pretty ready for water see where that one is it's also ready these are also thirsty and i'm gonna guess the jack loser thirsty two i went into water right before i left to straddle my trip but that's not happening right now see how our pollen project's going oh yeah i see paula now okay so we might do that before we take off for our trip and try to shake this bag out i'm gonna let it go two more days but there's definitely some stuff falling off now finally yes sir everybody's dry so that's a good thing reservoir today as well this is where my filter water lives it's a 22 gallon rubbermaid tub okay here's today's recipe starbucks french roast half a cup of cow nag we're going to use this beastie bloom since some of these are probably halfway through flour maybe not quite but we're going to use some of this some sweet sm 90 half a cap half a kappa sweet ph2 yellow tennis ball color and then we're gonna throw just a dash of hydro guard in there that's for the roots that's the color i like to see threes get three cups of water two's get two cups of water these are also threes are totally neglected autos and i they probably don't need water but i think i'm gonna just give him one cup and let it run through everything looks okay in here otherwise i'm not gonna do anything these are gonna go pretty long on a watering this is the last of the jack glue strain super deformed looking plants this is our uh two our february harvest of four plants and two gallon pots very modest harvest these are african orange these are lemon jacks really good looking flowers they're just small and we are okay with that these are totally solar solar winter california flowers in little two gallon pots so we're happy so we're gonna do our african orange first be nice if they don't fall on the floor the penalty of doing things one-handed sometimes so i went four days on this but we had some really low humidity days uh the temperature swings in our dry space which is the garage we're probably as low as 57 and as high as 75 so not ideal a little slightly over dried evidence by this by this dust um but we'll scale it and we're gonna be happy with that and um put a humidity pack to a humidity here for hoosiers more one-handed dangers yeah come on yep 0.9 better than a sharp stick in the eye this is our lemon jack i suspect it's also a little over dried our lemon jack is also slightly over dried but less so so let's see how we do that this guy i think we're going to be right about the fan maybe just a tick over and one one three not bad we'll take it these little um two-way humidity packs are rechargeable that one dried out sitting in my box and i highly recommend these [Music] i should have a link for them they renamed them terpene shield they used to just be called 2a humidity control packs for humidors for cigars so i'm gonna stick one of those in each of my jars and start my month-long daily opening burp process to cure these all the way awesome so that's two ounces of outdoor flower in the middle of winter and this is where i keep my flower it's a wine refrigerator that's turned off right now because it doesn't really need to run but it gets hot in my room in the summer so and that's what i have left with my lemon jack from before this is what i have left of my lady orange from before and i'm out of jack blue already so i will just barely bridge smoking and i will just probably have a week of smoking not quite cured weed but not bad for the middle of winter off to go cgo george just changed the oil on el nino after boarding yesterday 347 724 well i'm back home sweet home i i chose we left george no cameo from george today um but i did get some flour to bridge my dilemma and i got three shirts for michael to pick from and i will gift the other two to somebody or bring them with me to arizona or sell them to somebody oh i like that one a lot i didn't open them there i mean they're all so good if you see his shirts there's really no there's no bad there's no bad choices so there you go green purple and blue or purple and other colors sometimes they go through sometimes they don't this one doesn't these are all independent those are all independent too all right so give me a shout michael gonna bust out a batch of jack blue cookies and then sign off for you guys

Amina if you're new to my channel welcome and if you're irritating subscriber welcome back and thank you for subscribing so today's video is a bit different we are doing an Aliexpress haul so I have heard a lot about any Express so I basically decided to jump on the bandwagon and get some stuff from Aliexpress because I never used it before so I was curious and I was a bit skeptical because I was like why are these things so cheap but I was like hey they cheap so might as well get some and see what it's like and stuff and I've watched a lot of reviews on YouTube about I did experience so I was in two escapes or like okay whatever let's do this and if you don't know what le Express is it's basically a website that is China based and basically they just sell everything like there's not really any specific things that they sell but then like you have like different vendors that you like shop with and stuff like this are like concentrated things like do it's a makeup or jewelry or stuff like that so you just have to like going through that and kind of figure out how to use it it's not really hard it's just like any other online store and there are people who basically do videos on YouTube about how to use any Express and how to shop on Aliexpress and if you guys like once a video like that you can just comment down below and I'll do one but I feel like it's like so many of them so I really don't need to do one but if you do you can ask me and I'll do it so let's just get into the whole so I'm gonna start with miscellaneous stuff basically everything I quote is miscellaneous like it's nothing important but it's like I have like a mixture of things so it's not like a specific type of thing like clothes or shoes or anything like that so let's just I'll just try and just go from there and stuff so the first thing I'm going to show you guys is this necklace it's basically this is like one necklace that is joined together anyway yeah so you know how people like like layering necklaces so basically like they had a necklace which is just naturally layered and yeah I liked it and it's cold and I used to hate go to rebut then I was like okay now I'm kind of I kind of started liking gold jewelry so I was like what better way than to just go on any experience and buy tons of gold cheap jewelry and then like once I see that I really like it then I can buy the expensive stuff right like the real golden stuff so yeah but anyway this is like it's just a simple necklace it has like little a little chain thing here which has little balls if that makes sense like it has like balls and stuff and then it's just like two circles like simple you know like you just throw it on and it makes the outfit look expensive so that's up and then the next thing I bought I'm just gonna go through my jewelry and then I'll go through there is some stuff so the next thing I bought were some hoops I got some gold hoops I basically I have silver hoops but they are not the size they like smaller than this and I wanted like a bigger size yeah a bigger size hoop so I got these hoops and they also in cold and they're very cute and the quality is pretty cool so yeah then I've got another necklace this is a a cardiogram results what is it yeah I call your gram so as I Commission you know like well most people know it as a heartbeat like a person will just call the heartbeats so it has like a heartbeat and I am hot and then another necklace I've got was a star and chain necklace and this one is also a layered necklace like this moon thing moves to the bottom just imagine that it's there because right now it's like stacks or whatever so anyway it's like a moon and star necklace it's also in gold so I got that and then I've got that see was this okay then I got another necklace and this necklace basically is a an a it's my initial which is an A as well as my husband's initial he's also in a so a is kind of like I would say my favorite guitar so yeah I got an 8 so that's it's evening and then so I actually bought more jewelry like another ear necklace which has like different steps with and things like that and auditory but then that jewelry hasn't arrived yet it's still gonna arrive so I don't know maybe I'll do like a part two to this hole when that stuff arrives and then like I'll just show you guys when it comes so yeah and then I've got so now that was all the jewelry for now and so like I show the underneath at Adam Hall so now I'm moving on to like random stuff excuse me the next thing I got was this brush kina it's a makeup brush kina and I've always wanted a makeup brush cleaner so I kind of saw this and it was like good really really cheap and basically I'm gonna try and link all these things excuse me I'm gonna try and link all these things down below or I'm gonna just write them and write the prices like these things are so cheap guys like these necklaces were probably like some of them are like five Rand or a trend or like they were just cheap so I was like why not some of them are like fourteen and I think okay I forgot I think it was like around 14 Rand 59 which means your end or something so yeah but this is a little makeup brush cleaner there's like a bigger one I think most people have seen it but I wanted to try this like I don't have a makeup brush cleaner I just like clean my makeup brushes using my hand so I kind of just wanted this professional thing so yeah and then I got a phone cover with a pop sockets so it comes like separated in the pack and stuff but I just put it on so yeah this is a phone cover and I'm obsessed with marble like I feel like a marble is just wood will never go out of style it's just it's beautiful so it was kind of scared to buy because I was like I wonder if it's gonna be like good quality but it's actually quite good quality it's like it's like a hard rubber if that makes sense yeah and this for this is for Samsung it's thin and then I've got some nail polish this is basically it is tiny it is absolutely tiny but anyway this is um it's Chow nail polish focus so yeah it's channel it uh English its gel nail polish only uh polish you can't really see the color this is like the base coat this is a base coat so it's just clear and then this is like a purple color so let me just show you guys the color it's like this color what am i shaking it's like this color so yeah so it's like a purplish color and then I actually have others that are still coming as well like other nail polishes and I'll show you guys those they have I have like clears her like a glittery wine and I have like a different like her I don't know what color it was like a nude it was like a nude brownish nude like this so yeah um and that's the nail polish cheese or nail polish how do you say that ignore me and then I've got some eyelashes these are the eyelashes they are so cute because they're like simple you know like they just they simple not dramatic and like they just they're just chill do you not I mean like they just relax they're not like doing too much and stuff so yeah I got these ones and they actually come with four in a pack there's actually four in here and they don't come with lash like you have to buy your own lash glue so yeah that is the laughs and then I've got some lash glue let me just take it off the packaging I got some lash glue it's actually like looks like this I have already tried it so a quantity charge it's like closed so I can't any charge like if it's good or whatever and like I don't really weigh lashes that much but hey so yeah so this was the lash glue that I bought separately from the lashes and then I've got some sunglasses because I am kind of on this tip of basically getting sunglasses because I'm like I don't know they make you look mature I think I don't know so yeah this is a pair of sunglasses that I got I don't want to try them on but hey like let's try them on so yeah these are the sunglasses like gods they are simple they're black they have just a little tinge of gold and they just they're not doing too much you know what I mean like some some sunglasses do too much and these are not doing so much so I like them so yeah these are the sunglasses ID cards and then I got another pair of sunglasses and these are like the nice ones they're so cute and like I feel like everyone knows these sunglasses it everyone has them so when I saw them in any experience and they were like how much were they I don't know member guys like these things were like cheap like it was like I don't know 100 grand no but yeah and the quality is amazing like I haven't said much about the quality of these things these things are really cool like the quality is nice and stuff so these are the second pair of sunglasses that I got and I like them I really do they are cute they are simple they are just me and simple I like simple things so I got these and then I also got another pair of sunglasses which aren't yet so I'll show you guys in that part two of the whole so then I also got some heat jobs and they basically came like early like they came before this stuff like this stuff came like at the same time but the jobs came like a long time ago so I kind of like forgot about them but anyway this is the first one and it is actually chiffon um I've been into chiffon scores lately and I was like trying to hunt down chiffon scars everywhere and everywhere I looked they were costing around like 200 grand a scarf and I was like I'm not about to do that I'm sorry I'm broke okay I'm a varsity students I don't have money for that so I was like okay I like chiffon I need to find it so I went hunting on Aliexpress and I found chiffon scoffs so this was the first one that I got it's like what is it a more what is this move the more pink pink I don't know but CJ we have borne that now where you can see you know so yeah this is the one stuff and then I also got this callous cough it's like hardly does it orange I don't know but like it's like neutral I don't know it's something but yeah you guys can see it so yeah that one and then I also got this like sort of brownish but once the olive green type of thing not olive green but it wants to be green with but yellowish I don't know nude whatever but yeah that's the third scuff that I got and then um those are the like three scoffs iPods and those are the only scoffs of import from Aliexpress and I was very impressed by the quality I am definitely gonna go back and buy more cuz so yeah and then the last thing I bought was this and a cap this hijab and so the last thing I caught was actually a lipgloss this it's called dnm lip gloss and [Music] how I feel about it is my face right now like I got cleaned they played me okay so anyway I'm okay so basically this lip gloss it looks amazing guys like the packaging amazing you look at its formula looks amazing when I put it on my lips did it not stick to my lips like guys it feels like paints like like it's supposed to be mad so when you apply it it's who and shiny or whatever and then you wait the time for it to become mats and it becomes meds and wow wow like it just it sticks onto your lips and not in a good way like it's it becomes try like a blue she tries the entire list and it feels like paints I like your lips are sticky and it's just his bed and like try taking it off oh my gosh I was I was like wow it's paint I initially believe this is paint actually I believe mrs. Bates but anyway that's just me so yeah this is I don't like this at all I did not like this at all so yeah this lipstick was horrible and everything else I bought skies I am absolutely in love with it I am shocked by the quality especially the price that I paid for it like literally I bought I think I bought like what was twenty nine items in total don't judge me okay I shopped at different times like I show up like like five items at that time five items ten items you know different size so in total it was 29 items and the total of those 29 items was about like 900 trend I could resist 900 and something R and that's how much I spent on everything so it's cheap guys like it's cheap and excuse me and um the quality is not bad you know it's not bad at all like it is not bad at all so I would recommend that you any expert oh I basically had a good experience with Elias right it's my first experience Aliexpress was good so I feel like if you want to shop Aliexpress you should go for it and if you have any like questions about like customs and things like that and whatnot I feel like you can just leave them in the description and I will not description in the comments below and I will answer and yeah I will answer it and stuff and yeah and if you guys are interested in this makeup look I actually filmed it so I don't know which video is gonna come up first either that one or this one we shall see that's everything and thank you guys for watching and thank you guys for subscribing if you subscribed and if you haven't if you want to subscribe if you don't it's okay so yeah thank you guys for watching I'll see you guys in my next video wait if at that movie so yeah I [Music]", "DaJeg3f8jFk": "[Music] I'm on a shopping spree going down the aisles buying mosquito repellents the mission find out which repellents work and which don't next stop the USDA mosquito and fly research unit in Gainesville Florida headed by dr. Olli premier are you sure you all want to get bitten by these mosquitos even with the Zika virus out there absolutely can't wait to do this mosquitos here are Zika free three volunteers including Inside Edition producer Charley Mackel ray V are about to expose their arms to hundreds of hungry mosquitoes even if they're Zika free I'm a little hesitant here we go the first product to be tested is the chemical DEET it's the active ingredient in many spray repellents we dried off cutter and repelled and they all work so far so good no bites that worked pretty well huh like he got no bites another popular product is mosquito repellant made from natural plants she's got lemon eucalyptus oil on her arm that she just applied this repellent should work very well another round of success no mosquito bites here either next we tried these anti bug bracelets which claim to repel mosquitoes by releasing a natural plant-based ingredient called geranium this is ready here keep bugs away we'll see what happens look mosquitoes start sucking away that's one two three four five so you got at least eight from what I can see our experts say they both failed did that go well no in our type of testing we would consider this product not to be protective against of the mosquito bite lots of homeowners swear by citronella candles especially for outdoor cookouts the scientists released 500 mosquitoes into this special outdoor cage to see if it really works I'm holding this candle right here fumes coming up in my face and yeah you've got one on your nose you have it on your forehead got one your beard you got a shirt on a scale of 1 to 10 how effective is this candle of course it's gonna give us better one experts say citronella can be effective getting bit as we speak but one candle just isn't enough and can you believe there's even an anti mosquito app for your phone which claims to repel mosquitoes by emitting a high-frequency sound I don't believe it's gonna work in your brave man for doing this I'm not so sure if this is a good idea but let's see what happens Shirley is eaten alive I can't even how many mosquitoes you have on you right now yep they're sucking away the app is on and it is not working Charlie looks like you got at least two higher bites you think 100 bites at least gosh get these things off of me please well as for the wristbands that we showed you the company that makes them disputes our testing methods and results saying that their products are effective and have millions of satisfied customers [Music] you [Music]", "duVDowiGO3s": "[Music] [Applause] bacon hey guys it's dr bacon hope everyone's doing great um just checking in got these ladies we started under the mars hydro ts-1000 i had the lamp 30 inches away it went out just a little while ago i'm looking at uh my plants and they're looking very leggy and laying over um i think i'm gonna give them i don't like to water them when the lights are out but i think they maybe are a little thirsty too um i skipped a day so i do not water uh yesterday i was gonna try to even maybe try to go three but i don't think that's a good idea at this point um so i wanna do that i wanna give them i'm just going to give them each a cup of water and i don't think there's any harm in watering them and right now i would not water plants when the lights are out like a hard water like big plants but i don't think it matters the other thing i'm going to take a chance on is move this lamp down six inches from 30 to 24 inches and see i don't think we'll cook them we'll find out and the other thing i might do if the sun's out for a moment but it's going to rain again this is our last lemon jack and that's got a couple days to go and these i brought in from the barbie house because of the storm that happened last night and we have one more band of weather that's gonna come around four o'clock so i'm i kind of want to take them outside but it's freezing outside and i think they'd probably be happier warm than in the sun and cold um but i do want to stake these they're falling over especially this guy here so i think i'll just make a little clean space here and give them a quick and dirty steak after i give these a tiny bit of water these things are um ready for water and still throwing leaves so they're going to get flower food tonight um when the lights come back on and hopefully they'll kick them out of this what i think is a potassium deficit other than that they're looking pretty happy here's our tying in progress this is the end of this plant right here these are all super cropped and i'm using soft ties i'm using recycled soft ties and i'm using bamboo that i've used previously and some dowels making sure to put the dirty end back down and um all of these were washed and soaked and washed in clorox water after they were used and dried i do have some really great suggestions i believe dirk was one of the people that suggested dipping them in the dipping the ends into some kind of waterproof paint and sealing them for life that's really a good idea because you can you can get mold in the end of these and then you um if especially if you're not careful when you put it in upside down then you can you have a hole that holds soil and nutrients and who knows what else and moisture and so you can get mold but um i'm using my soft ties and also wash those and i reuse those and why do you want to um why do you want to tie up your plants when they're young before they really need it well it signals them that they're supported and they can tell and then they grow bigger flowers believe it or not the other thing you can do is the and we're a little late for that is the uh the twisting motion the chiropractic um these are you could do it um but it's kind of late but that's a that's a kyle cushman uh specialty wow that smells good and um you should check that out if you don't know who kyle cushman is you should definitely check out his videos he's he's epic the reason i super crop okay all set i put a little electrical tape on the top of these too it keeps the uh barbie dream house net from getting snagged and torn well our day has passed i it's still raining and it's gonna rain through the night so i'm gonna try to get these guys so they the barbie girls get them some darkness so i have a friend stopping by i'm gonna see if he'll say hi uh he's driving south dropped his mom up in ventura and he's driving back to san diego in some pretty bad weather apparently these aren't dry or these are not dry enough to water the ones in the in here are and they haven't come on yet but we're going to hit them as soon as they do and i'll show you this too when they come on um i put all the uh solo cup new seedlings in with the we're going to put all our eggs in one basket with the mars hydro i thought about it and i'm just going to try it and we'll definitely learn something that's for sure okay so i'm going to water this and i'm going to do one thing i normally don't do too i'm going to ph my water i'm going to try to remember to ph my water out of the bottom of the plant someone commented my ph is off i don't think so i think i have a phosphorous issue so um but let's check that and then it's a data point and people can comment to it um what am i gonna do for feed all right good grief so cow mag and then this is my flower food pure blend pro bloom whatever it works fine and then a little sm-90 and then we're going to ph to 6.5 and we're just waiting for the lights to come on they'll come on in a minute or two that's where my ph pretty much always comes out it's a little um base and i always have to add some acid half a cap of ph down okay that's what we're looking for the yellow tennis ball color well i'm i'm totally impatient so i'm going to water these and i'm going to use this to collect a sample of something off this plant which is looking the worst um to ph i just this looks terrible it seems like it's progressing pretty quickly the jack lews also looked pretty crazy those leaves always look crazy this is not an unhealthy looking leaf for this plant believe it or not this is one mixed up plant and some mixed up flour too but what do you expect when you cross uh when you cross gorilla glue number four the original couch glue with like the strongest sativa ever smoked which is probably not true there's probably stronger sativas but jack hair is pretty damn strong and lemon jack is right there all right so i'm going to quick water these and give this thing a quick ph sample so two gallons of potting material two solar cups of water to that one to this bottom line okay this water went through the plant and that ph is to 6.5 which is pretty much exactly what i just put in the top of the plant i've never ph the water ever once out of the bottom i wouldn't even know what to do with it but comments are welcome okay these are on and our new additions are in here i put them kind of off to the side a little but they're in there and we have lowered the light down to uh closer to 24 inches really it's more like 26 or seven so keep an eye on these but we're learning sure does look like kind of burn but then there's these dots so we're going to lose a lot more leaves before this is over i can tell something's up that just does not look healthy at all oh let's see we're going potassium that's the root we're on right now i'm sorry i said potassium phosphorus well hey guys that's our episode i'm still waiting for my buddy to show up so maybe he'll be in tomorrow's episode i want to get this out to you guys have a great one like and subscribe if this makes you happy and we'll see you really soon you", "pV2BxxIBxx4": "[Music] [Music] g'day guys Andy Thomas here from water on the run today I'm going to talk to you about a few issues you guys have had regarding your running lights on the Africa tween unless you've got the ones with the LED indicators you've got the ordinary lenses like myself there's been cases where people have been pulled out on because they can see the orange lights I've also got these on my old under CB 400 the the lights actually run Orange and go about problems wear them they've got these orange lights running because they are just on all the time until you indicate then they go brighter cars have looked at you seeing that you've got an orange light and automatically thought you're about to turn left or turn right and pull down on you there's been one incident I know where guy did actually inside the car another got a lot of guys have talked about yet they managed to swerve and stop and whatever but I've come up with a theory and we're gonna have a go not sure if it'll work but we'll try it alright guys so this is what I'm talking about is you've got your main eight light but you've got these running lights in orange unless you've got spotlights running lights you can use daily hopefully they can see you which is great if not as I say some of you guys are having issues where a cars looking at you've seen an orange light think you know it's turning just a quick glimpse he's turning an issue so what we're going to do is we're going to take up one of these lenses we're going to try and make a mold I'm gonna do it like a plastic cast but you can do it in silicon take up all these lenses try and make a mold and cast it in a clear resin and then we're going to swap the globes out for LED globes that run white and indicate orange so let's have a go so I taught up Donnie just cut this bit of foil I'm gonna fold it up just make it a little rough box or do me it's all you need you put a bit of tape around if you want to but I'll mix some plaster off we'll set that into there like so then push it down and put a bit of weight on the top of it to hold it in but I go so it makes it a bit of plaster I'm just going to pour it into that mold and put the piece on top and go from there all right go so what I'm gonna do with the lens I'm just going to get some vaseline and I'm gonna coat it over just paint it all over it just so when we do cast on to it the Vaseline doesn't stick although this the lens doesn't stick to it so just coat it all in Donnie needs a very light coating you don't to go too mad or a nice shine on that you don't to go too mad because obviously the thick it is that's going to be the imperfections into that mold that you're doing all right guys sorry I skipped the stage I missed it but what I did is I pushed that into there into the wet plaster and left it in there I put a bit of weight on it just rolled it down as you can see that's all set now that came out piece of cake casted the bottom lovely and I put these four holes in and just rounding them over just so they can locate the top pieces when we do the top one but that casted quite good it's quite smooth so yeah we should be okay with that so that's that bottom part done I've also cooked that little channel in there which I'm thinking once I get the top off together that's where I'll pour my resin into to do the casting but I'm thinking do I pour it do I inject it create an airflow there look at that bit later on but there anyway that's caste pretty well up to the top part okay guys I've raised this sides up so everything cast on top so we're going to do is mix some more plaster again inside this time with the Vaseline stick it back in there and then we cast the top for as I say I put those four holes in and rounded them over when we cast this part it'll be like a locating pin this time we're also going to Vaseline all around the top of this mold inside ear around everywhere because we don't leave to a half's to stick together we want to be able to break them open okay going so let's that's gone off I'm skipping a few processes sorry I'm really sorry it's just that I'm backwards and forwards doing other stuff and working and and there that's gone off obviously it's not you don't go off in seconds so I've had to leave it come back to it come again and I keep forgetting getting where I was I've just watched through the video thought missed off on it but anyway I've casted that there we're gonna take this apart [Music] try and leave these two offs open go take that poor offer there for there to give us a top part those at the top and the bottom as I say these locators what I mentioned and put it back together they'll be nice and lined up solid alright so again I've cut that to the to when they go together locate and we can pour through there so that's the next step we'll put this band on I'm going to before a pool a will coat everything me Vaseline but I'll come back here on that one alright go somewhere I did I've made my own mold I bought some two-part silicon I made a mold from the original white light and then I've used a resin two-part resin to cast it and as you can see there's my clear one still a little bit tacky I've just done my second one for the other side and I'm really pleased as a couple of area bubbles in there but I'm really pleased at the way they came out as I say let's show you them on the bike up against the white alright go see your standard orange indicator lens as a screw at the back there just need a Philips screwdriver insert into that all and then just undo the screw and that will pop off exposing that I've took the glow boat which is a standard globe it's what they're known as a stop and tail but we use them for running lights and indicators normally there for brat back lights so you've got a running lighting back Lloyd's and you've got a brake light it's called the stop and tail but these are the globes that they've got they're led same thing you can see with the pings they're offset pings 1-1 so it's higher than the other so there's a certain way those going and these are amber and white and those will obviously run running white and indicating orange or amber goes a little bit fiddly but they will only go in one way so line them up with the slots push and then turn no push and then turn and then block ii i'll turn the ignition on and i'll show you that that's now running in white but then when they indicate it indicates in orange but as you can see it's what they call hyper flashing so we're going to install the resistors in the back of the bike we don't need to put them on the frontier the bulbs in the back or the globes and the back adjust standard normal globes but because we put an LED the hyperlinks so we have to put a resistor between the neutral and the live which resists the power down to blink its lower and to regulation so that's let's see as you can see running lighting white indicate in orange so as you can see guys that effects the back as well that's a standard globe in there but it does either blink in the back so i'm going to show you how to disconnect that alright guys so i know you all know how to take your seed off obviously with a key the terminal bolts under there to take up your back seat slide that it open that that exposes that and if you look inside here there's a three set plugs now the orange one is your left hand indicator and the blue one is your right and indicator so what you've got to do is we're going to splice into those wires to put the resistor between them which will stop the eye / blinking so there you go i pulled out that 3 set plug as you can see there's an orange a white and a blue the orange one is this indicator showed you the blue one is the other side and I think that white one is the stop and tail for your brake light on not only person sewer but I haven't messed with that one I just know that this is I'll put that on I'll disconnect II put the indicator on splash it away just pop the tab pull that the relay is going but the globe's have stopped when you can see that the globe's that stopped if I just put you back on if I plug you back in there you go going pop it out stops so what we're gonna do is on that white dome wires here we need to scotch clip between this which is the live and the neutral we need to scotch clip a resistor so this is the resistor 250 what resistor I mean some of them are 25 but we're gonna supply the 50 watts and a bit bigger we need to mount them somewhere and you need to mount them on some alameen your Muslim don't put them on the plastic because they do get hot so we'll need to mount them somewhere probably up there it the way something like that on that side I'm on that side or two together there we'll find a place for them in a minute but I'll show you there these work how they go on so these are the scotch clips as you can see the wire goes straight through one side but on the other side it's blanked off so we'll put that wire through there and then when we clamp it up with deployers it'll seal down cut into it and do a connection on that alright let's do that so first off it's that way so push the wire I'm going to bring you over the top sing see alright so there we go so that goes through there and strip some wire back if you want to but you don't need to really just open that up a bit get through there and then any side of the resistor if there's a manner stick suppose that bend that over a little bit push that into there make sure that's right down little bit fiddly I pulled that blade out as you can see all right there we go so that clips onto there like that without backing so that goes on the outside resistor goes into there you get the pliers make sure that's right in that up that then should have cut through that wire up during that one fix that one cut through there then lock that over and then we do the same again to the other side slide that through the way up these are bloody Toit all right there we go that one's on again just do a bit of fold it over I was gonna bend that over a little bit push that into their game lawyers crimp it up it goes in there's a connection lock it on and then we put that back into its socket make sure we get the right way around yep so that's that's no connected between the positive and the negative of that running light other that indicator alright guys so yeah that's what I'm done I'm now going to the same to the blue one I'm going to put the resistor in and I'll show you that we've got to fix them down here somewhere - as I said to you that do get hot because they're transferring cutting between a live and a neutral but that's what they're for okay guys there you go pushed all that back of thick stays down with a couple of well wanting money needs to self tapping screw into the aluminium they're nice and solid as I say you need you can't put them on the plastic they do get hot you want to put them on metal or if you're going to put them on there put them on a piece of some main sheet or something something that's gonna take the heat so it don't melt your plastic because if you got your hazards on they do get warm obviously when you're indicating you know you're only on for like 20 30 seconds sometimes or it's about it but you command them to the aluminium yeah reboot them I've put a couple self tap as he blew them down whatever you want to just be careful with the glue si because of the heat they'll be effective alright guys so there they are I've not put the lenses on yet I'll show you the lens in a sec it's exactly the same as your engine ones just clear but there you go so the running lights in white you'll have no one pulling on you anymore through having a quick glimpse think you know you're indicating it's a white light it's gonna be through a white lens not Orange so yeah there's I know that's why we've gone through this because I've heard a few guys about that problem where the running lights obviously of running in Orange cars are taking a quick glimpse thinking you're indicating not realizing and pulling out on you and bang a couple of swerves couple of Mason booties but there you go extra running lights in white yeah before I show you the lens I'll just show you the acids back to front where are they there we go orange beautiful look in there as it's off-white Ronny lights there we go guys now I'll show you the lens as you can see I haven't drilled into there yet to put the screw in because it's still a little bit damp I'm gonna wait for that to harden off a little bit but that's the clear run as you can see let's turn the lights on oh wait there you go you can see that's a fair bit of a little bit glazed inside but it does the job and then we put the indicator on there you go orange now I think that is a perfect perfect scenario to overcome you know out of Maine it's like that sides turned off that side stayed on they they know you're indicating that way now rather than having two orange lights on let's turn that off back to white there you go boys alright guys so there we go I've put a piece of cement sheet underneath I've screwed it down to one of these little holes here look one of the mounts screwed it down to there and I've put a piece of cement sheet underneath there which is fire retardant heat proof and then I've just screwed these down to that push the lip back down and there we go all the cables on this loose heat resistant wire so you don't worry about those touching so you're good so there we go so I put the seat back on and actually you can charge your wife or your pill in for heating the seat up and keeping their bookworm there you go there you go guys fantastic as I say I'll put a link down below also I'm going to start listing them on eBay if anybody wants to know there will be on eBay Australia the price I'm not 100% sure yet as I do this video but I'm looking probably around about the hundred dollar mark plus postage that will give you the two lens covers the two Globes the two resistors and the four clips to connect it all together plus a set of instructions about to do it I've only got Africa twing lenses I've not got for any other bike so yeah we'll go from there thanks for watching guys see you later [Music]", "WgMDN2elbME": "hi guys and welcome back to my channel so on today's video we are doing this pretty pink bobby ish um matte pink cut crease we have not used any shimmer we are just playing around with a bit of pink and seeing where it takes us so your crush calls me napsy but you you can call me kingman so um please comment like and subscribe and please click the little bell notification so you get notifications whenever new videos come out and i hope you enjoyed today's video [Music] hi guys and welcome to another new video so i hope you've already subscribed and let's just get into the video so on today's video i am going to do um a matte pink look i am feeling pinky and i'm going to be using um this colors obsession palette from beauty treats it has like loads loads and loads of colors the top part is matte as you can see i've gotten very much good use out of this palette and the bottom part is just shimmers off i guess like complementary colors of the of the mattes so the bottom part is just shimmers and you can use shimmers but i'm going to be using the top part today just the top part and i'm feeling something a bit pinky i might use a bit of carnation rosewood scarlet you know a bit of a pink cut crease i'm gonna be using these four brushes for the eye look this is the color uh 311 blending brush and this is the color 486 brush and this is the wow 9008 brush and this is a brush i got from clicks i think it was one of their concealer brushes or it was in that package with that with the eye brushes so the first thing i'm gonna do is go into the shade kiss it's a light lightish pink and i'm gonna tap off the excess powder on my palette so i'm gonna start at the base of my eye and then work it into a v i'm not going to completely work it across my eye i'm just gonna work it into a v and then in order to create a transition shade for all the shades i'm gonna use so we are just creating a small v for for the shades that are going to come along and then after that shade we are going to mix a bit of scarlet and carnation carnation as like a neon pink but on dark skin it shows up really beautiful it just shows up carnation has a bit of a brownish it has a bit of a brown in it it's it's like a burnt pink so we're gonna start with carnation and then deepen that shade afterwards with rosewood but we are going to place carnation right on top of that kiss color we put on first and then we are going to blend this one a bit more forward a bit more to the front to create a bit of a base for our cut crease so that's what we're doing you see how bright that pink is actually let me skip to the front so you guys can see the colors i'm gonna need another brush for this carnation shade because it's a bigger blending black brush because we are trying to diffuse the shade into the outer v of the eye and we're not trying to mix up colors because we're going to we're still using the same brushes for the other eye we just blend that and just into the outer v and then we are going to use the color brush or the new brush that i worked out as the wet and wild brush and then we're going to be using the color brush just to blend out the edges of the carnation shade we put in first so we don't have any lines of demarcation that we need to remove then i'm gonna go in with kiss again and just blend out right on top of coronation just to diffuse the colors i kind of don't like the the the quality of this palette because the the eyeshadows just blend into each other and you can't see the done the hard work that you were doing basically so you can't see any dimensions i'm going back into that neon pink and then i'm placing it right at the outer v and then i'm blending it out in circles and hopefully that will make a bit of more dimension and then now it's time to cut our crease so we are going to be using the essence um concealer that i used in my last video because it's the only concealer that i have that looks like it's going to be light enough to grab onto the shade that i want to put on um my lid which is this amber rosy amber shade it's a bit rosy it's beautiful and i'm going to use my concealer brush that i use for my for my brows to carve out my brows and i'm just going to cut my crease so i'm gonna start by the inner corner basically and then just and just build so the good thing about this brush is that it has a round tip so it's very hard to mess up the line of your cut crease because of the round tip of the brush so it basically does your cut crease for you like one so when we get to the edge of the cut crease we just you slant your brush this way and then you just use that part to blend the cut crease into your shadow you just blend it like that so we're gonna use that scarlet shade first and then we're gonna put it into the inner corner again just to a bit of dimension there and then we're gonna go back with carnation and use it button click i don't know what this part is but part of the lid so we can blend the concealer and then we're going to grab this flat brush from clicks and then grab the shade amber that's like a light pink and then just pack it on to a yay that almost rains into the wrong shade pack it on where we have put our concealer so you see it's a peachy pink i see that and it's so beautiful it's such a beautiful shade i love it so so much you just pack it on as much as you need to because you needed to show up and now i have hooded eyes so very i just need to pack on colors so that you can see them from the satellites in space i don't know the girl has a bit of color on her eyes today and then we're gonna go back into just attached a bit of orange go back into that carnation shade and then blend it right at the edge of that color and on the outside where we were blending it prior to soften out the harsh line from the cut crease just to soften it out a little bit so it's not you know clown like i guess and then i'm gonna use that big fluffy brush from color to blend out the edges of that so that everything is nice and blended and uniform so i'm gonna do my other eye off camera and my face so that we don't have a super long video and then i'm gonna come back to complete my under eye and apply my lashes so guys i'm back my face is done my nose is baking a bit so we're gonna do our under eye and we're gonna grab a flat brush i got it from clicks and then we're gonna grab coronation should we start with no we'll we'll blend coronation out with scarlet coronation is that bright pink we used so we're gonna grab coronation with my handheld mirror and then plop it in the inner corner only it's not me making my makeup dirty with this green shade so we plop coronation in the under eye i think i have glue in my inner corner i was just removing the crease i was not poking into my eye we use coronation and then we don't go past the pupil right because we're gonna put another color there or should we no we're not gonna do that and then and then we're gonna i'm dusting off that color on my paper towel and then i'm gonna grab the darker scarlet shade and then pop that out just to make sure there are no harsh lines and then we are going to use that amber shade that we used up here my lashes are really dramatic i need to get lashes that are less i'm going to take this amber shade in the beginning we're just going to use it right there did i not just poke into my eye and then we plop it on the inner corners so like we're making a gradient of the colors that we have on the top lash line do you understand on the bottom lash line so that it can somewhat be uniform and then i'm gonna grab my highlighter brush and then go into the inner corner if you thought i wasn't gonna do glitter it's all wrong me and glitter in the inner corner are best friends i think i have a pink undertone highlight i use i thought well maybelline master chrome it has somewhat of a pink undertone but if it's not popping i'm going to use something else so i just plop it into my inner corner just like that it's very slowly would you like it very slowly i'm gonna add this shade chic right here this one that i'm finishing then it's my favorite pink shimmer like the time i was a shimmer addict i should do a makeup look with like shimmery i should the time i was a shimmer addict this this was my staple even on brown looks that was my staple i think i like the formula of this eyeshadow you can see it will show up this pink eyeball it's that girl that will pull through for the babies how i'm going to use this pink essence pencil i don't know do i still have the shade on this 48 something 48 something i'm gonna sharpen it a little bit and then just to tie it with the pink we want a pink water line because we are what we are dramatic like that so now i have really sensitive eyes that's why i cannot just plot things on my water line i need to pull it down it's like a mauvy dark pink like the scarlet shade we use we used not so long ago so guys that is it for today's video i hope you liked this look and if you do recreate this look please tag me on your pictures and that i may converse with you guys and like your pictures and yeah don't forget to like comment and subscribe and see you in the next one", "C3koA28ZgbU": "hello my babes and all welcome back to my beginner beauty with Bella series this is video number four if you haven't caught up on the previous videos I will link a cut up above as well as in the description box below so you guys can go and check those videos out I have pretty much posted my beginner series of foundation eyeshadow and bras so today's video is going to be focusing on mascara eyeliner and those dreaded false lashes trust me even I freaked out applying them some times now so I'm going to show you the easiest way to do them so that you can still wear the lashes of your dreams and not be scared to try them out but applying lashes can definitely seem daunting at first but really they make your makeup pop and they're really so fun to use because there are so many different styles and kinds and you can get some really affordable options too so instead of shying away completely from them I want to invite you to try them out and to start playing around with them and after a while practice will make perfect and I guarantee you you'll be wanting to add lashes to most of your looks so if you're interested in picking that perfect mascara getting those false lashes on and of course getting that winged down to a fine art then please keep watching so the things you're going to need today for this tutorial are as follows you're going to need a mascara of your choice any mascara that you love that you enjoy using will do perfectly fine you're going to need an eyeliner I suggest a gel or liquid liner but once again this is entirely up to you what you have available and what you're comfortable with using you're going to need a pair of false lashes these can be easily bought to add clicks or disc in and they don't have to be the most expensive ones they don't have to be the fanciest ones you're just going to need a pair of them in order to practice and you're going to need a Guu many of the lashes that you can buy such as the adul whispies and a couple of the idlers or most of the others come with a lash glue however I will give you a recommendation throughout this video for a really good lash glue and why I use this particular brand here optional tools today but I promise you these will make your life so much easier are an eyelash curler which looks like a medieval torture weapon and a lash applicator so I'm pretty sure you might have seen these and wondered what it is for but it's for your false lashes you can of course use a pair of tweezers I just find that that with the shape of this lash applicator it gives you a more even grip and it gives you a more measured application so that's pretty much what you're going to need for this video if you're keen on seeing a how and what we're going to do then please keep watching so your first step is going to be to take your eyelash curlers if you have them and a nice little trick is to heat this up for a few seconds with your hairdryer and it just helps to maintain that curl and just make it a little bit easier what you want to do is you just want to curl your eyelashes on both sides so as with all different types of makeup there are so many brands of mascara out there there are so many different types so it's kind of difficult to know which one works best it's kind of also like a trial and error thing I have heard amazing things about the essence lash princess range I myself haven't tried it out but if you are looking for a very affordable mascara you might want to give that a go one of my absolute favorite mascaras though is the mark big and extreme by Avon I love by this mascara it is absolutely amazing so it looks like this so it's pretty much an orange tube and the applicator looks like this another one of my favorite mascaras is the mascara revolution by makeup revolution so it's a rose gold tube and the applicator looks like that today I'm going to be using the Avon big and extreme mascara because I absolutely love this mascara it's perfect for everyday wear as well and it's a super affordable so the trick when applying your mascara is to focus on the base of your lashes and to do kind of a wiggle motion so you're going to start at the base and wiggle it a bit applying your mascara before you apply your false lashes helps your natural lashes to gel a lot better with your false lashes you can obviously apply it after but I find that that tends to end up with a lot of product on your false lashes and that does affect their longevity because you have to clean them quite thoroughly then so once you've applied you mascara just give it a few minutes to dry and if you find that your mascara is getting a bit clumpy you can use your spoolie to just brush through your lashes and it can get rid of any clumps that you find so if you're not a false lash type of person then by all means just leave the lashes like this and you're good to go so I'm going to go ahead and apply my eyeliner now so like I mentioned before there are different types of liners available gel liners pencil liners liquid liners my favorite are your liquid liners so today I'm going to be using the NYX matte liquid liner but suggest using a liner that's more liquid based for your wing just because a pencil liner like this essence one for example whilst it's really great for lining your lash lines the precision is not great on it because you can't really sharpen it if you could sharpen it that's a different story but I would say for a neater more precise finish I would suggest a more liquid liner they do take a little while to get used to but once you are used to it it's a lot easier to use so yeah so this one kind of has a finish like that so it's not super super thin but it does the job so a few months ago I actually did upload a super easy to do winged eyeliner tutorial I will link it in a card above if you want to check it out but for now I'm pretty much just going to be lining my lash line as close to my lash line as possible and doing a slight wing nothing too crazy so I'm lining about that much and then of course I'll fill it in and I'm pulling a slight wing out so once I have the point that I've drawn it out - I'm just going to not from right on the edge but from about a midpoint of that line I just put it back in as you can see that's just giving me a really small wing and I'm just going to go ahead and fill that in the reason that's helpful to apply some eyeliner before you apply your false lashes is that when the band of your false lashes sits on your eye it looks less noticeable because there is some black to begin with and then I'm just going to pull a slight wing in from the side and like I did before about half way I'm going to join it and then you can pretty much see there's a nice base for your eyelashes application okay so in terms of lashes there are a lot of varieties out there there's a lot of lens thicknesses shapes styles all of that good stuff so your top of lash really just depends on what you're looking for so for today I'm actually going to be using a pair of my favorite lashes and these are from lash addict sa these particular ones are from lash addict sa you can actually pick them up at clicks and they are called the hashtag mood so they look like this they come in a little box pretty much look like that so you're going to need a pair of lashes these can be whichever lashes you have chosen they don't need to look like mine you're going to need lash glue and you're going to need a lash applicator or if you don't have a lash applicator tweezers so in terms of lash glue I feel like it is pertinent to mention this and this is not in any debate disrespecting any brands but I find out recently that well a few months ago that this G Road I left blew the ones that I always used I have literally like another two tubes of it it actually has formaldehyde in it so that's not a really great product to have and to be using by your eyes so I do know that they have come out with a formaldehyde free lash glue as well so they do have a version that does not have formaldehyde or one of the latest versions of lash glue has no formaldehyde so just keep a lookout for that and if you have a look at the ingredients sometimes they on a box sometimes they're on a little sheet or leaflet that's in the box just have a look out and make sure it doesn't have formaldehyde in it but um yeah I just wanted to keep this on hand to just show you I don't use that lash glue anymore I do happy use this one and the branding has completely worn offers but it is from lash addict si and you can also find it in clicks that's where I picked it up I picked these up at the same time so this lash glue is really awesome comes at the middle applicator actually need to refill mine soon so it actually comes with a little applicator so it's super easy to use you might need a pair of scissors if you have not trimmed your lashes already but I'm going to zoom you in so you can see what I'm doing better and let us get onto this going to want to take out your lash right and you can hold it up you can pretty much see which side is which it'll have shorter pieces by the side that goes to in a corner so once you have your lash you're just going to want i'm just get right grabbing a mirror so you're going to want to just put your lash on just for sizing i've already used these before so obviously they are shaped and cut to my eye but you just want to apply it just above your lashes just let it sit there just to get an idea of how much you need to trim away and this is important to do because if your lash is too long for your eye you're going to end up but no matter how well you apply it with extra lash at the end here and it's not gonna it's not gonna sit nice because that extra lash is not going to sit to anything and then it's going to come off so you want to trim your lashes so that they fit your eyelids so once you visit it and you figured out that it is the right length for your eye you're going to take the lash and you're just going to bend it slightly in a c-shape this just helps because it helps it to form naturally and sit naturally against the shape of your eyes right so now we're going to get onto the good side so you're going to take your lash and you're going to take your lash applicator if you don't have a lash applicator just your tweezers if you don't have tweezers you can use your fingers I obviously have long nails so it makes it a bit difficult but what I do is I grab my lashes pretty much in the center so as you can see I've grabbed my lashes almost to the base of the lash and just in the center now you're going to hold that and open your lash group so the biggest mistake I used to make and that also see others make when applying lashes is not letting the lash glue dry if you don't let it dry it's not going to work lash glue needs to dry for at least like 45 seconds to a minute so they can become a little bit more tacky that's how it helps it stick on to your eye so all I'm doing is I'm taking my applicator and I'm going to apply a line of glue to the lashes I will show you the amount of applied once I am done applying it so you don't need to apply a lot of glue but you do need to make sure that you've covered the entire strip that is currently what my lash looks like so in the meantime what you can do is grab a mirror because you want to hold your you mirror at a higher angle and you want to kind of look straight at your lashes and apply them from the top that way they can morph to the shape of your natural lashes so once you had a look at the glue and you see some glues change to black they go from clear to black some glues go from Blues go from like a white color to like a clear color it just depends they work there on the box otherwise once you'd be given at about a minute you can apply it so on the press the lashes down on the center and I'm going to remove so as you can see it's a little bit more tacky then what you can do either with your fingers or with the lash applicator you just take the edge and you push that into the edge of your lashes and then last but not least you take the inner corner of the lashes and you just push it against your eye what I like to do afterwards is I just push the shut so that there's no space and then I just go along I close my eyes slightly and I can just press down on the false lashes to make sure they have a deed correctly and the last step is just to take the same applicator and what you're going to want to do is you're going to want to grow both your natural lashes and the false lashes and squeeze them together slightly you don't have to do this too strongly because it might hurt you you just want to squeeze it together very gently so that it pushes your false lashes towards your natural lashes and then once you're done you're just going to want to press up those false lashes so that they don't set too straight and that they are rather facing up as you can see lashes make a massive difference to your look so yeah that is pretty much the one I complete so if you want a neat little trick if you take your eyeliner and if you notice any spaces in between your lashes and your false lashes you can fill it in with some of your black eyeliner this just helps to make it look more seamless like it's just blending into your natural lash line first step is obviously just to measure your lashes to trim them to fit your eye then of course to just bend them a little bit in a C shape just to ensure that they are more curved then of course you're going to apply your lash glue to the base you're just going to want to let that lash for you dry for at least a minute come while you're waiting for it to dry you can contemplate why you're wearing false lashes I'm just joking it's honestly not that bad it takes a little while to get used to it but I promise you the more that you work with these lashes and lashes in general the better you'll get it's just one of those things I was terrified to use false lashes at first because obviously it's quite a daunting thing and the first time I tried it it was a complete fail and the subsequent times too but I think the more you tried out the easier it gets with most things in life so your mirror must be slightly higher because you want to look kind of lean your head back a little bit and look straight and you want to apply your lash from the top so I'm going to go ahead and apply my lashes again pressing down on the middle and letting it go then taking the corners you can use your tweezers you can use these you can use your fingers and pushing the end of that lash down to my outer corner and last of all you're gonna get the inner 1/2 in a corner then of course I just kept them shut and I just go ahead and press along the whole lash to make sure every bit is done and the last thing is you're going to gently squeeze your natural lashes to your false lashes and last thing just make sure they're pressed up so that your lashes I'm not sitting straight they're facing upwards that is pretty much it for the lashes they're on quite securely the edges are put down I find often if anything is going to pop up it's this inner corner here so frustrating it is something that is quite daunting to do it first but I do suggest you buy a pair of cheap or affordable lashes and you try and practice with them because I promise you wearing lashes is extremely fun to do and it really does add a pop to your look and although it's difficult at first it is super worth it so if you have any questions please feel free to leave them in the comment section down below or you can get hold of me on any of my social media channels otherwise I will see you for the fifth and final installment of my series and that is until next time i luvs stay sane and stay home bye", "X-yfRn4Pmj8": "hey guys welcome back to my channel if you would like to see how I achieved this look

later", "F2tRu8siZQk": "[Music] hi guys welcome to my youtube channel i'm natalia maison this is a fairly new channel so if you're seeing it for the first time or you have not yet subscribed to it please do subscribe and please give it a thumbs up today i'll be doing a planet nails haul with you um it's basically just a response to a few requests about how i buy my products and what price i got it from so i was able to come up with a mini um starter kit for no more than 600 rents but please just bear in mind that the 600 grand is except the uv lamp and i'll explain why i feel why i felt not to include the uv lamp in this haul we'll talk about it a bit later but yeah let's get into it so the first thing that um obviously we need to get in tune with the safety consciousness that we need to have about the pandemic that we're dealing with is a bottle of sanitizer so i got this 200 ml sanitizer for 30 rounds the normal selling price is 45 rents but this time around i got it on special so i really like the sanitizer the smell is not annoying at all because some sanitizers can just do the most but i i like this one and then i also got this nice um stainless steel cuticle pusher for 50 rounds so planet nails does sell a variety of cuticle pushes i've seen wooden ones long and short ones in a pack of i think they're like 50 or something very affordable as well but the reason why i appreciate this one specifically is because it has this very nice grid like grip handle and this helps me to just have a very nice safe grip on the cuticle pusher as i'm pushing back the cuticle to avoid any slip up or hurting myself or the clients whoever i'm working on so i love this cuticle push it's my second one that i've purchased so far then the next thing you're going to need is a hand file they come in different shapes i've got this one for 11 rand and i love the convex shape of this one because it helps me to just be able to get into the groove of the nail very nicely as i'm perfecting my my shape or the final product so i i like this one it's 100 by 100 grit it's fairly rough you're going to be needing a rough filer for your filing when you're still prepping the nail shaping your your tip or your natural nail and then also just to smooth it out in the in the end and then you're going to also need a buffer this one costs 20 grand but there are different buffers that planet nail sells i think they're cheaper ones than this as well you can just choose whatever is to your liking whatever your budget allows as well and then this is a manicure brush i really love the handle and i only got it for 650 very affordable you can get as many as you want and i got this knit hat this practice finger that we're going to be needing this one was nine round yeah this was nine round you can get as many as you want as well and then the next thing you're going to need obviously is um nail prep and nail primer so your prep looks something like this and then your primer something like this and they are 10 mils each and they cost 24 ends each these two go hand in hand guys you can never do a set of acrylic nails without having these two products it's your nail polish first and then your nail primer afterwards you need to have this um as a part of your starter kit don't take any corners and try to not get it to save on that extra on that 24 ends you need to have it in then you're also going to be using monomer this is a 50 ml bottle and it goes for 60 bucks there are monomer bottles that are in different sizes larger than this and i'm going to be honest and say that the larger the bottle of monomer you purchase the better it's going to work out for you in the long run remember we'll be doing a lot of practicing a lot of removal of the acrylic nails and redoing it over so to avoid you running out of product and being frustrated rather buy a bigger bottle if you can afford it but if what you can afford is this 60 rounds right now that's cool you can work with it and then you're going to need a dappen dish this is a glass one and it was seven rands they also have different dipping dishes with art on it and whatever all to your liking then the next um item you're going to need is an acrylic brush so this time around i got this acrylic sable brush and it's very flat and the cost is 40 irons also canon now sells different brushes i remember in the beginning when i started out i used to practice with this other brush that has a pink handle but once i found these ones i really fell in love with it because i feel like the the brush bristles are just so so so flush and like my application has improved so much because of how real these bristles are i work so much better with it so i i recommend these ones they have pointy ones as well not only the flat ones so you can see which one will work best for you which one you're more comfortable working with and then you're going to need acrylic powder this is in 30 grams i got the color white and it went for 80 rounds so acrylic powders works the same as the monomer the larger the the product the better it's going to work out for you in the long run they have acrylic powders that are like 10 grams and it's 40 in so you might feel like 400 end is more affordable than this 80 bucks but i guarantee you that you're going to run out of product with the 10 gram one and then you have to keep on going back and buying products so rather buy the bigger bottle that's a bit costly but it's going to work out better for you in the long run because remember we'll be doing a whole lot of practicing you're going to need a whole lot of product so this will be sufficient for you and then the next thing you're going to need is top coat and also cuticle oil 10 ml 10 moles 24 and 24 and same as our nail prep and our nail primer and then you're going to need acrylic tips if you're going to want to do tips as long as nails as long as these ones so this one goes for 120 rounds they are clear cut out tips i got it in the clear color and cut out means that they are designed in such a way that they hook or they fit into the free edge of your nail very very easily as you're going to be applying the tip so i really really love these ones you can also go a very long way with these tips so it's it's the 120 round is definitely worth it and then you're going to need a tip cutter i got the stainless steel one for 35 rounds obviously you can use a normal nail clipper as well or you can use a scissors whichever works best for you i've just never used these nail cutters so i was like let me just try and get one this time and see how it works for me and then you're going to need nail glue this is a 6 gram nail glue and then this one is 3 grams the 6 gram one goes for 30 rounds and then the 3 gram one goes for 15 rounds so they work differently this one sort of like a dropper you just do a bit of squeezing and then this one has a a brush applicator um you can also choose whichever works best for you or to your liking and then all of this here went to a total of 500 575 rents 50 cents somewhere hence i said no more than 600 grams but we are going to need a uv lamp at some point for now in the beginning it's not a hassle that you just apply your tip prep practice your prepping practice your application and then end with the top coat and take your picture that's cool for now but at some point you're going to need your uv lamp if you're going to start working on people's hands so the lamps that i would suggest are the ones from planet nails there's one that's 500 rand it just has like a on and off switch button and then there's one that's 1005 rounds that one has a timer setting on it and i really love that one it's the one i'm currently using um i would suggest that if you cannot afford that extra 500 rent now or the extra 1 500 right now rather just do the practicing and the prepping and the application on your nails and save up for the lamp do not make the mistake of that i made of buying from some random shop i was walking in joburg around small street somewhere and there was a salon there and guy says the the lamp costs 250 runs and i felt like it's a bargain compared to the prices i've been seeing online and i went in and i asked him to show me if it really works because i just couldn't believe it and he did show me and he took out he took out some top coat that he had from somewhere and everything was sharp but when i actually got to start using it personally i would have my clients my sisters would have to sit their hands in the lamp for a good five to ten minutes and still it would come out feeling a little bit tacky either the thumb won't be dry enough so i just didn't appreciate um the quality of the lamp at all the light bulb went out as well after a few uses so i just when that happened i got rid of it totally and then i got the planet nails one i started off with the 500 red one and now i have the one that costs 1.5 so yeah that's my advice to you also when you get to planet nails guys i've been to three different branches so far in different towns and i guarantee you that in each and every um store the ladies are so welcoming so warm they'll greet you with a very nice smile and they'll give you so much information so when you get in there ask them questions if you're not sure um speak to them and say you heard about something like this in the video how does it actually work i guarantee you they'll share the information with you ask them if there are any specials i always do that and it helps me and all the best with your nail journey", "lTiUDx33ZSw": "[Music] hey guys at psyllium HD here and welcome back to my channel for today's video I'll be doing another makeup tutorial and the look I'm wanting to

little bag we got our wig cap we got our nail wraps i thought that was cute and we got a new nice um wrap and some lashes girl them lashes was actually really cute i enjoyed those lashes and of course the wig it is a highlight 13 13x4 wig we have our combs in the back with the adjustable straps and two combs in the front and we have our brown lace 13x4 going in the middle and we have our buy two parting on the side so let's go ahead and try this bad boy on yes girl you know my head wide you know i represent for the big head girls unites was definitely good about sizing the cap correctly the flaps went down to a good amount and the lace was very nice and thin and soft and that brown lace right there is doing what it needs to be doing girl yes it's very much melted giving very much scalp and we didn't even bleach it or nothing this is straight out of the pack y'all i'm not bleaching it i'm just showing you guys the back and the pretty highlights throughout this wig it is absolutely beautiful the hair gives me that remy feel if you know how i really feel this is how this hair feels it feels like roomy it doesn't feel like human hair it feels processed so i'm going to take her scalp um concealing powder you guys can find her stuff on instagram i will tag in the description box below also she has a let's prep spray we're going to use her whole deal and we're going to prep our lace i went ahead and did the ball cap method off camera you know what time it is if you don't know already girl get the program we're going to use the let's prep and we're going to prep our scalp and then i use the quick grip lace glue you guys can find all her products at quick grip lace glue on instagram and i'm going to go ahead and start to apply this wig i did it just like this and i did three layers so yeah we're just gonna evenly distribute the glue along the hairline and then we're gonna spread it out with a popsicle stick this glue actually because i'm recording this video like a week or two after i re i actually recorded the video um this glue held really well when i took my wig off it was not ready to come off i was just ready for a new style and i had it on for about a week and a half and it didn't lift or anything so yeah and it dried super quickly i stayed dry in about three minutes that is a good drying time versus some of these other glues it didn't break me out it didn't have any of those weird side effects it didn't have a weird smell it went on smooth i just completely enjoyed um this glue from quick grip lace glue so yeah we're just going to go ahead and continue to install like i told you guys earlier i did three layers so that my wig could be sucker honey so now that our wig is secure and dry it is time to install but before we do that we're going to cut off this back tab in the back of the wig um i don't know why this is here it's pretty useless but anyway we ain't going down so we cutting it off and we're gonna slap that bad boy on across the front like we saw earlier it's pretty good we didn't really have to do too much i went and plucked a little bit but like i said it gives you that roomy texture so it was kind of hard to plug but in our reality it's free plugged and you really don't have to i didn't even do any bleaching so basically this wig is straight out of the pack you guys so if you are one of those girls that just need a beginner type of wig this is for you it's very easy and it's a human hair and because it has that roomy texture it will not have a lot of maintenance as far as like um keeping it straight you're just gonna have to straighten it so i'm using my babyliss flat iron and i'm going just doing a couple strokes and i use my pink lusters uh gloss shine just to give the hair some shine and an easier control while i am pressing out my hair now i just sprayed some in my hand and distribute across the hair you really didn't need a lot i think i did two or three pumps in my hand so yeah and see how just simple and easy it is i'm using um the flyaways from the quick grip lace glue company it's just a wax stick um this contains the flyaways and it helps your hair to lay down as flat as possible i'm using a hot comb an electric hot comb to make my hair flat and push back all the follicles so now everything is flat and laid we're going to go ahead and take off our elastic band that i used to secure the lace and just go over it one more time to make sure that everything is flat and nice before we start to continue to cut the lace i took me some duct clip and pushed the hair to the back so that i wouldn't cut any extra hairs and like i said you guys look at the melts i just took my scissors and cut across in a jagged motion and because we have a great glue and a great lace front wig from you nice it's seamless and it's easy this is how easy an install should be it should not be a thousand steps you should just be able to put on your lace and like literally keep it moving it shouldn't have to be everything how it is we just should be able to put our thing on make our little adjustments and that's it i just put some more glue on that part because i didn't um get that part but yeah you guys seen how easy that was and it's still a and it's looking amazing i'm just gonna do some baby hairs on the corner pieces right there because i just feel like i don't need a lot of baby hairs because it's giving scalp realness i'm filling this lace and i'm feeling this glue so you got as you guys can see i'm just making sure everything's flat with the hot comb don't burn yourself when you're doing it cut me some baby hairs use my mc7 collection edge timer to lay down my baby hairs and this is pretty much it y'all i use the her scalp from the quick quick quick grip lace glue and it is a lace concealing powder i 100 recommend this and she also has a cream one that you will use for the inside but i just did it on top because i just like powder better than cream for whatever reason but yeah this is the final result in straight i have a little surprise for you guys but yeah the hair was thick like i said it has that remy texture you can do a lot with it it's very soft it didn't tangle it didn't shed and the colors really brought out my skin tone it's so many different tones of blonde and brown in here it's so pretty and silky and nice i love this wig actually i've been waiting to do this on my own but since it already came pre colored even better you know what i'm saying we're just going to slap it on we didn't have to bleach the knots or anything because of our her scalp so yes i would 100 recommend you buying this wig especially if you're a beginner and that's it ladies this is the final look i went ahead and curled it gave her some curls girl and it really brought out the color even more you guys make sure to like comment and subscribe and purchase this wig on you nice", "j_Xr5y8Vi3c": "[Music] another video so my new subbies hi

so yeah so yeah what does make up video I'm just gonna be showing you guys mine my favorite go to makeup look kinda like an everyday makeup look we all know I don't put makeup on every day but it's just my simple go-to makeup look so yeah guys and my hair looks crazy that's why it's I never stay in front we are gonna sort it out you see what it looks like at the end of the video so yeah guys if you want to see how I achieve my simple go to makeup look keep on watching and I'll see you at the end of this video hey guys so I'm gonna start with basing my eyelid and I'm gonna use this upside down this wet-and-wild concealer is in the shade medium beige so I'm just gonna have my mirror down on my lap and guys this is my first video might make my first makeup video so please be lenient on the cold and in the comments Wow yeah so just gonna base my eyelids okay I so not that that's done I don't like I would like searching my eyeshadow with powder because I really want my eyeshadow to pop so I'm gonna be going in with this brown shade over here or this one I don't know if you guys can see it but I'm gonna be going in with this brown shade over here yeah that's brown shade and I'm also gonna be using this this orange shade so this one and this orange are the only two shades that I'm gonna use and there's a video so first I'm gonna go in I want to go in with what the yellow and my lid I'm gonna go so hooda what the orange in my lid and I'm using this a brush from Ecotools [Music] and just like a meth what do you do on the left is what you do on the right of except I didn't start it on the right side so yeah but what you do on the right side do and you left back because as you can see already my my palate is not it's not that pigmented hence I didn't even want to sit my my concealer with powder because you guys and be with this eyeshadow pen that I go through the most we did I get this I should repeal it I don't know I don't know where I've got it I think I got it somewhere Victoria you know small street vibes shandies some way they got it they was one of those first pellets that I cut when I started learning how to do makeup so yeah so now I'm gonna go into my lid with my brown shade that I'm using the very same brush I don't know why but I always do that so if you aren't that much of a perfectionist Hanako change your brushes so what you wanna do so yeah I'm just gonna go into my lid with this brown shade and I'm just gonna blend it over the orange shade so now to to clean up my the size of my eyeshadow I'm gonna use a q-tip and my masala water you can also use concealer I eat I saw this technique from from guy a couple of days ago so I'm gonna just gonna use my micellar water which I'm almost out of and I'm gonna put my q-tip in there get it wet and this helps you get that went if it's clean ring effect okay guys so there we go I know my my eyeshadow isn't exactly coming through but that's intentional because I never when I'm going for some old look I never want my eyeshadow to go crazy and be like hello hi I'm here so yeah I know it looks as if I don't have any eyeshadow on but this is just how I like it when I'm going for a much simpler look that's how I wanted to Kate this is what I wanted to look like to not look I don't want it to look extra I don't want it to look crazy you know anything cuz I'll be in a rush most of the times when I do this look that's why it's my coat to look and I never wanna go hot side with a half face tan or with lashes and no eye shadow I feel like I look crazy I feel like I look like a dad I feel like I look stupid that's how I feel if you like I look like a red when I do that and when other people who do it I don't find it weird I feel like it looks cute on them but when I try it I'm like sis who was you when I was you so next up I'm gonna set my my face I use these two settings phrase usually to set my face so I'm gonna set my face using my setting spray I don't like the feeling of Padma on my skin because I don't have any skin either so I'm just choosing the settings ready to set my face okay so next I'm gonna go in with the black on pure foundation yo Sam B it's almost almost done so I'm gonna use about 2 to 3 pounds of this and I'm just gonna grab my Beauty Blender [Music] the stick concealer in the shade met honey the cover stick I'm just gonna highlight my face using it to bring back color and [Music] I'm not a makeup artist I'm not a makeup artist so if you are watching this and you feel like coming at me to come and tell me what I'm doing wrong in this

concealer and I'm gonna use this you know when I use this Ben Nye banana powder [Music] [Music] okay guys so now I'm gonna control my face now and controlling my face I'm gonna use the very same brand shade that I used on my eyelid where is it yeah I'm controlling my face using this Ecotools classic foundation brush this is what it looks like this is what the brush looks like does that have a number in its nap it's just called the thoracic foundation brush from Ecotools it was a gift some time ago you you guys and then - sorry control my nose I'm gonna use um it's still a co2 so basically

progress slowly but surely so I'm gonna now control my nose using that it has two ends so I'm gonna use this end and I feel can see it when I use this end it's quote that line brush the very same color that I went in this you yes most contouring is is an arts and if your contouring isn't what you guys so now that I'm done contouring me I'm just gonna go in with the setting powder and just go under my cheek contour just to you know give it a more chiseled look yahweh doctor so I'm gonna dust off my said I'm kind of minority and brush [Music] [Music] the pits do you know the pits so what you got basically did was he I was gonna put on my lash glue on my lashes and I happened to put on a whole light it's just like and it's all out all over my leash I don't even know what to do with

"Um-nL847r-Y": "[Music] hello boys and girls um today is the first day for most of you guys back at school whether you're virtual or you're in person so guess what that means our art at home lessons are going to be starting back up this lesson we're going to focus on our warm colors and our cool colors we're also going to be featuring an artist this time with each lesson so a little something different but we we wanted to give you guys a little more information and get your brains thinking and so with each lesson we will be introducing an artist so our warm colors let's start there our red yellow and orange those are the colors that represent heat or make you feel warm and then our cool colors are purple blue and green those are the colors that kind of make you feel cool and calm so those are purple blue and green i kind of have a different color green but any purple blue or green so if you had a light purple that would be a cool color if you had a teal blue that would be a cool color what would pink be would pink be considered a cool color or a warm color think about that well pink would be considered a warm color because it is a shade of red and red is our warm color we have two neutral colors black and white and so when you add white to a color you lighten it and when you add black to a color you darken it but pink because it is a shade of red it's going to be a warm color the artist that we will be featuring with this lesson is alma thomas and i'm going to give you a little bit of information about her she was born in 1891 and she died in 1978 she was born in columbus georgia the oldest of four girls in 1907 her family moved to washington dc as a girl thomas dreamed of being an architect and building bridges but there were few women architects instead she attended howard university becoming its first fine artist graduate in 1912 1924 sorry in 1924 thomas began a 35-year career teaching art at a washington dc junior high school she was devoted to her students and organized art clubs lectures and student exhibitions teaching allowed her to support herself while pursuing her own painting part-time she debuted her first abstract work exhibition at howard in 1966 at the age of 75. thomas began an important became a an important role model for women african americans and older artists she was the first african-american woman to have also to have a solo exhibition at new york's whitney's museum of american art and she exhibited her paintings at the white house three different times so she's a pretty famous woman and we're going to talk more about the types of art that she did so the type of art she did was a lot like mosaic art only she just used paint instead of tiles in this picture you can see a radial design the design is in a circular motion she went from cool colors to warm colors another type of design that she would often do would be a vertical design making straight lines of colors up and down and the third type of design that she did was a horizontal design making straight lines going from side to side here are some of her pieces of art this is a radial design this is a vertical from top to bottom here's another radial design and another vertical design we are going to be making some radial and vertical designs using our warm and cool colors alma thomas warm and cool color lesson for second and third graders for this project you will need construction paper you will need warm and cool colors construction paper you will also need some glue any kind of glue i love this elmer's school glue it dries clear and washes off super super easy you will need to choose a color for your background i would recommend maybe a light blue or black it's really up to you i'm gonna go with black i'm gonna set these other colors aside for right now you will also be needing a pencil and something round to trace it i have this cool little circle stencil you can take taken and trace like the top of a cup or the bottom of i could trace this bottom of this paint jar it's completely up to you let's start with our sun so for your sun you have to choose what color you want to make your circle is your sun going to be red yellow or orange i think i'm gonna make my sun orange so i'm gonna lay this down right here trace my circle and cut it out going to set that color aside i will be needing it again so here's my sun you can have your sun offset to the side you can have it right in the center it's completely up to you i'm just going to use a dot of glue one dot not a lot and i'm going to offset mine so my sun is going to set right there now we're going to move on to the bottom of our picture and so for the bottom of our picture we're going to use cool colors so i've got a couple different shades of blue and green i'm gonna start with green and i love this project kids love this project it's a paper tearing project so what you're gonna do is you're just gonna start really carefully with two hands tearing up and down this paper very slowly using both hands just like so if you don't go slow and you don't use both hands and you just rip it you're not going to get it ripped all the way across like what we want so you have to tear slow and use both hands this is my grass so i'm just going to add some dots of glue i'm gonna go back in the between so not a lot and then i'm just gonna line it up with the bottom of my paper and glue it down this is my grass now in my grass i'm going to add some water so i'm going to take my dark blue first and i'm just going to kind of tear this time i don't want my water to go all the way across my paper and right over here or you can put it over here or you can put it right in the center this is going to be my little pond and it's gonna hang off a little bit but that's okay i'll show you how to trim up these edges when we are all finished and i'm gonna come back in here it's always fun the more layers the more different shades or colors you get it makes your picture better so i'm going to come in here with this light blue and i'm just going to tear slowly again and again i don't need a lot i don't want it to go all the way across and i'm going to tear it to kind of fit inside this blue that i have just like so oops and i'm just going to set it right there so this is my water there's a little pond or a little lake got my grass now we're going to work on our sky for our sky it's going to be a little bit different but you're going to keep paper tearing we are only going to use our warm colors so our red yellows and orange it does not matter what color you start with after the your color of your sun you can switch it up and do a different color or you can stick with the same color as your sun so what we're going to do is i'm just going to tear real slowly just a straight strip and then i'm going to tear this into little pieces [Music] all right now with my glue i'm going to go around my sun and do some dots and i'm gonna put a yellow piece of paper on every dot i'm going to go around and i'm going to do that again i'm going to put another row of dots [Music] do [Music] all finished i also did a pattern orange yellow red red orange yellow red red have fun making your alma thomas can't wait to see what you create", "8O2_8UI1pzE": "[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] what is up you guys welcome back

you're coming down this get into this B D so guys um in this video I'm going to be showing you guys my foundation routine I've tied up my hair so that anyway irritate me okay you know this weed stuff is just anyways let's get into it so the first thing that I'm gonna do is a prime at my face I'm using the trees fine and what the point fun place my skin has had better days okay but it's cool cause we ain't got no look why you got me Phillips you got it yeah so my skin has seen better days but it is getting a lot better so we have front you see it's okay so now that I've primed my face I'm gonna go into my foundation so I have this foundation which is the Inglot cream foundation it's as dark as you can see and I have my Matic which is a lot more orange than my actual skin tone so I like to mix those two not too much so I start with like that and then I'm going to use this little brush and mix it together it's still not like my perfect shade but I think it's like first enough to match with like the rest of my body so see it's not too late [Music] and then I'm gonna go in with my stippling brush from Real Techniques and then I'm gonna go in with my Real Techniques sponge anyways we're going to blend that foundation into the face next I'm going to highlight my face and with that I go in with two concealers the first one is the Real Techniques I can see light in the color horn that forms like the base of my hydrating so I just got right under the ass and really close to the noise that way that will help would like our contour contour like that put some on the chin and then some of that on the forehead sorry about the very changing but I've got my ring line then some on the forehead and then before that even before I blend that in I'm just gonna go in with my Maybelline fit me concealer in the color 40 that is much lighter than phone and my African culture I'm gonna go in back with my sponge then I'm going to do my nasal highlight and I just bring that Maybelline fit me I mean and then we're gonna go into our contouring so I usually start with like my cheekbones and my jawline so I'm gonna go in with the LA girl Pro concealer in the color beautiful bronze yes beautiful bronze I kind of just this women basically finished but I kind of just put one some on the back of my hand just to make sure that I don't put too much and then some people you can see you can kind of see my shadow over there but I also like to put the fish face so you guys I didn't realize my so you just do the contour here get back into that and then do your jaw line so you do the jawline just to make sure that the foundation because the fat you see how it's like my we're still gonna get middle but that's darker in here so you want to avoid that align and then we're gonna go into my voyage then I take my flat brush [Music] you can tell me look a little queasy at first but don't worry [Music] then we'll go back in without a sponsor I like to use the back for my contours and then it's time for the nasal contour now with that what I like to do is the instrument so with that I like to start on the bridge of the nose so I make three dots using the Maybelline fit me concealer in a darker shade in the collapse sixty and I'm basically just gonna like that you don't want to put too much because then and then I used this small angled brush and then I just bring it back up [Music] because you don't want your little Club you see how it's like it's there but it's not and now it's time for us to sit out fit so all the weight products are on our face I've been coming together okay so the first thing that I do is say it's my highlight now with that I use my Sasha buttercup now this Sasha Buttercup is really yellow [Applause] - Sasha Buttercup is really yellow but I'll show you guys how I fix that so then I use these little sponges that I've got from disk in it like comes in a flower shade and they're like that corner so I basically just dip that sponge into the Sasha Buttercup that's some of that just we don't want too much we don't want to be looking like we've got jaundice you know so I start with my nasal compost today then I'm going to take my setting brush just there for but I'm leaving my nasal contour my nasal one day and then I'm gonna go it into so that's what we've done right now probably gonna say that a little bit just you don't have to do it in for the forehead because you don't wanna be too yellow and you don't want to cross like a white Denise and just use whatever there and that's fine just use it on the forehead and then I am going to set my contour so I'm using my essence trio contouring palette and I like to use this color and this color together just kind of mix those tap that excess away circular motions [Music] see how it blends nicely then we are going to set our nasal culture now with that I use the darkest shade of the trio just roll that skinny brush that I used to actually apply my contour with the concealer and then just roll it and lay a little bit does that excess away and then it's basically left tracing and coloring in then it's gonna take your sponge once again but this time you're gonna go into your Mac Studio Fix foundation mine is in the color in C 45 take that very same sponge on the other side and just run that sponge on there and just cause like do that difficulty finding line unto the control then you just sit [Music] just to get rid of that yellowness see how it's even like it's less yellow now go to scale you know it's not that I need a skin you know is but you know so now we're looking a little too Brown yeah so I like to go in with my essence once again it's a flash play and this is play it's peach and I use this is technically a contouring brush but I don't like using it for contouring so I use a blush and I just dip my brush in today as just a little bit of color not too much I love the essence blush place because it's not too like it's pigmented enough for you to see that there's something there but it's like not like somebody's like and then remember we did our contract to go back again and the last step is to set our makeup so I like to use two cities face now this one is absolutely amazing I'm using the in essence instant mats y'all listen you don't got to be spinning 300 grand on setting spray because this baby right here told you the trick and she keeps you mad although my skin is a bit oily because it's winter so I start like getting oily around here like in my t-zone but again it's not playing so just set the face and then unlikely go in with my mac fix+ and that is all if you want to you can add a lippy but for me it's a basic lipgloss take kind of day I'm not feeling like doing anything on my lips so I'm just going to keep it like this but if you guys would like to know more information about this here I will leave it down in the description box it is a bob wig from bahu me bundles my friend selfie hates her hair

but I'm gonna be following the first one so what I'm gonna be using is water spritz bottle I'm just gonna be using this curl honey it's a curl cream medium control I usually use it for my wash and gos but I figured I could probably use it for this cuz at the hair salon where I got this the ladies they usually use it for setting styles for stars that neither set so I guess I can use it as on so yeah so I'm not using the exact same products that she is and also I'll be using the purple roses cherlene use the orange roses in her first video which I also have here I'll only be using these for the small sections but I I think I'll be able to use all of the song on all of my hair and also another thing that I did is in the shower I kind of made these pots so I parted my hair down the middle like this section here I made this section so it's more this just as thick as as the ruler and I carried that all the way to the back and then on the sides I did the same thing except I made sure these sections were about this size like that and then yeah I mean you know what I mean guys so hopefully this will make it much easier so that I don't have to pop my hair on the girl as cherylin does it because obviously she's a pro at this and I'm not all I'm gonna do is basically just like take small sections as I go and then roll it and hopefully it's gonna be easy hey let's watch Sharon's video okay so I'm gonna start off on this because I mean it's right here and hopefully you'll be the easiest she's thoughts at the back but I don't have the skills to be starting at the back so I'm gonna start at the front so I can actually see what I'm doing and so hopefully by the time I'm at the back I've already got the feel of it I had to do some research on trellises I've tried reading the sense before as yet I've tried a rose I said before like myself and from research they said that the amount of hair that she grabbed for each ruler should be more or less the diameter of the ruler so I'm gonna use that rule to measure out my small sections I know sherlyn just she just pots because she just has a feel for this okay so about that and then I'm gonna go in there with my rat toothed comb okay actually that's better okay okay I think that's quite straight and now I'm just gonna keep this away I'm gonna test it up just so my hair doesn't get tangled okay now focusing on this section I'm gonna grab some of the curl what not nothing not my hair still pretty wet so I'm not gonna spritz it just yet so I'm gonna apply about bad mom can you see can you see can you see it if you can see and then starting with the ends then working my way up okay then I actually decided to buy a bit more credit because I thought like my head was dry by dry I mean like not the opposite of wet I don't mean like dry as an offset of moisturize just to make that clear ah actually had to step out of camera just to I needed to go find myself I needed to take a moment because I was struggling here in front of the camera for 15 minutes and I just didn't feel like wasting my battery like that I went and I rewatched Sharon's video until I figured out the technique until I could do what she was doing and I think I managed to get it so I had already put this in earlier but I decided to undo it so I can show you what I'm done and hopefully if it works out that means I've discovered it so anyway those sections probably dry so first things first I actually went to mint this the night was too thick yay me with my crease sections all that pre sectioning for nothing basically actually not for nothing I mean I just need to make them slightly thinner which isn't too bad and then I also made this section smaller as well I think I had too much hair going on and it wasn't working and then another thing that I realized that I realized that I was really my hair down here and this wasn't working I actually need to do it like straight above okay let's do like this and then I detangle with rolla and then I put my ends on the as I move down a kind of move up so that I can make sure everything smooth I'm just making sure that ends up getting in I feel like the section should still be a bit more small died and if I make it smaller and now this gets pinned where would I even pin this okay I think I need up enough on the inside I think I'm gonna put a bobby pin here for now just because I don't know a way to pin this just to create a secure base okay bobby pin to the rescue okay I think I need one more okay okay I'm not planning on Bobby pinning everything that's just for now hopefully this will be easier so I mentioned with the Riddler but I'm gonna take a little bit less now what the really little requires this is so much harder than what I thought it would be I'm gonna actually start working from the back just because I feel like it works better because when I'm detangling I kind of and want to do things forward and it's just open having something in front so I'm gonna stop on the back or while I'm going to continue from the back I'll probably leave these two I'm next I feel like their position than what good place then I'll come back that's another thing I think I haven't been adding in the product I'm trying not to add too much product because I want my hair to dry quickly I think I need to add some more pilot just to make sure that my hair actually like goes onto the roller more smoothly okay so grabbing one of these I'm going to pin it on the floor [Music] - dude one two three four five and as I said I was gonna start from here so I actually ended these now and I started from here and then I would marry so yeah so I'm gonna show you what I've been doing I must say my hair is not as smooth as I want it to be especially around the root section know if you'll be able to see but it's not as me that I would had wanted it to be and by this point I've kind of gotten a feel for how thick my sections need to be I'm not using that rule that I was using before it's just it's too much hair so I need slightly less I like to take this a little bit of high okay so then I'm gonna wrap that around and then work my way down but at the same time I'm making sure that I'm moving up a little bit so that I kind of D time with my hair as I made love making sure that none of the hay is falling off the rover and then I'm trying to smooth the hair on to the river water [Music] yeah what were you saying just had an inspiring talk with Sheldon telling me how I couldn't do this guys don't give up on your first try hey let me look at me okay I guess I'm just gonna have to have a ruler ride on my forehead that's just how it's gonna be but you know what I'm gonna use an orange one because it's smaller guys I've been doing this for so long I supposed to go to the gym today and I didn't because I've been doing my hair oh my goodness my hair is taking over my life and I'm joking I didn't do this every day don't try this at home kids no I mean try this at home I'm gonna be putting this here I don't think I've actually showed you so I kind of stick it somewhere in the middle and then it goes through the other one and then it stays so my camera and she died and I managed to do all of these basically another two here and then pour down here and then four here these two are once again like glue tree on my neck this one's by my ear scratch in my era oh my goodness it's almost gonna be 12 hours since I've been doing my hair so my sections are definitely much smaller so which hopefully means they'll dry quicker and I'm still applying the curl honey thingie yes I'm rolling it up and I'm trying to assist Smith which is supersoul I'm trying to smooth my hair onto the road and at the same time making sure that none of the hair there are no hair pieces sticking beyond the ruler and then a position and this part I think is Eric okay I'm just gonna grab this and pin it at the bottom if it would allow me that is okay that clip isn't doing anything okay I think that's more stable now be beyond yeah at this point I'm just even parting with my fingers I'm just hoping that my hair dries by tomorrow 9:00 a.m. because I have a meeting with my Lightroom and there is no way there is literally no way I'm gonna be showing up and writers [Music] [Music] [Music] it's almost 12 o'clock and I managed to finish these words I should really hurt my ears I wonder if I could put something okay here's my satin scoffs I'm just going to sleep I'll no said I'm gonna sleep another hooded drive but okay of course that's not gonna happen I wish though I'm going to go under the hood of dryer for probably about two hours as long as I can withstand it and then I'm gonna see if I can sleep with these on I'm going to apply some heat protectant and I'm just using the GHD protect spray let me give you guys the 365th let me put this on now oh I think I'm gonna have to tie it like this okay so this is how I'm going to be looking for the next few hours and I'll come back once my hair is dry hopefully it'll be dry tomorrow you probably wondering why I have these here it's just tissue toilet paper actually that I put on top of my ears because these things are scratching me someone trying to be very careful because they're awesome like okay no let's do this one I'm gonna know what I was saying what was I saying before I got so distracted by my hair okay I'll say I'm taking this off very carefully because I don't want to snag any of the strands and are illegally migrating to other rivers if you know what I mean okay so this part is so nice and fluffy because I took it out early on and then I combed it and then I put it back in so that's how it's nice and fluffy on the racetrack of the racetrack yeah the bits are dry the roots are dry the roots are Jack the roots are dry I can't believe my hands drive this is so satisfying I should have such a bad headache I didn't even get headaches but this is giving me a headache call me to remove all this on my ear oh my ear my other year freedom [Music] and I actually put some clips in certain sections where part like there was a lot of flyaways just to keep it all smooth [Music] these are the results I don't know what to do with my hair I know I think I might come out each section I just let it be fluffy like this pot here because these these curls are cute it's just they're not information you can this one decide what it wants to do does it wanna be part of the family doesn't want to be an individual like what doesn't want to do not know if I should separate should I separate I'll come back once I've bought some sort of style on my hair cuz right now I'm just okay okay this is how it's looking so far so I kind of just separated the hair and fluffed it out so basically I'll show you what I've done I just grabbed these sections and then I just kind of chromed it out and then I haven't separated all the sections but I think I need to do more separating especially at the but the big back parts the big parts here is ones definitely needs separating and then I just curled at the end I think I'm gonna pin this pot back somehow my hair feels moisturized film oyster eyes and light and fluffy I actually enjoyed this I wasn't kind of feeling the results at first but no I'm like come through come through come through skirl ZAR these whose hair is this guy's it's so light and fluffy like it's a pity I don't know how long this has been a loss I think I can pineapple it animal awesome but I'm really happy about this and nothing to lie let me know what you guys think it's very fluffy which I'm not mad about mica definitely trying to improve my technique to make it look more sleep but actually I like this and I feel like if in three days it's not curling any more I can use it to style my hair in a different way or just as a baseball protective style Cheryl and Sherri hmm girl you're never not the sad part is I'm not even going out anyone with

video huh packing the man is gone she like I smell Cologne yeah I just I need air the Mon yeah yeah hi guys Danielle here welcome back to my channel so in today's video as you can tell by the title we're going to talk about the best edge control for 4c hair so I have 4c hair if you can tell me my hair I'm probably really can't cuz I haven't braids my hair is like kinky curly I'm a hundred percent natural I didn't do the big chop a couple of years ago I do have that video on my channel it's really know so you know excuse me about the quality and whatever but I didn't do the big chop a while ago probably like 2016 I think was the year and I absolutely loved it but then I didn't let my hair grow back and right now I can't say that my hair is not the link that it's supposed to be because I have not been taken care of it I do the wigs and brains and all this other stuff but just because you wear the protective style does not mean you're not supposed to also take care of your hair and that is what I have never taken care of my hair so my hairdo stops about like right here and I trimmed it so it's you know it's supposed to be longer than that but it's not whatever you know whatever is no big deal so that is not what today's video is about today's video is about the bench edge control for your hair now I have like a lot of edge control here you guys can see by the thumbnail that I have a lot of edge control and I couldn't even get all the edge control that I have in that picture because the way I was trying to hold it and whatever I just couldn't get all of it in picture so let's just start by my least favorite edge control because I have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 different types of edge control here and if for me it was trial and error trying to figure out which one works best for me because what works best for me probably don't work best for you and wait get works best for you definitely always I mean I have used some edge control that people recommend and it has been trash so you can tell right now that my edges are done and I use well we're not gonna talk about that because that's my favorite so I'm gonna we're gonna start by my least favorite so my least favorite would be this left jam coconut and avocado all moisture and shine gel and this is what it looks like so open it up it's like really really like like Jam almost it's really shaky it's like almost like slime if you would this was $4.99 for this container and I don't know if I was doing like a leave out like a washing go I would probably use this because this would probably move much for that but for its a hole in my head no in any sense it has like a mega hole a mega hole from who sweat not for me like this would be my least favorite hey don't do anything it don't really hold like it it has like a nice shine to it but it's too slimy for my for my liking so my Mets would be let's do this can to natural hair extreme holes edge style jail so this is what it looks like and most of this probably is gone because I had this for a WoW and I don't even know if edge control expires because I have had this for like I want to say two years so probably bet then it probably was good for plate for edges for like a whole nah it's it's not holding anything like it won't even hold it can't even hold water like this no this doesn't hold anything especially for 4c hair that night maybe if you have like a fine texture hair white hair almost I don't know maybe we're for you but this doesn't work for me at all and again this is what it looks it's almost like it looks like it can have like a [ __ ] but it ain't holding his hair next would be post out jail super old no I grew up using this right here my mom used it on my hair and it's you still has like that same smell so this is what it looks like it's not really it shaky but not much it has like a thicker type of shape it is black so when your mom did your hair or if you got your hair done with these and leaves like a little black residue around your hair I think as I can remember it this does like a lot when I used to get my hair down with you it's like when I used to get my hair done and all this pony's or whatever this stuff like like crazy um I don't know why I got it now I think I was trying to do something and I'm like well my mom used to using it so let me see if it works and that's probably why I have it I don't remember using it I think when my friend came over shoo some of it so that's why some of it is used but I did buddies and was gonna use it so this says that it is vegan not flaky lies it has a sheen a heart hole and protective it does has a sheen I'm not sure if it is vegan it's it's the alcohol free I don't remember I think it is eka Hall free because I remember like after I got my hair permed my mum put this on my head and it didn't burn flake best ally inflates in flakes like crazy but yeah so next edge booster so I was told that they have like a water one that's like a water activated I think that what's with all when I this does don't work on my hair I got this strawberry said hey it smells like strawberries overly strong cyber strawberry but this doesn't work on my hair maybe if I was getting it put in a ponytail or something like that but honey it doesn't my work on my hair not on 4c hair I have seen videos on YouTube of girls using this and it works on a hair but they can help they didn't have frizzy hair or maybe hair for sea air and they put it on for in the YouTube video and after a while that this no I tried to braid my hair using this and huntoday it's just so it's shaky - also this doesn't work that well on my hair I don't know but I keep it because ponytails so people love this stuff and sometimes I do love it I have like a love-hate relationship with this but this eco styler gel maybe she don't work on 4c hair like I don't know what people be saying my child we're going by hair this is my second container of it oh that was in the bathroom because when I do wear weaves it works for weeds when I try to do my edges for my weaves yeah edges for my red hair no baby no she's sleeping on that leave because that weave is not for AC hair that we just Caucasian hair and this is applied to dry a wet hair where it's desire your mouth through hair so I don't know this is the goat soup for people just not to go to 4c hair sorry it just this avoids me I do like it like I said when I with my weave and I try to sit down managers on my way my red hair no this shine jam now if you get braids and if you girl that frequently do braids shine Jam is done [ __ ] for doing braids oh my god it says this is the extra hole conditioner jail now it has like I used a lot of this cuz I just bought this to know I had this for a while because I've done a lot of race I use this to braid my hair and honey if you want your hair to help like that hole especially when you get in braids and stuff like that this is just [ __ ] for edges no baby so edges this is curling right up now I gotta understand like you'll get my braids together but you won't get my edges together like I don't understand what's going on um yeah this is awesome right here like I said I used it for braiding my hair and to get those parts in just right like you do part in your hair this and I fine-tooth comb they working together they work these together work some magic hunty like braze whatever like if you just want a nice part on the side of your head before ponytails these but edges snowman no I like it though cuz I keep them keeping my hair in some braids lately Oh Gorillaz not this is the extra hole when this hat is like on the meter right here in hands 10 now this does hole I'm not gonna life that this is Gorillaz night and on the picture of it it's like punching some people the person on the bottle has like a little spite hair this does hold maybe there's this hole this this hole this this hole you like together like you can use this [ __ ] to patch up a boat it holds but it's late it leaves like this like orange yellow because I use this today and then before I gave my edges today it had like yellow like flakes like just yellow because it's like orange yellow orange it leaves like yellow orange plates all in your head now if I was doing a pony tail or something like that I would definitely slap these on my edges and on my hair but for braids no because it the residue get like all caught up in the breaks like it did me this is great that's why it's like okay I'm gonna have the numbers on here on which number this is because I cannot remember which I see one two three four this is why this is number eight for a hole because it does hold amazing it just leaves like this this yellow residue flaky whatever but the hole for this is amazing I would definitely recommend it for something quit but you know for if you want to like don't use them race don't use their own brain twister that no protective style do not use this because you will regret it so that was eight number nine it's Marie ASHRAE no not just I'm sorry I have two of them so number nine would be the mers edge place so this is what it looks like but the reason why just had another one because I have this one to this one it's my favorite this dream hold see with this one it has like it's white both of them away but this one is more soft like my hand this all in net I use this one cuz my cousin was like oh my god gets the Murrays edge control of his words and I was putting on my hair and my hair was like no no wait like no and I was like but they said that work so what's going on it do work but it doesn't work for a long period of time this would not be something that I put on my head and a long period times and this was something I'm definitely not put on my head so glass side me he cuz maybe she sweats she sweats she don't play cuz it says no flaking she don't flake but she sweats a lot and it says non sticky field that's the lighting I just had the Miss Piggy it's another look at dis women with the extreme ho baby and this one two together so this has got to be and I have the yellow one two down here so the I have to like just like it's a yellow and a black of this Marie's it's a yellow in the black uh please I'm got to be now this women I'll be used for which I put this down for my wigs and when I'm putting my wigs on this stuff like that this hose but it's white so it takes long to dry this home but it is clear baby these two together y'all see my engines whoever made me you to our bomb like you probably use this and this one is much thicker like I had some finish rip it out I'm starting to clip because I did my edges and not recorded but I'm just require a whole nother video for that later wet so I got a clip of me doing my edges which I'm an insert down so the clip the clip that you're saying is my edges getting done and I'm using both of these this stuff holds like no other this stuff is just like I don't even know I don't even know I don't know how to explain it this is definitely my go-to for edges it works is thick it's not flaking and health instantly I didn't even put a scarf on when I did my makeup I just did my edges and then they dry it like that like that that was it with these two with much edge control you got to put a scarf on cuz you don't want it to move and go nowhere which I probably should have put scarf on cuz they probably went be that much curly like it is none but I love this stuff this stuff is amazing this was definitely be my close truthful 4c hair you gotta push the air go and get this I got it out of Walmart I think it was $4.99 and then go get this I also got it I got go please just the other one right together I don't have the receipt here but this is $4.99 and then I think this is like four or five dollars to the store I have like little small bottles which is like $1.99 but it's empty because I do definitely pack so go get the big bottom get these these foods together my edges they're gonna give me through the whole summer if I would protect ourselves I promise you so yeah I'm that is it for edge controls I don't know I think I forgot one I did it did I show I don't think so so this is a 24-hour edutainment this is seven night just like $7.99 for this now this is an extra mega hole which this does I just found this while looking for this way looking for the products for this video I've been looking for this and I always time it was on my cabinet and behind himself so you could tell this is almost going so it's clear and this stuff is amazing it does have an extra mega hole also so if it was anything that I was with my edges it would be this 24-hour a stammer now I know it's a small thing for $7.99 wait guys it works I think other stores you can probably get for cheaper because I think it was $4 billion people so I learned about it so it went up but this trust is bomb this this and this these three black containers bomb use these on your hair if you want them edges to lay down they will when you tell a kid then I'm tapping out Debbie's they'll and down to go to sleep with this this right here so use this for some edges so that would be it if you guys know some other edge control that you think is bomb let me know down below in the comment section I have heard the smaller thing of edge booster the one that's not water-based is really good so I'm gonna try that but this was not that good um it's my whole power of fire use let me know of the edge control that you like that's good for frizzy hair down below in the comment section don't forget to Like comment share and subscribe and that is it and I will see you guys in my next video bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "RlsyoEEchU0": "hey dolls in this video I'll show you how you can get your flexi rod sets to look like blonde curls hence the term heatless wand curls or Foe wand curls starting off with dry stretched hair from an old braid I'm gonna take one pack of the orange flexi rods and two packs of the blue size flexi rods for a total of thirty rods be sure to check the description box for the actual size of the flexi rods in this video if this is your first time trying out flexi rods or if you have issues installing them be sure to check the description box to find my detailed video on how to roll flexi rods where I'll show you all these different methods on how you can roll the rods now the method I'm using today is the third one I show in that video which will result in some beautiful heatless waves you basically want to grab a small section of hair depending on the size of your rods and apply your favorite styling products here I'm using three pumps of the Shea Moisture coconut and hibiscus mousse and a little bit of the curls blueberry bliss twist and shower cream now to speed up the drying time I suggest you avoid using any water so make sure you choose a product that will be able to moisturize and hold the curl next you want to make sure you really brush and smooth out your curl pattern now place the flexi rod on your roots and use a twisting motion to roll your hair around the flexi rod while your hair is tight and smooth around the rod and try to keep the hair evenly spaced throughout the rod to get the perfect definition once you finish rolling this section of hair bend the rod at the root and you can either secure the ends by placing some product on the ends to sort of glue it on the rod or just bend the flexi rod to keep the ends from unraveling I'll slow it down and show you the motion one more time place the flexi rod directly on your scalp and simultaneously twist and wrap the hair around the rod now to describe the motion as you can see when I bring the hair under and around I'm rolling my wrist in a circular like motion to make sure the hair is getting twisted so that it remains thin as it's wrapped around the rod rather than flat and wide remember to twist tightly and once you reach the end bend the rod at the root and use a little product to secure the ends or you can just simply bend the Flex lock so once you finish your hair will look a little something like this and depending on if you intend on sleeping in them or if you plan to stay under the dryer you can position and Bend the rods to fit accordingly now whatever your drying preference is just make sure your hair is completely dry before taking the rods down to avoid frizzy results I personally prefer to air dry but I was in a rush this time so I sprayed something you protect it and set under the dryer on high heat for an hour now to take the rods down all you have to do is um bend it at the root and arrival the hair by rolling the rod in the opposite direction in which you rolled it in now once you finish taking down all the rods lightly put your hands in some oil and separate each curl where it naturally wants to separate then you can just pick and fluff your hair until you reached your desired look as I mentioned before I did use a total of thirty rods for this style but I definitely will be using an extra pack of the blue rods next time because I was kind of running out of rods when I reached the front portion of the left side so did have to grab bigger sections which did result in a thicker curl so I would suggest if you want your hair to look like the right side just make sure you have enough rods in handy so you can use smaller sections throughout your entire head now another tip is to place bigger size flexi rods on the bottom portions of your hair if you want to keep some length but that's pretty much it you guys a great way to achieve some beautiful heatless curls now this style is perfect for transitioners or just anybody that wants to avoid heat to stop comment below and let me know this video helped you out and if you drop this down don't forget to hit the like button so more people can find this video and make sure you

"fMVhOzPYsas": "[Music] hello this is number 74 hi my name is Yuki and if you are a returning subscriber welcome back as many of you may know I am more in seeking make up side of things as far as YouTube goes but I have now found a way to start incorporating my first love which is nail a lot of you may not know this but I have an obsession with nail polishes not an obsession no no no it's not that bad I have actually loved nail designs nail art and anything related to nails for a very long time way before I started applying makeup but because I can't have on any fake nails for work and I can't even have my natural nails be super long it kind of deterred me from ever wearing any nail designs that were going to last more than a few days it's been probably over ten years since I last wore press-on so I got on FB and I had to impress on nails and all these designs came up and I was like girl I came across the third Beauty I'm not even sure if I'm saying that correctly was there the third here on YouTube and she had up a video talking about how she gets her press-on nails to last for three weeks I said oh I tried her trick I went on a trip came back and I had to take my nails off for work girl when I tell you that I could not get those press-ons off for the life of me it was so painful it ruined my nail bed because I took the nails off before they were even ready to come off I put them on on a Friday night by Wednesday I try to take them off and oh my goodness it was it was really bad and my nail beds were hurting so much so I've now found a way to be able to wear press-ons temporarily make my own press on my own design if you go through a lot of those press-on nail designs a lot of them look they're pretty up there in price a lot of them are upwards of 40 B it's P depending on how complicated the design is and to be honest over time that is definitely going to add up and if you're like me you like to do things yourself as much as you can and I've got this whole school of nail polishes that I've been collecting for a few years and in case y'all don't believe me is my nail shelf nail polish shelf I've had this for a few years now got it off of ebay the reason why some of them are upside down is because I was trying to like get them to stop separating so much oh yeah that's a lot of nail polish you keep watching this video you'll figure out how exactly I got these without using any glue I'm not really a fan of gel so I don't use gel polishes no to acrylics for me so I'm going to show you guys today not only how to apply these nails to have them on temporarily but also how to paint your own please keep on watching to figure out what I believe for me is the biggest DIY fake nail hack of 2017 so far there are a few things are going to need including a set of nails these ones are coffin shaped nails that I've got on Amazon for $7.99 you will need an orange stick this one comes in a set of 100 that I got for 265 on Amazon some q-tips a nail file and a nail polish I'm using an old bottle of China grave nail polish called sunset sail a small bowl a cup of rice yes I said rice topcoat is optional because the nails can hold up without a topcoat but today I'm using the SC mad about you top coats to mattify my nails and you'll need tape go ahead and open up your nails this is what they look like and you're going to look for the correct size for each of your nails these coffin nails kind of curve up to the tip instead of coming up at a diagonal line but I think they look okay these are very long so you can shape them and cut them down to whatever style you want they have a weird notch at the tip so just falling down a few times to remove the little piece sticking up this is something this herb you did in our video I do have a different method without q-tips and tape that I used to stabilize each nail for nail art designs but I'm going to show this because it's more accessible for most people grab a piece of tape roll it up in words and then out so the sticky part is exposed cut it in half stick it to the back of the nail and then attach the q-tip press hard and you'll be able to paint your nails you don't need a base coat because these nails are fake so just add your first coat of nail polish to get into the bowl or a cup of rice and let that dry add your second coat of polish if needed stick it back into the rice and let that dry applying the top coat is optional because the nails have a pretty good shine without it but I'm making my nails match that's why I'm doing this step a lot of nails to fully dry and mine ended up looking like this just remove the q-tip and a tape and you're ready to move on prepare your nails file them down push back at cuticles I forgot to wipe my nail beds with alcohol by doing this to get rid of excess oils that can prevent adhesive from sticking to your nails properly you can also block your nail beds to get rid of the oils now I'm taking the nail adhesive times I got on Etsy but you can find them on Amazon these ones are pretty big so I prefer it thinner set but try to get one that's close to the size of each nail bed and place them on really make sure it's secured by pressing it down a few times be careful not to touch the bottom of the nail adhesive top too much or also to lose its stickiness then remove the clear plastic layer on your nail adhesive tabs and place your new press-ons on the nail bed be sure to really hold it down and really press hard [Music] do that for all your nails and you're done this next part is optional I'm showing how to prevent the cotton on q-tips from getting in your way when you're painting your nails and also how to place rhinestones on your nails just rip off a few pieces and make sure you still have some left on the q-tip so that it can stick to the tape then roll the q-tip several times and you have a smaller tip this rhinestone picker pencil came in a set of nail tools for 988 on Amazon and the rhinestones are $5.99 on Amazon for a mixture of four hundred and fifty pieces I'm selecting the different size of stones I'm going to use and I do have a different way of adhering the rhinestones to the nails so they don't move at all but for simplicity sake we're going to use a topcoat adding a little bit of it onto the nail and then adding my rhinestone I'm doing one stone at a time so the topcoat doesn't dry down too fast you [Music] they are easy to remove which is what makes them perfect for a special event or a long time use the great part is that they're reusable even if you use nail glue to adhere these to your own nails you can still reuse them as many times as you want you do want to be careful but these nails do not pop off unless you're doing rigorous work with them although you might feel to move a little bit they're easy to remove which is what makes them perfect for a special event or one-time use as I said before I could be very late to this party very very late but it's new to me so I just decided to share it with you guys and I get to use up all the nail polishes that I have that I've not been able to wear for quite some time although my natural nails can grow long a lot of them do break and then I kind of have like these fabric nails it's not cute when you apply polish to that so I can now keep everything short for work and yet still glam it up for events and for these videos and if you're like me you don't have the money to be spent in like 40 50 60 dollars on a set of press-on you know every week or every month so I would rather just use my own nail polishes create my own designs and really get my creative juices going without me having to break the bank so I'm really really loving this hack let me know what you guys think down below did you already know about nail adhesive times did you not also make sure to check out some of my other videos I've got a whole slew of makeup tutorials and a bit of reviews here and there even some vlogs that you can check out I hope you guys enjoyed this video please do not forget to Like comment share and subscribe thumbs it up or thumbs it down I'm not going to judge you I hope to see you in the

panelists so jesse go ahead and take it away great thank you it's a pleasure to be here um with my wonderful panelists um let me just share my screen all right are you are you all seeing that okay great so i'm excited to be here today to talk to you a little bit about the work that we've been doing at mount vernon to really look at our collection in a new way and to find avenues to explore black history within a collection that historically has been primarily used to tell to tell the stories of a very white population specifically the washington family so as most of you probably know mount vernon is about 15 miles south of washington dc on the potomac river it was the home of george washington for 45 years he lived there with his wife martha for the 40 years of their marriage but it was also home to more than 300 men women and children who lived on the plantation in bondage so as you can see from this infographic in the year of washington's death which is the year that we interpret the estate to today there were about half a dozen washington family members about 20 hired white servants and their families and 317 people who were enslaved so the vast vast majority of the people living at mount vernon were living there through no choice of their own um and so their stories have an incredibly important part in the interpretation that we tell at the site today and there are a few different ways that we can tell those stories and i just want to touch on a couple before getting to the the main part of my presentation so we have incredible archaeological resources at mount vernon there have been excavations at the site of the dwellings of enslaved people as well as the cemetery that was used by the enslaved community and those are really valuable in terms of gaining artifacts and knowledge about inside people's lives um in a personal sense so the objects that they used themselves that they acquired that they surrounded themselves with in their own private spaces so this is incredibly useful um for understanding the the personal lives of enslaved people so that's one really valuable resource another is oral history and here you see an image from the exhibition that mary referenced lives bond together which opened in 2016. for this exhibition we interviewed seven descendants of enslaved people to get information about their family histories as well as you know their own pers personal relationships with mount vernon and how they view the connection that they have through their ancestors and so oral history of course is incredibly valuable for understanding black history and the history of enslavement because so many inside people were not able to to become literate and so information was passed down through oral traditions so those are two incredibly important resources but there's a third resource that i think is often not used to understand the experience of enslaved people that i really want to highlight today and that's using the decorative arts collection so using the fine furnishings that are are throughout the house that are often used to talk about the washington's wealth and you know their impressive interiors but less often used to interpret black history or which in this case is the history of enslavement for the most part so there are a few different strategies that we've used especially in the live span together exhibition to really bring out some of these more unexpected stories um as we look at these objects so i want to talk about three of those strategies today the first is really looking at the economic context of these objects and the products that they held so here you see a variety of objects that are associated with sugar and sweetened beverages and rum and those products were the result of enslaved labor sugar was largely harvested on caribbean plantations by captive africans and demand for sugar in the 18th century really fueled the slave trade you know as europeans and colonial americans were um really wanting sugar to sweeten things like tea and coffee and chocolate that created a huge demand which then led to a demand for the labor to to grow that crop and so when we look at these objects you know they're deeply connected to that larger context to that larger story of slavery and it's you know impossible to really understand the the role that they had without looking at that violent history and so when we look at something like this punch bowl which is really beautiful it has this elaborate pattern it was made in china it was kind of one of the the finest examples of chinese expert porcelain from the mid-18th century and that's the story that's often been told about this object when we've displayed it in the past but when we look at this punch bowl now we can think about it in the context of this quote from a visitor to a sugar plantation in barbados who described what might happen to people who were working there so he he wrote if a mill feeder be catched by the finger his whole body is drawn in and is squeezed to pieces if a boiler gets any part into the scalding sugar it sticks like glue or birdline and tis hard to save either limb or life so you can get a sense from that description and how dangerous the conditions were on sugar plantations how high the mortality rate was how likely the people who were forced to work there would have gotten injured and potentially even died and so that history is embedded in this beautiful object and so we really have to tell both of those stories and include that that difficult history alongside the the more traditional history so that's that's one way that we can really incorporate um this other story into the interpretation of these objects another way that we can tell more unexpected stories is by thinking about the everyday use of these objects so here you can see kind of glimpses into some of mount vernon's finely furnished interiors from the doorways and this is the way that a lot of the enslaved people working in the household would have viewed these rooms when the washingtons were occupying them you know from from behind doors from the outskirts but the people who were working in the house were intimately familiar with the objects within it and they were intimately involved in the washington's daily lives within their home and you can get a sense of that from this image of the washington family which is of course very famous this is a print based on an original painting by edward savage which is at the national gallery of art and you can see in the background there's this enslaved man wearing a livery suit and that livery suit was in the colors of the washington coat of arms right wet white and red can't speak um and that really marked him as washington's property very literally his body was considered washington's property and so people like this were constantly in the background of the washington's lives and you can get another sense of that with this sketch from um english architect benjamin henry latrobe he visited mount vernon in the summer of 1796 and um he made this sketch which shows martha washington and her granddaughter nellie custis on the piazza at mount vernon which overlooks the potomac river it's a space that the washingtons used as an outdoor parlor during the summer months and you can see in the background there's a black man standing there most likely enslaved butler frankly and he probably has just brought out the tall hot water urn that you can see has steam coming out of it as well as a tray with a coffee a coffee pitcher and cups on the table for the washingtons to enjoy and so um you know you see his presence in this image but in the final watercolor that latrobe made of the scene which you can see here that figure is missing and so often the labor of insight people within the house has been erased when when these spaces are interpreted and for many years at mount vernon that was that was the case we weren't talking about the fact that enslaved people were constantly there doing all of this work and so one goal that we have is to bring their stories back into the objects that furnish these spaces so we can think about who is actually cooking the food that was served on the washington's fine porcelain who was cleaning those dishes when the meal was over who was polishing the silver who was lighting the candles and the oil lamps when it began to get dark who was helping the washington helping washington shave laying out his clothing cleaning that clothing who was caring for the children who lived at mount vernon all of these objects that you see and basically everything else in our collection is connected to the labor of the people who are working in the house and so um you know when you really [Music] think about the daily use the daily life of these objects it's pretty likely that backhands were touching them more often than white hands that the people who were interacting with them were were more often enslaved people than even the washington family and so their stories the stories of people like caroline branham christopher shields on a judge giles kate many many others their stories are embedded in these objects too and so um one thing that we're striving to do is to to tell their stories as we present these objects to visitors and then finally um the last strategy um or an additional strategy that we've used um is to really look at the provenance of these objects so provenance is just a fancy word for the history of ownership of an object so tracking kind of who has owned an object through time and in the case of this windsor side chair which has a history of belonging to the washingtons in the 18th century sorry my my dog is my arm eager for some attention um uh in the case of this windsor side chair the donor was mary gibson hundley who you can see here um who was a descendant of the scifix family and she was actually a very prominent teacher and civil rights activist she attended radcliffe college in the early 20th century and she can trace her ancestry back to her grandfather william scifix who was an employee of the department of the interior and worked very hard to improve educational opportunities for african-americans in washington d.c his mother mariah syphax had been enslaved at arlington house um the home of george washington park pestis and mariah scifix is um generally believed to be the daughter of george washington park custis with an enslaved woman named ariana carter and so mary gibson hundley was actually a direct descendant of george washington park custis and by extension of martha washington and she in the information that came in with this chair recorded that her grandfather william scifix had actually saved the chair from arlington house during the civil war when the union army was occupying the area and you'll i imagine hear more about this story from kim later on um but it's a really fascinating story that really gets that kind of the complexities of family in the 19th century and the complicated web of relationships among the washington and custis families and how a lot of these objects are really caught up in that complicated web and this was a history um with this object that hadn't really been explored before you know mary gibson hundley's name is on the credit line but nobody had really investigated who she was or used this story as a prominent interpretive point so this is something that we really wanted to highlight and there are actually a couple other objects in the collection as well that have a similar history having descended through the families of formerly enslaved people um so and and i'll also mention there are descendants of the cybex family who were in touch with and they actually didn't know about this chair so it was incredibly powerful to be able to share that information with them and for them to see you know how their ancestors had preserved this object and how it ended up back in mount vernon so with that i will um conclude i'll just mention the lives found together exhibit is open through july so um if any of you are able or would like to go down to mount vernon we are um so you have a few more months to be able to see it um so with that i will hand things over to tiffany thank you jesse and i'm going to share my screen and can everyone see the presentation here okay so uh mary thank you for your earlier introduction and thank you for inviting me today and a big thank you to everyone behind the scenes who's making this presentation happen today i'm going to give you a brief history of the black crafts people digital archive and then i'll move forward into why we do the work that we do and so the bcda began with a project that i started in the summer of 2018 as a graduate student and that project centered on the life of a man named john quash williams and his involvement in the construction of the pinkney mansion pictured here on screen williams was an enslaved and later free master carpenter responsible for the carpentry and joinery work on the circa 1750 pinkey mansion but what emerged from detail research into the records was williams's story along with the stories of several other enslaved craftspeople who were involved in the mansion's construction and not only did these men perform work on the pinkney mansion but records reveal that they also performed work around the city of charleston and the south carolina low country for example charles a carpenter enslaved by charles pinckney and one of the men that john williams supervised on the pinkney mansion project left the site of the pinkney mansion on august 5th 1751 and went to work at pinkney store on the south end of east bay street um and you can see the path that charles might have taken on the map by following the red arrow like charles pompey also left the pinkney mansion in august of 1751 and headed to the harbor and boarded a boat where he would work for the next three days and pompey's possible route is highlighted on the map in blue and while those men were enslaved by the pinkneys and moving throughout the city to various jobs other enslaved crabs people were as well for example in august of 1771 joe an enslaved jeweler self-emancipated from charleston jeweller and enslaver john paul grimke and you can see joe's possible route on the map there in yellow in july of 1777 joe a cell maker self-emancipated from the ship general moultrie at rose's wharf and joe's possible route is highlighted on the map in turquoise and in july of 1780 an enslaved caulker named jack self-emancipated from john russell's home on beaten's alley in charleston and his route is highlighted in orange and so this is an example of where the project first began we started by putting craftspeople on a map out of curiosity we wanted to connect these black crafts people to place because besides place and and besides primary sources place was only the was the only tangible thing left to document their stories and what quickly emerged were the spatial geographies of black crafts people in charleston and across the landscape of the south carolina low country and then we asked ourselves what's next if we could map just a few people and document just a few people what would this look like on a larger scale could we then use these advertisements seeking the return of self-emancipated craftspeople to tell us more about the connections between craftspeople and place and so the black craftspeople digital archive was born and the stories that i just mentioned and others form the foundation of the project it is a digital humanities site dedicated to documenting the lives and experiences of black crafts people from about 1619 through 1900 and the website is currently home to records connected to the lives of 960 black crafts people both men and women both free and enslaved involved in 46 total trades from will rights and tanners to cabinet makers and goldsmiths who lived and labored in the 18th century south carolina lowcountry as well as 19th century tennessee and we launched the beta or testing version of this site on august 31st 2020 and we launched phase two of this website just this past wednesday which brought tennessee into the fold and working together as a team we consulted with digital humanists gis developers archivists and website designers to complete what you see here and so the project has two main components that are live right now and the first component is the archive the archives page will bring you here where you have the option to browse by collection organized by trade or use the search engine to find black crafts people by keyword or even to contribute your own research or knowledge on black crafts people fully attributed to you and browsing browsing the collections will bring you to a page where you can explore all of the collections that we currently have and the selection of a trade and a craftsperson will bring you to that person's profile the profiles are organized using dublin core standards and they include facts about the craftsperson's life primary source documentation in this instance a runaway slave advertisement and a transcription of that advertisement and so in this example we can see the profile of an enslaved spinner named judy george muckinfoose held judy in bondage and on august 25th 1779 he placed a notice in the south carolina gazette that judy had self-emancipated and left his bondage with a free man of color named andrew and the second component of the bcda is a digital map placing black crafts people on the landscape on the landscape of south carolina and now also tennessee and a click over to the maps page will bring you here where you can search the data in a variety of ways you can use the if i can find my mouse here there we go you can use the trade count section by clicking on the bar graphs to select a specific trade um you can click the blue arrow to the left of the screen and search through a set of drop down menus and you can skip both of those options and search by pie chart clicking a specific trade on the pie chart allows you to see individuals involved in that trade only and here i've selected shoemaker and so if we switch back to the map view you can see that each of the light gray dots on the map represent brick layers and if you were to click one of the dots you would then get this information box on london an enslaved bricklayer who self-emancipated from thomas forest plantation in saint mark's parish sumpter county south carolina included in this box if you scroll down is a link that will connect this dot on the map to the primary source information in the archive and so that was a very very brief overview of the archive and the map and now i'd like to spend just a minute and talk about the why why would we begin a project such as this one and the reason is is that i wanted a resource to use that moved beyond the traditional archival collections of craftspeople and just the endless collection and cataloging of names i wanted to better visualize the data i wanted to ask more questions interpret the data i wanted to see these black crafts people and i found that the best way for me to see them was through place i wanted to facilitate discussions on movement hence the creation of the map and i found that there was so much more to the story that the public was not getting for a variety of reasons and one question that i am often asked is how we at the bcda go about doing this work and on screen i'm sharing our three-point methodology and i'm also going to show you um how we put this to work i want to stress that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to this type of work and that this work is also important and and timely and so our methodology first takes these three avenues um and we begin by examining primary and secondary sources and these can be anything from newspaper articles to census records to wills and estate records and we comb through them looking for names and details and we record all of that info for example our latest research into tennessee literally involved us reading the census line by line paying attention to race and occupation looking for black crafts people and then and then next we look at objects and the purpose here is to take existing objects and look at them in new ways research them to find out more about their creation for example if we are taking the antebellum home of an enslaver as an object we would then begin researching to find out who was enslaved there what was the primary output or export of that plantation what skills might uh people enslave there have had and all of those we sort of layer those with the primary sources to begin to flesh out a much larger story and something i should point out about objects here is that when we examine the object we step away from that traditional art history approach of connor sewership and we center the craftsperson and our exploration of those objects and our examinations there and our third avenue of course is place and when i say place i'm thinking you know beyond just latitude and longitude points i'm also thinking about the presence of people on place the effects that of that crafts people had on place and the effects that place had on crafts people and now pre-covet i would go to some of these sites that i was interested in exploring i can't wait to be able um to do that again but again that's all in an effort to be able to tell more about these stories of black crafts people and i also have to mention that all of this uh put together rests on the context of black life we cannot understand black crafts people without understanding uh the tribulations that they faced uh being black in this in this country so that's everything there rest on that context and so um i want to discuss just one minute for one minute how we think about objects in material culture and so when we're presented with objects uh that we can attribute to black crafts people these are the sorts of questions that we began to ask ourselves and as i've mentioned this project is all about centering um black crafts people so when we we definitely begin with the question who made the object of course but then we continue with a series of questions to flesh out the craft person's life one of my favorite questions here on screen is how is craft knowledge produced by black life and when i'm thinking about that i'm thinking about how creators find new ways of doing things and then they spread that knowledge on to people that they are also training um in the trades that they are involved in and so all of this work aids us in telling stories such as the story of the poynter family of williamson county tennessee and richard dick poynter was an enslaved and later free craftsman who was a chairmaker he was born enslaved in virginia and held in bondage by robert poynter of halifax county virginia and when robert poynter and his family relocated to williamson county tennessee in 1816 of course they took uh richard dick pointer along with them and so by 1850 uh richard poynter was placing advertisements in tennessee declaring that he was a free man um and that he was available to make chairs and so richard poynter would go on to create a horsepower chair factory and teach the art of chair making to his family members and some of the chairs crafted by pointer and his family members are pictured here on screen and ever so often uh my friends in the museum field will reach out to me about objects that they find connected to black crafts people and so here annabeth hayes a decorative arts curator at the tennessee state museum reached out to me about a wheel lathe belonging to a black wheel right named william parkey now parkey lived in the rebel hollow community of hancock tennessee and he was both a blacksmith and a will right and so during our conversation anna beth mentioned that the museum of appalachia and clinton tennessee had several objects um involving the family including their blacksmith shop and so i quickly asked her to give me just a moment to hold on because i visited the museum of appalachia as a student years earlier and as i was going through my photographs i actually found out that i had an image of that blacksmith shop that you see pictured here on screen and so this story begins um with patriarch newton parkey born in 1847 died in 1915 who was enslaved uh by a white man named joseph parkey and newton's son william born in 1865 and died in 1932 followed in his father's footsteps and became a woodworker and a blacksmith and then william's son steve parkey born in 1909 died in 1978 continued in that family business and today artifacts from that family including their entire blacksmith shop are being preserved by the museum of appalachia and so to me that's a great tennessee story but it also speaks to the work that we do here at the bcda by collaborating with museums museum curators as well as genealogists and family members to flesh out a much larger story of black craftspeople on the southern landscape and so now i am going to turn the presentation over to ken hello good afternoon everyone thank you so much tiffany and aunt to jessie for such great presentations as you guys were going through your topics you inspired all kinds of ideas in my head but i'm going to try to keep it to 10 i'm trying to keep it to 10 minutes um but let me share my screen here i have been having some internet issues so for some reason i drop off i will just jump right back on just as a warning um i'm located within arlington national cemetery and right next to the pentagon and sometimes sometimes there's just a little bit of interference not that we get paranoid about that or anything um so good afternoon uh my name is kim robinson as mary so graciously introduced us and i am the museum curator for the george washington memorial parkway and nps unit here in the dc metro area i am duty stationed as we like to say in a park service at arlington national cemetery um in arlington and work at arlington house which is located within that site um today um what i thought i would do was look at material culture as it is applied in certain cases within the national park system specifically in regards to how we went about updating our exhibits focused on african-american history here at the 19th century plantation estate as well as how we updated our historic historically furnished period rooms and our dependencies in north and south slave quarters before i dive into the bulk of the presentation i when i begin any talk i always highlight that anything we do here at the park is tied to the national park service missions to preserve and impair the national natural and cultural resources of the park system and to do it for the benefit of our net for in to do it for natural and cultural resources conservation um as one of the 423 now nps units across the country and in our territories we're very proud to tell the stories of all americans at the gwnp so um what really um started us on this journey um was a need for updates and to preservation of the historic structure as well as how we told the stories at the site today following an extensive rehab which you can see in these pictures we are prepared to share the results of our hard work which we're going to get into in a second that includes the rehab of the historic mansion or manor or our main house and of course our historic dependencies the north and south slave quarters here they are today um for those who aren't familiar with arlington house it was owned the plan the original 1100 acre plantation estate was owned by a gentleman named george washington park custis um and it was constructed in three stages between 1802 and 1818. the historic dependencies that we're going to focus on today were construction constructed following the building of the main house between 1818 and 1824. um the collections that we're going to share a few highlights from today include about 40 000 objects um the historic main house itself and its dependencies um were constructed in what's called the greek revival style and the elements and features of all the buildings that we're going to highlight today echo that style while the house was owned by custis it was actually built by a combination of the labor of indentured enslaved and free workers it is actually all the structures that you're going to see today were actually brick buildings and they were covered in stucco and decorated with various faux finishes um arlington also has an interesting legislative history which we don't have time to get into today but it was established as a historic site originally the custis mansion then the custis lee mansion and later arlington house the robert lee memorial in 1925. and became a part of the park system in 1933 along with a host of other sites some of the key figures um that are part of our story include those associated with the washington custis and lee families that includes um george washington procustis who was the grandson of martha first lady martha washington and he actually grew up in mount vernon along with his sister eleanor carcustas and he considered um he george washington was treated as his adopted step or step granddad and they had a very close relationship and he idolized washington and that's actually why arlington house was first built as an early memorial to president washington where he would showcase his washington treasury and things highlighting washington of course we also have um robert e lee and his wife mary anne around of custis lee lee marries into the family he marries mrs lee in 1831 and he becomes a part of the story after that he spent the 30 years living up to the american civil war in part when he wasn't out on various campaigns at arlington of course the stories those aren't the only stories and key figures that we highlight at arlington house we also honor the legacies of those who live work and died at the plantation that includes of course is jesse alluded to mariah scifix her husband charles and their many children um mariah suffex was enslaved at the plantation and was the daughter of mr custis as jesse already highlighted um she was eventually freed and was given property on a plantation estate close to where um henderson hall and the pentagon are today and the family would continue to prosper even to this day and as uh jesse mentioned they are great partners um to numerous institutions the white house the park service as well as mount vernon and um exploring their family's history and helping us to better honor their legacy and we also tell the story of wonderful figures such as selena gray who while she was mrs lee's personal maid her story is so much more than that and that is something we dive into in our exhibits and of course we also tell the story of james parks and his family in their legacy james parks was 18 when the war broke out and he would go on to work for what was the early arlington national cemetery um i highlight those stories because we were able to really dive into the legacies and that history thanks to a generous and what brought us to where we are today with the newly renovated site it's thanks for a generous donation from david rubenstein um not only did it focus on um key uh physical aspects of the site including a rehab of the mansion as well as the out buildings in our grounds to make them more accessible and by as any clearwater we appreciate improvements to our hvac system and our fire suppression miracles but it also involved um group major updates to our interpretive exhibits and the stories that we tell as well as updates to museum collection and conservation and museum collection which gave us a unique opportunity to really reimagine how we tell the many stories of arlington um for the purposes of this exercise we're really going to drill down into the updated interpretive exhibits as well as the museum artifacts featured in our historic dependencies um things to think about as we talk about material culture and this is a part of this process are they reimagining to reimagine interpretive themes that came out of this process the thing that we are hoping that visitors walk away with now when they visit the estate is that this place was a place of division and unification it was a working plantation where many people lived and died um these are also a subset of some of the deeper themes that we are exploring in our new exhibits um again highlighting that while ali is a part of this story he is actually i would argue the smallest part as cumulative like cumulatively i like to point out that he was only here for seven years cumulatively leaving up to the war so but we won't get into those matters right now um but the key themes of arlington that we have recreated are that it's a memorial to george washington that it was a family home to because lee family but that was also almost critically a place where an oppressed community struggled for freedom that it was a trophy of war it went from a trophy of war to hollow ground and that again that it was a place of division and unification all of these themes and ideas fed into how we developed the exhibits and focused on material culture as we were developing our period rooms and our new exhibits the exhibits are spread across what we call five scenes aka five buildings and locations um we today are going to be focusing on scene number two which is in the south slave quarters and we're going to be looking at and objects associated with our exhibits in the slave quarters along with how we reimagined our period rooms through a material culture lens um you know so for the park servers we um look at material culture in a slightly different way but of course we still you know keep in mind that um material culture doesn't accomplish does encompass tools weapons and all these other materials that are produced and used by humans and that of course is the base when we're talking about material culture um i really liked um the statement that i found that just kind of sums up what material culture can mean is that we understand that material culture move this real quick um could see it helped us understand societies of both the past and present and through the careful study and observation of the physical material objects generated from these societies we can have an unders you know so that's why it's so important that we look at objects as a part of understanding our history and our our stories that we tell and how they can tie into that so for the park service that means um when we're trying to understand um cult stories and cultures that we preserve at our sites we translate that through looking at how objects tie to key interpretive themes um when we're selecting objects to put in our period rooms or put an exhibit we carefully examine primary sources and object id those kind of traditional things are a part of what informs our understanding of our collections um for us resources in addition to traditional primary sources like archives and key documents we also look at oil histories that's a huge part of what we do when we're telling the different stories of the park service because of course some communities do not have as much freaking written records so we heavily rely on old history when we are interpreting and telling stories at our sites um in a more traditional sense we're looking at objects and trying to tie them into key themes we're making sure we look heavily at provenance and we also tie that in when we have an object we also tie look at the knowledge of common practices so how are these objects used at other similar states and properties and when we're developing our period rooms especially that helps us frame how we should be furnishing and showcasing them we also look at when we're trying to develop how to use an object for um for various uses we look at our proc records as well as internal external archives and mostly most most importantly we're looking at historical significance of said object so to frame that into a practical context so how does that translate so for example um you know for the purposes of arlington house one of the themes that we were looking at for furnishing the scene to the south slave reporters was when a person's community struggled for freedom and we tried to find objects that tied to that theme um when we were um looking at objects and trying to confirm if they were a fit for that theme we looked at personal correspondence that provided background on them we looked at inventories associated that were associated with the people who owned those objects to confirm that they were at our own um we looked to um the manufacturer information to confirm the author then if the objects were exactly authentic we were very unfortunate fortunate when we were developing our exhibits that we have oral histories associated with the descendants of the enslaved here including the daughters of selena gray and we also you know were looking at records we're looking at if they were donated or purchased and going through accession files and other critical records to confirm the origins of those objects and when we're doing um research into our key documents which we're going to touch on in a second we're looking at conventional and non-conventional sources i found that when we were researching collections that looking at local historical societies as well as local government records was key for us as well as our databases as well as more larger well-known archives like the national archives and library congress and again for us it's all about how these objects tie to key figures and stories so when we're talking about applying a material culture um for the park service there's kind of two main things that i'm going to talk about how we applied it for this project um we were very lucky as a part of their donation to be able to update what's called the historic furnishings report and these reports document furnished things that were exhibited in associated historic structures they document the history of a structured use and these interior appearance and if appropriate provide a plan for recreating or maintaining the historic area so for us that is kind of provides a framework and a foundation for how we go about exhibiting um collections in these spaces so and as we're developing these reports we have we rely heavily on primary sources for example as they were crafting the report for the dependencies um they were able to look through documents such as this inventory of those who were once enslaved at arlington house this was taken from the will of custis which we actually found at not at a archive like the virginia historical society or at national archives it was actually tucked away in the courthouse in old town alexandria in a file cabinet so not the best storage conditions but that's sometime how you find these things so that's something to keep in mind when you're trying to dig into your own personal collections and resources that you have to think about taking an uneven route to get to where you need to go um but so but what these documents do is they provide a list of recommended recommended furnishings based on this careful research that i mentioned and then we apply all that information gathered to the period rooms that you see and they include a combination of reproductions antiques and associated objects all combined and create immersive spaces that help us to tell these stories and really create a real sense of the space so that's a brief very brief and quick overview of how a historic structure's report historic furnishings report can really really help and through a material cultural lens and developing these spaces and then really quickly um another aspect of how we applied material culture um when developing the exhibits was object exhibit curation and selecting artifacts for exhibit the object we're going to touch on really quickly is this cream picture um that is featured in our south slate quarters exhibit so you would think why would so this picture is arjo 216 i have to throw on a catalog number and it was produced circa 1850 if you're familiar with the produce the manufacturer wedgwood you know that they were famous um for their jasperware china china and um this particular piece is a cobalt balloon but made in the neoclassical style features traditional greek and roman figures i mean it has a raised relief and of course wedgewood like all graduate pieces was manufactured in china so why would we feature something like this in the south slate quarters well that is because it ties to selena gray one of the folks that i mentioned at the beginning of my talk so like as i said earlier when we're talking about material culture we're looking at not only how an object fits interpretive themes we're looking at how who is associated with and this object in particular was a gift to the national well it was acquired by the national park service from her one of her daughters pictured here in the center annie baker and a great baker so we know base thanks to our collections records and thanks to the old histories that we have again that primary source research that before the war broke out mrs lee gave that gave that picture to selena gray and that um during the interviews that took place for the restoration of arlington house in the 1920s and 30s annie baker returned that picture to arlington house for use for exhibit and to better honor and highlight the legacy of her family so thanks to um so when we're looking at it through material culture we're looking at when and why we decided to feature that object on our exhibits is that obviously the historical significance and association with selena gray made it something that we wanted to highlight in that space and i should mention that the theme of that space was what was life like for those those who were enslaved once enslaved at that plantation after 1865 what happened to their descendants so this object tied in perfectly with that theme um you know so again historical significance is a huge part of what we're talking about when we're talking about material culture and we also looked at and more traditional um things where we're talking about material culture confirming the origins of the object confirming that it was a westward piece thanks to looking at things like it's maker's mark um looking at similar items on the fair market to confirm its status and resources like that that helped us to confirm objects not only that it's authentic but also that it was suitable to be included in that scene and here it is um in the planning stages and then now on exhibit our exhibits that we hope to open soon um and we're very excited to hopefully share that with the public soon um just really quickly before i wrap up um when i'm when we're doing research and we're not only selecting objects to put an exhibit but also um thinking about acquiring artifacts these are just some of the things we think about in the park service and sources that we use to do that basic idea of objects to confirm that it's authentic and to confirm that it fits into those interpretive themes and in stories that we tell and that's just this example from icom of questions that you should ask when you are thinking about acquiring like thinking about looking for more information of things in your possession and then these are some of the sources that we have used in the past that help us with research into collections and confirming our suitability for exhibit and with that thank you all for having me today i was excited to share a bit about our project and i'm eager to take your questions when we get to that point in the discussion thank you wonderful thank you so much to all three of you for that wonderful discussion it was so great to hear about your work and how you're using material culture and now we are going to ask these folks to apply these skills and perspectives that they've shared with us in real time so i'm going to share with you everybody can see my screen this is a headscarf and certificate of freedom that belong to a woman named catherine taylor this is in the collection of dumbarton house and the nscda and catherine taylor was born around 1820 and died in or around 1892 she was enslaved by the madison family at montpelier and was freed in 1852 this headscarf belonged to her and this is a certificate of freedom from the circuit court of dc uh stating that she and her children are free so jesse kim and tiffany if you came across this object what would you do to keep it safe while you researched it and then what would you do to learn more about it so take all these skills that you've just told us about and and tell us how you would approach this particular object sure i don't know who wants to dive in first but in terms of keeping it safe from a collections management standpoint you would first um if it's a lot of times when we receive gifts or acquire things from a private lender private donor or private company they are not necessarily packed according to what we call archival preservation standards so the first thing we would do is make sure the outer objects the both the letter and the textile were housed in proper archival materials at a ph neutral non-acidic forgive me so we would probably make sure to pack repack the head scarf in particular and unbuffered acid free tissue and then we would probably house it in a properly sized textile box um and then for the archival document um i would say we would probably um oh first of all before going into this i want to consult with a conservator to confirm the condition of the artifact and to if we don't have the money right away to come up with a plan for treatment in the future before we packing it i should have said that at the beginning um you should always consult with a conservator um when regards to your artifacts but for the paper document i would re-house that as well probably house it in a mylar sleeve or mylar along with an archival folder and then store it in an appropriate way until and as a first part of um receiving an artifact before we get into the id side of it sorry i kind of jumped in ladies i don't know if you have anything tiffany or jessie sure sure no no problem kim um what i wanted to say is um for the work that i do i would definitely begin by first dissecting that letter i would make a list of every name jot down the relationships between the names does the letter mention that this woman has children if so i want to jot that down and write down their relationship to the owner of the object and then in thinking about centering them i of course would want to do more background research on that family can i pick them up on later census records can i pick them up on city directories if i can pick them up on a city directory um can i pin and and one of the things i'm aware of is that street names often change over time but one of the things that i'd be attempting to do is of course pulling up earlier maps of the city trying to see if i can pinpoint a location um for them within the city to give me an idea of what their everyday might have been like when they opened the window what would they have seen outside um type of an approach and then i would probably try to trace them throughout history so pulling on a little bit of that genealogy again seeing how far um i could take them um in order to learn more about their family their dynamic and of course the owner of the object and then i would also of course think about additional questions about the object itself what is it made of what's a good description for it is this something that i'm the owner might have that someone might have purchased for her from a store or different things like that how did she come into possession of the object how might she have worn or used the object um and then i would also think about things of identity because when i'm looking at this i'm thinking about that bright red vibrant color right and so thinking about this object in terms of its endormant it as an as an object of adornment um for the owner here and then i would just sort of continue in that line again fleshing out their life thinking about where she might have worn this uh what else she might have paired um with this particular scarf as well and jesse did you want to jump in here yeah so you all have covered a lot um and made some really great points um i will echo some of what kim was saying in terms of the conservation especially of the head scarf textiles are really really rare survivals from the 19th century and earlier because they're so sensitive to things like light and moisture and pests so this is an incredibly unusual survival so it's something that you'd want to be really careful with in terms of how you preserved it and you'd want to make sure that you were taking as many steps as possible to prevent all of those dangers from from worsening its condition i'll also add on to what tiffany was saying in terms of analyzing the object itself you know with something like a textile especially one with a really elaborate pattern like this you can look at the technique that was used to decorate it as well as the details in the decorative motif itself as a way to potentially identify the origin of the of the textile identify perhaps the maker the the manufacturer you can also potentially date it based on the pattern so if you're able to find a similar pattern in a museum's collection or elsewhere that could potentially help you narrow down when it was made and that might help tell you when the owner acquired it which is useful information um and then just again what what tiffany was saying about fashioning identity i think something like this is a really valuable tool for understanding the owner's sense of themself um especially um if she acquired it when she was still enslaved you know what might that have meant to her to have this this item that provided some measure of individuality and might have provided some measure of choice in her appearance when otherwise she likely did not have many choices in her own life so so questions like that can really help flesh out you know how this object came to be where it came from and what it might have meant to the person who owned it that's a great point jesse and i actually have to turn off my video due to my ongoing internet problems um especially i did want to also highlight just as fast to echo jesse's point the fact that um this piece has been preserved from the 19th century it really is rare and that vibrancy vibrant nature of the color the red in particular is also very rare and very incredible um and also i was just wanted to add in terms of like object id and target and things like that um i would also maybe check um various repositories that may have a record of catalog or database of prints or patterns from the 19th century you know i can think off top my head of resources like the victorian albert museum which actually surprisingly has a lot of resources associated with u.s sites or the met might have some records on textiles made in a similar style or vein that is also a research that you can tap and in terms of um doing more information on the associated document the letter um i would maybe also want to check maybe dc government records and archives and see if they have any other materials associated with um mrs tate to see if there's any other information that you can garner about her and her family and their legacy there because i think combining these two objects tell a really powerful story and if there's there may be an opportunity to even find more documents and materials on the provided insight into their background [Music] yeah i'll just add too if you're seeking information especially about dating an object or just wanting to get an idea of where it might have been made or you know or just suggestions on where to learn more your friendly local museum curator is often a good resource and a lot of museums have a kind of collections inquiry general email where you can submit a question for example at mount vernon we have a collections inquiry email where questions come in to curators and we respond to them so you know you can you can ask for for help from people who have experience working with these types of collections and um usually we you know have some type of suggestion even if we can't answer all of your questions um we can point you in in the right direction and i agree with that um i would also say please call because i'd rather much so talk about beautiful head scarfs and historic documents like this than to do what i do yesterday which is fix our security alarm system so you're always here to as a resource wonderful that was amazing thank you all for sharing your your skill in so quickly that was maybe 10 minutes and to just dissect this object and figure out the best method for um finding its its history i think that was really wonderful so for those of you in the audience you are welcome to submit your questions if you have anything you want to know about or you were curious about in the presentation if you have something in your family that you want to know how to how to get the ball rolling on your research from preservation of that object please feel free to submit those questions in the q a box or through uh the chat function and one thing that we were interested in oh you guys already answered all those questions yeah a lot of the questions mary and i hadn't got answered but um i will start with one um um and this is um specifically for you tiffany do you um um how can people get involved um if they think they have resources or can learn more about the black crafts people archive sure so you can email me directly and i'll put my email in the chat box but there's also a part on the website in the archive that there's a link there that says contribute and so it takes you to a forum where you can contribute any info that you have and then all of that shoots directly over to us and then we can reach out to you um we can reach out to you that way as well great um and i i did have another one i'm gonna sneak it in here um so um this um probably applies to both jessie and kim so you can feel free um to answer this but um are there any objects at either of your institutions that you specifically don't um display or are sensitive about displaying or won't display whether it's for fragility or for a sensitive topic um or have to think really deeply about before you interpret them for view yeah we definitely have some um more the ones that spring to mind immediately it's for conservation reasons um for fragility so we have george washington's queue bag or hair bag which if you've seen the gilbert stewart portrait of washington if you look carefully in the back you can see there's kind of a black bag with a bit of a kind of scalloped edge that held his ponytail or cue and that was kind of a style in the 1790s so we have his cue bag it's made of silk but it's incredibly incredibly fragile basically if you breathe on it the wrong way it will start to disintegrate so we have it carefully packed away in our storage facility and you know it's really only available for research and even then we're pretty strict about who we let um access it so that's one where you know we have it documented we have it photographed and so people can can learn about it that way but the object itself is is so fragile that we're hesitant to put it out absolutely and for um for us in particular at arlington but across the parkway really on one of the um groups type collection types that we're challenged to showcase as our archaeological artifacts um we do a lot of um archaeology associated with section 1 section 106 and it's tied to compliance to make sure that we're not damaging expect resources both above and in the ground um so in particular for the arlington project you know as they were doing utilities work as a part of the rehab side of things they came across a lot of artifacts associated with the early history of the site not only tied to the washington but also washington's in the custis and lees but also those things that were tied to the history and legacy of the enslaved and some of those artifacts were sensitive in nature um associated with um for example spiritual or religious practices that we have to be careful about how we highlight and display those being mindful um about how we treat those artifacts um while not at our park while we don't particularly have particularly have any human remains or materials like that associated in our archaeological collections for other parks they do they do hold back on displaying things like that due to the sensitivity issues yeah i would imagine um that would be definitely hard to interpret as well so we did get one um question in the chat um about um on the letters and um how to best preserve some things like letters and paper items um if you can speak to that um yes um well absolutely so i know one thing for example what we did is um for any paper um with the exception of a few we first of all made a good maybe i made a high resolution high quality reproduction of it so that when we did want to share it with the public we were keeping the original protected and intact but we're still able to share it with our partners and with the public um in terms of specifically how to best preserve or protect paper or archival material as i said you want to first first and foremost protect it from light damage um for us anywhere where we have uh historic paper or textiles on exhibit it's all of the windows are filtered against uv light uv light is one of the light in general is one of the things that will damage your paper materials and textiles the most so making sure that your paper document is protected from light damage is critical um you also want to make sure um especially for paper that it's um if possible um resting um well we try to keep our paper resting flat you want to make sure that you're not putting um any pressure on the paper itself and not causing any tears or bend outside of any natural bins so we keep that in mind as well and in terms of materials that you want to use for housing it again archival materials so that means acid-free um so from vendors such as gaylord archival or holland vital edge not that i'm doing a sales pitch but they sell um our cup i call for quality museum grade materials that will um while they're not going to last forever they are acid free and will not leach into the actual um paper or material that you're trying to protect and what we do for a lot of our historic documents in the park service anyway is that we put layers of protection when we're storing the items so in addition to having an archival quality folder or other sleeve um we also do put a barrier of mylar which is a polyethylene film plastic film um that helps to provide a barrier to protecting it as well and if we're putting a archival document on exhibit the original document we're also going to put it in on mylar polyethylene sleeve as well and that again is protected from mostly light damage and from handling as well you one of the best things you can do um for paper is to not handle it too much so i yeah i um i remember um mary posted um thank you mary for posting the youtube link um to our last um session that where we did talk a little bit about that as um well um thank you all um for that i'll just add to what kim said and just one little thing um if there are paper clips on your your documents make sure you take them off because they will rest if they're metal we've had a few incidents with that sort of thing in our files and there's one other thing i was going to say but it just gave me so yes that's just remember to remove your paper clips something i learned early on working in museums is to use pencils um when i'm near anything um so i'm just in the habit i'm home i'm not even at a museum and i've got a pencil um so when tiffany was talking about jotting down information i was picturing a pencil um which i think most archivists and researchers use as well we did it i did remember what i was going to say oh great and with when handling documents actually best practices now is to not use gloves um you might have this image of archivists with their white gloves kind of handling historic documents but um they actually find that kind of clean their hands are best because you have more dexterity and you're not at risk of kind of ripping things as you're handling them um so that's something to keep in mind as well no agreed and also for paper clips not just metal paper clips but plastic coated paper clips as well do not don't don't think that just because staples put that on there that that's protecting your item it's not that's great advice um so we have a question from the audience uh do you have any recommendations for language on how to describe material culture items in records or when you're reaching out if you have a question for someone like is there a specific language that would be helpful in describing your questions or um yes so there are several um for cataloging or iding artifacts there are several sources that you can use to um you could be in and be in conjunction with um like with standard language that a museum professional or appraiser might be familiar with um you can look to um the chinh hall's nomenclature that's produced by the american association state and local history they're a great resource um also the getty has things that can assist with object id in their arts and art and architecture database and i believe um and netparks canada also has a nomenclature database that could also provide standard terms and terminology for cataloging artifacts or i-being artifacts those are some of the things that immediately pop into my mind thank you i had not heard of the the canadian one there i have another question here um can you expand um and this is to to all the panelists um on the relationship you maintain and develop with descendants of enslaved individuals and how do your organizations manage object or image ownership with descendants so i can speak to this um mount vernon has had kind of ongoing relationships with many descendants over the last few decades and particularly as we've been expanding our interpretation of slavery with the exhibit and other projects we've been able to connect with more and more people which is really exciting and previously a lot of that work was done kind of on a an informal basis so as we were developing the exhibit you know we kind of reached out and had meetings and calls and um and that sort of thing but it wasn't really structured or part of our institutional mission but we actually recently had um a position created that's specifically for descendant outreach and interpretation of african-american history so um we kind of have that now codified into our institutional structure which is really exciting and we're starting to do more outreach like having a quarterly newsletter that goes out to descendants um and potentially in the future we hope to have more events reunions at mount vernon that will be able to bring the descendant community together so um we have a lot of really wonderful relationships already but we're we're excited about expanding them and in terms of objects and images that hasn't come up um a huge amount uh there there have been a few cases where we have borrowed objects from descendants um where things have have descended in their family um or we have used a graphic an image that is owned by a descendant um we haven't had any conflicts about you know objects having come into mount vernon's collection in kind of an untoward way and having to deal with ownership issues which i know has sometimes happened at other sites so we've been fortunate that most of those conversations have have been positive and productive um and i'll try to keep it short because my internet continues to be a plague today but um i i will say that in terms of reaching out and maintaining inter in relationships with um donors and partners well for the park service it's been a bit of a spotty history um originally we would reach out for special events and special programs and invite descendant our dissented community partners and local community groups like our surrounding churches including churches historically associated with the property to decipher special events tied to key moments in history like emancipation or to highlight special events like a commemoration of the wedding of charles and mariah syphax um so that was what we did in the past but um thanks to this project and um and ongoing efforts of our leadership team here at the park we've been able to really to echo what malford has been doing um really codify that to really not just have it be for a special program or special event but to really build those relationships um we started by establishing a community practice with local um community groups with local scholars and with descendant members of the descending community and we had some kickoff sessions where we discussed our goals for how we can better tell all stories in arlington but also how we can share resources and be partners in a real collaborative way and since that initial kickoff of the community practice our leadership team at that level has hired a community planner who's one of her key parts of her position is to reach out to our descendant community department descendant partners as well as community groups including churches to really um right now they're focused on facilitation like facilitating the relationships between the enslaved community and descendants of the lee family focused on key serious critical issues like that um so that's how we've um so it started as a really small effort for community outreach and it's really built into something that we hope to continue in the long term um not just to include loans to the park service which um and donations to the park service of artifacts but to also really have an impact on relationships between various groups and to help these families get more information and knowledge about their history of their ancestors here i like hearing about the it becoming part of who you are as institutions too i think that that's a a really great um way uh to really make sure that the um history is interpreted um jerry um has a question he asked um do you know what how do you know what family items or relics are important pictures and documents that sees you want to save those you want to see those people but what about other things on the things like the scarf how did that um how do you know that you should save that um and look into that and what's important i know i take a lot of stuff to goodwill that my grandmother would not like but i mean important is subjective um so you know that's kind of a hard question to answer in the abstract um you know i think if it's important to you it's important um so if if you feel that you want to save something because of its connection to your family then you know it's worth saving um if you don't feel connected to it but are curious if it is you know valuable or kind of you know part of a larger historical narrative i think that's where reaching out to a local museum and getting a curator's opinion can be helpful we get a lot of questions like that um a lot of times people want to donate stuff kind of offload stuff to mount vernon that was their grandmother's that they don't necessarily have space for but don't want to give will um and you know we really can accept stuff like that but um you know i think in that case asking somebody who is experienced in the field um can give you a sense of whether it's something that um you know is rare or unusual and it helps in that case if you do have documentation of its maker um or some kind of context of where it came from um but yeah so that can tell you kind of whether it's part of you know a larger kind of historical narrative but again you know important in what way um you know it's it's hard to to to answer that because it is a personal question and i would i was just thinking jesse mentioned objects that where you can identify a maker so yes i would definitely consider objects such as those as important things that you will want to save and then i also think objects that speak directly to your family's experience in this country that speaks to your family sort of cultural identity objects that um you know if your grandmother had a i don't know a cake plate or something that was so special that she brought it out on every holiday like some objects such as those that um sort of speak to to your family i think are also very important but again you know important it just it the word important can be you know it just depends so um yes and just to attack on i was going to say um you know helping the one of the things you can do when you're trying to learn trying to find out this information to determine um from how to figure out more about your collection is i'm really leveraging your collections records i know one of the things we have set aside in our database is space if the object to notice the object associated with the key figure and information and background on the donor so you know when you have time that elusive thing trying to do that collections based research to really try to find more background on pieces of your collection um for example one of the pieces that you wouldn't necessarily associate quote unquote a hand handmade four-legged table that we have a side table that we have you would think a wooden side table from the 19th century is not that important but when you find out that it was donated by descendant of the slave and that it was hand crafted by an enslaved worker on one of the other plantation estates you when you dive into those things that's when you find out the true importance of the object so it's definitely about leveraging your records leveraging your resources to try to take the time to do that research about things even the most innocuous thing can have so much importance associated with it and historical significance yeah i'll just uh say this conversation has been making me think i have this little piece of leather on my desk that has this beautiful work in it my dad made this it has a signature on the back made when he was 16 in woodworking class to prove that he could handle more complex tools including welding tools because his dad was a welder and this i wanted to learn to weld and he had to pass this test in order to be able to do that so like this is it's just a little tiny scrap of leather it doesn't really matter but it matters to me because it has a significance not only to my father but to my grandfather who i never met and so that's a story that i should write down so that someday other people in my family can know where this came from and why it's important to us and what it means and it's just those kind of little details that can really make something important to your story and your family's story yeah and mary when you write that down you'll put that in archival sleep it will right now it should be free and yes my life covered in dust i need to really take all of your advice to heart we also have some advice in the chat as well that's great is to tell other people about it that's where the oral histories come from so continue to tell those stories like you just told mary well wonderful i think that's everything that we had planned for today thank you to tiffany and jesse and kim for your wonderful insights today we really appreciate you taking the time to share your work with us um it was a wonderful afternoon to spend with all of you and as i mentioned in the chat we will kind of gather up all those links all the resources that tiffany and jesse and kim mentioned we'll gather those up and send those out later so that you can access those resources if you are interested and i know that jesse mentioned that if people have questions about objects you can always find your local curator so we'll be sure to include some some good museums if you need to look into something some good people that might be able to help you with identifying those objects i hope all of you have a lovely afternoon and a wonderful weekend thank you so much for joining us the next installation of the black georgetown community history project is on april 16th same time 1 to 2 30 pm eastern standard time we don't have everything locked down for that yet so but we're working on it we're working really hard so keep your eyes peeled and we will post information for that very soon so thank you once again for your support and we hope you have a great day thank you", "p9NFJPVKZxU": "hey guys welcome back to my channel today's video is going to be a makeup video I'm so excited about this so in this video I'm gonna show you how I came up with this everyday glam look I hope that you like it and remember to comment like and subscribe hey guys welcome to today's everyday look so in this look we are going to start with our eyebrows I'm going to take the essence brow pencil and the color number two and I'm going to start by brushing up my hairs using a spoolie I'm gonna start filling it in at the bottom start with the tail and then work my way up to the front I'm gonna repeat the process on the other side okay so once we finish that we're gonna go and again at the spoolie just to brush in the product and make it look seamless so now I'm gonna conceal my brows using a mixture of my concealer la girl thorn with my foundation of the day which is the nicks or NYX can't stop won't stop so I mix that to make a color that is appropriate enough to highlight but doesn't make my brows look crazy so I just start by shaping it at the bottom and then going to the top and repeating that process as you can see then I take a fluffy brush to neaten that up okay so now we're moving onto the next step which is priming our face today we're using the maybelline pore minimizing baby skin primer and I was just saying that I focus around my nose because that's my oily area so yeah just take a you know a small amount not too much and then put it in your problem areas first and then the rest of the face if you'd like to I like to do that okay so now that we're done priming what we're gonna do is we are going to go in with the foundation so like I said I'm using the NYX can't stop won't stop in the shade mocha you can get this at selected clicks outlets in South Africa you know if you can't find one in your city you can just you know buy it online so yeah so we're going to take a flat foundation brush that's what I'm going to use to apply this foundation first I really like you know the coverage that this foundation has it's soft it's MZ soft it is matte it's a matte foundation guys and it's also got a really really full coverage so as you're about to see now I have hyperpigmentation and I just put one swipe and look at that my hyperpigmentation was completely covered how amazing is that so I love this foundation because it has full coverage it covers my hyperpigmentation and it's also matte so yeah I love love love matte foundation okay so I'm just gonna go in all over my face don't forget to get your chin and you're like you know Joel area that's very important for you to have a seamless look so yeah I used two and a half pumps for this yeah start with two pumps and then see as you go unless you really like a really full coverage foundation look then I mean by all means do you okay so sorry about that my camera / my phone was moving so yeah I had to fix that real quick okay so I'm just going in at the top there above my brows just remember to move slowly so that you don't undo all that work you did earlier with the brows okay so next we're taking a beauty sponge I got this from clicks yeah and I'm gonna go in with my Revlon setting spray I'm just spraying my Beauty sponge and then I am dabbing in that foundation just so that it can look more seamless and flawless the brush application is really good but I like for my foundation to just look seamless so yeah so once we finished that step what we're gonna do is we are going to move on to the highlighter so you need to decide which part of your face you're going to highlight for me it's under my eyes as you can see and then the bridge of my nose my chin and the area above my lip I kind of just joined that to the side of my eyes so you need to check the shape of your face and what works for you I think this works really well for me so this is what I prefer to go for so I'm just gonna let that sit for a couple of minutes I find that you get fuller coverage when you leave that foundation to settle into your skin a little yeah and it just gives you a nicer looking finish if you let it sit and just become a little I didn't say dry but dry okay think let's say thick yeah okay so now we're going in with a flat concealer brush so I like to use this to blend in my foundation just like slight tapping motions as you can see there I didn't do the most but it's already starting to blend so just like tap it in slowly and gently to blend so you're gonna do this all over the area where you have you know applied concealer so yeah I feel like the brush actually just gives me a really really flawless finish every time i blend in with a brush and not a beauty sponge those are the days that I get the most compliments on my makeup so yeah there's definitely something to be said about using a brush so yeah we're just gonna you know press on that concealer blended blended blended and we're also gonna blend you know my eye area right up until my brow since I'm going for a you know everyday school appropriate look I'm just going to do that I'm not going to use any eyeshadow so yeah this just helps my foundation to you know come together nicely so yeah continue to tap it in and blend so yeah that's the one side done now we are going to move on to the other side so yeah of course I've had to speed up the video so it doesn't look like you know it's taking time but trust me this part often takes a bit of time especially you know when you first start doing it but the more you do it you'll get used to doing so just going to repeat that process on the other side and now we're going in on our chin area so yeah just remember also like the pots that you picked to highlight these should be the pots that you would like to stand out so yeah now we're going in again with that beauty sponge and the setting spray again and now we are just going to dab all over that just to make it look more seamless just like we did with the foundation so yeah as you can see going over it with the beauty sponge just you know makes it look more seamless and of course the setting spray is helping to just get that in there so yeah there was a lot of talking in this video guys okay so next we're gonna do the contour so I'm gonna use that angled brush that you saw it's just an angled fluffy brush we're gonna go in with the LA girl Pro conceal and the shade mahogany and we're mixing that with my next can't stop won't stop foundation I couldn't find my shade when I went into store so I just picked up the darkest shade they had and mixed it with my foundation yeah so yeah I feel like you know make it work if you can't find your color be creative because sometimes you can find a good solution for yourself so yeah I'm just gonna mix that just so I could get my perfect shade and then I'm gonna take that angled fluffy brush and dip it into my you know mixture of concealer and foundation so I'm just gonna press that brush together so I can get it as thin as possible and I'm gonna contour along my cheap and then we're gonna go up along the side of my head okay so yeah that mixture of the two actually gave me a really good contour color so as you can see I'm contoured but it's not looking crazy I like my contour to be minimal but also still be seen so gonna repeat the process on the other side minimal but still you know visible which is what we're trying to do here so yeah once you just apply that need to blend it in nicely and make sure that there are no harsh lines next we're gonna contour the sides of our nose and you're just gonna go up all the way to your brows so from your brows down the side of your nose and then you repeat on the other side as well I just feel like that adds like a bit of a shape to my face maybe I'm being crazy but yeah next we are going in on the pots that we highlighted with concealer and we're using the Sasha Buttercup banana powder and that same fluffy brush from earlier I don't bake I don't know it just doesn't work for me and this is like a hot hot hot day like 30 degree weather so you're just gonna go in there with your Sasha Buttercup and you're just gonna press in that powder we're not baking we do not bake unless it's absolutely necessary here so I'm just gonna go over that area under my eyes my chin above my lips the bridge of my nose see I was just gonna go over that contour again since we've not powdered our face just to make sure it's still visible despite the banana powder so yeah it's coming together nicely so now I'm gonna use the it's almost finished the Yardley quad eyeshadow I think it's dynasty and I'm using the orange shade in there as my blush I love love love love love how orange blush looks on melanin skin so that's my go-to so I'm gonna smile as you can see there and then apply it onto my cheekbone area and just pull it back a little so as you can see it's blush you know I look like I'm blushing but it's minimal but it's a realistic blush because I mean pink blush on black skin come on now anyway yeah so once you've gone in with the orange now we're gonna go in with the LA girl strobe light highlighter this is the 20 watt okay so we're just gonna go over that orange blush just because adding the highlighter on top just makes this really nice you know orange golden color so next we're gonna highlight my chin and then we're gonna get a small brush just to get some highlighter on the bridge of my nose I like to use a small brush because then it's more concentrated and I get to make sure that it's just on the bridge not like across my whole nose you know and then once we're done with the bridge of my nose we're gonna move on to the tip of my nose and just repeat that there we are also going to put some highlighter on our Cupid's bow just so you know it pops okay so now we're gonna set our face the first time using the Revlon setting spray be generous be generous you can have too much setting spray guys searching spray really is so useful especially if you are using powder on your face it helps that powder you know come together nicely and sort of merge with the liquid product so now I'm just showing you the lashes that I'm about to use these are from lash addict you can find these in clicks certain clicks if you are and portal is but like I am you can find these in the water branch clicks I don't know if any of the other clicks have it but that's where I found these so yeah I do not know what the style is really I don't think it's written on the box I didn't see anything there so yeah these are really nice 3d lashes they are you know good enough so now I'm going to go in with the Oradell lash grip so I just put that on the back of my hand and then I just dip my lash in there so be careful not to get any lash glue on the actual lash hairs make sure the glue just stays on the band so yeah for you to have a successful lash application you need to put firstly I wouldn't say a generous amount of glue but I mean don't be stingy with your glue right put enough and then later to get tacky so we'll come back to that part soon so while we're letting our lash glue to get tacky we are now going in with the liquid eyeliner so this is the wet and wild one actually it's the one that looks like a highlighter the felt tip eyeliner from wit and wild I'll have all the products in my description box so don't worry about that so yes I do wear a winged liner on a daily basis or at least most days so yeah but you know this wing is you know Loki I'm not doing the most the most but yeah say yeah we're just gonna you know fill that in and just make sure all the parts that are supposed to have eyeliner have eyeliner then we're gonna do the same thing on the other side so now we're going in with the essence get big lashes volume boost mascara yeah so you want to use mascara on your lashes before you put the false lashes just because it helps you to like see where you're placing those lashes I find it extremely useful okay so now you're gonna put your mirror underneath your chin and look down that way you'll be able to see where your eyelid starts and ends when you establish that then you just place your lashes on top so I guess I'll do a detailed video on how to stick on your lashes at a later stage but yeah you basically look down into it on your chin and you know continue so here I realized I wasn't generous with my glue so I had to put in another layer of glue so just going in at that and then I'm letting it sit so y'all be generous with your glue guys don't be stingy okay so now while we're waiting for that to get tacky again what we're gonna do now is do our lip so I usually just go for like a nude lip or like a soft pink lip like you know that pink that's like a natural vibe yeah so I'm going in with my essence eye pencil in the color brown and I'm just lining my lips there I like this because it's low-key like even though it's lining my lips it's not like as dark as the brown on my brows for example it's just enough to still keep it you know so yeah it's enough to just keep it nice and glam okay so next we're going in with the essence matte I don't know plus I guess I'll put the product name the exact name in the description box so don't worry so yeah I just put on two layers of that nothing like too serious because I wanted to look like I have naturally like rosy pink lips not that I have like pink lipstick on so yeah I'm going in again with my pencil there and just lining those lips again so yeah now I'm going to just blend it in okay so now we're back we are back the lashes are ready to be stuck on thank God okay so like I said mirror down on your chin and look into it you'll be able to see where your eyelid starts and ends all right so look into it and then pay attention to where you're you know eyelid ends and you like lashes natural lashes come out and then you just place it there and yeah if you let your glue be tacky enough before you put it on then you won't have any difficulties it will literally just stick right on without any difficulties and all you'll have to do is just position it if you feel like you know it's not in the right position so yeah guys so this glue that I told you about it's a well it's white when you put it on but it dries clear so as you can see I placed it there but it was still a little white so I had to leave that to dry after placing my lashes say I feel free to press in your lashes do what you gotta do yeah I always find it easier to use my fingers rather than to use a tweezer unless I have like nails on so you're finally the lashes are on so next I'm going in with my essence cosmetics clear lip gloss I really really like a glossy look so somedays I leave it like this but yesterday I felt like going glossy so I'm just gonna put that gloss on the back of my hand because it's a clear gloss I don't want the color to be contaminated because my lips are pink of course so yeah so I'm just gonna put that on my finger then dab it on my lips both the top and the bottom look at that shine look at that shine I absolutely love clear gloss guys like clear gloss changed my life my makeup life anyway but yeah so I'm just going in again with that brown liner just to make it you know pop and we are setting our face again y'all I told you can never have too much so now I'm just taking off my scarf while my pantyhose actually that I was using - okay that sound it's so wrong my what are they called pulling socks while pulling socks that I was using to hold down my wig while I was letting you know it's melt into that got to be clean so now I'm just gonna comb out to my hair yeah so I'm gonna comb out my hair and I'm going to press a spray sorry some heat protectant from Tresemme and then I'm also gonna use some mousse to sleek down the flyaways that you can see there and then after that I'm gonna straighten my hair and that you guys is the final look thank you so much for watching my video I hope you liked it and yeah remember to comment like and subscribe and if you have any makeup looks that you want to see let me

so obviously you layer plastic because you don't want your flow to have died all over I've bought today an ecto red wine and in the box there is the color cream the is the hydrogen peroxide which is the collective a term they there is the conditioner there is their gloves and achievement a color treatment so after you've got you dyed it you have to put that treatment so that it can strengthen the plum only comes with the cream already mixed and activated it comes with a small brush and I'm gonna be using an empty container I just washed out the one with the bleach powder it also comes with the serum shine serum and I'm using my brush comb thing scissors and now we're gonna mix these two first because I want to first activate the red so that I can mix it with the plum so I'm using that empty container which had each powder previously I've washed it up and am I using Beauty using the back of my brush comb thing my BOB so make sure that you brush the hair apply the dye and then brush it or comb but again because you want the color to be spread into all the strands you can't just do top layer because what normally happens is that the color doesn't seep into the strands that are under the top layer strength so make sure that you comb it after so right now I'm just showing you twas the end when I was dying the last bit you see as I'm turning it around the strands at the back did not have died so I have to make sure that I constantly massage the color into every single strand and constantly home bed so that each and every strand can have an evenly distributed amount of product to dye it so right now I've just turned it around put on some more dye I'll keep on twisting and turning so that I can see which strands I've missed and then I'm combing to make sure that the dye evenly spread to even the strands in the middle of the top and the back layer of the wake so that I don't have a week ago to kala basically so now I'm blonde and like and I and then the top layer of my wig

everybody need to know how to approach this amazing southern recipe don't real way okay now the first thing we're gonna do is get out of sleep potatoes I'm using large sweet potatoes cuz I like to use a nice fat sweet potato okay so make sure you get you some good sweet potato mix it up to them what we're gonna do now is we want to take a paring knife be very very careful y'all when you are pill and sweet potatoes cuz they can be tough to peel if you want to use a potato peeler it's fine that's the safest way if you want to be a ho G like me go ahead and just feel it with your hand so you want to just take the peel off take your time and do it cuz it be a little rough honey trying to get that peel up off the okay but don't hurt yourself so I took the peel off and then I gave him a nice rinse and then I patted him to dry with a paper towel and I'm gonna take my knife here by Christine I like her stuff over at Target but use a good sharp knife to cut your sweet potatoes okay so I'm just cutting them my graham I used to cut him real real thin y'all I don't know how she did that me it's in it cuz I can't get him like there unless I use a mandolin honey I ain't got time so I just cut them into like you know small circles or whatever not too thin not too thick but just good amount desired size circle you have you want to do it it's totally up to you now what we're gonna do is we're gonna use a medium sized pot I'm only using two potatoes but this is gonna serve about six people so two large potatoes can feed about four to six people but I take depending on your family honey they like to eat sweet anything you need to make a little bit beauchamp okay so I took a medium sized pie here and I'm adding two tablespoons of water that is the only thing you need no don't add no more water to this job because sweet potatoes make a lot of water and that's why a lot of people can't get it right you can't not can do anything without I mean when you had to have a whole lot of water and do not bake them you can candy them the right way if you bake them you got to glue them on the stove okay so we added the two tablespoons of water just to prevent them from sticking at the bottom once we put the sugar in now I put sweet potatoes in there as you saw me do but I only put half so have put half your sweet potatoes in there and then you're gonna add your sugar your salt and your brown sugar your white sugar and your salt on top of those potatoes we're gonna we're gonna add their sugar and everything in layers because we're not going to touch them while they are cooking okay long ago in touching one time so you're gonna layer them put half pound and your sugar and then your salt because you need a little bit something to make a stop to it okay sweet things like soup takes a little salt baby then you're gonna put half the other potatoes down in the pot then you're gonna put the other half of the sugar and the salt and the vanilla and the cinnamon all that on this half okay as you're gonna see me do so half and half okay and as you know all the ingredients will be in the description box below so just make sure you check that out okay but we gotta get this right so I'm breaking this thing down okay so now we're working with the other half so now we have had the potatoes in the pot which is gonna do honey you're gonna take that other half for your sugar and your brown sugar use brown sugar how to make a star - okay God had you brown sugar you gonna put your sugar on top you're gonna put your vanilla ink on top and then you're gonna put your cinnamon now be careful with this cinnamon honey okay cuz y'all be acting like y'all be out there making cinnamon roll we're doing that we're gonna add a little bit of cinnamon so I use about a tablespoon and a half and then I use just a pinch of nutmeg but you know the descriptive the ingredients will be in the description box yeah okay and now we're gonna do is we're gonna cut them over medium low heat okay medium low heat and then I'm going to put my lid on half the pot so you want to crack your lid this is just gonna allow the potatoes to kind of steam through and still get nice and candy do not put the lid on top and close it okay it's gonna be a sweetness we're gonna talk about you in a group chat don't do that okay you just want to put the lid on halfway or crack it just like I'm doing and let them blow for about 10 to 12 minutes the bottom half is gonna get nice in ten and then the top half is gonna start to cook to what we want to do after about 10 to 12 minutes you want to go in and take the lid off and flip the top ones only flip them up honey and just push them down up and then the creases in the crevices of that hot lava that we got going on uh-huh just so they can get you know coated and candy too and then they can cook on the other side so flipping this flip just the top part y'all and just let them cook for another 10 to 12 minutes and as you can see this is how they're gonna start to look do not touch them don't you check that back okay just let them cook and let them get nice and bubbly just like that we ain't got a whole lot of water do it nope we got real candy sweet potatoes maybe it's candidates up good look at that look at that get a nice and candy so once they get tender just like that right there what you want to do next you want to remove them from the heat and what I've done now is I've taken my pot turn the heat off and I'm gonna remove them from the heat and I'm gonna let that hot lava that sugar lava that we got going on I'm gonna let it settle down because now we're gonna get rid of to add the South's finest delicacy okay and you can't have sweet potatoes and then gonna be sucked up and then shoot at this right here okay we're gonna add I what I butter now that you've seen that the sugar has kind of died down and ain't gonna pop you everywhere honey like you fried chicken what you want to do now it but you see there candy right ain't got a whole lot of woman honey and you got a whole lot of water in there as I should say okay then we gonna put the lid on so that we let that butter just melt and get sucked up in the creases in the crevices up in there okay get your lip butter river going on okay that's what you want don't put the butter never so here you gonna have a mess people talk about you nope put the butter at the air and just let them put the lid on and you have perfect candied yams now look at that y'all so delicious thank you Jesus put this on your holiday table honey make it Sunday for the

[Music]", "a9HyfxrvciU": "hi everybody Lisa here today I'm going to do a new paint technique for me it's called the kiss technique and this is inspired by Olga I'm gonna try to say your last name Olga so believer I hope I said that right anyway I saw Olga's post on one of the Facebook paint pouring groups and then I watched her video and I just was wowed by the paintings that she was doing so I wanted to try it for myself the concept of it from what I can understand from her videos that she started out with two sets of contrasting colors and you put them in the cup from lightest to darkest so you use two cups and I'm gonna use turquoises and orange with red anyway we'll see how that comes out and in her video she starts the cups with white in the bottom of each Cup so let's get started [Music] okay there's what I'm going to call my orange cuff let me do my blue or turquoise Cup [Music] again on the blues or the turquoise as I'm working from dark to light and I know this isn't turquoise but it kind of works with the colors okay this is like a dirty poor technique but we're going to put the cups together and pour them together I just hope that my hands are steady enough to do this so let's get started [Music] try to pour as slowly as you possibly can [Music] [Music] I didn't add any silicone or dimethicone into the paint's because I'm going for more of a ring look and I don't really want cells I see I have some cells for me however I see a lot of bubbles so I'm going to torch it a little bit to pop those I forgot to say that I pre treated my canvas with some black paint so that I can get this to move easier [Music] trying to tilt slowly I get impatient and that kind of gets hard for me sometimes some nice rings I'm not really thrilled with the mess I have in the middle of this tilt this a little more this way I'm going to stretch these rings out I'm really liking the colors [Music] move it back to the center a little more the color looks really cool I was hoping for a little bit more orange maybe next time [Music] okay so I can do I kind of like this black negative space on the corners so I think I'll leave that I really like that [Music] there is my first attempt at a kissed poor didn't exactly turn out the way I wanted it to turn out but it is kind of cool I got a lot of rings for sure I'm not really happy with the center here where my paint kind of ended up coming off the pout of the cup and drops not happy with that but it's my first time and I do love the color I have a lot of color in here anyway I'd like to thank you for watching if you like what you saw please give me a thumbs up and subscribe don't forget to click the notification bells so you don't miss any of my future videos stay tuned for close-ups I'll see you next time

get a new clock 'cause that one's wrong. (Orange yells)\n- What is happening? - It's time for the 24-hour challenge. Me and Pear, my best friend\nin the whole flippin' world, we're gonna do something\nfor an entire day. (laughs) What will we do, you may ask? Lemme introduce you to my good friend, bowl filled with paper slips. - You mean it, Orange? - (yelling) Whoa, didn't realize\nyou were anthropomorphic. - Did you mean what you said\nabout being my best friend? Wait, are we best friends? - No, that's Pear. Let's move on. Here's how it works. Pear and I are gonna pick a slip of paper, and whatever's on it, we\nhave to do for 24 hours. - So for the next 24 hours, we\nwill be superglued together? (record scratching)\n- Woo hoo. We're gonna be so close\nafter this challenge, not to mention during\nthis challenge. (laughs) - Yeah, I wanna pick another one. Wait, these all say superglued together. - That's what you get, best\nfriend stealer. (sobbing) Why couldn't it have been me? - So what do ya say, my\nwell-adjusted best friend? Face to face, cheek to\ncheek, other cheek to cheek? (Orange laughing) - Have you brushed your\nteeth in the last two days? - Not a chance. - Other cheek to cheek it is. - Flip yeah. (laughs) Woo hoo, here comes the glue. (laughs) So, what now? - I don't know. 24 hours is a long time. - I gotta use the bathroom. (Pear groans) (cymbals crashing)\n(low ticking) - Okay, three hours in and\nit's going surprisingly well. I'm actually getting to\nknow Orange a lot better and I'm beginning to understand\nwhy he's the way he is. - Here I am as a baby. This is right around the\ntime I fell off the branch and landed on my head. - That makes a lot of sense. - Well, yeah, what else would I land on? My whole body is my head. (laughs) And you know what my mom\ndid when she found out? She flipped out. (Orange laughs)\n(Pear groans) - Please stop doing that\nwhile we're glued together. - Okay, okay. Ooh, wanna nya-nya for a while? - Sure, why not? (Orange mumbling) (Pear mumbling) (cymbals crashing)\n(low ticking) Okay, 12 hours in and I'd like to retract everything I said earlier about enjoying\nmy time with Orange. (Orange babbling) He motorboats in his sleep,\npeople, in his sleep. How am I supposed to get any sleep when he's annoying even\nwhen he's unconscious? - I'm not annoying. I'm an orange. (Pear groans) - And that's not all he\ndoes in his sleep either. (Orange farting) (Pear groans) I'm beginning to wish I\nhad picked face-to-face. (cymbals crashing)\n(low ticking) (groans) 21 hours in and I'm\nbarely hanging on by a thread. I haven't slept a wink and Orange has made nine\ntrips to the bathroom since we got glued together. - You should calm down, Pear. You're looking kinda flushed. (laughs) (Pear yells) - That's it, I can't take it anymore. - Can't take it or you\ncan't flippin' take it? (Orange laughing)\n- Ow, Orange! - Whoa, talk about\ncoming unglued. (laughs) (Pear yells)\n(drum thumping) (cymbals crashing)\n(low ticking) It's almost the 24-hour mark and Pear is, well, I think\nPear's lost his mind. He's not really talking or blinking. I think it's safe to say he's\ngone a little fruity. (laughs) (drum thumping)\n(Pear barking) Yeah, that's another thing he does now. He barks like a dog sometimes. I'd say he's in pretty ruff\nshape all right. (laughs) (Pear barking)\n(drum thumping) Okay, okay, relax. Time's almost up. - It is? You mean, we did the challenge? (upbeat music) - You're not stuck with\nme anymore. (laughs) - (groans) Finally. I can't believe this\nmoment is finally here. - You can go, Pear, anytime. (Pear grunting) - I'm trying. Wait, how long does this glue last? - Three to five days. Oh, you're so lucky. (sobbing) - (groans) He's not the only one who feels like crying right now. - (groans) Don't be sad. We can do something you enjoy,\nlike read a book together. - Really? - Sure.

who are important cultural icons and fascinating animals did you know their trunk alone has 150 000 muscles we've only got 600 in our entire body or that they can detect thunderstorms miles away through the vibrations in the ground unfortunately these great beasts are under threat from a loss of habitat and from poachers who are after the ivory in their tusks there are at least three days in the year when people celebrate elephants world elephant day is august 12th september 22nd is national elephant appreciation day and march 13th is thai national elephant day each of these days helps to celebrate these amazing animals while helping to educate the world about ways in which we can help to make sure we protect them for artist alex beard elephants are a big part of his work he's even started a foundation called the watering hole foundation that helps to raise money and awareness to help protect elephants this week we're going to make some majestic elephant masterpieces of our own i can't wait okay artist today we're going to make an elephant collage now collage is a piece of art that's made by sticking things down to a background you could use fabric or photos today we're going to use paper so you're going to need some colored paper some scissors some glue and i used crayons for this project you don't have to but i liked the way it looked so i have some crayons on hand i started by drawing um really like an upside down u a big thick upside down u and then the next shape i drew sort of looks like a comma then i'm going to add two hearts and together we're going to use those pieces to make an elephant so before i try cutting out these shapes i'm going to actually do a rough cut of them that means that i'm cutting around them without being so careful i'm going to save that scrap that would make a great bookmark later so i do a rough cut and then i go around and i cut carefully along all of the lines to get the different shapes that i need so i need to be careful not to cut off its trunk there and i cut out the two hearts they're going to be his ears and once i've done that i've got all my elephant pieces i'm going to put them on this um orange background here and there's different ways you can arrange the elephant but we'll worry about that in a minute all right i also want to put the sun in my picture so i've got some leftover origami paper and i'm gonna trace uh something round to make a circle i'm going to use three different colors of paper the orange and the yellow and some pink now i cut the pink one out the same size as the yellow one but i'm going to adjust that pink one a little bit so it will sit on top and still show some of the yellow i just cut wavy lines in it and for the orange one i'm going to cut it into a spiral you don't have to do that but i just like the look of it all right once you've done that then it's time to start outlining at least that's what i did i took my crayon and i edged all of the different pieces that i made you could do this in black because my paper was sort of a pale purple i decided to use a purple crayon and i just went around all of the different pieces of course i did not forget to add my elephant toes and then once i've done that i'm going to do the same thing to the sun as well okay so i've edged all of the pieces now i have to arrange my elephant and decide how i'm going to glue them down i think i'm going to go with something like that so i'm using a glue stick to glue these down make sure you get right to the edges so that uh they stick really nicely now i'm trying to figure out my elephant head might overlap my sun a little bit so i'm going to put glue my sun down first be very careful if you did a spiral because it's easy to tear those all right now i can add my elephant head and my elephant needs some ears and once i've done that i can draw in my elephant eye and i think i'm gonna give this elephant uh some tusks as well all right so i just found a scrap of white paper and i cut two little tusk shapes out and i'm gonna stick one behind the trunk and one in front of the trunk and there i have my elephant i'm going to use some green scrap paper that i have to add some grass to the bottom of my picture glue that down as well i added some crayon to it just to so it kind of matches the style of the other pieces and there we have my collage elephant now i told you there's different ways that you can arrange the elephant i have also a picture here of one i did i love this one i used some old scrapbooking paper for this elephant and i have him looking directly at us either way they're really fun to make and it's a great way to celebrate elephant appreciation day have fun and stay creative", "jMG40809rws": "welcome to redhead up first things first subscribe to the channel today I want to show you how to make these really cute magazine beads they're relatively easy to make and also the better you get at them the nicer and the more detailed you can make them but this is just a very simple how-to so that you can make them this summer with the kids and have a go at this really classic traditional kids crafts as you can see here I've got some pink ones blue on some purple ones and these are all made from old magazines now we've just had the recycling in our house which means I sillily gave away all the magazines that I could have used to show you how to make these beads so I'm going to show you how to make them with normal paper but obviously magazines brilliant also use newspaper or whatever you can find and then string them up look at this one this is a nice long orange one and that you know you can make nice bracelets and necklaces and similar things now they also look quite nice on frames okay so let's get started you will need some magazines or paper this is scrap what not scrap paper but leftover paper a straw or a toothpick depending on how good you are so I think smaller children will need the straw order children can use a toothpick and some PVA glue I'm going to stick that over here so the first thing you need to do is you need to take your paper and this is a relatively straight edge you do not want a straight edge you actually need to do a long in triangles I'm going to get rid of this one because what you want is you want a triangle where the tip is more or less in the middle at the other end that's one and then this way what the tips for the next one at that so you can basically cut several strips okay let's do that and then here's next strip and as you can see it's not clearly obviously like I said if you really get into making paper paper beads the neater you do it the better but it's also fun quite rough now I'll just point out two things I would like to point out firstly this bottom edge here will determine how wide your bead is and the will determine how thick your bead is so it's really about experimenting what works for you and now I'll show you how easy it is to make them now like I said you can use toothpicks or straw we shall use a straw today mainly because that's easy and now there's two ways to do the straw one is you actually stick your piece of paper on the straw and wrap it around and then you your straw becomes part of your bead that could be easier for younger children or like ass we're just going to add it to the bottom and then wrap around like this by the way I do excuse my fingers are a bit blue and pink and yellow today but I was playing with food coloring that does happen doesn't it wrap it around as tight as you can like so then you get a bit of your glue where's my lipstick my nose I'm basically either to get it out might want it handy and then you dab a little bit of glue there just like that then you press that down you can always roll bit of glue around it and you let that dry here we go and that is it and you believe it that is how easy it is to do a paper bead and you can slide off and we do another one just to show you so you put your triangle place it at the bottom wrap it around like so keep wrapping keep wrapping wrapping so get a bit of glue plunk it autumn it's alright if it spreads across the other sections because actually I'll just keep the bead more in place try not to get on the straw as you'll glue your bead to your straw and then you have your second finished bead now remember the two things to remember the the width of your triangle or determine the width of your bead the length will determine the thickness and then also when you're cutting out magazines you know you can find pink pages to make pink beads purple pages I mean really ordinary magazines you know nothing special about them I think that might have been a picture of a little garden or something and you know it's just remembering what sort of colors you think you can bring together and then you can sort them by color as well so just because a magazine beads made for magazines with lots of colors in it doesn't mean that you could can't have a color scheme and that is it so I'd like you to subscribe to read it up today I hope you do make your own magazine beads because they are lovely and fun to do and will keep the children busy this summer anyway hope to see you here again soon bye bye", "xQ5A9hSSHSM": "do notice that whatever okay hi guys I guess they were doing a review slash comparison we're comparing the ever-popular gorilla snot gel with the most delicious name with the cream of nature flexible styling not gel the gorilla snot has been out for such a long time this is actually a men's product a lot of naturals love a lot of people love it in general it's just a really really great holding gel and I actually started using this for a first time this summer for my edges so I couldn't find anything that would hold my edges done they didn't end up making a video on it just cuz I got really busy but yeah I really love this jealous sorry my hair is growing out my nerves okay it's fine it's gonna go up in two seconds so anyway I did notice that cumin nature came up with their own flexible holding styling gel and they called it snot as well and these products look very similar I'm wondering why they had to call it's not to like you could call it something else but maybe they wanted people to know that it was comparable to this I don't know bite enough people's names but it's fine it's fine so anyway I haven't tried it so I don't know if they're comparable but I'm just assuming because of the name and how they both look they're both like orange gels and they're both flexible whole gels so but we're gonna test that today we're gonna find out for sure the two biggest differences that I can tell so far without having used this one is how much they cost and the ingredients so you can buy this 11.9 ounce squeeze jar at Target for $3 I looked online in it so that you can find it at Walgreens and Target I could not find it on either of those stores not even online I had to actually order this off for Amazon and I got this for $11 but then the other difference is of course the ingredients the scurrilous not gel is not natural at all girl I'm really excited to give this a try because just reading this ingredients list we're seeing a lot more natural ingredients yeah they even dyed the gel to make it look the same that's hilarious yeah this one looks a lot safer ingredients wise then the original gorilla snot gel it looked on like how to use this Lyonne it says that you can use it for like twisting your hair for twist outs and for updos so we're definitely gonna use this on our edges today and then for the sake of this video we're going to make an updo just to see how it holds so we're gonna do two space buns just remoisturize a little bit with some rose water well you want the hair to also be flexible right I'm gonna use a little bit of cream again so that the hair is pliable I mean I haven't tried the cream of nature but I know the Gorillaz matte gel is pretty drying so you're gonna want to put something underneath protect your hair on this side I'm going to the Gorillaz knot first and so you can get a little bit of feel the texture it's a very sticky gel I cannot believe I'm putting this all over my hair like this Oh what oh the caustic it is why would anybody do this I feel so weird going on I've never applied this much of this gel oh it just feels wrong it's like I'm putting glue on my head so I just brush it in ah okay it doesn't like that [Music] it's so hot today but it's raining so it's humid and hot this is actually really good for this hair steps that we're gonna see really how this stuff works this bun is done now we're gonna repeat on the other side applying a little bit of rose water to moisturize applying a cream as a buffer anytime you use Jose you do want to put something between your hair and the Jo just to protect it all right on the side we're using our cream of nature flexible styling snot excited let's see the texture of this guy that's the same texture there's definitely a thicker mm-hmm just okay oh it's not as sticky this is not as sticky as the gorilla snot hmm very thick it feels more like a buttercream than a gel this one has sent the gorilla snot doesn't really have a scent let's apply it [Music] this one has less of a shine I don't know if you can tell look how shiny the site is this site is not as shiny I kind of like that I kind of like that natural finish it's nice both of our buttons have been created yeah I definitely noticed a difference right off the bat so the gorillas snot is definitely a stickier gel this has a nicer texture I like the texture of this a lot better yeah I wouldn't say it's like snot I'd say it's more like a buttery cream it's not that nasty I mean I'm used to using flat seat gel which is definitely like snot so maybe that's the difference but yeah this is not this is not the snot that I'm used to but I like this texture it's like a buttery cream and I love the finish I love that it's not super shiny because it just looks more natural come you see I mean hey girl let's do our edges really really quick the Gorillaz turn that first this is a very sticky gel just look at that super sticky so this can get kind of messy and you know what I'm sure this is so bad for your skin and for your like follicles and all that so if you guys do put this on your hair just try to wash it out quickly you know this is not something that you want in your hair long term it's not the healthiest and I guess we'll just use this to to brush I've got lots of baby hairs now because my postpartum shedding so this is a good time to test this out and I go in and just do a little bit of detail great just so you can see I love this stuff for my baby hairs look at this works so nicely and it lasts like I said I first tried this in the summer because I was really humid and nothing was working and I just decided to give it a try because I had so many great reviews and I was so happy and pleased this stuff works really well so there's a that sleeky fleeky edge sleeky flaky so there you go that's the sleek not sleek so on the other side let's give the cream of nature try it tastes like a butter and I wouldn't say it's likes nice this is like a it's like a bouncy butter this is nothing like snot and guard I tend to be the snot connoisseur in these parts it don't ask me why just trust me so I'm gonna apply this the exact same way and this is definitely a thicker consistency ooh I don't know how I feel about this for my edges I feel like I'm putting a really thick butter cream on my edges which I don't like okay you're giving it a try we give it a try brush it down that's so thick it's disgusting it's [Applause] [Music] I mean very nice just feels gross bad at all oh it feels kind of nice like after you after you brush it in it feels really nice I can get into this this is nice this is cool it's feel smooth like the way that my comb and brush just glided on those edges felt so good and again I really like how it doesn't set shiny okay cream of nature I see you I see you this is dope oh wow look at that hey you guys looks so good and it feels so good okay so far I love this stuff this is bomb it's such a natural looking set and it's so smooth look at this look at my edges looks like lace I am wearing a dually is that it's called a dolia do alludu Lee it was so easy to do it was so sleek and you can kind of tell like it just looks effortless you see the difference I mean this still looks good too but this looks hard this looks soft okay where you want this all to dry equal opportunity chances here we're going to put on our obligatory scarf to compact our hair and allow it to set I'm excited and like it's really hot you guys like I'm so hot I'm like sweating so this is good we're gonna see what actually happens give it a good solid 30 to 40 minutes to set I can probably zoom out no come back and see what we're so far so good alright well be back okay so it's been about an hour and 15 minutes and the hair should be dry by now this car the scarf is sticking to my head dude okay alright so the Gorillaz not Kjell the scarf comes off nicely but uh this is definitely this is definitely sticking to my head this is kind of hilarious I mean doesn't hurt it's just let me just try to peel this off without messing up my hair you guys this is crazy I don't have words for this this is Wow Wow all right um I don't even know where to start it feels so tight like both sides except for this is this one feels tighter than even the Gorillaz notch I like this stuff is insane like I thought this was heavy-duty no Midna good new this is heavy-duty you guys look at my hair it's not even moving Wow I feel like I have Elmer's glue on my head this is hilarious but I like it it works it works really well both sides dried seamlessly like it's not budging surprisingly the girl\u00eds not gel has a softer hold then the cream of nature just is the Gorillaz not and this is the cream of nature not even when I do this is it coming up this isn't coming up either well yeah I can move this I don't want to mess it up but if I if I wanted to I could move that I really have to kind of get my nail under here to move it the results are amazing for both products again I'm loving the hold on the cream of nature that it just doesn't there's a reason I don't like to use this all of my head because it's so sticky that I don't like having like a cement head you know I'm saying and although this hold the hold on this gel is better it doesn't have it's like surprisingly my hair still feels pretty soft and this has a hold but it's but it feels hard feel the difference that the argan oil and the glycerin is making in this product they're both really great products the biggest differences are still price point this is three dollars this is 11 you're getting more in here you're getting slightly less in the cream of nature the ingredients this is not natural at all this has natural components to it and it's a little bit more moisturizing which is nice it has a softer hold and it smooth on a lot nicer especially for your edges then this does this is like more stickier this is more thick and buttery err for both products you only need a very small amount to set the hair which is really great because this will last you a really long time they both have a nice shiny finish on it I do like the cream of nature finish a little bit better because the shine looks realistic it just kind of enhances the shine that you already have in your hair rather than in parting like a new synthetic looking shine which is really nice this doesn't really have a scent the Gorillaz not gel the cream of nature has a nice scent it's nice it's like a I don't know I'll just call it amateur sand I don't know I don't really know how else to describe it but this is scented and this is not although these do similar things they're not the same product I thought it was gonna be like the exact same product I think cream of nature did a really good job at taking what worked with this product and making it better I really didn't understand how they were expecting people to do like twist outs and stuff with this product but now that I see how soft the hold is even though it's a good hold it's soft now that I see that I can't imagine doing a twist out with this gel and I actually I might want to try I might I might try it I didn't realize that this was gonna be such a buttery or consistency it's not sticky I thought it was gonna be like a sticky gel it's it's like a buttery gel it's nice but my final thoughts are that this is an awesome product comparing the two they do similar things they have similar outcomes but I think that both products are worth their price point I think that this girl is not gel is a steal at three dollars like it's it just it's amazing like your edges will last all day with this product like they're not going to go anywhere and it's also great for touching up like protective styles I would not use this all over my head though it's just really sticky and hard and it's gonna give you that like cement finish worth three dollars it's a steal if you're not somebody who has to have natural ingredients if you're just looking to get a good hairstyle and save money this is the product that you want to get now for those who have a couple extra bucks to spend maybe you want something that's a little bit more natural you're gonna really like this cream of nature it's a really good product after you put it on your hair you're not gonna be able to manipulate it so put it on and work fast and the same thing goes with the gorilla snot gel this is something that I can imagine using more all over my head more than I would this job because it's again more of a buttery texture so I really think it just comes down to number one how much you want to spend and how passionately you feel about natural ingredients so yeah I guess that's it for my first impression review and I leave my hair as is for the rest of the day I'm gonna go outside probably get my daughter it's a little bit humid up there and see what happens and then I will check back in really quickly at the end of the night just to show you what it looks like yes at the end of the night I'm a little bit it is 11:30 at night and I just wanted to quickly show you my hair it looks like no time has passed is this insane or what both sides it was humid today I went outside it was raining and I washed the makeup off of my face so if my hair did get a little bit wet around the edges but still look it's nothing this is literally just because of the water hit it right here the cream of nature side is still hard while the Gorillaz not side is it still defined but this is actually a lot of softer so so the cream of nature hold out a little bit better wow it's hard though the moisture aspect is no longer there so anyway I just want to make sure that I updated you guys on the gels and I hope you guys enjoyed this comparison first impression review video and oh my debate cuz I'm tired Oh see you guys

wig I have so many tutorials sharing with you different techniques on how I hide that I will link some of them in a description box if you're new to my channel make sure you subscribe that way you won't miss my upcoming tutorials if you're not new thank you so much for tuning back in for today's video you probably have already seen most of my tutorials on how to make your wig look more realistic so I'm going to be using this week as a demonstration I will put information about this wig in the description box and I also will share all of details about this particular wig before I get into sharing with you guys today's technique I want to be clear that I know a lot of you want the most realistic looking wig that you can possibly get but honestly when it comes to lace wigs I have tried everything bleaching knives concealer after years of experience with these wigs you're only going to get it to look as natural as it's going to be you can't expect it to look like a scalp because it's not a scalp you can't expect it to be more than what it is unless you're paying big Beyonce bucks for your wigs expect a little bit of flaws here and there but today's video is going to share with you guys a really really quick easy technique that I like to use that will minimize the appearance of those grits and also the separation from the wig cap underneath your wig and all of that is going to be demonstrated on this wig here let's jump right into it so let's take a look at how it looks when you first get it this is what people mean when they say the lace look gritty and not natural like a scalp the is what we're going to cover up in hi today so as you can see when the wig is applied you can still see the lace and it does not look natural at all you can even see the separation from the wig cap so I'm gonna show you how to turn it into this right now so the nuts on this particular wig has already been bleached as you can see which is a perfect starting point few things you will need for today's video is a wig cap you want to get one that matches your scalp color you need a pair of scissors that are sharp you also need some thread and also a needle to sew with you can use a sewing needle that is for hair you will also need just some powder loose powder that matches your Scout color and a brush like a makeup brush that you don't use anymore so the first thing we're going to do is take this wig cap and I'm going to remove the bulkiness of this cap I'm just going to start by cutting the cap straight down the middle to elongate it and make it a little bit more longer now you just want to take your scissors and remove the stretchy part of the cap this part of the cap usually is the one that shows through the lace really badly so you don't want that so we're just going to cut that right on off okay so let me go ahead and share details for this week before I forget this wig is from Davis wigs calm I chose this particular style because it is a shorter cut it's like a bob cut and all the details I will put in the description box but here is the full specs for the wig it is a natural color 14 inches in length Brazilian virgin hair again all the details will be in the description box below this video it's going to be best to work this on a wig head so I have a foam wig head here what you're going to do is take that wig cap that you cut and place it over top of the front part of the lace we're going to cover the whole front believe just a little bit uncovered I'll talk about that in just a second but what I'm doing here is just stretching the cap to make sure it's nice and tight and then I'm going to pin it with one of these wig pins to secure it for now stretching out that cap a little bit more I'm going to pull it and I'm going to begin to sew that cap right on that edge not on the lace but right there on that edge where that comb is and the reason why I'm applying this over top of the lace is because this is going to hide those grits and act as a scalp under the wig I'm also sewing it right on that little tab you can see right underneath the wig cap but I'm not sewing on the lace at all I'm doing one or two stitches and then cutting it off and moving on I'm going to also repeat the same thing on the other side make sure that when you put that wig cap to the other side you pull it a little bit tight so that it's no looseness on the cap now also make sure the cap that you're using is your scalp color you want to get one that's either this color or darker if you are a darker complexion I'm also just going to add a stitch right here at the top just so that it won't roll down fYI I did cut off the extra cap that I did not need so at the front what I did right on the size of the lace is I put 1 stitch on each side and usually my size don't show so it's really no big deal for me now as you can see the cap is rolling from the front we're going to fix that in just one second I'm going to skip ahead a little bit and we're going to place the cap and the wig right back on the foam head and as you can see you can see that separation there that's what you do not want so what I'm going to do is take that powder that matches my Scout color and my brush I'm going to dip my brush in a little bit of water to kind of get it nice and moist and make the pigment of the powder a little bit more intense and then I'm going to be applying the powder down the parts and anywhere that the lace is going to show that separation from that cap now I know you may be wondering well how come you just didn't put on the wig cap and you know just do this on your head well the problem is for most people we're caps be uncomfortable it can be hot in the summertime so I figure doing it this way so I get to the lace itself is going to make it a lot more breathable so you don't have to wear a wig cap on it and also that elastic that we cut off when you wear a wig cap is usually hard to cover with just concealer or powder so cutting it off and make it a lot easier for you to actually blend everything so this is how it's looking so far as you can see is covering pretty good now going back to the part where we have the cap that's rolling from the front I'm going to pull the wig cap down to the front of the lace close to the front of the cap but not all the way down because you don't want it to be too far down because then you will see a separation you want to leave just a little bit of lace I'm going to apply that glue over top and this is going to temporarily hold this in place I'm going to dry it with my dryer and now this gel does wash off so when you do wash your wig it will wash away now this time when I did it I was a little bit messy with the glue if you happen to have that problem as you can see it will turn a little bit white what you do is just take an alcohol pad and just get rid of that little bit of flakes that you see and then just take some more powder and cover it up now I find this method really really nice and as you can see everything just looks really good it looks so much better than it did when I first applied it again as I stated at the beginning this is a wig so it's going to look like a wig closed closed up and I'm using a HD camera so you will see everything but from a distance if you no one has a magnifying glass they're not going to notice all of this but as you can see it's looking really good what I'm going to do is just play with it a little more I am going to go back and clean up the rest of that jail but right now I'm just widening and making my part a little bit longer so yeah this is the finished result this as you can see is the after and here's how it looked before I think it looks really really good very natural if you guys found this helpful please give this video a thumbs up share it with someone and also let me know how this method turned out for you if you try it out down in the comment area I would love to hear and

the truth is this that day i saw you was actually one of my best days since i came to visit my father but i met nunes and i'm in love with her if you think i can't even do anything to hurt her that's how much i love her i can't have anything to do with you so let's just leave this thing and probably be just friends no no i can't believe that yes we're becoming more than friends good afternoon why

please do you mean it for real i do understand the good good friend is very hard to find i gave you trust gave your trust but you gave me pain you gave me pain thank you so much god bless you god bless you thank you thank you i came to you because i know you are a man of wisdom and have great influence on paul your son i also came because of these unending conflicts between my daughter joanne and one non-european girl who possessed to be your son's girlfriend so what's the issue the issue is this my daughter joanne met your son first and they are madly in love with each other all right in case you don't know i will tell you a story you don't know my daughter met your son paul the very first day your son set his foot in this town in fact my daughter risked her life to help your son fix his tires and so many other things they have known each other for quite some time now until this um non-european girl came out from nowhere and this girl i'm talking about papa paul do you know her mother is a witch her uncle is a wizard in fact her entire generation are witches and wizards again they are known for using charms the same charm by manonya used to send her husband on an ending trip to nowhere and i don't even know this family is evil you don't know them i know them very well and i'm sure this sudden change in paul's decision choosing my daughter is witchcraft should believe me honestly so what are you driving at i am not driving at anything i am here to state the fact straight that your son is under a love spell god forbid none of my children not even my son will be bewit by a charm do you know what your visit to this place has exposed one thing about you you are a shameless gupsie and an envious mother who will stop at nothing to drag people's name to the mood just for your selfish end let me tell you you see this my household my household will not entertain any of your in fact my son will not marry your daughter hey let me tell you papa paul there is no point ranting all these things i am only here to help you this is for your own good if you like remain here and be calling me names in fact maybe they have even bewitched your son who knows i'm sure they have bewitched him help her do you know what leave my house oh yes leave my house you have to wait let me finish my drink now before i leave your house nachos matcha [Music] i will leave your house i will leave your house but i'm so sorry you see all these things you're enjoying you see all the you have a very beautiful house no doubt you see your tv your fridge every single thing in this house

son it's okay life is like that can you imagine such a devil when something good is about to happen the devil comes you can imagine such [Music] now [Music] hey is drink um why did you tell the doctor not to alarm on your aim but i didn't feel like seeing anyone like that i didn't just feel like seeing any of them that's why you see the doctor said there was a substance that was used in preparing the food you ate it means that nonie and the mother poisoned me that's what it means no i just won't believe that nunya and the mother poisoned you you know john's mother told me that no nes family not even the mother that they are full of witchcraft it's not that i believe that and i'm sure that none did not poison you the person you have to be very careful with is that joanne the mother is a desperate woman and she can do anything humanly possible to get what she wants how are you even sure that this is not a setup papa i was in the house with only and the mother nonie served me the fruit do you would you believe that when i told her to join me she refused and you tell me they are not aware of what they did i literally begged nania to join me in the meal she refused because she knew what she was doing a girl that came and told me about your predicament a girl that was willing to let you go how can she be the person that will [ __ ] you it's not possible but i don't know what to believe again i don't foreign life 15 boys five men they're doing that is good you never know where they're coming from the streets you need forgive us your streets now we don't we don't run things

"what's up you guys it's your girl tomorrow gi and i am back with another lip hair tutorial y'all i've been contemplating about doing this style but i was like you really y'all really love my tutorial so i was like let me just go ahead and do this for you guys before we start this video don't forget to like comment and subscribe to my youtube channel and you know you want to be a part of this family like you want you you want to be here okay today i am showing you guys how i got these butterfly locks these are cute and they're like bob shoulder length that's why i really like them like they remind me of a blunt cut like it's so it's so cute like i love them we're going to jump straight into the tutorial and after the tutorial is done i will go over how long it took me how many packs of braids i used all that type of stuff all the information that you need to know will be at the end of course you know for my tutorials if you are already a subscriber you know i already got the time sense for you guys so don't forget to check out those time stamps because you can just go to straight where you want to like what part of the video that you want to go you know i'm helping everybody out so y'all can just get it let's get straight into this tutorial okay so here i am looking like 42 dub but i use the freetress water wave in 22 inches and then i used the jam to do my separation parts for my hair so now i'm just going to show you what i do i take two strands of the hair in the freetress hair and i pull it out so that's the first one i'm pulling now and then i'm gonna go ahead and flip out the second one so now what i'm about to do is take my crochet needle put it through my hair y'all the way i did the first time was kind of like too much you don't have to bring the whole one through you could just pull your braid through as you'll see me do later on but yeah i was doing it the harder way y'all like when i do my styles this is my first time doing this style so like i just try to see what works for me as the style goes on but you guys see i'm just twisting it around i will twist it like three or four times at the root and then just keep twisting all the way down now to get the butterfly look i just like be messy with it the little thumb um the thumb method does not work for me i tried but it wasn't working but you guys see that i just make it a little messy like make it a little looser when you're wrapping and you'll get the butterfly effect okay so when you get towards the bottom you just want to flip it like you just see me doing now and you want to wrap it going back up and this is how you're going to get your hair all one length because it's really easy to stop at the length and then wrap it back up so this is how you're gonna get your short length you're wrapping your hair back up into the twist i mean into the lock and then don't twist all the way up to your root kind of like bring it back down as you see me doing in the [Music] tutorial [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so if you want a better hold what you want to do is add a smaller piece of hair into your root and twist your root about three or four times and then twist that little thin piece of hair into your lock and you will see me do that with the rest of my braids because i feel like they gave me a tighter hold with these locks so yes you guys will see me doing that further on because i figured like that that's what kind of worked for me while i was doing this style so i kept adding in here after i was finished with my um first lock [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and as you can see just wrapping loosely and it's giving me the butter the butterfly method instantly as i'm just wrapping loosely so you want to wrap hard at the top like wrap tight at the top and then get loose when you get towards the bottom and you have the butterfly effect [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so now we are done i know you guys was like whoa this is a big change i just got done decorating finishing um my room and room tour coming soon y'all but yes so i'm doing these edges y'all [Music] [Music] all right you guys so this is the style that i came out with this is the finished product after i did the edges and everything you guys and i am loving this style y'all like i really love it like it kind of like my short like little twist but like with a twist a kick to it i like i like it like i love them they're so cute i love them y'all i really do like like i just love like the bluntness of it like i love that so much oh my god that's my earring so let's jump into everything you will need to know important information about this hair so like i said i use the freetress water wave in 22 inches and you'll see a picture of that right here i use a total of seven packs of hair to achieve the style i don't know off hand how many braids is in my head but i'm gonna put a picture right here because of course i'm gonna go go ahead and count it but it should be a number right here about how many braids is in my head total this style is supposed to really take you six hours to do it six or five hours to do it non-stop but me i kept stopping like i was i started at one o'clock in the morning y'all and then i kept stopping and stuff so it took me a while but most people say they um they take six hours to do this style y'all so this style is very very easy i very i recommend this style for like this style is easy for beginners because it's no no it's not too much going on with the style all you literally doing is wrapping and it's so so easy for you guys to do if you guys like this video don't forget to like comment and subscribe to my youtube channel and i will be back with more videos

it's your girl dope ass panda and today i am bringing you guys the best beginner butterfly lock tutorial if you haven't already seen my first butterfly lock video i'm gonna go ahead and leak it in the top right section but that video was sponsored by leave-in hair and today i am doing another collab with them so i'm super excited i'm gonna be showing you guys three different techniques that you guys can use to achieve butterfly locks so today i am styling on a mannequin head which i know is different but if you guys haven't already i told you guys at the beginning of quarantine to cop you guys a doll head to practice technique so if you haven't done that by now then you don't listen but it's not too late i will make sure that i link this doll head that i'm using down in the description section the texture of this doll is great and awesome so yes it's great to practice these techniques on so i am going to be showing you guys three different locks like i said in the beginning and you guys will notice that i am going to be prepping my second one in a different way so this first one i'm going to be doing a regular plait just braiding my clients hair from top to bottom my second one is actually going to be a twist and the reason why i do this is because for those of you guys who have to take these down yourselves i know it is super frustrating taking down a head full of braids especially when you have 4c hair texture so a couple of my clients have requested that i um braid at the root and just twist all the way down and this just allows for an easier take down for a lot of clients so this is definitely a great alternative to just doing a braid all the way down really it only matters if it's super tight at the root so that's why i started with the braid the only reason why i wouldn't um do a full twist on my client is just for a fear of the crochet being a little too loose at the root so you always want to make sure you start that with the braid so these are the locks that were sent to me by leaving hair they are 18 inches and very similar to the bobbi boss nulox hair which is extremely hard to get so i definitely definitely highly recommend purchasing from this brand as always i will leave the links in the description section where you guys can purchase this hair and i will also pin it at the top of the comments in addition to this they sent me passion twist hair which i had used in my first video where i created butterfly lock so i'm going to be using that in this video as well so you're going to start by finding the loop at the top of the lock and i'm going to use that to crochet this lock into my client's natural hair so after i push my needle through i'm going to put that loop through the hook and close it and then i'm going to pull that through next i'm going to take the end of that faux loc and i'm going to do the same thing i'm going to crochet that through the top of the loop and pull it all the way through and that will make sure that your lock is secure you can save a bunch of time by not crocheting your braid through the middle of the lock which is what i have done in my previous faux loc tutorials but i realized like it just takes too much time and it's not necessary if you're doing a distressed or a butterfly lock so next i'm going to take two pieces of the passion twist hair and i'm going to start by fluffing them out and the way you do that is by running your fingers down the entire lock that will fluff it and then it'll make it easier for you to pull them apart next i'm going to split each of those pieces into two and you just want to carefully pull them apart you want to make sure that you're not creating any knots or tangling if you pull too hard and too fast so i'm going to slowly take my time and pull those apart you should end up with four pieces of passion twist hair so i'm going to take two of those pieces and crochet them through the top one side is going to be significantly longer than the other you're going to take that shorter side and combine it with the lock and the braid the longer side is going to be the piece that you use to wrap around [Music] so you're going to begin wrapping at the root you want this to be fairly tight this is going to help keep that hair secure at the root the rest of the wrapping for these locks don't need to be done extremely tight but you do want to make sure that this hair is secure at that root so you're going to go around three to four times and make this nice and tight once you have that piece on there nice and secure you can begin to wrap down and we're going to be using what is called the thumb method where you're going to take your thumb and you're going to weave out a little piece of the hair to create a loop so you guys can see i'm almost in the middle of the hair and then i'm going to take this long piece and i'm going to wrap it over the top while i'm holding that hair in my thumb you want to do this about two times over the top because if not you can see here that it's really easy to to lose that loop when you're wrapping so you're gonna stick your thumb in the middle i'm gonna wrap two times over the top to make sure that my loop is secure and that it's going to stay and then you can move your thumb and continue wrapping underneath that loop now you're just going to continue doing this all the way down how many loops you want to add in there is totally up to you if you want a super messy look then you would do the loops more often if not then you can do them more spread out spread apart but you're just going to continue to do this until you're almost out of this passion twist hair and like i said this wrapping doesn't need to be super tight and super overlapped or anything because we are doing sort of like a messy distressed look and you still have that faux loc underneath so you're just going to continue wrapping and continue doing that thumb method until you're almost out of hair [Music] so when you get down to your last three to four inches of passion twist hair that's when you know it's time to add in your second piece so in order to do that you're going to grab your second piece and again one side is going to be longer than the other the short side you are going to add in to your faux loc and your braid again and then the longer side you're actually going to either clip up or just wrap it around the top of your client's ponytail or whatever so that way it's out of your way you're then going to take that hair that you were initially wrapping around and you are going to start to wrap it around again about three to four times and that's going to help to secure that new piece of hair on once you do that you're going to tie it in a knot so in order to do that you're going to wrap it around and tie it around itself and pull it and then begin to wrap that piece up where it will meet that new piece of long passion hair that you added in once it meets where that long piece starts i'm going to grab that long piece and just begin to wrap that down together and it will be nice and secure once you've added that piece in you can continue to do your thumb method and move all the way down until you get to the end of your lock [Music] once you get to the end of your lock you're going to go ahead and tie another knot with the passion to his hair and begin to wrap upward once you run out of hair you're just going to do a nice palm roll and your lock is done i will show you guys on another lock how you can better secure the ends of your lock if you are nervous about it not being secure enough with just the palm rolling but i've been doing this for a while and it really doesn't unravel especially having that knot and that is how you create your first method for butterfly locks for our second method we are going to be prepping all of the hair the same way however instead of using two pieces of passion twist hair we're actually going to be using three so once those are pulled apart you should end up with six pieces of passion twist hair so for this method we are going to start off by crocheting four pieces of the passion twist hair through the top instead of using the thumb method we are going to be using a pull method so remember it's two pieces that we pulled into four and we're gonna put all of those through the same thing is gonna happen there's gonna be a shorter side that we combine with the lock and with the braid or the twist in this case and i'm going to still wrap around the root three to four times to secure that going down i'm gonna wrap this loosely and what's gonna happen is i'm actually going to be pulling out those little butterfly pieces so this one i'm just wrapping lightly as i go around and occasionally i'm going to pull on the lock and i'm going to create those butterfly looking pieces so this one you really want to make sure that you are switching in between wrapping tightly and wrapping loosely so that you have areas where you can pull those pieces out but that your lock is still also secure this method is definitely a quicker option but it is a little trickier so if you are someone who is not advanced at doing locks i definitely would not recommend this method for you when you get towards the bottom you're going to add in that third piece of passion twist hair and that's going to be the last piece that you need for your loc you're going to literally do this the exact same way that we did it the first time so the shorter side should combine with the faux loc hair and you want to make sure that you're lining that up so that it's at least around the same length and that's gonna make sure that you know you don't have too much hair at the end of your loc [Music] so i'm speeding up the bottom of the lock because literally everything is the exact same you're going to tie it at a knot at the bottom and you're going to continue to wrap back up but we are going to secure this one differently so to secure this lock because we have a lot of hair left over i'm going to be taking nail glue and i'm going to be placing that right where the hair we want the hair to end i'm going to kind of just pat that in so you don't need a lot of hair glue just a little bit of drip and then you're just going to cut off the excess hair and that is how our lock is secured so you guys can see that these locks do look very similar but we use two different methods to do them so yeah on to our third lock for this lock i'm actually going to be showing you guys how to do an extended faux loc so like i said these locks are 18 inches but we can make them longer a lot of locks stop at 18 inches it's really hard to find them any longer than that so i'm going to show you guys how you can extend them yourself so i'm going to start once again by crocheting my first lock through and we're actually going to be using two locks for this method so for the second lock that i'm adding on once again i'm going to find that loop at the top of the lock and i'm going to be crocheting the bottom of the first lock through that loop how high up or down you slide that loop is going to determine how long your lock is going to continue to be but um i'm going to show you guys where this is going to hang so you guys can see it's literally double the length of the locks that we just did if you keep the lock towards the bottom so once you determine what length you want your lock to be you're going to take that first lock and you're going to begin to unravel it and split it into two and take these two pieces you're going to wrap it around the back and you're going to tie a knot with them and then you're going to pull them around the front and you're going to do the same exact thing you're going to tie a knot in the front and that is literally how you secure your lock on there it should be nice and secured and you don't have to worry about it coming off this is not going to look perfect when you do it but that's okay because we're doing a distressed lock and so that part is going to be covered or it's going to blend in with the lock anyway and you guys can see that that added a lot of length to our locks that we're already doing so i'm gonna go ahead and wrap those in and you can use any method to wrap these i believe for this length of a lock you will need about four pieces to six pieces of passion to his hair really just depends on what method you use i believe for this one i used a total of four pieces to wrap i'm gonna speed up this wrapping just because i'm not really doing anything too different um so yeah i'll speed through this one [Music] [Music] [Music] so here guys we have our extended lock these are perfect if you want butt length or you can even make them knee length just remember that if you're doing lengths like this you need to order double the amount of hair that you would for a regular head of hair so i hope you guys really enjoyed and learned something from seeing these three different methods that i use to create my locs i really really highly recommend this hair makes it very easy for you guys to achieve this look and like i said i'll link their

"LqNznINXGC4": "hi friends its Brandon welcome back to my channel community you can count on to provide practical wellness to you in your everyday life I'm your stress management consultant and wellness maven and today we're making a blackhead & Whitehead DIY face mask that you can peel off that has no glue so let's go ahead and get started we are going to take one pack of gelatin and this is an all-natural way to get a glue-like texture and I'm just going to add about two tablespoons of warm distilled water until the mixture is a nice consistency similar to glue actually and once you reach this consistency go ahead and grab your next ingredient which is activated charcoal powder you can find that in capsule form or you can buy it in powder form and once you are feeling good and that the mixture is ready go ahead and blend it thoroughly and then get ready to apply it to your face make sure your face is already cleaned and washed and that your pores are open so use warm water and if the mixture starts to solidify early just go ahead and add in more warm water and go ahead and apply the mask it's very easy fresh clean skin and you can use a foundation brush if you'd like I just use my hands because it's easy peasy and be mindful wherever you apply this mask you're going to have to take it back off and since this is a similar effect of using like the poor strips or Biore Pore strips or any other whitehead extraction method you're going to feel it so be sure that you want the mask everywhere you're putting it also be mindful to avoid applying any of this mask mixture too close to your under eye area or on your eyelids those areas are very sensitive and not ideal for this type of mask so just be mindful that as you're doing your application process and then once your mask is fully applied go ahead and let your mass sit on your face for 15 to 20 minutes in total and then when your masked it's ready we're going to go ahead and pee all the mass back off I peeled the mast off most of my face already because it is something that takes a while when you do your full face but I'm showing you how to remove the mass from your nose or from my nose and that took a little bit of patience as well and my eyes were watering a little bit which is the huge for a bee or a face trip or a Whitehead extraction process anyway so I hope that you enjoyed this video and I hope that you can see some of what was extracted I tried my best to showcase but I wasn't sure if I was getting a good shot but those little blurbs of white and the texture is actually the blackheads and whiteheads that were extracted from my skin during this video so this is totally a success I hope that you've enjoyed this video please be sure to subscribe if you have not already please be sure to like this video and please be sure to comment below if you have other video suggestions or your favorite ways to remove blackheads and whiteheads so until the next video I hope you take great care and I look forward to seeing you soon", "hUcWgBHsXME": "hello everybody welcome back to my art studio um for february young at art the dubuque museum of art i'm glad to see you guys so for this month i wanted to pick a book that was super super colorful it's winter outside everything is white and black and gray and brilliantly sunny or just kind and dreary and i thought let's celebrate some color so i picked a caldecott winner for this month called why mosquitoes buzz in people's ears and this is a west african tale and it's retold by verna ardema and the pictures are by leo and diane dillon so another husband and wife team who are working together to bring us some beautiful artwork for our story so let's go ahead and read this together it's a longer book so i might try and read a little bit faster than i normally do but yeah really look at the pictures because they're gorgeous all right why mosquitoes buzz in people's ears one morning a mosquito saw an iguana drinking at a water hole the mosquito said iguana you will never believe what i saw yesterday try me said the iguana the mosquito said i saw a farmer digging yams that were almost as big as i am what's a mosquito compared to a yam snapped the iguana grumply i would rather be deaf than listen to such nonsense then he stuck two sticks into his ears and he went off mcmack through the reeds here's iguana oh my gosh mosquito what are you telling me the iguana was still grumbling to himself when he happened to pass by a python the big snake raised his head and said good morning iguana the iguana did not answer but lumbered on bobbing his head buttoming betterment now why won't he speak to me the python himself iguana must be angry about something i'm afraid he is plotting some mischief against me he began looking for somewhere to hide the first likely place he found was a rabbit hole and in it he went when the rabbit saw the big snake coming into her burrow she was terrified she scurried out through her back way and bounded quick quick quick across a clearing here is iguana or sorry here is python and he is trying to hide from grumpy iguana and they have frightened they have frightened rabbit a crow saw the rabbit running for her life he flew into the forest crying it was his duty to spread the alarm in case of danger a monkey heard the crow he was sure that some dangerous beast was prowling near he began screeching and leaping kiliwili through the trees to help warn the other animals as the monkey was crashing through the treetops he happened to land on a dead limb it broke and fell on an owl's nest killing one of the owlets oh no something sad has happened because of a misunderstanding mother owl was not at home for those she usually hunted only in the night this morning she was still out searching for one more tidbit to satisfy her hungry babies when she returned to the nest she found one of them dead her other children told her that it was that the monkey had killed it all that day and all that night she sat in her tree so sad so sad so sad now it was mother owl who woke the sun each day so that the dawn could come but this time when she should have hooted for the sun she did not do it the night grew longer and longer the animals of the forest knew it was lasting much too long they feared that the sun would never come back there is mother owl so sad there's the sun do you see the sun setting going away at last king lion called a meeting of the animals they came and sat down around a council fire mother owl did not come so the antelope was sent to fetch her when she arrived king lion asked mother owl why have you not called the sun the night has lasted long long long and everyone is worried mother owl said monkey killed one of my owlets because of that i cannot bear to wake the sun the king said to the gathered animals do you hear it was the monkey who killed the owlet and now mother owl won't make the sun so that the day can come so here is the council of all the animals in the darkness in the night time then king lion called the monkey he came before him nervously glancing from side to side monkey said the king why did you kill one of mother owl's babies oh king said the monkey it was the crow's fault he was calling and calling to warn us of danger and i went leaping through the trees to help a limb broke under me and it felt onto the owl's nest the king said to the council so it was the crow who alarmed the monkey who killed the outlet and now mother owl won't wake the sun so that the day can come here is monkey telling his side of the story a blaming crow then the king called for the crow that big bird came flapping up he said king lion it was the rabbit's fall i saw her running for her life in the daytime wasn't that reason enough to spread an alarm the king nodded his head and said to the council so it was the rabbit who startled the crow who alarmed the monkey who killed the outlet and now mother owl won't wake the sun so that the day can come crow telling his story then king lion called the rabbit the timid little creature stood before him one trembling paw drawn up uncertainly rabbit cried the king why did you break a law of nature and go running running running in the daytime oh king said the rabbit it was the python's fault i was in my house minding my own business when that big snake came in and chased me out the king said to the council so it was the python who scared the rabbit who startled the crow who alarmed the monkey who killed the outlet and now mother owl won't wake the sun so that the day can come oh python are you the guilty party let's see what python has to say now king lang called the python who came slithering past the other animals but king he cried it was the iguana's fault he wouldn't speak to me and i thought he was planning some mischief against me when i crawled into the rabbit's hole i was only trying to hide the king said to the council so it was the iguana who frightened the python who scared the rabbit who startled the crow who alarmed the monkey who killed the outlet and now mother owl won't wake the sun so that the day can come is it the iguana the iguana who's guilty of all of this all of this mischief now the iguana was not at the meeting for he had not heard the summons the antelope was sent to fetch him all the animals laughed when they saw the iguana coming but with the sticks still stuck in his ears king lion pulled out the sticks then he asked iguana what evil have you been plotting against the python none none at all cried the iguana python is my friend then why won't you say good morning to me demanded the snake all the animals laughing at him although mother owl still looks really sad i didn't hear you or even see you said the iguana mosquito told me such a big lie i couldn't bear to listen to it so i put sticks in my ears laughed the lane so that's why you had sticks in your ears yes it was the mosquito's fault king lyon said to the council so it was the mosquito who annoyed the iguana who frightened the python who scared the rabbit who startled the crow who alarmed the monkey who killed the owlet and now mother owl won't wake the sun so that the day can come feeling a little guilty i think punish the mosquito punish the mosquito cried all the animals when mother owl heard this she was satisfied she turned her head towards the east and hooted and the sun came up so here is mother owl finally waking the sun meanwhile the mosquito had listened to it all from a nearby bush she crept under a curly leaf and was never found and brought before the council but because of this the mosquito has a guilty conscience to this day she goes about whining in people's ears is everyone still mad at me when she does that she gets an honest answer she is in somebody's ear and the answer is pow splat right on the ear all right so did you guys get a chance to look at the colors and all the animals i just love how they brought all those different types of animals to life and all the beautiful colors that she puts into these illustrations i also really love that character of mother owl and that idea that the owl hooting in the morning time is what ends the night time and brings the sun and so i thought for our first little project we should do something with mother owl so mine fell on the floor hold on all right so we haven't done anything with just scissors and paper and glue in a long time so here is an idea i had for making a mother owl out of just scissors and paper and some glue to glue things together so let's gather our supplies we're gonna need of course scissors and glue some kind of glue glue stick or whatever you have if you like drawing out your shapes first before you cut them grab a pencil and if you have it remember our handy dandy folder full of scratch paper i'm sure we can harvest some of this and put it to good use otherwise if you have construction paper if you have i like to use cardstock just because it's a little more robust but any kind of paper that you have will work just fine if you only have white paper well then color it first with crayons or markers or something before you start covering it up cutting it up all right so to make this owl there's a couple steps that we have to do right first we need to make the owl's body and the easiest way to do this is to take your piece of paper so you have a big piece of paper and fold it in half the tall way right see something kind of long and skinny and i want you to cut out something that's kind of like a half circle right going up but take a notch out of the top so that your owl has some ears and leave some room down at the bottom i don't know if you can see this is the bottom of the paper so that you can give your owl some feet if you want to do that and you could even carve it cut into this and give the owl claws or talons instead of just a little circular foot okay so that's the first step so then when you fold it out you have kind of a circular shape but you have this cut out up at the top to give your owl's ears and you'll have two little feet and it'll be symmetrical okay so that's the first step the second step is these funny little slices i put in it all right and to do that pick a spot fold your owl shape in half right and cut these cut these slits in it so they're going up and down right the owl's body okay so that when you're all done you have an owl shape with these slits in it that look like this okay so then the other thing that you need to do is to take paper if you have bunches of different colors that's good right oh everything's sliding off and just cut a whole bunch of strips these ones are about an inch wide but really if you want to do narrower ones that's fine if you do longer ones and shorter ones when you weave them all in what you're making is the owl's wings so i used shorter ones down here i used longer ones up here and after i wove them all in there i cut them in a curve so that the owl head wings you see that do you guys know how to do how to weave strips of paper into grab a color oh that one's not long enough here we go right so you can pick whichever way to go but you just put it in there and you go under and over and under and over to do your to do your first one and then the next one that you want to weave in there you just have to remember to reverse it so because this one started over the orange this one needs to go under the oh under the orange and then you do it the opposite way that makes sense and push it through see and you get something like that right so you get this checkerboard pattern all right once you get your wings woven into your owl and you can cut out some circles and give your owl eyes you can give it a nose you can do whatever colors you want you don't have to do an owl i thought one time that a turtle would be fun give it a little plaid shell so again just cut out your shape whatever you want whatever whatever animal you want to do fold it in half so that your slits can run up and down and cut those slits vertically across your shape and then you can weave things in in and out right so you can do a turtle you can do a turtle another thought i had was because we're just using scissors and paper you can make whatever animal shape you want like i made this looks like a pickle does this look like a pickle a pickle with a couple of i don't know look like wheels or something on it and i cut i cut these little triangles in it fold these all back in all right so i had this pickle with this pickle pickle shape and i folded it in half i can do this all right and when it was folded in half i just cut these little triangles do you see that little triangle shapes just these little angled slits okay and then you can unfold this guy and those little angled slits you can fold them up all right like this this one i need this crocodile a little crocodile friend just out of a piece of paper in the shape of a pickle so i thought that was fun another thing of course you can do is to make masks right so you could make any animal from the story or your favorite animal so you could make like a lion you could make a shape like this and then you could give it like a big orange mane around it right and you could be king lion you could make yourself the monkey right you could do whatever you want you could make yourself into some kind of cat okay so really just kind of explore with shapes and see what you can come up with for animal masks the last thing i wanted to tell you guys about really quick is a little bit more um a little bit more steps to work on but it's february and valentine's day is coming up and a couple years ago i made these little paper valentines for my kiddos you see that so i wrote a little valentine's message on the inside and these were actually really easy to make so that was a bunny here's a little mouse with a curly tail little mouse you see this guy and i like these because they're really brightly colored too so for these guys if you want to make something like this again you just need scissor paper and glue and what you can do is if you cut out heart shapes like this or this or if you cut out a heart shape but give it some ears right you can fold these in half and make the heads of your animal see how it's just that heart shape and for the bodies they're just circles right so if you can cut out heart shapes and circles of different sizes however you want to put your animals together then you can make these little animal valentines just glue the head onto the body and you can give it little little accessories like a curly tail right or the bunny i took a circle and made it into like a little poofy cloud cotton ball shape and i glued that on and i gave them a little tiny circle feet but i thought this was a really great way to play with colors as well and to make something fun so if you want to make valentines for your family or for your friends with these little creatures you can do that too so animals there you go there's a bunch of different ideas for making animals out of of just paper paper and scissors and scissors and glue that's it for this month um next month we'll be reading another um called a cod award winner and um yeah we'll see what activity we come up with but i hope you guys stay warm and stay well and i will see you next time", "1JFP_3WcSzs": "my name is Rachel forgot I'm an educator at African angel school in insa we're really thrilled to be here I think it's really

slime steve nash work as a child that is not as much science as I could I really enjoyed the Christmas lecture series that were on TV these were very big scale lecture demonstrations a bit like my kitchen chemistry show but with bigger scale experiments less readily accessible materials in many cases I try to make science fun and accessible by using chemicals that you can get easily at a pharmacy or a supermarket or hardware store and show also the teachers that it's easy to do these sorts of things with readily available chemicals watch what you do didn't make it kids you can learn how to be a real scientist without having to be behind a desk make slime and be creative with brains listen what is with you to make slaw and stir it very good death to state workshop we've just done

god what is this this is unbelievable praise the lord this morning i am not happy [Music] but not because the presence of god but because something that should not be heard something that should not be done by a member of this church has been done before i go further i would want us to take a look at sound 82 verse 3 and it says defend the cause of the weak and fatherless maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed rescue the weak and needy deliver them from the end of the weekend [Music] from the handlebars [Music] i will take us to deuteronomy chapter 10 verse 18 and it says he defends the course of the fatherless and the widow and loves the alien giving him food now before we i finally go into why i said earlier that i am not happy i'll take us on another part of the bible and finally i will take us to the book of ephesians chapter 5. verse 1 to 2 and it says be imitators of god therefore as dearly loved children and live a life of love just as christ loved us and here he set up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to god [Music] equalness risk [Music] the care group deliberated and entrusted the care of three children three boyfriends in your kingdom and unlike what is supposed to obtain as a member of this church instead of protecting them from the hand of the wicked you became the wicked they were supposed to be protected from you became the oppressor they were supposed to be saved from you denied that the love we have always preached in this church that resorted to the death of one of the children even as grace henceforth you have been relieved of all your duties and this church you have been relieved of all your positions in this church i will not hand you over to the devil because we wouldn't want to lose your soul this church will stand against mechanics this church will stand will continue to stand against wickedness and until we see genuine repentance genuine remorse from you will continue to stay at the back seat yes bastard you have better moving me because henceforth you will not eat my food drive any of those cars or even get an allowance from me need i remind you that i'll soon be done with my master's program and according to father's real i'm supposed to take over the company immediately need i also remind you that you have six months to achieve that dream of yourself [Music] yes but you're not my god so for your planned starvation the bible says i can cope with cabs just fine just like my savings can do me for the next one year if i so desire stop fighting with your [ __ ] because you focus on yourself excuse me [Music] [Music] it's the same god who is there for you in the mid-nine hours he's the same god who is able to wipe your teeth [Music] tell me why you giving up on god tell me [Music] [Music] hmm oh mike i'm sorry but you're renting me too high i don't think i'm about to task of course you are come on you're going for that audition [Music] seriously [Music] have you heard you need to take this

"_HkQyD2tYU4": "hey there crew today we're going to start making our loom uh to design our kenti cloth like our textile weaving which is originated in africa so hopefully you've watched the slideshow and some of the stories that go along with it and then we can start making our loom so to make our loom you're going to need a piece of paper uh bigger the better mine's 12 by 18 it can be any color your heart desires i went with black because i just uh i like the look of black and if you remember from the slideshow black kind of stands for uh bold intense energy uh in the kenticloth colors so i chose black uh you're going to want to fold it in half not the tall skinny vertical way but we want to kind of turn our paper horizontal sideways and then fold it in half so it's almost like it's a book so we're going to go edge to edge once you line up your edges just so you want to make them even you're then going to press down and make that crease to make a flap flat crease fold open it up like a book boom then next step turn it it's back so it's uh having the flap or opening of the book at the top all right it's very important that the opening is at the top for this loom to work so again a loom is just a tool used for weaving so we're not going to use actual fabric like the original kenticloth makers would use but we are going to weave with paper so our loom will be made of paper too so opening tip top then we're going to use a handy dandy tool called the ruler and since my paper is 12 by 18 we know the shorter edge is also 12 inches and our ruler is also 12 inches so it's going to be important that we line our ruler up at the very tip top line it up perfectly hold it down flat and then we're going to drag our pencil across to create a straight edge now you can't see that line very well on the screen so i will hold my ruler there again and maybe i'll use a silver sharpie uh so it'll show up a little better for you on the screen so again hold my ruler down flat at the very tip top of my opening and then drag my pencil across you want to use your pencil so you can keep it light so you get it right i just use a silver sharpie because boom you can see that a lot better then uh if it in the classroom we always put our name in class code so up in that box i'm going to put my name so i'm going to write mr gove up there you can write your name in there if you would like as well so in that top box making sure that the opening is at the top make that line you can put your name in the box if you want boom then we are going to use our ruler again to create some tick marks now we want to think about fractions so we want to break this bottom part into four equal pieces so four equal pieces think of a number that might go into 12 four equal times so i'm thinking of a number are you thinking of a number hmm i'm thinking of the number three let's see if that can go into twelve four times so we'll count by threes three six nine twelve three 6 9 12. that went in four times so if you're thinking of three bravo all right so i'm going to put my ruler up close to my first line and a tick mark is just like a little mark next to the number that you're measuring uh not a full long line just a little tip so i line up my ruler my paper is 12 inches long so i'm going to put a little tick mark at the number three tick three plus three six so a little tick mark at six six plus three nine well i'll take mark there nine plus three twelve now i don't need to put a tick mark there because the edge of my paper so boom i'm gonna go over my tick mark with my silver sharpie again just so you can see it better so three tick marks but i broke it up into one two three four sections all right you'll see it even more clearly when i move my ruler down below so our folded edge it's at the bottom of my paper line it up perfectly now we're going to make those tick marks again every three inches so we're gonna measure to the three tick mark tick three plus three six tick mark six plus three nine tick mark nine plus three gets me twelve at the very edge of my paper now my tick marks since i measured correctly to the best of my abilities will be directly across from each other on the top and the bottom but i don't want to just freehand my lines because they won't be perfectly straight the way to make sure they're perfectly straight is to use your tools so tools are there to help you so you're going to line up your number three inch tick marks you can line them up so that you can see both of them and then hold it down tight then you with your pencil i'll use my silver sharpie just so you can see it better hold down that ruler flat and tight and then drag your pencil across connect your tick marks there's one section even three inches wide then we'll go to our six inch tick marks which is half way between 12 connect then my 9 inch tick marks i hold my ruler down flat and connect now we went three inch six inch nine inch 12 inch let's see if we have four even sections one two three four we got it into quarters four even sections now the next part uh you're going to need another tool a pair of scissors with the scissors we are going to cut our lines but not the first line that we made i'm actually going to put an x on that line so i know that i stop at that line so you don't want to cut into the box that has your name in it i put an x there just so i know stop don't go past that line or it won't be a true loom you'll just be cutting strips of paper we want to stop at that line right there so i'm going to grab my scissors and this is exactly why it was important that the opening is up at the tip top you'll see why so i made a nice straight line so i'm going to try to cut a nice straight line cut cut cut cut cut stop stop at that line i'm going to do it again cup cup cup cup cup stop one more and i'm gonna cut so i cut those three lines i can put my scissors off to the side stopped by my name now when i open it up it's kind of like a wave so i kept that uh or i stopped at that line so that it wouldn't go all the way across so it's created a wave and now you're gonna be able to weave through that loom over under over hello boom so the loom is complete so think of that as like step one or day one put it off to the side next you get to pick different colored papers so their different colors could just be your favorite colors or you could put complementary colors on the color wheel or warm colors or cool colors or you could pick based on what they symbolize based on the african kenticloth legend so in the slideshow you can go back and look and see what colors you might want to use based on what they symbolize or represent or you can just pick your favorite colors or whatever colors your heart desires so i picked another 12 by 18 inch paper it's important that you pick kind of the same size paper as your loom and then turn it sideways so if you wanted you want you have to pick at least two different colors because we're going to make like a checker board if you wanted more colors that's okay too but at least two i'm just going to start with orange here now we are going to measure and cut strips that are the same width as our loom so if you remember our loom we went every three inches like 3 6 9 12. we're going to do the same thing again so i'm going to put my paper horizontal because my loom is horizontal then i'm going to put my ruler down at the very bottom and i'm going to measure and do little tick marks uh three oh i'll use a sharpie this time again so that you can see it uh three six oh no and this time i'll go to 12. see those little tick marks down there every three inches then go up to the tip top we got a three we got a six we got a nine we got a 12. so tick marks at the top measured the same distance as the bottom three inches and then we will line those babies up hold your ruler down flat and connect now this time you will cut your strips all the way across uh because we do need them separated the loom we didn't want to completely separate or it wouldn't work so that's why we stopped with a little bit of room at the top actually one inch at the top where we wrote our name but this time we're gonna cut all the way through so and you could keep going and measure more every three inches if you wanted more of the strips of the same color so once you measure this time you're just gonna cut cut cut and get colored strips all right so let's say i was super fancy and cut some beforehand so i have some turquoise some green and now an orange and i have my loom so you'll open up your loom you'll pick out your strips and you'll kind of want to create a pattern so right now i could choose like an orange turquoise green uh but i don't have another orange so i'm gonna put orange off to the side i could go turquoise green and then turquoise green that would make a pattern so you're going to start underneath your loom and then you're going to pop out that first slot see it pop out and then the next one if you went under your first one you go over your next one then back under and then pop out and go over see how it kind of makes a pattern so now since i started underneath it goes black blue black blue or turquoise next i'll do green but this time i want to be the opposite of blue so i'm going to start over then go under pop out over and then i end up under so now it's kind of a pattern or like a checkerboard so now it's like black green turquoise black turquoise oh goodness green black turquoise black all right so then next in my pattern would be turquoise again and i would start under pop up over go under and boom so just like the first time when i went with turquoise then green over under over under now i have a little bit of room left here at the end so i could cut a turquoise i could cut a green or i could decide to add in my orange so i could have a random orange at the end or if i wanted it centered i could just kind of switch it out here now let's see if i come up with a problem all right well i want to do the opposite of the green so it's black next so i would do over and under and over but look my blue or my turquoise and orange are right next to each other so i would have to switch those and weave the opposite of my orange turquoise and then problem solve again and weave the opposite with my green so you can just kind of play around with the color order that you want or the color options that you want and pattern that you want and then just weave it through just remember to go opposite over under over under because you don't want them to line up right next to each other all right once you have that figured out then you can uh make a spider if you want like from the story the spider weaver so i'll show you how to make a symmetrical spider so i chose a yellow piece of paper we are going to fold it in half again like so once you fold it in half you keep it folded and this time you don't want to work on the opening you want to work on the fold so how many legs does a spider have hmm ocho 8 but if we're only working on half what's half of eight why it's cuatro four so we only want half a spider body half a spider head and half of the spider legs so we only want four legs so i say use a pencil keep it light till you get it right i'm going to use a sharpie so you can see it better if you want you can have it look like the spider either in the african legend uh why the moon is in the sky or the kenticloth legend or you can invent your own so i might do like the hat from the legend i like that legend and then half a head then the body and then if i'm only doing half i'm only going to do kind of like one eye here part of its nose part of its mouth and then i might add a pattern like stripes on its body and then for the four legs it's like one two three four so you don't want your legs too skinny it'll be hard to cut out all right when you cut it out keep it folded start on your folded edge not your open edge but start on your folded edge and then carefully and gently cut around your lines and if you want you don't have to worry about patterns and details until after you cut it out just worry about like head body and four half of your legs because once you open this up it should have symmetry the same on both sides so if it's the same on both sides and you have four legs on one side you should have four on the other and four plus four will get you the eight legs that a spider has so all sorts of vocabulary and skills here symmetry we're using some fractions and measuring and numbers as well as the geography and culture that you're learning from the books and slideshow from africa one of our seven continents so when i open this guy up i now have a full head a full body and a full eight legs but of course since i drew the eye nose and mouth i'd have to go in and fill that in and kind of be like a mirror and reflect the other side and i'd finish my stripe and then you could add texture like a fuzzy texture or some polka dots or horizontal stripes and diagonal stripes or whatever your heart desires there too so you could add a spider a good tip that i like to share back to the weaving my brain's all over the place here uh to keep your weavings in place so they don't slide around i suggest you glue a little on the end pieces so line up uh i would like line up this blue and glue glue glue and stick stick stick then when i flip it over i would do the same thing on the back so you don't want to flapping in the breeze like that so you could just glue glue glue dot dot not a lot and stick it down and you'd want to do that with all of them because you can see if you don't glue them down they can move and slide out of their slot and you wouldn't want that to happen so i'm gonna transition uh to one that i've started earlier to show you how we can add some african symbols as well so i made a symbol sheet uh so everyone in person will get to use one of these resources but i also put it in the slideshow and have it up on the screen as well for our in-person learners so if you're at home you can just go back to the slideshow and look at the slide that has the african symbols on it so the symbols mean different things so they represent something like these four circular shapes represent knowledge so if you're a smart cookie and you're all smart cookies uh strength this amazing four spiral uh kind of a cross or t shape strength strong freedom creativity are all creative geniuses the universe kind of like an all-seeing eye adaptability uh you're able to adapt or change to your environment it looks like a turtle to me nature is like two hearts here if you have a lot of energy it's kind of like a spiral a good luck charm if you're careful if you have balance if you have teamwork teamwork makes the dream work i like that one if you're full of love and friendship if you're a tough cookie if you have the power if you're great if you're courageous you could use all these different symbols that represent you and we could use some black and white paint to do those symbols so i'm going to show you some different examples of weavings i have here i did one with purple and yellow because they're complementary colors i did one with blue and orange because they're complementary color i did one with red and green because they're complementary colors and then my finished one i just did with the turquoise and green like i started with in my other or at the beginning of this video and i just painted and did all sorts of uh symbols on there and then i added color with marker and oil pastel you could use crayon you could even use sharpie i used some silver sharpie and gold sharpie as well so you can do all sorts of things so i'll just show you real quick me painting a symbol or two maybe i want to do uh i kind of like that freedom so i might use my black paint here and maybe i'll put the freedom in this red square and you can look at the symbol and you could paint it draw color with whatever materials you have if you want before you paint it or go over it with sharpie or a oil pastel or crayon could you use a pencil and keep it light to get it right absolutely before you paint or do anything it's a good idea to plan it out lightly with pencil because if you need to you could always erase now i have a little black paint there for my symbol if i want to stand out i might use more contrast or a complementary color the opposite of black is white so i could have it stand out if i if i wanted to fill in part of those shapes with some white that already makes it stand out a little bit because it's contrast red and green are opposite black and white are opposite so you can think about opposite contrasting colors and maybe i want to do a little dots in the middle there that's pretty cool so i added my own personal spin to the freedom symbol that was on the page so as you continue you can paint you can add oil pastel you can add all sorts of different colors and symbols i glued my spider on and if you don't want to make a spider like in the story you don't have to make a spider but if you want to that's how you can do it so enjoy your kinty cloth try to practice weaving before you glue it down practice your patterns practice your contrast and opposite colors and symbols so there's all sorts of new things that you're learning go to the slideshow and review as needed go back into the stories and read those and listen to those if you want inspiration for colors textures patterns uh you name it so let me know if you have any questions and i can't wait to see what you guys come up with adios amigos", "PsjXN-kHb84": "hey guys welcome back to quiet toy collector and in today's

to do today I'm going to do a blank for a plate made out of wood honeycomb and the reason that's got the amber honey color in for a friend of mine Paul Maher from tool metrics join me let's go morning everybody our own Africa meet and here I'm doing a blank that I'm going to use with honeycomb and that's for a good friend of mine in the in the USA and he's going to do the work I'm just going to do the blank so I've got a round disk of wood I marked the Center for easy the same thing on the other side so I'll have a reference point for further work now I see that there is a place here that I missed so I'm going to use this one as the part of mahanakhon now freehand I hope you can see free and I'm going to do a river I like rivers and the same thing I'm going to do on the other hand on the other side okay bear with me okay now this one will move to the benzo I'm going to follow the lines that I made before it looks like a river I'm going to follow them on my benzo [Music] [Music] I cut it freehand so if it's not exactly on the on the line don't worry about it it's frigging as a base I'm using PT food-grade so nothing sticks to it and it's easier to work and I'll show you now why okay because I need to put it together now because of the size of the blanket will not fit into my pressure pot so it will have to be outside and now what do I do I going to mark few of those with hot gun glue and take the center out you you the idea behind it is we keep the circle all the time the same so this one will hold it and this one will hold it let it get cold a little bit before we removing that Center for the resin not to flow out we need to close it here now we have a complete circle and left a gap underneath here and I get underneath here the only reason I left a gap is sure the gap because the honeycomb is a little bit thinner than my blank so we will have to work porns will have to work according to the honeycomb but I left it on both sides so it will be easier to work with it hope you can see but I've got a piece of plastic a piece of PVC and I'm going to close here so the reason won't come out so I'm going to cut two pieces you you you you you you you um orange flow nothing only a little bit because I want it to be very similar to honeycomb but I don't I want it to be see-through and one drop of yellow you you you you you you 24 hours later it's ready I had a slightly separate here but otherwise came right I'm now I'm going to take it off I'm going to remove the glue around and take it off as you can see I had a little bit of support that's why I'm putting hot gun glue around it perfect hallelujah and it's ready Center center let's see what Oh with it here you are it's on the way to you pull Cheers", "hbS50Nvh-7A": "Welcome to Kenya where they are known\nfor their safaris as well as all of their delicious tropical fruits. So let's\nlook at some of the products that are native to Kenya and also Africa. You\nhave rice, they have lots of rice as well as honeydew melons, cantaloupe and they also have good delicious watermelon. They also\nhave fish as well, so that's just some of the products that we will be looking at\nas we travel to Kenya today. Let's also look and see where exactly Kenya is\nat. Here we are in the United States and we're going all the way across the ocean\nto the continent of Africa to Kenya right here on the equator. We\nare traveling a long ways today. So what will we be doing today do you think? I don't know, what are we doing today Ms. Beverly? We're going to be looking at a book\ncalled Handa's Surprise. We're also going to be making a delicious watermelon\nshake, and we're also going to have a special guest today and that is Pam Outen\nour Family and Consumer Science agent. She will be dehydrating apples. We're\nalso going to look at and learn about an ancient art project . So let's get started!\nLet's take a look at the book Handa's Surprise. Handa put six fruits in a\nbasket for her friend a Akeyo. She will be surprised, thought Handa as\nshe set off for Akeyo's village. I wonder which fruit she'll like best\nwith the basket she's walking towards the village with? Will Akeyo like the \nsoft yellow banana? Oh look at the monkey in the tree.  He's gonna get the banana.\nHanda walks on. She doesn't realize the monkey got the banana out of her basket.\nWill Akeyo like the round juicy orange thought Handa? Uh-oh here comes the\ngiraffe He's got the orange.  Handa doesn't\nrealize it's out of her basket. Or will Akeyo like the red ripe mango thought Handa?\nHere comes the elephant. Oh the elephant's got the mango. Will Akeyo like\nthe spiky- leaved pineapple Handa though?  Oh here comes the giraffe.  He's\ngot the pineapple out of the basket. Will Akeyo like the creamy green avocado? Oh\nhere comes the Antelope. He's getting the avocado. Or will Akeyo like the purple\npassion fruit Handa thought? Oh goodness in the tree there's the parrot and he\ngot the last fruit the passion fruit. But look there and here in the story. The\ngoat has broken loose from its hold and it's running towards the tree and\ncrashes into the tangerine tree. Now I wonder which fruit Akeyo will like best\nthought Handa.Not realizing she has new fruit. Hello Akeyo said Handa. i brought\nyou a surprise. Tangerine said Akeyo, my favorite fruit.\nTangerine said Handa. That is a surprise.\nWhat a cool story. Let's make a delicious watermelon shake. It comes from the\n4-H curriculum Food Culture and Reading. Our ingredients will be six ice cubes,\ntwo cups of chopped watermelon, and this watermelon looks delicious. Then also\na tablespoon of honey. Once you have all of these ingredients in, we are going\nto put the lid on and we're going to blend our ingredients Wow this looks delicious.\nLet me pour a cup of our watermelon shake. Let's try this. Oh that is good. Join me\nfor some watermelon shake. Dehydrating apples is really easy and the whole\npurpose of dehydrating apples is to remove the water from the fruit, the apples, the peaches and the pears so you can enjoy it later on. The steps are\nreally easy. First wash your fruit or vegetables really well. Let them drain.\nYou want to get rid of that excess water. After the apples or fruit have drained,\nyou're ready to peel it and you'll need some adult help with this. And after\npeeling the apples, you'll want to slice them to be about 1/4 inch thick. As you\nslice them, put them in a mixture of acid water. This is one and a half tablespoons\nof lemon juice mixed with a quart of water. This keeps the apples or the\nother fruit pieces from turning dark and the product will be much prettier. After\nyou've let the apples soak for a few minutes, drain the apple slices in a\ncolander.This is a step you don't wanna miss. You want to get rid of that excess\nwater. After draining you're ready to come to your cooking rack which has been\nplaced inside of a cooking sheet and you want to place your apples around the\ncookie sheet. You're going to place them so air is\ncirculating. Well now go to the oven that's been preheated between 145 and\n175 degrees. We'll slip the cooling rack in and let the dehydrating begin. It's\nideal if you can put a wooden spoon in the door of your oven at the upper part\nof your oven to keep the air circulating. I can't do that at my oven, so I just\noccasionally open the oven door and move the apples around on the cookie sheet\nand make sure that air is being distributed. Remember you're going to\ndehydrate about five and a half to eleven house. Then you can test them if they're crunchy and\nnot mushy you know they dehydrated. The next step\nis super important.  We're going to condition our apple slices. When the apples are cool, well place them in a container and leave it about halfway full. We'll put a\nlid on it and every day for the next week, we'll shake these apples a couple of times a day this is completing the conditioning process. When you open the container if\nthere's no moisture around the edges, you'll know that apples are conditioned\nand ready to be placed in their permanent jar. You could use a plastic\ncontainer but I'm using a small canning jar. You can fill it to the top now and\nafter they fill to the top just put your lid and ring\nand screw it down tightly. Don't these apples look delicious? It's simple and\neasy to dehydrate apples and other fruit with these seven easy steps. I hope you\nenjoy. Let's take a look at a really neat craft that we can do at home that's\nreally based on an ancient craft of batiking.  This is very similar to this but more of an  updated version. Some things you're going to need is some thin fabric something that you can see a little bit\nthrough. You're gonna need some gel glue. You're gonna need a pattern and you're\ngoing to need two multicolored acrylic paints. To get started, you want to\ntake your pattern. I want tell you what this pattern is because this is unique to Africa. In Africa they speak about 60 different languages across the continent.  Many times they use symbols as a form of communication.  This particular symbol means spiderweb. It also means wisdom and creativity, but the spiderweb is also a symbol for many of their African folk tales and some of you may remember the folk tales of Ananse the spider. This is the symbol for a Nazi the spider. So we're going to take this pattern and lay it underneath our fabric and we're going to use the gel glue to trace around and as you can see we can see the pattern underneath there our fabric. We're gonna trace the pattern with the glue. Once you have your gel glue on the cloth\nand trace your pattern, you want to let this dry for about 12 hours or overnight.\nLet it sit and let it dry until we begin our next process. All right our\nglue is all nice and dry on our fabric. We're gonna put this on a\nsurface that's not going to mess up mom's counters. We have taken just\nabout 1/4 of a cup of water and maybe a quarter a little quarter-sized dollop of\nacrylic paints and mix them together to make a really thin paint. You want\nseveral different colors to color your fabric with. So let's get started on our\npaints. All right once we've got the entire fabric covered, we're gonna let this dry completely. For the next part of the process you're gonna need a bowl of hot water. We're going to take the design that is already dried that we've colored\nand still has the gel glue on it.  We're going to take this and put it in the hot\nwater and just get it nice and wet. You might even take a soft brush to the\nglue but the water will dissolve the glue gel. I can feel it dissolving in my\nfingers now. It gets really loose and eventually it will come off. So this is\nwhat it will look like once the glue is removed and it's your finished product.\nIsn't that pretty? It has been an exciting trip to Kenya today. What's some of the things that we accomplished today Ms. Denise? We read  this really cool book about Handa's Surprise, we also made a delicious watermelon shake. Pam helped us dry apples, and we learned how to make this neat African craft. We have had a wonderful time and glad that you could join us today. See you next time.", "iD8kjBpm0FY": "I bought the extra flame but that's the medium course and for today we'll be using the extra fine crest this is the wasting of Eevee used to take child nail polish off my nails by for soaking it off is a long very very long thing off the soaking the gel nail polish off I moved on to using the sanding band in the manual but also with my e-file also takes a little bit long but does chefs kiss you blink your eyes your channel no polishes off highly highly recommend using the ceramic throw but it is amazing holding everything in the description box down below so if you interested you can check that out over there add a disclaimer I think that I wouldn't really recommend anybody to use this on these natural nails because this but is quite a tree so it removes the product down very quickly and I think it could chew up your natural now like this would become the Tasmanian devil or a natural now so if you are using gel nail polish international nose at duty community to use a sanding pad and immense ouput but if you do have a little bit of acrylic lift over like I do from my behavior seat that I did think I lost about painted my nose when I paint it in black for Youth Day so what a little bit of acrylic the endless is shapes kiss amazing and Sigma say and it's done it is literally that quick to remove child nail polish weathers flying bath when I am finished removing the gel nail polish with the e-file I like to take my old my cap - just brush it over my fingers helps to remove any excess dust for today's look we'll be using these clear full coverage stops I got em from mascara and they're in there's the little shape so the first thing you want to do is to take your Eve foul and use the sanding band that isn't for taking the sanding band is because I think any other drill but might just be too aggressive and it's gonna chew all the way through your extension so what you want to do is just and wrap up the inside of your extension just show who's the boss just put it through the things and this is going to help it to stay in a place later on when you do a catcher to your now as you can see you don't need to be doing the most you only need to be roughing up the section of the extension that is going to be attached to your actual nail plate and then when you're done you need to repeat the same process on the remaining four extension tops that you have or maybe you've got more you still need to do your other end but you've got more per hand I don't know you do you I'm not here to judge you this is a safe judgement free zone you do you boo here on my channel we don't play favorites just like we dusted off our natural nails these extensions also need to be testicle because these dusty boots are not observing the quarantine restrictions they are not observing social distancing regulations they are disturbing the peace and we don't need them they are going to cause unnecessary negativity and they will make everybody pop off we don't need that - just - your extensions off and thank me later next up we've got the protein boy and we just came to be putting a thang out on each nail to get the pH to the level that the product needs to be for the adhesion to be at the maximum a ssin now I'm going to be taking the supreme now nation and just coating a thin layer on my nails it doesn't need to be too thick we don't need to be repeating the episodes of jokes and survivors without mode it just needs to be a thin coat on each nail and then I'm going to be curing it in my UV LED lamp for one minute taking the same supreme nail foundation just coat the inside of the extension as well but be careful don't use too much don't use too little just find the sweet spot if you used too little it's not gonna stick on it now and if you use too much it's gonna flood out the side so just find the perfect amount and only experience is gonna do that so as you go along you're gonna learn did I mention it's my first time using full coverage tops and they are so much easier and faster than acrylic in my experience anyway they just go on you don't have to file anything down and enough to worry about the liquid to powder ratio you just put the glue on put it in the lamp and it's done I'm gonna do this from now on so remember earlier I said if you used too much you're gonna get flooding yeah I used too much and I got flooding so I just ended up taking the diamond but that I got worse my evil I don't know what the name of it is but I thought I needed something about more gentle not something so abrasive because it's gonna be on my skin and I don't want it to damage my extension that I also just put on I used those and she just came in she's like the cleaning crew easier what do you need she didn't fast she didn't care she did a job and she was gone so if you're a lady just call the cleaning crew don't stress just show me liquor I wanted a coffin shape for my nails so I cut the stiletto tops off like toxic friends cuz nobody has time for that type of negativity my poor Nels were left with a little bit of emotional scarring and ravages of the cutting those toxic greens off so to remedy that I'm just taking my nail valance smoothing out those edges making sure everything is right 90 degrees perpendicular oops I dropped my brush and just taking my makeup brush again oops I dropped it again just get rid of any dusty boots next I'll be serving you some clear double base coat and you know the role we are gonna put a thin layer on each now just a thin layer don't do too much don't do the mouse just keep it liquor just put a thin coat on and pop it in your UV LED lamp for one minute to cure I also turn my hand around to see my love from a different angle and make double triple quadruple that I'm getting every nook and cranny of mono with a clear rubber base coat so Dhoni and in any direction make it go up down lift that turn your party do what you need to do in order to make sure that you cover every square millimeter of your nails that's what's gonna make your nails look pillow-fish we are not trying to make it look like we did our nails in our mother's basement in the dark we are trying to make Arnold's look profesh especially because we cannot go to the salons now thank you quarantine on the menu for the main course I'll be bringing you the colors not so plain chain in my opinion this is an eggshell but not in a chow she's warmer than a chow she's pesto she doesn't know if she's pink she doesn't know if she's white she's confused but she is beautiful and remember that we're trying to make ourselves look as profesh as possible so flopping around and keep that angle if you need to flip your hand back and forth flip her hand back and forth that's totally up to you you do what you need to do I know my nails look pretty good at this point in time but in person they are looking prettier than the bacon that I eat on a Sunday so right now I'm going in with a second coat of the not so Plain Jane and you know the row we're gonna keep cute keep it classy we're gonna put a thin layer on because we don't want a product to bulk up on our nose we still want that sling the cute look you know today I'll be using the non wipe top coat also by mascara and you know exactly what I'm gonna say keep it cute paint a thin layer on all of your nails and pop it in your UV LED lamp for one minute to cure to secure my cute little rhinestones in place I'll be using the gym spine gym job also buy mascara this gel is Brooke I'm talking thick with the food see at the end this child was holding on for dear life first child was holding on tighter then Jack held on to their board or what I ended up doing was moving my to be around and around and around just to make sure that I wasn't getting any string on my nail like you know the Charles string if you do use this child you'll know exactly what I'm talking about so to prevent that I just went around and around and around and eventually when the stinginess ended I could move on to the next spot where I wanted to put my rhinestone another top pair for you is to take what ever it is you're gonna put on your nails and arrange it into the pattern that you want to use it's gonna save you a lot of time in the long run when you do eventually get to putting them on your nails so if you look at the cradle the thing that I usually put my Eva on for each nail every rearrange the pattern of ten rhinestones that I'm gonna put on each nail [Music] [Music] I'm using my wax stick to pick up the rhinestones throughout my cradle and placed him on my nail actually you know what I don't know if it's made of wax I don't know what it's made of this thing is made of unicorn dust because it's not sticky I don't know how it picks so kudos tools up but it does and that is me adjusting the exposure so that you can see what I'm doing it's not easy to light up dark skin with something that's light because then it's just overexposed and they a drop the crystal and that is the reason why putting your gems in a pattern is going to save you time the cooking you drop a gem you can just take another one from a different place and then replace that one at a later point in time I'm telling you finding a dream that's facing the right way when you must scatter you you guys so much time don't do what I did I'm trying to save you time do what I'm doing in this video don't do what I did lost night when I did my other end when I did my tight end with my left hand bearing in mind that is also my non-dominant dance I learned a lot I learned actually that putting it in a pattern is gonna save time but if you enjoy playing hide and seek and you want to look for the gems in you you don't have to put it in a pattern also it's up to you when you have decided how you were going to arrange your dreams and place them on your finger what you want to do is place it in you UV LED lamp for a full minute to cure if I were to form the other 40 rhinestone applications in real time we would be here until my first grandchild was born so to save us our precious years of life I've made a time lapse [Music] and this is the final look if you do recreate this please segment Instagram I would love to see your creation I'm curious to know what it would look like in another color with another color

to do blocking methods and looking at my videos and my methods have changed a little bit so I just want to show you guys my new updated method and all the differences in it and how to achieve flawless install like so keep watching this video if you'd like to see all of that and don't get super my channel before you do that because why wouldn't you subscribe we have fun here into the safe space you keep watching and thank you and I'll see you at the end goodbye okay so for this tutorial really need three things that is your weight cap some scissors and some got to be glued freeze great you take the wakeup out sometimes I actually do get dark wake cast which is really helpful because then I want to put makeup on it if this one isn't a dark one or if I make Monica start by pulling the wig cap all the way down well the first thing you want to do is make sure your hair is slicked back and that it won't like get in the way of anything put this all the way over my ears I don't know why this would have look like orange I don't like the Hornet cap so I'm going to use this beige color I'm going to put it all the way over my ears and my and just so that it's like pulling where we needed to pull assumed it in a little bit so you guys can see a little bit better but I'm taking this free spray and I'm gonna spray it all around my hairline including right here and right here if this is your first time doing the bucket method well I know my first time when I sprayed this and like I didn't know how to spray it right and it just went everywhere so you're gonna want to spray it like really gentle so that it streams not everywhere just in like the places you want it to go and you're also going to want to hold it with the close to your head bringing it blow dryer it has settings high but I usually just like quality but necess pull to make it like a medium heat so if you have a medium heat I suggest doing that I believe dried it for about 2 minutes I'm not going to cut it off just yet what I'm going to do is cut little slots for the ears so that we can get this part stuck all the way down I know that used to be a problem that I used to have was getting the side stuff down on my way ball cap stump yeah that's what we're gonna do put the little hole go and now I'm going to take the spray and spray it in the same places once again and blow-dry it once again [Music] now that our wig cap is completely dry I did that run I went for about five and six minutes because it's extra wet especially on the sides after you do it two times I'm going to take my scissors and cut this off I start in the middle just to like do half and half and then I kind of peel back as I go because I always do a little bit extra I always spray a little bit extra so that I can peel it back and decide how much I want to keep on there I'm just gonna peel back and cut take your time you do not have to rush this because we not want to risk cutting your hair [Music] okay and do the other side you okay now we're basically all done the only step left is to put makeup around the edges it's optional but you can put got to be glue gel around the edges and then blow-dry one more time but I find that it really doesn't make a difference especially if you're putting your makeup on top of it use the foundation that's a little bit lighter than my skin it's by ill macchiato and then I apply it with a Beauty Blender tip the beauty blender in it Pat away you there we have it this is the finished product of the ball cap so now I must put my wig on don't hear that music today is it beautiful 26 inch gazillion curly from Ali pearl hair Ali pull hair yep there we go the best I'm gonna do you guys know the drill already every time I do the same thing I'm just going to adjust the straps and I'll pop this baby on since this was not the focal point of the video I'm just going to speed through it and you guys can watch it at your leisure and I'll show you how I style it imitating curled but yeah okay you you you you you you you you I want to show you guys a link no fluffy it is I just this is like a favorite I mean look at this hair quality but matched so this is how the weight turns out is

these types of videos if you like them and if you want to see them yeah thank you in advance for that and I'll see you guys in the next video you", "vm_RGhriwkk": "what's poppin YouTube welcome back to my channel and today I'm sharing with you guys a nether fallout tutorial and I'm kind of just updating you guys because I have been using a quicker method to save me like a bunch of time and it's been super effective and so I just wanted to share that with all you guys today and I am defining my parts today using the Black Panther strong edge control and I have been using this a lot when I post my giveaway I will be giving away some of this product but if you're interested in trying it out you can also go ahead and check the description section and click the link or you guys can purchase it and I'm just starting out by kind of platting my clients hair and I'm just doing basically like singles just some individuals with no fake hair added in that just saves like so much time guys you don't even know I'm gonna be doing this all over her entire head I know a lot of people in the past have talked about faux locs like causing a lot of tension on client's hair and like people's hair falling out because the locks are heavy and that's why I love this method because it's not as much tension when you're not doing a box braid and I know it does get really tight when you're like wrapping the hair so this just helps with that overall [Music] [Music] so once I've completed that over her entire head I'm gonna go in and moisturize and recently I've been using this medicated anti itch spray and I absolutely love it it has olive oil jojoba oil shea butter and tea tree oil and I kind of just sprayed this all over the clients hair and then I kind of like massage it in and moisturizing before you do the faux locs is so important just because all of her natural hair is going to be tucked away so you want to make sure you do this prior to doing the faux hawks so as far as hair I use two packs of the free tres braid deep twists and 22 inches in the color is one beat and I'll also use three packs of the Cuban twist hair in 24 inches and you guys can see how long these faux locs are I pretty much used one piece of the Cuban twist hair per fell lock so to create my foot lock I'm gonna be taking this deep twist hair and I'm actually going to be crocheting it at the root of my clients natural hair and in the past I used to do like box braids with this hair like add it at the bottom but it's just so much quicker to do it this way and um basically to make your faux LOC longer because when you pull this through there's going to be two sides one side is going to be shorter and one side is going to be longer you basically just make sure the longer side is hanging at the length that you want your faux lot to be at if that makes sense so you'll see here like I'll be pulling on it and making one side longer than the other side the shorter side is going to be wrapped up in the folic so it really doesn't matter the longer side is going to be hanging down at the bottom so next I'm gonna take the Cuban twist hair and I'm combing out the end of it just because it's really stuck together and I like the Cuban Swiss hair better than like the Rasta free Marley hair because it just covers more space it's not as like nappy as the Marley here is so I do like it a lot better and basically all I'm gonna do is crochet this in at the root of the clients hair also so you will crochet in the free truss braiding hair first and then you crochet in the Marley hair really you could have done it together but I don't know why I did it one by one I didn't even realize with the screen wind dark hair but I will have a clip a little later that shows you what I'm doing but basically I'm gonna be taking this Cuban twist hair and I'm going to be wrapping it around the clients natural braids and also around that free tress deep wave hair so I'm wrapping it around all of that [Music] [Music] so when I'm wrapping the hair I'm literally just pulling it and wrapping it around the free tres hair and you really want to just make sure that when you're wrapping it around is kind of overlapping itself and then I will prevent your photo op keeps having gaps and it will also make it a little bit tighter and if you do like wrap loosely your photo op could potentially unravel and that has happened to me before so you just want to make sure that you're like wrapping it pretty snug all the way from the root down to the tip and really when I start at the root it's no different than what I'm doing here the screen was dark so that's why I kind of zoom past it when I get to the bottom I start to wrap like the little piece upward and then I'm actually using nail glue this time to still my faux LOC and in the past I use a lighter but I didn't have a lighter on hand so I'm kind of just using no glue to seal it and then I kind of palm roll it just like that and that is how you create the faux hawk [Music] so in this clip here you guys can better see how I started the roots of the faux lock and I actually spelled this clip down just like you guys could get a really good view of it I'm just a couple tips when wrapping and I already said this before but you want to make sure that as you're wrapping the hair around its overlapping the piece that you just wrapped around that's to make your faux lot you know just hold a little bit tighter and to make sure that there's no gaps in your faux locs also you want to make sure that the hair is like kind of combed out or separated at least a little bit just to let as you're wrapping you cover more space because that will prevent you from having to use more pieces of the Kuban twist hair and if you guys can see all of the other faux locs when I started they look extremely natural and that's why I really really like this method just because like they look like they're coming out of her scalp and that's what you want it to look like [Music] in my first ever Fallout tutorial you guys had asked if the full locks were sent and they were and that was because I did the box braids with Marley hair so I will never do that again I have never done that again so as you guys can see these ones move she can put them in a ponytail they're not stiff at all and that's what I love about them [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] so once I'm done with the fella I go in and I kind of trim some of the synthetic hair that's at the bottom and that's just something I need to work on like I leave a lot of the synthetic hair out and y'all there goes my nephew I had to freeze the frame here because he's literally just the cutest thing ever like you cannot tell me he's not super cute if you guys follow me on snapchat I live me posting 24/7 everybody's like is that your son like baby I wish but he's not but yeah anyway back to the video um so I'm cutting off like some of the synthetic hair at the bottom and like I said like I need to work on that I use a lot of the free tres hair and so it gets like really thick at the bottom and you don't really want that because it's synthetic hair so eventually like this hair is gonna get super tingly and nappy so when you're adding in the free tres hair like try not to add in too too much only a little bit of hair so y'all this here is my finished look I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial as always make sure you guys leave me some feedback in the comment section below let me know if you guys have like been using this method for your fell off because I could just be new to the game I haven't really watched a lot of fun locked Orioles so yeah let your girl know if I've been just flipping this style took me a total of six hours which is six hours quicker than when I first did this song so baby I'm happy okay and it saved me so much time by not doing a full head of box braids so yeah let me know which I think in the comment section below and I will catch you guys in my next video bye get you back in the house no doubt", "TcXRYb3bB9c": "Oh African art the simplicity of design get vibrant colors in your living room with

this product because it dries very fast so what i'm doing right now is putting the product on my edges just so i can slip back my edges because you want to make sure that you have some slick back edges for your ball cap method and then i'm just using my blow dryer on medium heat and i'm just kind of molding it into place and please do not mind the gel that's in my braids you guys i still take out my mix and redo them for my birthday okay so don't judge and by the way if you have not clicked that subscribe button go ahead and subscribe to my channel and click that bell right next to my name to get notified when i drop my videos but right now like i said i'm just applying the boldhole liquid gold on my hairline and then i'm just using my brushes to slick it back and then using my blow dryer just to blow dry and mold it into place and this is very imperative especially when you have natural like edges and they curl up because you just want to have a flat and seamless [Music] install now that that's done i'm going in with my wig cap you want to make sure you get a wig cap that's closest to your skin tone just because you want this to look as if like you're bald okay the whole point is for it to look like your scalp so i went in with a wig cap that's closest to my skin tone and i'm going to go ahead and cut around my ear tabs just so we have the wig cap nice and flat and now i'm going into my foundation color i'm using my foundation just to go ahead and tint the wig cap because wig cap isn't exactly my skin color and you want to make sure that you go in with a foundation color that's a bit darker than you and the reason why i say this is because you want it to be able to mesh nicely underneath your lace um so now i'm going into my bowtie liquid gold again and i'm using that just to secure my wig cap for our install so i just put that all around the perimeter of my hairline and then i'm just smoothing it back into the hairline and we're going to go ahead and just let that dry but back on to why i like it darker is because sometimes when you're putting your lace frontal on and stuff you can see the wig cap underneath and it's more seamless when you have your wig cap a little bit darker than you than when it's lighter than you because it is more visible underneath your lace so that is the reason why i go a little bit darker i went ahead and used my blow dryer just to make sure it was dry and while it's drying i'm gonna go ahead and sew down the back of my wig cap just so that it stays in place and there is no shifting and moving with the wig cap and then i just simply knotted it at the end and then cut off the excess thread now onto cutting our wig cap i'm using these cuticle scissors and i'm cutting in the middle of the wig cap i like to do this and work from side to side just so that the wig cap doesn't loosen up or move or anything so right now what i'm doing is i'm just gently lifting up the wig cap until where the gel stops and i'm gonna go ahead and cut across where the gel is at just we have a nice and seamless um cut and again i'm not pulling i'm just gently lifting it up to see where the gel is at and i'm cutting and this would just you know help um remove any of the little excess frayed wig cap you know it just makes it more precise and exact with the cut and then now i'm just going in i'm kind of working in sections just because i couldn't really see that side of my head as well so i'm just working in sections lifting it up and then cutting and again do not pull just slightly lift up [Music] and overall this is how your bald cap method should look like it's looking very seamless and this was super easy now on to the next step i already have my hair curled if you want to see how i curl and layer my hair i will leave the video down below in the description box right now what i'm doing is i'm taking my lancome tintai doll foundation which is my exact foundation shade and i'm using that to tint my um lace and now when it comes to attempting the lace afterwards i like to spray some glass to be free spray on the hairline just so that the oil doesn't transfer onto the glue and i went ahead and i just put on the wig and i'm measuring it and i'm just pulling it taut to where like my head fits and i'm gonna go ahead and cut out my ear tabs now because i have a big old head you guys i don't really have much to cut but on the other side i did have a little bit more to cut so i'm just using my rat tail comb and i'm carving around where my ear is and then i'm going to cut around where my ear is at now what i like to do is i like to cut slits just so i can kind of mark out my sections and this just helps me um with the gluing process because i kind of do it in sections you guys are going to see that more further on but now that i have cut my slits i'm just going to go ahead and just fold the wig back and then i'll be using my 91 alcohol and then a paper towel just to wipe off any of the residue i have my forehead and this is very imperative you guys you want to make sure that you do this because if you do not have your oils or the dirt on your forehead removed your hair will not lay you guys the lace will not lay so make sure that you're cleaning it with 91 alcohol now the lace system i will be using is the erica j hold me down lace system i'm using the skin guard across my forehead first this serves as a primer for all my sensitive skin gals and overall this helps the adhesive last longer now i'm going into my adhesive and i like to apply the adhesive right on the hairline and then a bit on the cap so this first layer that i'm doing kind of serves as just like you know just to protect the wig cap i like to do my first layer just to make sure that the wig cap is secured and it's nice and flat so it meshes with my skin so right now what i'm using is a popsicle stick and i'm just smoothing it down and you want to make sure that you spill it down into a nice consistent layer you do not want any lumps or bumps at all and like i said make sure that you get it on the cap and then a bit on your skin this will just ensure that your lace would definitely stick because your skin does produce oils and the cap does not so the cap just serves as like you know more space for you to apply some glue so please make sure you do the ball cap method because it also protects your edges as well y'all and i promise you this process it will not take out your edges if you take it out the right way okay so like i said i'm just going in with my popsicle stick and i'm just smearing it down until it's nice and flat and there's no air bubbles no lumps and bumps and you want to make sure that you let it dry completely like clear you do not want to see any white before you apply your next layer and as you guys can see you want to make sure that your width of the glue is about that thick so like about an inch thick to ensure that the lace will stick and this is where a lot of people mess up at because people sit down there and just apply about like you know a thin width of the glue and this is why sometimes you experience your lace lifting or it's not sticking down it's because the width of the glue isn't large enough okay so you want to make sure that you have about an inch of width when it comes to the glue i'm not telling you to apply a whole bunch of glue but make sure that the width of the glue is enough now to ensure that you have a maximum hold i would definitely recommend to use three to five layers five layers meaning that you probably want it to last for about two plus weeks and of course sometimes when it comes to body chemistry everybody's longevity um journey lasts differently sometimes you know your skin can produce more oils than others would as and that would be the reason as to why your installs won't last that long but this glue in general the erica j hold me down adhesive whether if it's the original formula or the watermelon formula the only difference is the smell this is the best glue to use for beginners if you struggle with your lace lifting this glue is like crazy glue but for hair and it's safer hair okay so it's really good i definitely recommend to use this glue and again we're just gonna let this layer dry completely clear before we add our last and final layer okay yes all right you guys after this last layer is dried we're going to go ahead and apply our lace you guys so now what i'm doing is i like to apply my lace weight in front of the glue the reason why i like to do this is again you want to make sure that you have a good width when it comes to your lace installs just so it can last long as well too but also you don't want you don't want to overestimate the glue i rather me go back in and apply some glue than for me to take off glue so i just like to apply my lace in front of the glue and i'm not pressing down on the lace into the glue just yet i want to make sure i have it in a good spot and making sure that there is no glue in front of my hairline before i press it down and after that i see that i'm going to go ahead and just gently use my hands to press it down this isn't really recommended use a comb to press it down but i just press it down just because you know i'm kind of a pro at this you know but definitely use a comb to press it down and that's what i'm doing right now i'm just using my comb and i'm kind of just putting pressure on to the lace into the glue just so it can adhere and now i'm going into my blow dryer in medium heat and i'm just going to go ahead and blow dry my hairline so now on to our sections i like to work in my middle section first and i'm using the eyebrow razor just to cut my hairline you could use sheers too but for my beginners i would definitely like advise you to use the eyebrow razor just because it gives you more of a jagged look and you want to cut in a jagged motion you do not want to cut straight across now what i'm doing is i'm using my rat tail comb um this is like my detailing part i like to use my rat tail comb it kind of like you know outline um where my lace is ending at and then i'm going to go in and apply two layers of the glue with my rat taco and i'm just going to smooth it in the rat tail comb just helps you get into the little pieces and crevices of lace that you wouldn't normally get with your popsicle stick so again i'm just using two layers and i'm going to let each layer dry completely before i go ahead and press the lace in so i just went in with a small buffer brush and i applied some of my foundation just a little bit i'm just going to go ahead and dab in to my lace with my foundation all right now onto baby hair i like to just carve out my baby hairs and if you guys want to see a full um tutorial on how i do my baby hairs i have that of my channel right now so i'll leave that also in my description box below description box below i have a label that's the baby hair tutorial okay okay i'm just going to go ahead and just hook my baby hairs in and i'm just going to do that all alongside of the hairline overall i'm going to use um or not to use but i'm going to do i believe it's seven baby hairs so one in the middle and then three on the side yes now i'll be going in with my silk wrap and i'm going to go ahead and apply that on my hairline i'm going to let that sit for about 30 minutes or until you feel that it is dry completely and you can tell when it's dry especially um just from like your silk wrap if it's not wet anymore so i'm going to let that dry for about 30 minutes or until it's dry and then we're gonna go ahead and take that off and as you guys can see that nairobi setting lotion really sets that lace and you guys so now what i'm doing is i'm coming on my baby hairs because you know your girl don't like hard baby hairs and overall it didn't look finished as well too so i just want to fix it up so i'm just combing them out and i'm also just going to go ahead and cut any fray hairs that i have just lingering around just so that our baby hairs could look perfect and laid and i'm going in with my hot comb my andes hot comb on its hottest setting which is on 20 and i'm gonna go ahead and just press out my hairline just so to look nice and perfect and then i'm using my baby hair brush and some spritz just to form my baby hair so it can look nice and laid and i spray the spritz on the brush i do about one pump and then i'm going to go ahead and just form my baby hairs and this just give it a nice hold it won't make it hard or crunchy unless you put a lot but i'm just putting one spritz gonna go ahead and just swoop some things and yeah you guys we are looking pretty late and overall these are the finished results i went ahead and did my makeup off camera and stuff and my hair was already styled as i've seen before if you want to see how i achieve those layers and the curls go ahead and check that link down below i hope you guys enjoyed this video like comment and subscribe to my channel if you have not and i'll see you guys in the next video [Music] later [Music] you", "n_SVHo6xgTk": "[Music] welcome to wheels up with sunrise on wheels i'm michelle newman today's program has three segments first i'll take you on an adventure using information from my own personal travels we'll explore lots of cool african animals including elephants leopards rhinos lions and african buffalo next our friend caroline will show us how to make a cool lion mane and then i hope you'll play along as three of my friends linda janet and sherry play african animal trivia [Music] today i thought it would be fun to travel to africa and go on a safari after a very long flight we will arrive in africa here on the map are four countries will visit south africa botswana zimbabwe and tanzania a typical day is bookended with game drives one very early and the other in the late afternoon returning around sundown this is the time the animals are the most active will most of the time be in an open-air jeep today we'll focus on the big five which were once the most difficult and dangerous animals to hunt the african lion is a massive tawny colored predator of the cat family the ultimate predator and an awesomely beautiful creature the adult male lion has a flamboyant rough of remarkably long hair around the head and neck known as a mane which begins to develop when he is about 10 months old an adult male lion is over 400 pounds and four feet tall at the shoulder they're equipped with norm enormous fangs and incredibly powerful necks four limbs and claws that allow them to hunt the largest prey of any land animal regularly taking down 600 pound zebras and 1300 pound buffaloes african lions will also take on giraffes and even elephants in the right situation compared to other lions other cats lions are very social animals and live in groups of 5 to 25 individuals called prides female cubs will live with the pride their entire lives male cubs will leave the pride usually driven off by the adult males when they're about two years old the females hunt together only occasionally being helped by the male members when the hunt is over the adult males generally 30 to 40 pounds larger eat first lions can consume up to 40 pounds of meat in a single meal but most of the time you will see lions sleeping they doze or nap about 20 hours a day the leopard is the smallest of the four big cats but is probably the most powerful they have amazingly strong necks and shoulders and are able to carry prey often heavier than themselves high up into the branches of trees where other predators can't reach the leopard's climbing ability sets it apart from other cats and has made it the most successful of the group their tree climbing prowess doesn't just give them the means to keep their kills safe it also provides them a quick escape from the many animals on the african plains the leopard is a gifted swift and effective hunter but is less than half the size of a mature lioness has nowhere near the pugnacious tendencies of aji hyena and wouldn't stand a chance against a pack of african wild dogs leopards are loners and live the most solitary lives of all the big cats the only time a leopard spends in close company is the first year and a half to two years of life spent with mom newborn cubs leopard cubs are a dark gray in color an abundance of fuzzy fur and very faint spots i spotted these two cubs but never got a chance to see mom in fact on a safari you are very lucky to see a leopard their solitary nature and ability to blend in with the tree limbs make them the most difficult to find a leopard versus a cheetah what's the difference they're both spotted african cats leopards have irregular black patches across their pelt cheetahs are covered with 2 000 black spots cheetahs have unique black teardrop patterns running down the inner corners of their eyes towards their mouth leopards do not cheetahs are diurnal meaning they're active during the day leopards leopards are nocturnal meaning they are active at night leopards like to climb and spend time in trees a cheetah does not cheetahs are the fastest land animal in the world with a top speed of over 70 miles per hour however they are mainly sprinters and can only maintain this speed for a short burst of time they have brilliant eyesight and when the time is right they sprint from cover knock down their victim and kill it with a bite to the throat [Music] next is one of my favorite animals the african elephant the largest animal on land the african elephant starts out life big usually 200 pounds at birth and grows at a rate of two pounds a day elephants are known for their intelligence long memories and deep family bonds each herd can consist of anywhere between eight and a hundred elephants and is led by the oldest and usually largest female in the group known as the matriarch her mind is a treasure trove of knowledge leading the other elephants to water and food and especially critical skill during times of drought each herd is made up largely of females the females often the grandmothers daughters grandchildren sometimes other elephants that join the herd help each other raise the babies and keep them protected by babysitting the younger females learn how to be good mothers when the time comes the elephant has the longest childhood of any creature on earth including us a mother carries her calf for almost two years then with the herd forming a circle around her to protect her she gives birth while standing up to a 200 pound calf the calf remarkably hairy at birth will not be able to stand for the first hour or so which is a very nervous time eventually the calf will struggle up to nurse and could walk two hours after birth it is so much fun to watch an elephant use its trunk the trunk can reach over 20 feet high into the trees for fruits or leaves or it can suck up and discharge up to five gallons of water at a time to bathe in or playfully spray others with the trunk has no bones but it is layered with 40 000 muscles and it is immensely powerful as adults these creatures have no natural enemies other than us the most critical issue facing african elephants is the slaughter for the use of their tusks the tusks are modified teeth that begin to develop at about five months of age and grow continuously throughout the animal's life the ivory from tusks is used to make decorative items and powdered elephant tusk is used as a medicinal aid and supplement rhinos have very bad eyesight they have small eyes and their vision is so poor that they will occasionally attract trees and charge at rocks by accident their incredible near-sightedness means that from about three feet a human or a tree can look the same however they make up for it with excellent hearing and a keen sense of smell the rhino is the second largest land animal after the elephant they have thick bare skin round barrel-like bodies gigantic heads and incredible horns protruding from their faces their horns are made of keratin like human nails and grow out of the skin in a similar fashion the rhinoceros is a strict vegetarian grazing on grasses or browsing trees and shrubs for leaves shoots and fruits they are mostly solitary especially when feeding since their food intake of 40 to 80 pounds of vegetables a day requires them to spread out rhinos are intimidating looking creatures and will charge when confronted or threatened but they are generally not aggressive towards humans and only two or three attacks are reported a year in comparison fatalities from elephant attacks near number 400 to 500 a year and hippos kill about 2 900 people annually speaking of hippos the hippopotamus commonly referred to as the hippo is a round bald cantankerous herbivore with a semi-aquatic lifestyle and a fearsome reputation at 14 to 16 feet and 4 000 pounds they're about as long and heavy as a car their method of travel is very simple they kind of walk underwater they don't float mostly they propel themselves by pushing off and gliding rather unusual for an animal that spends up to 16 hours a day submerged in rivers and lakes to keep their massive bodies cool under the hot african sun but please don't let their size fool you they can outrun most humans running up to 20 miles per hour one thing you want to watch out for with a hippo is if you see them start spinning their tails they do this when they poop they can spray over 30 feet grow the african buffalo is a large animal that can weigh between 660 and 1900 pounds it has a large head broad chest and strong legs and it is four times stronger than an ox the body of the african buffalo is covered with hair that can be brownish to black in color the horns are shaped kind of like question marks males have longer and thicker horns the buffalo is a grazer feeding mainly on the grass and when grass is scarce they might eat shrubs or trees african buffaloes live in large herds that sometimes include hundreds of animals but usually herds are smaller with up to 12 animals on average herds usually consist of females their offspring and one or more males african buffalo is well known for its exceptional memory it will recognize a person such as a hunter that heard it in the past and it will attack it at their next encounter same with lions they will preventively kill cubs of lions that are known to have attacked the herd well i hope you enjoyed looking at my photos from my last two safaris [Music] hi my name is caroline and today i'm going to be showing you how to make this really fun lioncraft so for this craft you will need some paper i chose orange yellow and black some glue or a glue stick scissors and either googly eyes or you can draw on the eyes so the first step is to cut out the lion's head i'm using some yellow paper to do that and i had this in my house as the circle to cut it out so i'm just going to trace it and then cut it out if you don't have yellow paper you can also use some white paper and you can color it with a crayon or some markers so the next step is to make the lines face so i'm gonna do the eyes first and i'm using googly eyes but you can also use you can also draw on the eyes or you can um cut them out of construction paper so i'm just taking some glue and putting the eyes on then next i'm going to draw the face so i'm going to take a brown crayon but you can use a black crayon or black marker or you can paint it on so first you draw an upside down triangle and then you're going to draw two lines so that it's like smiling and then you're going to color in the triangle so now it looks like this so the next step is to make the lines made so i'm using orange yellow and black paper to make the mane and i'm just going to put them on top of each other so that it makes three strips at the same time so i'm just making rectangles and you can make them as long or as short as you want so they should look like that so i have some strips that i already made so first you're just gonna put some glue on the face and then you're just gonna stick the strips on and i'm doing orange yellow and then black but you don't have to do a pattern and you could do whatever colors you want or you can even make it rainbow but you could do whatever you want so to make the lines main more realistic i'm going to take a pencil or you could use a marker or a crayon and i'm going to curl the mane so what you have to do is put either the pencil the marker or the crayon on the end of one of the strips and you just curl the paper around it and then it looks curled like that three so now mine looks like this and now you can add whatever you want to it you can add some jewels to make it sparkle or you can add a popsicle stick to make it like a puppet or you can hit you can even make multiple like a family and hang them up in your room you can do whatever you want i hope you had fun making this crafts with me i hope i get to make another one soon bye [Music] welcome everyone to our african animal trivia game we'll have 10 questions

join us next time [Music] you", "yZ_7zbW1Nus": "good afternoon ladies and gentlemen i think there is a good time to start something like that what we want to do here in uh altmere in the netherlands and we are at the burma institute which is one of the very dynamic and since a long time and i think with a wonderful future too because of it goes from generation to generation there and there is a lot of fresh energy in there and let me say that because of i know how important it is that we at the moment speak also about the future so we are in this wonderful educational place and uh in the heart of all smear you know which is one of the hot spots of flower production and flower distribution distribution in the world and what am i doing here that is maybe uh just a little question because of i am one of the partners of the school for a couple of years so um it's obvious uh if you see the the shade of my hair the 50 50 second shade of gray that i have already years ago when the founder of the school when he was around in holland in europe in the whole world and that i'm now working with his daughter and his grandson with his partner and i love it very much because of this is a place where education is number one and after all these years also i was in trade in flower business and in the flower cultivation that was i was first a gardener and then i was a florist in a shop with my parents and then with my wife and then it started more and more to travel and to go abroad and now today i'm here so what we want to do is we want to talk about education we want to talk about what can we do together i think this is very important because of these covet times they might end one day i hope i survived that too because of now we are here together but we have to be online so i like very much the life classes and believe me i also look out for something what we do here at burma should be also a life class it should be also should be amongst people and i still like that the most um but i had to learn to speak to a camera camera is my friend now hello friend and uh but i don't blush anymore like last year around easter i had my first camera experience experience in many years for a longer term presence in front of a camera and that was very difficult now i feel good about it because if we can still be together and i hope that we really reached you we made our announcements for this meeting here today it's a demonstration so i am not here to talk and i'm not sure i'm sharing with you things which are everywhere so we really packed the car with prepared pieces and some are absolutely uh new developed so that we don't see that what we daily see on the internet so that we really are looking out for work which could be interesting for uh maybe for the master education of master and for other interesting work what the most people will do in the future so what i have today is some table work some room decorations what i'm starting with here on the right side is something which is a wooden backdrop and it is a bit vintagey rustic and with falling off paint you know what vintage often is but the disc in front of has a bit of asian look it's a a wax plate and so i was just we'll do with a few simple touches i want to finish this and then i have more work to share with you and we want to do it really that you have a lot of enjoyment and you also see the one or the other idea but we cannot start everything from the scratch but this is what we promise for the educations what we will do here again together because of for my last class here two years ago when that was one and a half years ago then we really had intense class and everything starting from the scratch and really sharing with people very well so um we want to i have to speak english so i we discussed it uh with my friends and partners here that's how we shall we speak speak spanish italian wonderful it would be wonderful if we could do it but i think we should go with these very for many people easy to adapt language which is english and but when we are in class here together so if we come to further on life classes here we can always when we are side by side work uh talking about the work we can always speak in several languages but today just english forgive me that even if i actually should speak german but that is what i don't use here today so um this work here is just hanging on a branch here on the ceiling so all these uh i think it's a is it a hamamelis or is it i don't know it's uh we it is winterly it is dry actually but it was fantastic you see here there are these little black buds here and here is one panel which is a little blackish from the in texture and so you see there are nice connections and also i worked with tubes which i covered actually with organic materials so which is a little related to the brown and sand and taupe tones in the backdrop and so i try to make the props as little important as possible you know i should really stop for a moment talking and go into the design i have some gorgeous flowers here this is the um in spanish they say the nardos which is the polyantis tuberosa the pullian tus uh they have here in aldsmere is that place uh margin par and which is a distributor of uh productions of flowers which would not exist usually as this seasons and uh so mug empire i found fantastic flowers here today and i i should mention it because of if they would not be here i would not have it and not having is something what i know by my traveling when sometimes when i had classes in other countries then it was very difficult when i was dreaming of something doing and i didn't get it so okay here i have some antheriums this is the are the smaller lovely types these are the small very long lasting antheriums and you know the good thing about it is that they are available in little packages and uh so i like big anturiums too but i should say that a small aetherium for a lot of the work i'm doing here today is very suitable it's absolutely suitable for this because of one of the next works i have just very little tubes and little space for flowers and then the flowers should not be like an elephant ear so what do i have here please be proud with me that i have it this is not a repsolis this is a casual arena the casuarina acquisetifolia it's a kind of african you know you see this sometimes in the movies about tanzania and films like out of africa and all that so you see this trees often in the back of uh in front of a sunset so you know i want to touch up this here fairly quickly and so that i have really enough time to share a lot with you so the plan was first yeah let's speak a little about education and maybe we do one or two arrangements but i said i don't come for two arrangements to holland how can i go this still three hours to drive so let me do something and uh okay so the wax work this is something which is very interesting so at the moment as long as we have flowers like the lily family tulips and uh you know if you look into a tulip you look like into onto a wax work a wax candle or something and uh yeah and then uh the gingers and ethereums all these families they are very much with a waxy surface and i think uh therefore it was worthwhile to make a wax plate i made a online class a couple of weeks ago and then i started a lot with wax and i think for this season we can really work like that i wouldn't do this in the middle of the summer or in the um very clear colors of the summer and fall no i wouldn't do that but at the moment i think it can be still till april wax but then i wouldn't make it so much of important so that's about it i think we can have already thinking about the next arrangement so all of this is just placeable in a corner it is for a display or for in beside a speaker you know a speaker at the speaking table this could be next door and then uh next to him and to her and then just hanging a few uh populous populous albustics so all of this is just to hang so work what can be prepared at this at the place at home you transport it you go to the side and then you hang it have something which can be done in a short time so if we do must yes there's a question well um for now there's not a well there's a question later but first of all i want to say that there are a lot of people watching from all over the world we have people from mumbai romania uk poland kenya ireland estonia california and singapore we have sardinia france canada croatia china san diego pennsylvania colorado and of course holland russia hong kong and taiwan okay so i want to thank you that you take the time to be with us and i wish you could be here because of uh this is a fantastic world here in between the greenhouses and all the the the water which you see in channels in the little lakes around here it's a fantastic ambiance and so uh yes i know i should not talk about alzman now we should do the next work can i have the next work so um yes we want to speak today also about very practical work and about work which is um which is not too time consuming but i think at the moment we see that people like very much to think about what can we sell in the future is this a very cultured flower trade and on the other hand side there is the floral art and the floral design as a hobby and a floral design as a culture even if it is commercial so i want to really think of both directions i think that we still need knowledge about what how can we make create an ambience for flowers do we know enough flowers and [Music] enough about flowers and about botany and all this where is the plate the plate is i should really know so now here i have um it's a bamboo it's a bamboo tube it has a little of an old yellowish bamboo post and this is a table decoration or for a sideboard and [Music] the the bamboo is nailed uh on uh 18 wires 1.8 millimeters here in holland they have 1.5 millimeter always and this is green lacquered it doesn't oxidize the one i have here can oxidize so but i wrap it up with a paper covered wire and so i have the most fantastic uh very thick kind of crespedias do we have the flowers yeah here they are and then we have uh very nice tulips i have a bit of the materials here from dunsigger this is a cultivator for summer kind of materials spring and interesting greens and then the tulips here these are the double tulips and this is a wax plate and the wax plate uh i did in a container in a aluminium container and melting wax and bringing the materials the wax [Music] letting it cool cooling down let it cool down and then when it's cool then you can knock it out of the container but there are some little tricks what you have to do that you get it out of the container again so usually wax sticks on everything you know if you had wax on a trouser or on a skirt then you know that it's not so easy to get it to get rid of it again but i have my tricks here and so i share all of this in classes of this school so here we have the lupitium from is it dansiger it's a dancer okay and the i think the crosspedia chrispedia the drumsticks is from the family of the daisies from the daisy family and what i'm doing here is really working block type so that just every it's a bit of cubistic the cubism you know the big artists of cubism in a certain period of uh the modern art also in floristry it can be like that so i have a little a weakness for this i don't show it constantly but it can be in modern ambiences it can be a wonderful way these little holes they disappear i need my glasses so do i yeah here are more holes yes and the flowers they go through a grid here and this grid is holding the flowers in position here the focal area of the design is about here and i have a big group and i have a small group and i have this big empty part so i think in three five and eight i think in three and five and eight and less and more you know the proportion is very much of a parameter for design quality so i really look out for good proportions so the work shouldn't be too high so that i really have less more and maximum that branch here is floating it floats from the side here is all the anchoring and technically it's a lot of challenges to really get everything standing well that it doesn't fall apart that it's transportable so these are all professional values so i'm not saving flowers here i am here in the heart of uh the the european flower wild spring so i cannot hear play with a handful of three little flowers i think there is a question yes a question from joaquim unreal where do you get the wax the wax uh we find out in the communication with our friends from canada that we should take a bee wax which is fully organic or a soya wax but what i did frankly to say when i did my first work here for this at home it was a leftovers from candles and there is still 20 maximum of mineral oil product so paraffin so but i i promise you when i do this work again i will look out for the soya wax and for the bee wax so that is available in special shops candle stores and many people they do their own candles and there are many techniques but [Music] it goes too far to speak about that now but go and look out for soya wax or for bee wax more question yes question from taiwan may i ask if drilling holes in the wax will break it easily and how do i prevent no you just you just have this wax and you put it on a on a softer base maybe like carton on the table and you start very carefully drilling very carefully not quick and you don't take too much of a big drill you take you start with a smaller and then the second time you go in with a bigger so here i did it actually at the place i did a few at home some holes but i added more in it because if i want to make it more opulent it's not breaking at all so there is no problem but there are very wax kind they can break i don't know what kind of wax that is but if you drill carefully you have a soft under a base where you drill and then it doesn't happen anything so i am very happy with what i have the flowers they are ending down underneath and in two trays a big one and a small one it's actually the same like this grit is a small one this grit is a big one and the branch streams in from outside okay there could be another little branch which goes back again so i think if the majority of the order here the line order is parallel there can be a little flirt with overlapping a little fluid just don't change the balcony that's what i always say about that okay so let me do another one i really i'm getting warm here warmed up for uh for more work because of i have much more to share so if if in case we get here together again we could do an um class for mastership so i think that is a very uh good opportunity because of uh bulma is very experienced in classes for all kinds of education but i think it is a very big step people say okay you need the master to be respected or what no this is not the only reason i think the very big reason is that a master should be ready for as a decider as a decider for a design direction for a business idea for to consequently uh have a team and and guide the team into a good result i think uh to be a a master florist is not only to do once a fantastic design so you need to study many skills and so i think it is very important that we learn a lot about techniques but we also learn all the methodologies principles and elements and that we know of of this and that we have a lot of knowledge for cultural things like the style lesson what kind of styles oh here coming in your work no no come in you are more important than what i have to say actually because of i can still say it later so let's turn it around para momento so so here i have a little a little of a modern rustic uh decoration for maybe for for a buffet and if people are not too sensitive they could even have this as a as a table decoration so that they could look here through and i think uh that is an option but i would say uh it's more for on a buffet on a sideboard or for this kind of work so let me tell you what i have here i come back to master education later i don't let it go because of i have so much to say about it and wonderful you see the neri no not no no it's amarina which is a um it's a hybrid between amaryllis and um amaryllis and nerina and it's fantastic this flower and i do a lot for amaryllis not that i am on the payroll for production no i am helping a flower which is ideal for our life circumstances the flower lasts very long the flower is very strong the colors are fantastic the flower has a beautiful face and wonderful legs so i would call it amongst all the naomi compels claudia schiffers and i i know more actually but don't let me mention all the models in the world but i think i we should mention here this rose do you have a name for this that is a fantastic rose it's the same color precisely like the color of the nerina that plate is what i have here is a taupe colored is a taupe colored wool a transparent disc which i did with wire and then on this i found a a greenish yellowish lichen which is growing usually on elderberry on some buccos i have a bit of ornithogalum arabicum which is uh in the new name what they give is uh ornithogalum sandozoni but when i was in education they called it arabicum or nytholomoravicum so but soon i'm done and what is this wonderful uh what are these strings here with this little cucumbers these little pumpkins this is deep lord zeke los palmatum and when we have people from taiwan here on the on the web then we can say dutch florists designers and guest designers in taiwan they found the diplodziklas me too i was also there at that time but i don't want to mention myself first because of the dutch colleagues they brought it to their gardeners in holland and nowadays you can have these wonderful strings in a little box for a bearable price especially in times when vines like ivy honeysuckle lunitzera and all this when this is not so available then you are happy when you have something which is draping down and uh yes i think i'm done so this is a structure all handmade and we want to teach in our classes for masters how to build props so this is a feather stone it's just a concrete material which has a little stone debris in there it is drilled in a iron bar wrapped with the clematis bark that is the bark of the clematis these are just stronger wires and we wove the candlestick also with wires and this is very stable this is something which is oh good to have the right color but we should glue it again okay so uh here is uh we put the flowers here in a in a tray and the tray has a bio regrettable foam here and i don't want to start a discussion about foam now i keep myself out of this but for the future i think we should really look out for less mineral mineral based uh not mineral uh oil based uh flour arranging aid you know so let me go on with oh here it shouldn't be here this is more for here so the discus discussion about the the forms and all that is very important we should really see what we do in the future so before i get to get to the next work then i to really tell you how i do my plannings is there a chance now um angelica that we show a few sketches yes of course so now we need to turn that around so that you see at least this from the bet i said it's the better side so perfect it's a perfectly symmetrical work what we really what we really want to do in the future for the class of masters that we go very much into the design rules that we go into symmetry asymmetry the line orders for example radial parallel overlapping diagonal winding free line order all this that we speak about relationships uh between height and depth and width and the directions in which a design is uh dominant for like this one is symmetrical and it is more wide like high in in in general so about all of this then talking about where is if there is a point of emergent where is it here there are 20 30 points of emergent because of these lines never joined together and all that needs to be discussed so that a master of floristry knows about the rules the design rules even if the personal style is a little different so i think we should really look out for that and uh you see the sketches the sketches are there now you see how i do my planning so when i do something what i haven't done before then i just take a little piece of paper and make a little communicative document for myself and then when i want that i have help that people help me then i can share it and i think when i am communicating with others with myself and also with the client so a master florist should be able to communicate with a client i think that is very important so and when the master florist is able to communicate then it is easy to create individuality because of for the client it looks like you designed it only for her for him which can be the case which i think it's wonderful because of people want to be spoiled spoiled by the professionality of a professional individual and sketching is one of it we should study together sketching at least sometimes in our days when we're here together a couple of hours even after dark still an hour of sketching i think sketching is communication and communication nowadays is more than important thank you very much how is it we do another one do we have another one no question what only about oh well there are a lot of compliments about your work compliments yes far too nice to me now thank you very much yes we enjoy even if it rains outside but we have compliments from our guests so my friends axel and mike they bring in now another work so this one is a bit heavy uh because of also in uh in gastronomic situations it should stand stable therefore we have this father stones which is this concrete a melted stone thing and it has its weight but it's also possible on a brick of what there's a question well um this question is uh like coming back to the sketches we just showed uh alina says how to implement ideas correctly if there are a lot of ideas in my head but when i start doing it it doesn't work i think we still need to study parallel to this the rules of proportions for example the rules of one one two three five eight you know this this kind of the fibonacci concept or or the leonardo da vinci concept so that we know how the uh rules of proportion are and that we know actually if we have too many expressive ideas side by side then we lose actually the clear expression of a work so you cannot follow too many expressions so if you say you have five ideas in your mind and you want to bring and implement them all in the work it can be too much so you know what i did was with the first horizontal bamboo lifting a wax plate drilling holes and placing flowers in there but the target was actually how do i find an interesting charismatic idea with a character bamboo and wax to place my flowers so that is the in parallel so but the only really important idea is drilling holes in placing flowers in there reaching the water and here it was building a platform in a structure with many flowers which are standing down in water but building that colorful platform and the candles and all that is just little touches i always do this like a a chemist or a pharmacist who takes a few drops to change the substance you know a little bit in in in russia they say choo choo choo choo you know so okay let's go for another all right here is here is mr chickenfoot huh no it is actually i like works which are super light which are floating i like floating things it maybe has to do with that i am not so light myself and so this is actually a rebar a rebar of [Music] six millimeters and it's [Music] the rebar is bent and here i added a few um feet uh like little bird feet uh to lift it up that it would not all depend uh from here then i must have a lot of weight here but i think for the eye this two very light feet are not too visible they are fairly fairly dainty fairly little to see now then i had the overlapping technique this is also something what we would study in classes together so that is the overlapping technique and of wires this wire is a 1.2 millimeter wire which is now i would say available in the most countries in the world they have wires and then i have very little miniature tubes and they are attached here under the this cox comp type of form and then one of my darlings here which is the gloriosa they call today superba but it's uh the old name when i was a a student it was gloriosa rothschild jana you know like the road shields the the barren family in in in france the road childiana and uh so i think and then look what i have here i have just a few stems of them but they are a little gift from magenparr new varieties of clematis diversity folios i was spoiled like hell years ago already with clematis in japan because of they had a lot of clematis for floristry which was really a stunning stunning material and they were wrapping them in newspaper wet and then afterwards in uh wet sprayed plastic from inside so i learned a lot from this all these treating flowers for preparation that they last and all that so but let me say that then i was really longing when i came back to europe let me have a few um um um clematis and then in the garden i planted some clematis vines and then for a short time i had them but the ones here from margin power which are now actually old year available the good thing about them is that you have many varieties and even you will see today a variety which is very seldom and there is there are a few people who are regularly working with margin par which are not so far away from them and they do fantastic designs with the more flowers not just clematis also other summer flowers and this is the wonderful thing that we have many things to combine and also that we are not getting overload by tulips there is a question angelica i see you so a question from lisa uh how are the feet attached wrapping i'm a big rapper actually if you see uh skelo and all these big wrappers but my wrapping is a different one you know so my wrapping is done with paper covered wire or with uh um with the black uh iron wire and here is uh our wire pieces this long about ten five going this way in this leg and five are going in this leg here and they are wrapped on the end of that iron bar is this answering my question next one yes question from pamela what is the material at the top of this design cornus alba sabirika this is the it's already dry i had it for christmas for my christmas works uh what i posted on instagram i'm actually posting every second day of work on instagram but they were sitting still in the garden and i said come on oops we go to holland and then you have one more time a good time in that cox comp arrangement at burma's and this is cornice you can you don't have such a wonderful red wood in the world like the corners corners yellow cornus orange the yellow one green yellow one is stellonifera an orange one is [Music] in sanguinea and then the orange one i don't know i don't know but you have so many colored wood sticks and when they are in the first year of their growth then you have wonderful colors different colors so that's wonderful for something which is still a bit wintery and yeah and we are still here march we are still a little winterly on sunday morning they promised us here in my hometown 5 minus so really frost you know more questions shitsumon no no someone okay i actually do have a question uh shaytu is asking how do you determine the materials other than flowers do you uh that's a good that's a good one how can i praise you your intelligent question you know what when something is in a modern home in a modern office in a modern building which is uh going the direction of you know like the good old mr conrad from england that interior what he called modern rustic you know modern rustic is modern but with more rustic materials there is an open stone wall there is maybe a high-tech old weathered factory hall there is a high-tech zinc concrete halogen light related no that is high-tech this is a little different high-tech but something where rusty iron where uh this steel steel tables maybe furniture which is also maybe then with the fabrics in the furniture which is related to this flowers here it is a perfect harmony if you have a modern rustic interior and you have works like that on them but if you say okay now you make it a little punky funky then you spray the whole structures bright red and you take little red and theriums and even phony wire and then you have a little little punk music related floristry sorry there is no punk music related floristry if you ask somebody but i tell you you can design like that and this is what you have to learn when you do do your education that the material choice has something to do with the social not social message the style message of the that what you want to relate to to be related to what is the rose here sorry i had to there are many new varieties that here is a rose which is very well when the gloriosa is perfectly three to four days old then it turns a little into a burgundy leaves the bright red is cayenne so that is a very good uh thing and what you need also is the repsalis here and the repsolis and the beargrass why you need this green is the vitalizer of floristry green makes floristry a life if you have just the colors the bright colors and you have no touch of green in there it's possible that we have just dyed dry flowers or artificial flowers nothing against that but what we want to do here is really the lively flowers we are in the heart of the flower movement in europe in arts meso today we talk about fresh flowers can i have the second piece so i want to show you a group you know what you want to learn as a as a master master florist is actually that you know to create scenes that you know to create [Music] a scene on a bigger table on a long table to make a series how much do i need to calculate the number of materials i need how many flowers do i need how many corners how many irons so if you just order if you have an endless budget please go for it but if you have to make your living by it it should be calculation business and all of that i think look at this beautiful clematis you have a name of this clematis yes so you see here the two uh horses are jumping together here from one side to the other so that is not so much work if the structures are done uh the the work is not so much but the prep for the structures this is a lot of work so it's took me about two hours two and a half hours to do this too but to put the flowers in now in total it's about 20 minutes that is not the problem but people like to really see something oh how is that done and i think this is a major question we have to fulfill and therefore we need very [Music] well done education and uh yeah so uh i have here uh that's not a book what i want to sell you i sell nothing today absolutely nothing but i have to say uh we offer uh a big book with sketches photographs text so what we give every week for one week to the master students so that they have material you know so that they have material and so with just works and then text again text in english so we cannot do this in in more languages uh that is at the moment i don't see the chance so you there should be english english but look here and then sketches for works different types so that some of the sketches they even include more information for you like a photograph a photograph uh fills even a lot of little details in which are taken away from the the most essential information so just the silhouettes of uh yeah you see bulma institute but this is not a this is not a book of downloads you know from other books from maybe my books no this is individually made text for master education and for for you and not what you also find thousand times in the web or what so it should not be it is individually it's your thing can we go ahead what do you think you have to say something the new one ah look at this beautiful very asian looking clematis sevilla and uh but that is not the the only one you see today there is a question yes angelica question we go question question from carmen where do you go for inspiration or who inspires you 335 pages i did a book wellsprings of inspiration but i don't want to let you down with an offer of a book by buying a book no it is actually i follow very much five wellsprings the one is uh craft and technique methodology of design you know like uh the what is visually uh to what i have to develop for the eye what i have to develop for the hand technique and uh and and and craftsmanship that these are two the third is what do i have material and flower this is the hardware of creation inspiration and then the two other ones are actually the softwares this is cultural suitability and emotion and situation i think that's very important i need the tray underneath here oh we have that tray yeah you have that i was afraid we forgot the train but no no no we don't is this answering your question because of to discuss inspiration you can do this about a whole week or you can say actually what is the uh which creative um way do you take and this is actually what i do so here my inspiration was culture that is you came up with in the right moment with this question because of this here is latin romans i call this latin romans because of in old churches in the latin world then you find chandeliers and lambs with these wire flowers and so i saw this once in southern france in a store there was a big lamp all done with these wire ornaments here and i said okay you are mine i do this as soon as i come home i will experiment with the wires and it took me a while and so i have never done this form but the idea with the with the wire flowers is actually a very old one from the latin cultures so let me do kind of a not table or sideboard work and herefore i have fantastic materials you see what i have i have the fritillaria miliagaris which is the czech panel flower and this is a very old flower you know so this is something which in very well protected areas still in the franconia in germany you still find them but they are very very well protected this is the czech panel flower because of the patterns in them they are really like a check panel pattern and then but i welded the wire i have to say that i welded the wire painted the wire not welded painted the wire because of i made it a little darkish green so that the black wire doesn't become too much of a a mania rhythm a mania and in that disc i filled in some moss and covering this with an invisible wire and now i build and then that whole thing is standing on this also splitted wire feed so this is all handmade by myself so to build props i said that about 15 minutes ago to build your own props is part of your skill when you are a master designer here i have something very special that's also a margin power which is the talinum the talinum is a very magic much more dainty than dainty then gypsophila has this little shiny burgundy little balls at the end very tiny and then a few of the little group of the um clematis and ran unclear so you see i have some roses here on the side but i think this would be the wrong place for the roses at the moment i have the feeling i should stay very much in this spring related flowers don't fill much green in here because of when i fill green here then i push the appearance of the greenish wire flowers away so then i don't see the wire flowers anymore ranunculus sorry so here could also be a wonderful grass which is all year available also by margin part is the shasmansium and later in the summer you have the breezas and you have many others but i like that playing here it has a bit of a vegetative touch but it is not really a vegetative design because of for a vegetative design it needs actually more less decoratively made handmade craft then it should be just growing like in a meadow now i think soon i turn it around you see we are quick but believe me we are well prepared i had wonderful help so this year in this corona times i can work with my wife and we are preparing uh at the moment everything together so this is for me a new experience i love to travel and i love to be with all yours but i should also say this is a wonderful time for both of us you see here i have to rush ahead before i start too much dreaming about our good times [Music] you see how important the talino is the talinum and also the jasmine the jasmine even if the flowers are not really open but they help to stretch that floral part so let me go i have time enough i think i don't need to rush too much so all the props here this is actually wire wire wire wire so i have nobody who welds that for me i have nobody who buys that for me so i am always proud and happy when i build my own props i think that angelica has collected some more questions have you no oh hi already ah okay okay yes thank you so so i have to group a little bit some flowers like this ranunculus they should not be everywhere and also the beautiful fritillarias and also some of these clematis i'm grouping and i want to rush i want to do it quickly but i promise you when we are together and have more time to go deeper into the subjects and also when we can go home and do our homework you know when the master school students when they do their homework and doing their studies in detail i think then it is even more fun but at the moment we cannot really say when it is our plan is for later in the year but you better discuss this with uh jacqueline and uh with mike so at the moment it's also not a plan to do this master education at a as a as a online class but at least we want to uh offer this for the future because of that is a long term dream of that we would do here in the heart of the flowers in holland together postponed already twice but who knows how it goes on with our covet our new friend okay so i think i'm done i still could uh you have a little more of that jasmine don't you think so jess yeah so you see also romantic work uh what i what i'm doing so it is not you you know that i like to work also with a handful of flowers with very little amounts so and and grouping a few little things and then let the lines go form linear have you seen all my postings about foam linea and the last time yes i like to do foam linea but we should also we should also study the vegetation which means the vegetative style and we should study the form linear because of these are the two very important teachers of floristry beside uh the decorative the decorative is actually what we humans uh creates that we say i want it this way i want it this way but if you say i want to go under the wings of lines and forms then i really uh have to study this in in terms of angles uh symmetry asymmetry heights length uh depth uh depth width and all that you know so i wait for just a few no no no we are fine thank you we can already have an eye on the next work so one hour is over you see time is running huh i don't want to make it boring so that we get enough to see we should some of us should get to know each other a little better so latin romans romantica latina este so yes so that is very important that we accept many cultural influences in our forestry not to forget asia japan china indonesia all these cultures so i want to have it all in mind when i am talking about cultural targets in flower design in floristry and emotional so okay that's about it shall i i think i go once around the table and put a little of that darker color in here that i create kind of a focal area here everything is in water and i don't i care absolutely for the fact that it is less or more biodegradable [Music] arranging eight i think that's what we should not forget for the future thank you very much and we are going to the next a question from angela uh why your works affect my hands what tips would you give uh to use uh with two people with health issues concerning their hands uh hell health okay i i was just afraid you are uh caring for your fingernails but no no health issue oh yeah yeah i think if it is about uh the wiring if you say for example you want to wire something like this you you really you hold one hand stiff and the other hand is very flexible and you use it like this one hand should be very stiff and then in this tension between stiff and moving then you can bend the wires very easy so if this wire is not as thin like this is a thicker wire it still helps but when it becomes 1.8 you shouldn't try this this is zero six one point eight millimeter wire is if you have a health issue with your finger a little hard so wait a minute oh i wish i could fiddle a little longer on this here but i think i have more to do how is that yes and if you uh okay if you have difficulties to uh to wrap the wires then you should say okay i take a grayish or a blackish raffia and i wrap everything on raffia and you know what hitomi gilliam from canada is doing she has this extender extenders these are medullino uh medullino vines and she is wrapping that with wool yarn and so you can also take a a a wire colored wool or yarn and then you wrap with that but if you need the wire for stability then you should not work that style because of you i can't help you if there is a if you don't have the the strength in your hand for this then uh it's difficult so look out for this extenders i think this is a very good medium metallino covered with yarns wools and then maybe in a wire color so then you have the same effect but it is not so hard to do but it also doesn't i repeat myself carry so well so what do i have you seen this ones the new scopes what what is the name we find out in a minute is that the name okay we'll find out in a minute so it's a beautiful they call it scope the margin par um scabiosas what vocal scoop that is really something oh yeah look at this and then oh thank you then you have the jasminium officinalis but they are not open blooming now and then i have the fritillaria miliagris fritillarias you will see a little more today i have other varieties and you have some ranunculus but what do i have here these are meant as candlesticks from a wholesaler i bought them a couple of years ago in cologne in a in a wholesale place and i still have them and but you have also these cones stainless steel cones zinc cones even some people they sell plastic or iron and lock it and so you can drill hole in that hole holes in that piece and then you uh put them in in a glue which is not too sensitive for influence of water and then you place them in there and then i hammered wires in here this is the 1.8 millimeter wire two of them together wrapped with the paper covered wire and you have this lifting sticks here and then i have here this is a thyme from the mediterranean countries uh in every country is something like that in the summit you just take hey hey tell me what i say and then you attach them with a wire on each other also on this lifting wires and you build a strong grid for this floating spring collection here okay if i would have now uh some leaves of the uh i should bring them from home but uh it was so strongly freezing two weeks ago so that they were all gone the leaves of the epi medium epi medium it's a perennial wonderful or alcamilla leaves or the leaves of mature haliburus so that would be better but i have this little antherium leaves here and they are actually good for to bring in some green but not too much everything is a bit floating in the air also this magic and good well uh scobiosis here in the center uh the whole work is a little more concentrated so this is the focal area it's not the focal point not the focal line is the focal area so we have four different vocals in the design worlds but all of this we should discuss in our classes angelica how does it look more questions well a lot of questions yes please come up i love questions you know that some of your questions they opened actually the quality of our communication because of they were just in time that i could speak about something which is very important and interesting for our design decisions you know so please come up i love it i love it love it well i have one question about the previous arrangement um i can't find the name uh maybe i can yes mandy um she has a question about what was in the moss disk the moss disk is just a wire grid which is the the chicken wire technique and then we push the moss from this side and the mask from this side and twirled it together with wire forks wire crushes and we twisted them together so then if after five six of them they don't fall off anymore and then maybe you have a very thin blackish or greenish wire and then you wrap it in so that is lasting forever so but now it's fresh which is much much more attractive is that answering your question yes it does good more more question not at the moment yeah we called it live stream and so we should be able to answer questions i think when you really in the middle of the day take your time to listen to us it should be at least a few answered question besides looking to the work building props out of existing hard goods of our trade partners if we go to a a wholesale place for decoration materials that we are able to combine these materials what they offer to us and make them lick looking always different i think that is something which should be a wonderful field for the uh for the master designer the educated master designer if it was a stand for to lift an easter net in this time it can be a stand for to lift a wire christmas tree with lichen branches in december so i think this is really that we you know that colleague a very clever colleague from switzerland mrs von boletsky she said even an accident when something is tilting tipping over or when you had an accident that something was falling down pick it up and think what can you do with the rest even an accident can be a creative chance so i really like to mention to my students this kind of word even it is not my word but i want to say how important this kind of building out of nothing is the building out of something which was in an accident or combining things who had another meaning and still are useful for our creative process see how beautiful these jasmines are we take a lot of leaves off taking leaves off is for this kind of floristry often very important because of that many leaves they really cost the life of some materials stems and leaves and that is what the old english florists found out when they and invented the tape and wire technique and taking the blossoms of the stems and put them on a wire and taped them so it created at that time a fantastic style which was practiced for dozens of years i don't say for hundreds but for a long time the tape and wire technique was originally english so therefore is it wonderful that we are melting here in front of our work table burma together so you have listened to you did listen to angelica who said where all the people here today are coming from so greetings to singapore yes uh so i have uh two questions but they're kind of the same um the question from peggy and from taiwan the question is what are those cones um and it's a nickel nickel is a it's a a metal which is a combination of uh of of uh i don't know precisely of what so i'm not a a chemi chemical scientist but we call it nickel and this is not oxidizing it lasts for years i have them for a couple of years and the nice is the nice thing that their feet are a little bent and so that they are having this floral movement of these sticks where they are standing on it's a very symmetrical work but internal order has some asymmetrical flirts so i need to say that i like to flirt in between design categories angelica what's more yes a second part of that question was also how are the silver metal phases uh drill the hole drill the hole and then take in a silicone and gluing it in the wood so drilling a hole zero six zero seven this size and then it's a wonderful standing there it's transportable is you can use it again but if you don't want to use this hard good then you can take also pods like there are some pods in the nature you inseal them with lacquer and you can also work with them but then after a time they start rotting and you have to throw them away or you make compost from them but uh i think uh these iron things are good for you know for uh your hopefully they come back our hotel partners that they really have fun to come back and to enjoy not only their guests but also our service so you see here this is a design which can be abs thank you which can be absolutely double-sided it can be from this side and from the other and uh hello boros uh cabiosa fretillaria therium leaves jasmine and ranunculus and these sickles they are made out of thyme folds thyme we buy the bundles from southern europe we get them from italy southern france and uh unexpensive material ma'am can i answer something yes question from sarah how can you transfer this beautiful design safely by car that is not a problem that is not a problem you know i'm rough no that is really that is really not a problem the problem is when something is going right and then hanging down and then you if it's well done and the flowers don't fall out then you have little tubes with a lead and water in there and then you lay lay it on the back this higher works so that you get them in even a smaller car so there are always ways but it's better to think about it before and not when you have it done and then you think oh how do i get it away so i think the planning is masters quality cheers it's water angelica yes question from hendra do you have a store room full of old props and do you recycle them regularly i tell you the most of these guys i take them apart next week i take them apart and i put several things in boxes so you know there is that tubes on an arm you know here this one there were tubes on an arm you cut them off put them in a box and then you have many of them a few with oxidized wire a few with a paper covered wire a few with organic material a few with wax and then you have the boxes for this see how beautifully organized this school here is all these order here with thousands of articles so that is what you unfortunately you have to do i don't storage too many works for too long because of then after a time in my case i have many florists who would come back to me by online or even life then they would say oh i have seen this before so not too many of these things should be storaged and for too long and used too much again it's better you take them apart and you build them new so many of the things i show you today they were just made last week and i can use them maybe one more time somewhere else but don't use too many times one structure it is another thing if you are a florist you are in the middle of paris and there are many many different customers and you do this design once in the spring for this client once in the summer for this client and once in the next winter maybe with apples and christmas ornaments for and conifers for the christmas period so this is my advice it might be that you are in such a big town that nobody knows what you ever have done but don't hope that it is better when they know what you have done because of you do it so beautiful oh we're quick today huh okay so now we should do another one how is that sir yes thank you very stable so the lady was it hendra if she was afraid of stability in cars or what no problem so that is one of the most easy to transport works and even the flowers when you have a bit of a hillside street with stones and pebbles it would not easy jumping out the flowers in the tubes and something like that no i have a buffet decoration or what something on a sideboard see what we have it is a iron frame something what you buy in the places yeah first we show it from this side this is something what you show uh what you have uh what you have what you bought from somebody that is that wire that welded frame i also weld myself but this one is what i purchased and then all these little wire hooks wrapped with this wire and the 1.8 iron wire so all the flowers which are resting here on that rack they are all placed down here in this tubes and i think that also these vendors up here they have little tubes here just two little ones they also have water so they can sit there for a longer time and i think that's very important and you see the wonderful wax plate here i come back to you this wax plate is a peach colored mixed wax which is attached after hardening cooling out on this wire grit which is done in a vertical horizontal order of wires and the birch sticks which are also looking a bit in the color like iron and wire they are woven in in also a cross pattern so you see this would be something for a buffet for a sideboard for if it is on a table it could be a kind of a room decoration my flowers will be fritillaria persica and will be uh what else the nerina amarina and then a bit of le pismium cruz bolivianum which is now here from alzmere there is a grower who has fantastic uh repsalis what is what is his name you have the name that is a good one and uh they have fantastic repsalis and vines and so if you buy a pot and you can cut it over the whole winter and you are sure in a season where you normally don't have a lot of stuff from outside except from the southern semisphere of the world then you have the summer there but we are poor like the next local church mouse because of we don't have vines for the winter so we are happy to have all these guys like the reptiles the cactus family they have 50 varieties available and it's fantastic what you can do with them question yes question from angela when you create a design are you always thinking of three five eight and the principles and elements of design or do you occasionally just do what you feel uh no i think uh i it is a constant uh jing and yang a dancing from one side to the other so when i have for example i would see this stand here then my first impact remember the five world springs what do i have it would be that frame the second thought would be i built a grid on that frame so it would be a grid of wire and the birch this would be craftsmanship wrapping a grid on then i would think of oh i want a focal point and a focal line focal point is the wax and the focal line is actually the flowers on that rack design then culturally what would it be good for it would be for a modern rustic interior maybe these walls here is also a bit modern rustic and i would create something for that this would be a cultural question if it would be very symmetrical and static it would be a little more official and not so much of romantic you see the brain is going from one wellspring of inspiration to the other if you hear that now from me you think oh man that man is talking from left to right and from up to down and from down to up and everything and slant and curvy and every now you can organize your creative thinking but if you have done this for example for example with us here for a couple of days you start to understand how to develop your own creative idea does it make sense is it answering your question kind of huh yeah but i always start with the first step and the first step here in this case was the frame what can i do with this frame but another time you have a customer who says i need for my modern rustic room for the birthday of my 50 year old husband what can you do for me then it would be a cultural impact to have a room decoration on a table on the sideboard and then maybe some candles around here what can we do with these colors that would be another beginning so everybody starts a creation in a different category so me here it was when i was in my storage room and i saw that structure there okay i will wrap the wires and then weave the oh i have that wax i make a wax plate and the wax plate is my focal point and then you know that actually i don't need to repeat it going from one uh category to the next till the end and when the last flower is in then you know that you were going through five different categories of inspiration i think we talk too much today here huh don't we but i should really touch flowers let me turn it around so also this is very stable you can bring it from holland to here and from here home again from home to holland and and back again so i think these flowers they last two weeks if you have a daily uh daily or all second day second days refill and these tubes are not too large this is a kind of a long-lasting plastic but i think glass is also good is more yes when you see it is incredible elegant but what i have here is actually this silicone tubes they are covered with black wrapping wire and the black wrapping wire it can oxidize and it still looks good and if you don't want it oxidizing then you can cover it with as you spray it with a clear lacquer or you paint it with a clear lacquer or even wax so in the last time i was experimenting very much with the legs wax you see here a wonderful flower which is also really making its career since a couple of years that is the fritillaria persica the iranian iranian fritillaria and it could have let me be serious about it a little bigger tubes so the tubes i brought from home they were a little small so please remember that when you use them again that you have a little bigger tubes maybe two centimeters wide and 10 15 15 centimeters long so that rag here is made out of a bronze net that is a bronze net wire and there is also the there are the uh birch sticks little birch sticks takes little debris uh pushed in there so the nerina and then we are also done here i turn it around when i'm done and then you see oh it could be some french tulips in a peach tone they would be also perfect here because of the wax is a bit peachy salmon-ish so there are many ways you can go i think color is a very emotional uh medium yeah and and and uh a platform where emotions in floristry flower design can be wonderfully transported transmitted so i think color lesson should be should be very much our big theme for the school of masters but about the school and when and what and such you speak with the principle of the schools uh the principles of the school and not with me i just can tell you what we could do together and i think that's about it okay if i had a little more time then maybe i would have some washi paper a little washi paper and would also dip that in this color of wax and would attach some of these little washi fibers which are dipped in wax and would them have them in between that flowers on the rag here this one is a work practical for floristry daily what you have for the next saturday if gastronomy is open again and something what you can do when it's prepared technically you can do in 10 minutes 15 minutes that's also something what a master should do create things which are very quickly to do nerina is amarina is the name of this flower amarina and fritillaria persica wanda anzu yes she is having a question i am so happy when you have a question a question from marianne should there always be a vocal point and vocal line in every design if if you uh want to make a let me call it landing place for your eyes for the eyes of the beholder the person who looks to what you have done then you have a focal point if you see architecture for example you have a huge business building 50 stories high it's really like a just a rectangular block out of covered with mirror and glass and then the entrance hall is something which looks very spectacular because of an individual form then it could be like a vocal or you have a dress which is really very uh uh a tweed dress in in french they would say uh robert and then you have a big brush here or some focal point or what is the focal point of a person it's the face because of it includes the most graphic uh patterns on a body even if some people look other places like faces but this is not so much my subject here please understand that and uh focal is something where the eye starts to discover a creation whatever it is so it is not obligatory if you see some tapestry you make a wonderful wall or hanging carpet on a stand or or a painting it doesn't really need a focal but the focal as the most important concentration of forms lines patterns um structure is actually something which creates the difference to other parts of the design so if you have a wall carpet and it is one pattern pattern like another one and there is no focal it can be a pa piece of art in the quality of building that pattern or doing that technique but i think to create a tension between different areas of a creation is a focal a focal point a focal area a focal line or even a focal circle this is very important but we cannot only discuss this in about five minutes here but i answered your question i hope i did it right angelica yes a question about the wax plate how did you attach it i made also with a small drill a drill bit four millimeters took some wires and was hanging it from above that uh it did not crack is actually that i also had two little holes down here so that all the weight is not going into that hanging part so the wire could cut the wax when it's getting warm so then i have also two binding point and wires down at the under end to lift it up so that i'm not only depending on the two upper binding points question question from barbara how did you attach the water tubes the water tubes that is a tricky thing here they are big like this and they have an arm with a t at the end up here there is a t and then under that turn here there is the tube so that that t is attached here on that bar and going down coming up again and holding these tubes here and this is a fairly good technique because if you can use it again and again and if you want to clean it please put some chlorine in the water fill it with chlorine water and if you pour it next morning off and then you can use it again chlorine attaching tubes is a science in itself there are so many methods i think i could do a class only about one and a half two days all the different methods how how tubes can be attached on something maybe to make a flute may yeah a flute can be a radial flute a parallel flute an overlapping flute on tube on an arm tube on an arm with a t it's unbelievable even if you have no stick for your tube so you bind a flower in the air here on the on the structure here would be the end of the stem and you would make with a special technique that the tube would be held at the nerina or the heliconia and it would include water and you have it lasting for without a refill for two three days you know there are so many techniques thank you that you ask so i had the chance to say don't underestimate how much you can do with tubes and if you are start thinking about making tubes yourself out of organic out of nature out of wax out of paper waxed and other materials which are organic then you get really dizzy thinking about what you all can do okay and if you demonstrate it and use it and such then it would be a sleepless night afterwards because if you have so much to think and and such do we have more work yes still i think two yeah yeah that's okay two what is the time now oh oh oh we should rush we should rush yes oh but i i'm happy that you have this question it shows me that there is a lot of interest for technical solutions for design decisions by the way tomorrow i go to the hairdresser but i should not complain about covet so you see here these are organically covered tubes just a few flowers these are ceramic triangles i got them as a present in washoe and i love them very much and i had them for a longer time but last week i said oops come on i need you in holland and for my video what i did a short video and and and then here now for bulma so to say this is the right chosen container and you can do a design in a minute in two and five in ten minutes which is actually so important you don't need it all you know some gloriosas and then so i'm very proud i brought a few flowers from germany but i'm not too proud for too long because of then i saw the label they came from holland before but i promise you tonight i don't take them home so they stay here and hopefully they find a good time after and not too early in the grave so see this beautiful crown jewels here the gorgeous gloriosas there's a far too many i just only need two two of them i just brought them from germany but they are originally here from holland gloriosas are really flowers i always say these are florist flowers florists they are crazy for them and then i have this uh lotus nilumbium nutsy fera that is the lotus seed pods and then i have a few of this [Music] allium and you know what maybe you don't like to hear it but if you do an examination of to be a master florist you need to study botany a lot of botany can be done online so that maybe i have to prepare lists of uh 10 conifers uh 10 blooming branches for the spring 20 tropical cut flowers 20 bromeliads 25 orchids with a full botanical name and i think that's what we need so i think therefore we could go today wonderfully online let me say it like that so yeah here that's that's for people who want to do work in a short time who want to do floristry for the daily needs for corporate work for such orders so okay you see i found this one very important to convince you that we can do floristry when we have once the information about different techniques we know what is out there we know the materials how they last what could never last you know like having a lilac in so much water for example if you know all that then you don't get lost and now i think can we have another work i think we have one beside yeah there is a question how wonderful that we have all yours and angelicus questions love it so a question from taiwan the angle of the tubes will that be an issue for holding the water for the flowers if the tube is like this the water goes very slowly down but if the water is like the tube is like this the water is very quickly at the end so if the flower is leaning against the roof of the tube the roof of the tube it would be very quickly empty so this lube uh tubes here they should have a gum lead did you hear it gum lead you can even work and i could not do all that for today if you have a grid under the ceiling and you have caller lilies or something and you can use them upside down and with the tubes with a lead and before even you can inseal that the color lily doesn't slip out and you inseal this with a cold glue so very much done before very successful flowers in water that's an issue more question yes question from barbara please explain how you developed the water tubes the water tubes is something which already was there before i was born in the 30s in the 30s of the last century there were already people who had done a plant design with tropical plants ferns bromeliads orchids and they also included a few flowers in tubes and it was here in holland and also in germany and i saw a book in america they also had some tubes so the tube is not my invention but i just am very happy that we have so many ways to work with them next one please i hope i answered your question one more question two more ah two more works and no question no who dj dj says hi okay bonjour dj you'll see what a perfection here see what these gentlemen are all doing here you should see the studio here flower schools become television studios today you know there is a huge screen and if i would correct your works here we could do this even online but we don't we do life we want to do a live class with you oh that's that's a good one here oh yeah there's a letter for me thank you yeah number nine oh we were quick huh yeah so you know this was has to be a little bit more to the back this was an uh a broken uh vase there the the the head broke off i used this for uh for the class two weeks ago uh the online class and uh but there was not so many beautiful flowers in here like now i just want to say show what is happening when your uh vase breaks off and you don't need to through such an expensive thing away and uh all of this is waxed even the miscanthus grass uh sickles they are waxed and attached here on this uh on this clamp on the vase so just thank you sir you'll see this is the fritillaria persica so this as maybe as a buffet decoration or something look at this gorgeous orchids what i have but i should not praise the orchids because of my asian friends they have so many beautiful orchids that is really not to top when i for example remember on the singapore garden show when we did the the the speech about design and such and it was next to a orchid exhibition so i really was getting blind from all these beautiful orchids so you see all this is hanging all this is hooked up in these upper in this upper structure and if i want to make an easter structure so i can also hang the the quail axe in there but i said let me do it with flowers i don't want to go with quail eggs so fritzillaria not too much leaves tubes not too small [Music] and you see this they are not too big in inflorescence but they are gorgeous in in their color it is more a brown burgundy and this is one of the beauties who start in the beginning of march end of february and they are gorgeous to work with no it's enough now we go with a bit of other things i have to rush that we can we go five minutes longer is that possible so this is also something buffet room sideboard even in the middle of the room it should be multi-directional here i have wonderful little antheriums do you see what i have this beautiful little uh aetheriums these are also i think from the pot plant growth sometimes when the growers they have too many in bloom they cut them off and sell them as cut flowers and this is a gorgeous quality for little flowers small and thorium especially for here these ones especially for gastronomy you know table decorations little mini arrangements on the guest room and all that i don't want to say toilet flowers but all that little stuff i think they are gorgeous for and i think the small ethereums have a big future also the big ones but we constantly need to invent that's what i learned in holland from one of these managers of the holland auctions this gentleman said gregor we need to constantly make new type of cut flowers which people know which flower faces what they really see all the time so that we invent constantly new colors new forms inside soy was a mr van dyke i have never forget forgotten what he said uh shall i really yes inventing constantly new colors and all that so that flower people never get feeling bored from what they get offered but also the the summer flowers at the moment if you see the the scabiosas and the xenias asters all of this is on a big flow of innovation so now i have some equisetum here the equisetum ha they have a wire hook i can still fill the upper element a bit with water so that they last a little better and i have this i need to say that this uh phalaenopsis here for 10 days already i brought them with me i said they should have a chance to live even when they're where they are born in holland and i love that color combination especially with this winter burned brownish fresh ivy which is fantastic in combination with all this no i'm fine i'm fine i'm fine you are such a gentleman mike yeah i really need to say that okay so here we are and oh it is a shame that we are already close to a finish here because of i'm in a good flow now i could go on and on but we still have to drive home tonight which is a shame [Music] so you don't believe how many flowers can be in such a work the wax waxed miscanthus sickles they are good now for this season you know still something is iced when you look out of the out of the window in this march mornings but so for this season is fine but when we are getting close to april ma may then the wax is actually as i said before is over so the wax is good very well replacing a cool winter morning with the sunlight on a bit of iced plants so now you have some vital green lines in here so you see that the waxed miscanthus wrappings that they have still something vital accompanying them so that there is some green you have a question only needs to look to you you have a question it's wonderful yes so question from felicia can you explain about felicia yes yes yes can you explain about tension of a design tension the tension is for example when i create the difference between a strong focal point and a very calm work the the the relationship in between is the tension and you say in holland is spunning in in spanish is tensiones uh tension between factors it's not only a contrast tension is something what you really feel tension is also when the temperament of people in a in a community is growing so that can be negative and positive so that is also that so here the tension is here is very floral and this is very very empty so that is two thirds an eight part of herbaceous and a third is dry fresh and dry is a contrast but it also creates attention i hope i explained that very clear excuse me so it's done i sometimes i think could we not fiddle another five minutes but i love this today i need to admit that i was very decorative but i think also when we see at the moment the floristry in the world like vintage boho garden style all these styles that we really have much more of a decorative time uh than before so now we have one more and this is another piece of latin romans i'm done yes perfect okay i feel you have another question uh angelica no no question so everything is hanging the other design was everything is on a rack and this one here is on uh thank you jacqueline this is on a moss cushion it's a flat cushion what we made at home and framed it with black oxidizable iron wire so that stand is an old chandelier which i not old i bought it just two years ago and transformed it with these wire flowers wire ornaments and i think that is latin romance i call it always in a short form latrom latin romance so take a paper chairway so you see here this is uh a double wire uh four millimeters and all these wire ornaments are attached on with the black oxidizable wire and you see here there are this little double wire hooks and with them i can hook them very well in the moss cushion i can take them in i can take them out and i can take more i can take less i can spray them that they are not oxidizable and i can use them as they are oxidizable beautiful so just let me finish this work here in a few minutes this uh unbelievable rose in this latin romance work its name is tortilla so it it fits tortilla la tortilla you know the um corn um weed tortillas and they have a bit of that peachy what also some of the winterley ivy leaves have and i cut the flowers fairly flat so that i don't take too much water away from the now the clematis i think that is something what i should share with our your friends see what this is this is a clematis and also it comes more and more from margin par also our dear colleague joe messi from england he makes made on internet from margin parts some wonderful works with them and i think this is something beautiful in here it goes very much in that very romantic work and water enough for all these flowers i think there is enough don't take the tubes too small for the clematis the clematis don't like too much of small too much small too much of small tubes so that should not be we should study what kind of flowers are good for tubes what flowers are good for these new foams are there new foams what kind of foams do we have but this is today not so much my subject here i have a darling rose what is its name bubblegum that's a darling i had it years ago in japan a few years but i never saw it here and but i think at here in altsman i think it was around for longer beautiful then i have the diplod c-class which is the no it's okay a bit of fritillaria so you see the the tubes also hanging on a wired stick and then also i have the grayish look at this look at this this is the poplar that's what they sell here in all aldemere in the winter time it was outside on the piles maybe [Music] sitting there for longer but i think it's perfect for me here to frame this work here a little stronger let rom latin romans hooking in also that mat that moss mat which is humid so this humidity is good for the flowers to to last so it spreads humidity so also if you would have another structure which not would be not latin romans it would be more modern and then tropical so we can put little orchid plants and little orchid bromelia plants on there and blooming and would last for weeks or months or even for a trade fair booth for hotel entrance or something so just let me finish a little bit i need a little bit of where are my glasses here they are so i should say thank you for the help i had with this designs thank you also my wife gabby she was a very good work companion to me in these days and but believe me [Music] it is a great time together when you are a florist and you can share this most beautiful profession in the world or one of the most beautiful professions in the world the floristry it could go another hour or two but i have to stop mike burma what would you say we should tell these people out there i think if you would like to learn all these types of techniques and really go deep into the knowledge of flowers and the floristic profession then you can join us in the in the course we will start i think in november so i think if you would like to join us and learn all these intricate types of designs and techniques if you want to deepen your floristic knowledge then you can join us in the mastering european floral design course and that's coming up in november we are hoping that we can make it continue we have postponed it from this month to november because everyone knows the current situation so but gregor will teach this 20-day course 10 days in november and then 10 days in 2022 and you can study from gregor you will be in a class with maximum 15 people maximum 14 probably and there will be an exam at the end so you will be tested on your skills you will be trained to a certain level so that you can achieve the skills that you are probably looking for for a long time and learned to design in a european master way yes i think that's it and uh believe me it looked like work but it was pleasure and all these two days here or one and a half days we are here so it was that target to share this works with you for two hours and if you are there still and watch and listen thank you for your time and we do our best to spoil you next time whenever that is thank you very much also if you have enjoyed this pro

look no i'm it's not a dragon crappy look but then it's like in your face but not really i [Music] hi guys so welcome back to my channel thank you so much for joining us so as you can see and you probably already know with the thumbnail i am joined by a very special guest i'm joined here by my younger sister i feel like i look like sad trash while i'm sitting my chair because she's all you know beat up [Music] okay so you guys she's actually going to be doing my makeup she's actually a professional artist please introduce yourself hi you guys i'm a yandere luisa i'm a makeup artist i'll actually link her instagram account on the screen and i'll also leave her email address so that if you're interested oopsie i'm so sorry we've already started drinking if you want to link up as well actually drinking savannah i'm gonna point a drink and i cannot come on this is too much is too much and i'm gonna be drinking oh my gosh thank you if you thought i was busy thank you guys if you thought i was a bit bulgy oh brace yourselves okay i'm not i'm not that's me i'm not right cafe so guys let's just get right into it i'm so excited to have my face and after here we're going out for drinks it's veggies and you guys i am so excited because i haven't like touched any space i've never touched a face before so it's actually my first time so it's actually like interesting and we'll see what happens but this is gonna turn out but that's no no no no no no no because she actually did like my face i i wanted to hire her then we went to five days to find i don't like dare her face just like i i just did her touch-ups that's it that i've just never done like a full face beat and stuff but then that has never happened before okay i suppose and you guys the reason why i was also doing the sister tag like my sister does my makeup is because she's like queen of face beach i'm more so i go for like the more everyday look i'll do that video for you guys as well but for now i wanted to give you like an absolutely glamorous type of look buy an actual professional makeup artist because honestly guys and i just wing it kind of nature like even with my makeup you can see i i just winged it evenly eyeshadow so with her she's more creative on that side and that's why i prefer that she would do my makeup for this particular video anyway let's just get right into it okay guys so this is what i'll be doing first tweezing because her eyebrows have to be nicely tweezed because of course if you want your eyebrows to turn out just like me you have to tweeze so you can't be like oh bushy eyebrows they do your eyebrows no it doesn't work that way so you first have to tweeze the eyebrows to turn on extremely finely know that right and then do you charge for no i don't no i don't okay no i don't so guys this is the tweezer that i use you can't find it and guys it's not painful by the way it's not painful ouch yeah i've never used that type of teeth in a while [Music] oh [Music] so guys now i'm done tweezing what i do some people prefer starting with the foundation that i prefer starting with like the eyes because i feel like i take time when it comes to eyes that's very interesting because i prefer starting with eyebrows and then foundation both i am that i've observed her she starts with her eyebrows and then she goes to eyeshadows before she applies foundation but her eye makeup is legit everything guys i i can't do it at all i'm matched i'm mad oh my god guys the eyebrows are like literally the important part when it comes to makeup so if your eyeballs are like crap your whole makeup is going to be crap so this is like literally my favorite part if i just like conceal like eyebrows isn't it exciting you ladies you feel me if you're a makeup chick you feel me no i just want to be done with my makeup so that i can just replete but sometimes i do enjoy like putting on my makeup the whole process but the most important thing is my face turning out exactly how i want it to turn out in my head i actually hired ayanna for a very important event that's coming up soon and i want to know because business with pleasure by the way oh my word oh absolutely of course i'm gonna pay her nothing for my what are you trying to say and now i'm no longer exactly what you're doing but to be fair i get it i love this majority of the times always i see her face and then next thing full makeup is [Music] right guys this is like a concealer as you can see it's like extremely light lighter than her skin tone i like this actually it gives like an illusion like you tweezed or something i use it right now and i use like a shade that's lighter than my actual skin color so i feel like it actually gives the illusion like that it pop out that okay i did my eyebrows so this is like a lego pro concealer oh so you actually put the concealer on your i just take the concealer right from the tomb and start working on i just feel like it's way easier okay i actually like making it like look flat you know flatter to not flap flat so i just like use my two fingers then it's like super sharp [Music] actually like for prime i don't actually use like the actual primer and actually it's like a thick knee spray i feel like it does the job and it makes your makeup last long enough so that's what i'll be using to prime my face so what does it do so do you still use um the primer when you're done with the foundation no you just use it underneath or you use it after as well after as well oh okay oh then you don't have to buy the primer yeah it as you can see the eyebrows are done so i'm literally going to the eyeshadow part so guys the eyeshadow palette that i'm using is colors limited 15 color eyeshadow i like people like virginia so yeah oh so i'll be basically starting with the warm colors which is like orange colors these three are my favorite really nice the nude shades are literally my favorite the first the first three are like so pretty yeah okay but anyway well i'll be literally starting with this one not the favorite one i mean it's oh she is so don't you have like a transition color you have to start with all that this is like literally the transition color you know it's actually important because you find some other girls like looking like pink it doesn't look okay because actually probably you start with like this color it's not going to look nice it has to look 3d so what type of look are we going for so okay she expects me to give her that like kind of drag queen type of look no it's not a dragon copper look but then it's like in your face but not really i don't know if you get anything okay so what colors are we going for for the eyeshadow okay so we literally gonna go for nude the first three colours oh so you are gonna use this yeah i'm actually playing around with the colors like i'm wrong so ayanda when did your love for makeup start that's actually like an interesting question you know so basically when i was like 18 and i just like staying at home just like doing my face like i was actually learning about my face and i just like did makeup and i actually tried different type of looks and i actually didn't notice that like that was actually practice for me and i actually as like the days went my makeup became fine oh by the way as you guys can see this is like yellow oh yeah it's yellow insane right so yellow and orange are literally the best colors okay what are you doing now um so this is like my smelly eyeshadow what's the name of the eyeshadow [Laughter] i can tell something was written here yeah okay the name we don't know like this oh yeah okay scarlet hill oh yeah scarlet hill you were just like it's like a small eyeshadow it has basically a few colors so but i i want to use like chocolate it's like chocolate chocolate brown ooh coco i guess yeah if i'm basically using cocoa only the first one [Music] that actually looks nice wow really yeah has never seen yeah guys that's the first look from the orange and actually do something they play a role even if you can't see it it doesn't tell them again are we only gonna go for the matte uh eyeshadows or we'll also do shimmery eyeshadows okay shimmy eyeshadow okay it's overrated and i feel like it reminds me of 1960 but you do shimmery eyeshadows okay where do you see shimmering i don't need to glitter oh it's literally okay because i mean i want them to see okay so are we gonna do that look are you gonna have glitters on my face or not or not maybe a little a little a little yeah guys i love shimmery old like glittery eyeshadows in 1969 at that time guys i love shimmery eyeshadow if you want them to see just the glitters yeah but glitters is for like a night look [Music] you basically going to choose your favorite color i'm not going to choose i feel like i do that to all my clients like you choose your favorite color when it comes to glitters jesus iron's makeup bag is literally wowzer what's the name of this okay wait i literally have two oh it's glittery shades beauty wow you guys how cute is this yeah how long did it take you to connect which is your preferred palette is it this one or that one because i can tell they both literally i appreciate this one which one this one this one this one then i'm definitely using this oh but i think my face i think i'm i want to take i like this one no we cannot actually mix the glitters you do yeah oh perfect then i want a mixture of this and this what do you think yes so i'm i picked a combination of bronze and gold um not shimmer gold and uh bronze glitters and is it gonna go ahead and hand with the orange and the yellow or whatever orange and the yellow goes involved with a neat thing that's the thing guys orange goes in everything trust me even the green can you imagine queen and orange yeah and does it already have glue can i touch it it already has glue you don't need like a glitter to do it already has glue this is the tree the final touch for the eyes which is like the liquid eyeliner is it the matte liquid eyeliner or oh perfect guys whenever you buy eyeliner i suggest that you always go for the matte eyeliner because you know how or something yeah it looks shiny so the way just you look for the matte eyeliner then it looks way better and zandy nose eyeliner is which is my favorite when it comes to makeup [Music] but have you seen the egyptians guys oh my word yeah [Music] i'm sure someone out there [Music] please look down because [Applause] where's my eyes or looked on look down okay so that's a trick now when i literally go down with the mascara you look up slightly up okay [Music] eyelashes before the lashes not too long not too short just okay like guys so ayande's makeup services she gives people free eyelashes for every makeup look she's really brilliant at picking like really nice eyelashes but guys i don't know i feel like at this point in my life i don't know if she feels or whatever but like i really don't like those really like kind of heavy looking eyelashes anymore so she bought me more natural looking eyelashes which i'm very happy about i'm actually measuring her eyes you know some people have white eyes some people have small eyes so of course guys isn't it because the next thing is so i also cut my lashes so you guys just like put on a mascara to actually make your fake lashes and your natural lashes like link together okay guys i am done with the eyes the eye shadow and also what's next the foundation okay so guys i am using maybelline fit me it's 324. i'm literally using two foundation colors three three five and three twenty four i'm mixing them i just can't tell you about your skin color and then you know how much to pour the dark or light wine so you're basically creating a cut yeah yeah it's like really painting like pink chili yeah this is like legit collab exact color i'm gonna ask you because you're a guy what do you think about girls who put on makeup your honest opinion okay zandy knows before zandy before wendy yeah actually she knows that i prefer i don't mind makeup okay but she know that i prefer that natural look or whatever you know first time i met her she the first time you met me oh second time actually the first time we went out let me say that you know she was all beat to death you know but i prefer the natural look you know it's just a matter of preference i don't i don't i don't mind makeup or anything like that you know what i mean you don't mind makeup no i don't i don't okay i'm more about embracing what works for you good because if you are a makeup person go for it if go for it but as long as like not too much yeah am i too much in right now you're decent i've seen you do way more than that really yeah yeah okay actually yeah this is like my natural this is [Music] [Music] and honestly speaking i did prefer makeup probably oscar that i'm wearing makeup but i like it you must be able to tell that i'm going to say and that was how i personally wanted it to be because i was just like what do you saw me apply makeup it would be on skincare makeup on or not like the the that chick the lady knows how to make up nina that type of makeup i applied [Laughter] forehead is a bit darker than learning yeah what are you not to do right what do you do you apply no it means i like a contour or contour right okay okay this is probably like what is i am doing to my buddy i know those guys right down here look out for me the beauty blender literally makes it like tone down a bit and it also makes the fine lines from the brush yeah it doesn't disappear so it's a really nice trick does she still look like a no no she's dead yeah that's how awful [Music] but another thing that i always tell people usually like for instance i know i have my face is a little maybe like a shade lighter than the rest of my body and that that is normal like people shouldn't be in this bed because obviously you use more facial products you exfoliate your face more than you do your body so what do you think do you think um it's very important that you wear foundation always on your neck and your face so that it matches your neck and face or you don't have to do that because it's a waste of money you have to too okay you have to no i didn't think you have to really you know you have to because i feel like it just goes in well it's okay if the rest of the body but as long as the face and the neck are just like the same color right okay um remember the girl that i used to do like her the eyebrows the eyebrows and stuff so this is the very same take that i'm gonna use oh for my dark under eyes okay look up what type of foundations do you prefer do you prefer cream foundations um stick foundations or liquid foundations and within those three foundations do you prefer matte oily or is it it's matte oily and white metal i prefer liquid foundation i feel like it it goes according to your skin i mean if you literally have acne suffering like with acne pimples and stuff i feel like it's it's better for you to go with the creamy the creamy part because it's literally it's full coverage and then for the liquid if you have like a smooth skin and all that aquifer like the liquid as you can see yeah so for me i i literally have a smooth skin but i literally have like few pimples but then i just prefer liquid because it's easy it's easy but then if you suffering with acne and stuff then i prefer it for you to use like a creamy foundation well and then with the free oily oil free all free or matte if you're sweating yeah if you if you have oily skin i prefer you to use like masks and then if you literally have like dry skin then use the oil yeah oh that's yeah that's true [Music] okay so we're gonna start with the contour do you normally contour your face or what never only my nose she's gonna use the cocoa remember the cocoa i use on the eyelids the same color i'm gonna contour your face with it's not complicated guys you don't have to dry tons of makeup and product you can still use the same thing over and over again all right please also mention how contour is very important according to face touch i would contour my face like so here and then i'll turn and then it would go like so and i'd be like i look so bad i it's not for my face structure oh yeah guys so for instance i i have a round face yeah i hate it i have a face no i know i don't like no round no so if you want to make your face look more slimmer you're going to have to do like a bit down if you go down transition like lower lower face lower your lower face and then if you literally have like the face structure well add a little app so that it brings in the cheeks i didn't know that i would literally go like so and i'm like why the hell do i look like so and guys even the brushes the brushes are important can you see this brush it literally has an angle your contour brush has to have an angle there's a difference where is this brush so as you can see there's a huge difference even though they look like the one like has an angle and then the one is not it's just a contour but yeah this is the contour brush the last part it's going to be the nose i know how you do those you just do it off from here but i'm going to start from like the we'll see i'm not done with the noise yet but then we're gonna literally bake her face a bit just a bit just a bit for zandy what i'm using it's actually a transition powder from like yardley it's for every skin tone [Music] so if you have to go through like a whole little shower how long does that take you i'm actually fast here how long does it take you it has to be like 30 minutes like i have to be quick quick quick quick quick and then makoti is lost yeah the bride is always the last one so guys this is the highlighter the glow kit that i have actually has different shades for her i'm gonna actually use the last one yeah before i actually like put the glow in stuff right i had to use the the fiddly spray the it actually enhances the setting spray the setting spray is [Music] so do you feel like a makeup is very essential in your life yeah to me it's very essential to my life i can't live without it okay i can but then it's part of my life it's part of me yeah it's part of my identity like you can't have bianda without no makeup like just know if you see i know with no makeups either uh i'm not i'm just not feeling well because i put on makeup even when i'm not going anywhere that's how it makes me feel happy some women have like low self-esteem issues and stuff so i know i can't change anything about that because confidence comes from within but then makeup does something because that part when a woman sees herself looking at herself in the mirror and she like she's like transformed that's like the beautiful part of in the makeup artist because you can see she's happy from within and that makes me happy that's like that's the so what do you feel about people that always diss you know girls about like tiny makeup well i feel like if he does girls who have makeup if you're a girl he's saying that because you don't know how to put makeup on so you're concerning yourself you're making yourself feel better for no reason and if you're a guy you're saying that because you can't have bad chocolate shake so girl girl you can literally rock your green lashes purple any color do you feel like literally having makeup on well it's for you do it for yourself not for anyone else the same way if you prefer not having me and you just love yourself in your natural form that's also amazing i mean i think i see you exactly like i feel like people should stop coming for people for doing what they want to do like if i'm comfortable with wearing my afro my base is there's absolutely nothing wrong with that if i feel like wearing my wigs that come up to my knees there's absolutely nothing wrong with that if i want to wear my green lashes and a face full of makeup there's nothing wrong with that as long as it doesn't affect you in any way exactly coming for people for doing what they want to do is insane to me i was actually like walking mm-hmm like with my friend and this guy was just like swinging me up soon you know and i can tell i'm just like actually i felt sorry for him because he doesn't know me and why would he say that he's actually sad so he's trying to make me miserable because he's also miserable so i was just like okay and now i know the type of person you are so it's okay you're trying to bring me down i can tell that you're already down already you're a down person so you're trying to bring me down who is because you're not feeling yeah you're trying to bring me down and it's not going to happen not on me guys speaking of which i am this british accent literally is the most insane thing ever hello my name is johnny wow okay i killed it i actually killed it okay okay well hi guys my name is from london i'm not from here or i'm with my sister zandi so shout out to perfect shout out to birmingham shout out to every one from britain yo my homies glasses and lads or you down there i love you okay you're my mates for real so this is like the your actual powder okay look up for me [Music] this is the two colors that let me show you apart your blush that color the second one and then the orange one yeah so guys it comes back to you don't have to buy the blush it's all about mixing and using the very same thing creative fingers so one two how did you go like that and then [Music] what is that it's actually like a contour a contour lipstick okay yeah it's more contour but it's extremely dark for you my lips for lips you can use it for anything it's all about creativity what's the name of the thingy revlon new color stray life proof matte foundation stick it's for contour it's very dark by the way you guys this is like a flex love liquid highlighter what did you use because your one looks more cold it looks like your hair let's look at my hair i guess it's the hair that makes it false out but then yeah i mix it i actually this one actually makes it pop out there's something about it yeah it's not like the powder one so you actually have to take a little you have to be careful when it comes to this one extremely careful it doesn't need too much on the brush [Music] spot [Music] not just there i want oh you okay but isn't it even tinier than others like you okay guys i am done with danny's face uh oh wow okay so be the judge please okay i haven't seen my final look where's the mirror are you nervous isn't it there mm-hmm it's a nice that's gorgeous are you sure what oh my leg oh my gosh i look so gorgeous oh my

counseling and at my master's level i specialized in child psychology um practically there is no child even those with special needs that i cannot handle that is basically why you should hire me for the job sir yeah though i am overwhelmed by the plateau of a words included in your cv i still can't phantom why i mean a master's degree holder as yourself would want to teach in a primary school sadly sir in our country we reward the largeness of an office rather than the depth of service rendered unfortunately yes well folks like me i my motivation is not in the number of zeros i go home with every month but the impact i make on lives that's impressive so tell me what are your expectations salary a big money [Music] [Music] hi [Music] pass off [Music] so [Music] how was it what

percent of my salary of course not i mean i'm not god thank you talk to me what is wrong with you how much is the pay okay did you have to 50k um 75. what are you kidding me really is it poor it's fine you said primary for right yes from before i'll take you there okay so mr johnson i asked the last time that um you should come with a mother before she could be registered so why is her mother not here i told you she traveled yeah you said so i thought she should have been back by now um she's not coming back anytime soon so for how long so long um uh mr sun what is so tedious and registering in my old girl that i the father cannot do you say mr johnson the fact is that before we register any child we love to see both parents in the wake of divorce well that's an exception then what i was saying i hear they first what rubbish what nonsense what kind of function what is it will you click quiet and sit down nonsense everybody bring out your book how is that possible what's going on why are you all looking at me are you mad rubbish oh goodness i can't take this how can he over to pay her 75 000 naira the same amount i earn no no i'm not take this mr sam i insist my daughter is not getting into a lower class she has to start from class five well i'm sorry mr johnson but we cannot admit that you need to bezak five you have not given me any substantial reason well mr johnson [Applause] what other substantial reasons that you wanted to give when your daughter failed more fully on a test she took last week what other substantial reason of proof that you want me to prove to you so you see mr johnson your persistence and promoting your daughter into berserk five um knowing through fully well that her foundation is so weak trust me what is going to affect her her future excuse me she's my daughter i should have her best interests at heart i know mr johnson you should have a best interest at heart but trust me your constant persistence alone um tells me a different story about you i beg your pardon you see let me reach a read this whole thing mr johnson uh you see once you bring your tota to our school it simply means that you are selling her uh basic academic rights to us to take uh control over it and but i still have mr johnson going through her records her records here there's truly nothing good so it shows how dumb you know that is so i am going to squeeze out the place to put her in standard tree and the only reason why i am going to do that miss johnson is because of your constant um assistance and support to me but if you don't accept that i think it would better for you to better still take her to some other school and not my own school i've done the transfer ah i i just i just saw the money oh yes sir what is this for you said you could take on a private lesson so she can cope in class 5. exactly but this is way too much from what we bargained maybe your responsibilities would include staying with her in school until i come to pick her she can be a handful does he also include bringing her back home because this is too much no staying with her here in school until i come to pick her if you want some clothes you could leave [Music] thank [Applause] what is wrong with you why would you offer to pay her 75 000 naira why do you have a problem with that i have a big problem with that you cannot love you just employed her she shouldn't earn as much as i do and she shouldn't end more than you rita listen to me somewhere she is doing for those children do i look like i care i mean i don't care rita we shouldn't be talking about this outside here to my office please no okay class she is now one of us her name is sandra johnson from today henceforth she is now a member of this class am i well

dr johnson because this is not the first time you're talking about him uh he's just one cute doctor in my opinion you love him well i like him but he would not like me back he would not like anybody

"3cME3vK1aaQ": "so no matter what you do no matter if it's woodworking or anything else one of the best way to be efficient and get things done fast is by having tips and tricks and that's exactly what I'm going to show you some of these tips and tricks are things that you've probably seen but to be frank there's probably one that you haven't before we dive into this video I have a new project that I'm working on and I really need your input I'm thinking about creating a step-by-step online course about woodworking I want to make it something really useful to you so I'd love to hear from you there's a link to a short survey down in the video description if you're interested in learning how to make some of the projects on my channel please take a few minutes to fill out the brief survey and I look forward to seeing what you guys are interested in and with that said let's get to the tips but this tip I'm gonna show you how to make a really quick and simple Center marking gauge all you need is a piece of scrap wood to get started establish the line going down the center of that then mark off three points in the center and the two sides for the pins now if you want to make this even more simple and more approachable you could use two round head screws and put those in place of the pins that I have here and since this is supposed to be beginner friendly we're gonna assume that we don't have a drill press and we can't drill a hole straight so take a piece of scrap wood draw a straight line on it then use that piece of wood as a guide rest a bit up against it and keep it straight with the line so I know I didn't drill the two half-inch holes for the pin straight so what we're going to do here is use wood glue to hold them in place and finally just check to make sure it's squared on most marking gauge you're going to see a pencil for this one I'm going to use a screw and the main reason for that is durability and if you've never used one of these you're gonna love it just simply place it down on your subject and twist it to both pins touch all you want to do is drag it and create that line going right down the center now one of the upside of this being a screw is you can adjust the depth of your scribe so the more it protrudes the deeper to cut and could also mean a little harder to drag but you will get a deeper cut and you can always back it out so that you bear this quarter surface as shown this can mark multiple sides of materials as long as you have a parallel line going down on both sides you get that straight line going right down the center and one of the first things you're gonna pick up is some spring clamps because they're cheap and then you're gonna take them home and realize you don't use them as much at least I don't so I'm gonna show you how to get an extra use out of these without just leaving them in the corner collecting sawdust so these banded clamps shine really well when you need to attach a piece of trim where they work is you apply your glue I mean you just put that down and the rubber here actually does a really great job of holding this piece down so it doesn't move and it's really hard to use a bar clamp because this tends to want to ship that been said I'm gonna basically try to duplicate what this clamp is doing with these are you going to need is some spring clamps and two rubber bands so what you want to do here is now grab the two loops and you can bring it over the top like that and leave it there and do the same thing on the opposite side and this is just a really quick temporary fix I want to take that and repeat the process again you can see there's a little bit of tension in here good enough to hold down this piece now what's nice about these clamps is that you can force them down a lot because you have a deeper jaw in here so that's the plus side of these collapse they're really cool really innovative and those are called bendy clamps and all I'm trying to do is utilize something I already have and even haven't abandoned clamps there have been a time or two where I needed more and not just didn't have them and this could have been an easy substitution and obviously the rubber bands not going to last forever but if you're in a pinch this is something that could probably save you and get you out of that pinch so you don't have to go crazy and try to figure out how to attach the front so next up we're gonna take on some right angle clamp jigs and I think these are going to be the most used out of all of these tips now since this is gonna set most of our right angle pieces we want to make sure that this piece of wood is as straight as possible I would also suggest going with plywood or MDF I set the miter gauge to make a 45-degree cut then I made the first pass flip the board around and then made another pass so now I have two 45 degree pieces from the ends I'm not always successful at this but I always try to go for the simplest approach for instance I use the first cut to set up a stop block at the miter saw to cut down interference on the corner and also prevent the edges from being chipped off we're going to remove all of those the right angle corner can be a bit tricky but if you set up a stop you can then hold that piece down with a push block or something to prevent the wood from flying up as you're cutting up to this point nothing has been measured I'm just taking off some material and then duplicating the same thing to the other pieces for this to be a true right angle jig I need to cut a few holes in it and I need to use a template this way I can keep the hole consistent I'm marking a location to drill out three holes because I feel like this gives me a little more flexibility I used an inch and three-eighths forcing a bit but anything in that neighborhood should work if you just starting out or you've been going at it and just don't have any of these I would totally recommend you make at least eight to twelve of these just because they're so handy if these do not hold true to a framing square or something like this I would totally say just remake them it's not worth the headache if they're off even by a little bit so I'm gonna take one of these and now let's cut it down to the workbench pass the class through and again this is what a third hole in the middle shine because it allows you to sneak under that wood and hold your piece so the beauty of these is it doesn't matter if you're trying to do a corner or you trying to do an intersection and these holes are there to be used so just use any one of them that you need to clamp and if you remember these clamps that I say I don't use much they work great for this as well the bar clamp can work on this as well but it's a little more cumbersome and all you need from this is to stay in place and allow you to have your free hands so you can then join the two boards so you may see this clip in an upcoming video but what I wanted to do here was show how you can utilize a piece of scrap wood or sacrificial fence and use that if you need to make repeatable cuts that are different lengths now I don't think it'd get much easier than this I transfer the measurements once I put them onto the temporary fence on the miter saw of course if you have a miter station then this is pretty much irrelevant but if you don't then this is a really quick and simple way to get you up and running to making quick and repeatable cuts this is a really simple attachment all I'm using is a 2 by 2 attach to the miter saw table which is secured in place using the existing holes and long enough screws through the fence if you use wood glue before then here's a common problem you may recognize when gluing multiple pieces of lumber together the minute you put a clamp on things start to shift so let's look at a couple problems and then we can introduce a solution first I'm gonna use 2x4 that has a little bit of a warp to it then we can look at plywood and see how these perform and even though I'm using 2x4 and they do have a little bit of a cup to it the slipping and shifting will still be an issue I try to with two pieces of wood and I still saw chef and I'm gonna try with three pieces and see how much more of a difference it is so you can see along the top here how they want to shift and go out of alignment and one common approach in woodworking is to sprinkle a little bit of salt on the glued parts and then that should prevent from shifting by using a salt that completely eliminated a shift I don't want to drag this out too much but I guess it's best to show this on a smooth surface to see how it reacts with plywood after gluing these up let's look at it from a different angle with wood glue in between that's gonna allow it to be extremely slippery until it's set up the real problem here is when you have perfectly cut pieces that you want to glue together but with only a clamp you'll have shifted pieces and you would then have to sand later but let's look at how this reacts when you add a little bit of salt on these two pieces so now that I have the pieces aligned together with a little salt in it I'm trying to shift it the best I can and it's not budging so this goes to show that this actually works if this is news to you the way this work is once you apply a clamping pressure to it the grain of the salt then bite into both pieces of wood which then prevent the wood from shifting I have used those in the past and they're great they allow you to join things together without seeing fasteners there are a number of ways to use dowels you can use a jig like this and there are many different jigs on the market or you can just drill a hole use a dowel Center and use that to mark and although they are great option for joining things together they're still a pain in the butt to work with and of course I like to think about you guys that are just getting started and just don't have all the tools so what happened if you don't have a dowel jig or you just misplaced it or you know exactly where it is but you're terrified of it because it lets you down the last time so I don't know if this has been done before but I'm gonna share this silly little idea to take a small nail place that in between the two areas that you're trying to join now don't be afraid you can add one nail two nails or three nails in here but Larry it takes just tape them down this way nothing move when you apply pressure and just like that Demark is now transferred to both parts and you know exactly where to drill now all you have to do is just flood the area with wood glue clamp the pieces down and you should have a solid joint there is so many tips to the trade and I wish I can keep going but unfortunately we got to bring this one to an end alright guys so if this is your first time around I don't mind sharing these tips and tricks with you and I hope you enjoy these if you guys are interested in more things

have been bamboozled LED astray confused and shrinked all these years I haven't worn acrylics on my hair for years I stay the hell out of nail salon right now more than ever because I got no choice I've been doing press-on nails and wearing press-on nails since about 2016 today's video is not only going to be about how I apply my press-on nails it's also gonna be about how I care for my nails in the process if you just want to get to the nail skip to this part where I show how I apply the press-on nails for everyone else who's looking for a nice at-home treatment on how to pamper yourself and maintain yourself I would have very honest I've been avoiding doing this video for a very long time for a long time videos like these kind of flops but I think right now more than ever people are just uber conscious of nail salon culture or just in the future in general if you want to be able to take care of your hands and do your own nails when you can't get to the salon or you have an emergency situation today I'm gonna show you just how to do that with press-ons I'm gonna show you guys exactly what you need to remove these we're gonna be taking these off and putting on a new parent so here's what you're gonna need you're gonna need a clipper and orange wood stick a nail file only for shaping your nails I usually don't so this is just some glue the nail glue doesn't really matter I think that'll probably vary depending on I think you can use any loop but the one I'm using is a nail buffer some nail hardener just when I usually get from Target some Bowl you'll also need a hand scrub and a nail brush this is really I feel so bad for you are you okay don't judge I'm gagging girl some 100% acetone apple cider vinegar extra virgin olive oil or just regular olive oil I'll take it matters and of course your principle you guys have asked me a ton of questions about press-on nails and a lot of them have a lot of overlap a lot of these are questions that I've answered quite a few times and I want to address them all here so that you always have a reference to come back to first thing sex so because we're taking off the old pair of nails we're gonna start soaking fingers and 100% acetone I use 100% because obviously it is a higher potency regular nail polish remover so from what the real deal get 100% order this on Walgreens whatever okay so you know it's China mood and press-ons child when you see the glue you see how that little crusty crust yeah that's what happens when it starts to lift when it starts to lift just like that look guys there you go instead of that space you know when you wear acrylics and you get that little empty space there with press-on you don't get that it just starts to lift and then you keep putting in glue putting in glue and then eventually that glue builds up so it's basically time to remove these but instead of just going in and soaking them I'm actually gonna click them off first not completely my nails are pretty long so think of it this way when you take out your braids you're not just going with the scissors and snip right you gotta like check where your actual hair ends because you don't want to come over here same thing with your nails I'm gonna cut right where my nails stop click off the ends of these press ones now my natural nails are actually pretty long now this is the one if my nails have ever been ever since I started we're gonna press on with my nails just started getting real long and like my nails are not dirty by the way it's just with the white underlay of the press-on like nobody's nails are that pristine white so it just looks like a bigger difference than what it actually is whatever you do never ever pull force your nails off never do that it's very painful and it's not healthy so I'm gonna put a generous amount about acetone and you definitely will be soaking these for a minute I would say sometimes like 20 to 30 minutes depending on how much you really glue them on but when you put your hands in that Bowl what you also want to do is you can kind of like press down on your fingers to get them to lift a little bit more in the back so you can like really get the acetone in there because the more your nails start to lift and come off the better it is so then the acetone can really get underneath the surface and separate the press-ons from your natural nails so take advantage of that lift press down on the nail gently please be gentle with the hands girl and yeah I just let the assets home work its way in there and just be really really patient this process take a minute but remember anybody got time to be waiting at the nail salon girl for two hours because you didn't make an appointment so this is the next best thing take it or leave it okay so I've already been soaking my nails for about 10 minutes and two of them are already popped off these were ready to yeah what you can do once you start to feel them left you can just gently give it a little budge if it's not coming up then leave it alone or you can take you know that little sharp part from your nail file you can also kind of get up in there just to see if it comes off it doesn't naturally come off then it's not ready to come off I soaked it longer this is just to give it a little bit of courage just to state the obvious soaking your press-on nails after you've also clipped them will tear them up these will not be reusable so it's been about twenty minutes now and I feel like my thumbnail is starting to this process gets messy deal with it now the hard and most tedious part is over you're gonna take a bowl of warm water no your preference and your apple cider vinegar you want to basically make this equal parts and we're gonna soak our hands and this apple cider vinegar / water mix for about 15 minutes now remember this is nail care so this is gonna be a couple steps and it's gonna be a little bit of a process you just want to get to the nails you can do that too but this is just what I like to do every two weeks just to maintain you know the cuticles now keep the cuticles cute I'm gonna soak my hands in this apple cider vinegar / water mix for 15 minutes and come right back after we do our apple cider vinegar rinse I'm gonna take my nail brush and this is just some soapy with hot water make your a real comfortable like this should feel like a treatment I'm just gonna scrub the nails over and under remove any debris and don't forget to get under the nails I rinse my hands clean and now I'm going to soak them in some extra virgin olive oil for another 15 minutes my hands feel nice and soft from that olive oil but now we're gonna do a little hand scrub so I'm just gonna take a little bit this foot back for your feet but it shouldn't matter right okay nice really work that scrub into the digits girl all that work you've been putting in yeah you deserve it go do a little dip and scrub time it actually feels really good after the olive oil soaked because you can just get rid of all the build-up don't forget to enjoy this process I take your time it seems tedious but it actually pays off ok I do this for a couple minutes this feels really good I'm gonna go rinse I rinse my hands as you can see some of my fingernails still have a little bit of like debris on them from the press-on nails and like the glue and stuff I'm just gonna buff a little bit of that off I also make sure you always both in one direction don't go like back and we're back just one direction take your time and just buff enough to like make sure that the surface is nice and flat and smooth don't go overboard ok at this point you probably gonna be pretty actually I'm gonna just be very honest now you want to push back your cuticles using a little orange wood stick or if you have a cuticle pusher you can use that too this is just easier and cheaper and this is what I have at the moment let's talk about some facts though some frequently asked questions okay so do press-on nails pop off sometimes this is the number one question that I get asked every time somebody looks at my nails they're like oh my god I love your nails and then I'm like oh my god they're pressed ons and then they're like oh my god do they pop off and I'm like yes and no the team press-on nails is like obviously you're not gonna get the same old and bond of acrylics that's the point that's the beauty the reason why I stopped getting acrylics on my nails is because it was a lot you know like they're quite damaging to the natural nail my nails would always like never get past a certain length I could never really get a long healthy nail growth so I stopped going so with press-ons like it's kind of a give and take right like you don't get the longer ability what an acrylic would do and that's why your nails or raw tend to stay a little bit longer and healthier that's kind of like the pro and con but the thing is like it's nothing to just keep glue in your purse and if I see a nail that starts to live like it's not just gonna literally like walk off of your fingernail guys like people are so dramatic if they're applied correctly and if you take your time and if you did it thoroughly they're not just gonna pop up out of nowhere unprovoked promise you now if they do start to lift throughout the day so you got a business meeting you see something starts to live just keep gluing your purse touch it up and go on about your day cuticles look good I'm gonna apply about two to three coats of my nail hardener and I'm gonna answer some more questions now the reason why I personally I've never seen anybody do this with press-on nails but I personally like to apply nail hardener underneath because to me it's kind of like a little protective barrier so I do about three coats of this instead of doing like sticky tabs which is what I used to do under my press-on nails to me the nail hardener not only protects my natural nail just kind of adds like a little barrier from the glue but it also is like something else for the glue to kind of adhere to you got to make sure that this is dried down completely or as complete as possible before you apply your press-on nail I'm kind of sloppy when it comes I just my little stick and all the little residue that's on my hands this stuff will easily come off like by the time I do my skincare routine all of this will come off it's just from the acetone you know removing the nail polish remover and stuff like that sometimes it just kind of floats and gets stuck on your hands it comes off very easily now I do want to talk about pricing and stuff like that a lot of people assume that personal nails are a cheaper alternative to go into the salon I remember one time so much straight-up asked me you make a lot of money why did you wear press-on nails which is like okay no correlation but okay my sounds are what you make it it's not necessarily a cheaper alternative to going to the nail salon and you're probably thinking well what do you mean why might I ask well when you've got Swarovski crystals okay pearls honey matte finish and cold like yada this does look cheap back keep in mind that the nails that you see in the design that you see here are all done by a normal nail tech it's no different than when you go to a salon someone did these styles someone put time and design them these little crystals and studs and props that they use they cost money the fancier design is the more acrylic that's used cuz these press-on some of them do have acrylic on them they're not bonded like acrylic is but they are like made with acrylic if that makes sense I like my nails to be really thick the same way an acrylic nail would be I pay a little bit extra for that I think it's like five bucks percent or something like that I could be wrong don't quote me yeah so I can add extra gel overlay to make them extra hard and extra sturdy I like my nails to be kind of thick and kind of firm now the flimsier and thinner nail is the cheaper it's going to be so I just wanted to talk about price because I think there's some misconceptions about you know like this being a cheaper alternative and it absolutely can be but the fancier you get I mean come on come on come on this is the whole frickin vibe that vibe is gonna run you probably like I want to say I probably paid like 70 80 for these now mind you this is also a set of 20 and when you buy press-on nails you can get different options if you just want enough you can buy a set of ten or you can buy a set of twenty in case you want to play around with different sizes if you've never worn press-ons before and you just want to size them properly this is like a variety pack think of the twenty is like the variety pack if you aren't sure what fingernail sizes are appropriate for what finger more often than not if you see me wearing press-on nails they probably either come from this company here which is called the nail list and this is a brand from Etsy and they also have their own independent website I am in no way affiliated with these websites these are from dippy cow nails also from Etsy sometimes on their websites just to make it easier because I literally rave about these companies so much and they're like here's the nails that jackie anta uses and they put them in one tab it's not a collab or anything like that and i don't mind that but i just want to let you guys know these are not companies that I'm affiliated with or companies that I work with in any way shape or form I just organically found them on my own on Etsy and support them on my own and I buy 80 percent of the nails that I use I think because they got hip and they started seeing me tag them and they just started voluntarily sending me these I've never asked I've never you know like given them an ultimatum or anything like that they just send them because they you know like that I shot them all and please but I just want to show you guys the variety and what press-on nails can look like I mean we have like a burger like well I'm definitely not wearing mr. warranty this is the whole thing I'm saving this for my birthday red I wouldn't normally wear this is not something that I ordered they actually sent me these thank you to be count nails this cone is my favorite this mint shade but yeah I just want to show you guys some variety these all come from Etsy because I've been doing this for so long like I already know which finger goes where after someone asks me do these nails top off the next thing guarantee they're gonna ask me is how do I make them last long okay so obviously long and subjective so long for some people might be a week long for someone else might be two weeks I usually get about two weeks where if I'm not antsy or if I'm not doing the shoot if I don't have a special occasion coming up on average I would say two weeks by that point I get bored and I'm like okay it's office at the new I've definitely worn them as long as a month I kept touching them up with glue and I maintain them really well I do all of the same normal things with press-on nails that I do with acrylic I just slightly adjust a little bit because they are press-on nails so you don't you definitely don't want to be trying it and you want to be very careful I would say overall the most important thing I want you guys to take away from this video on how to get them to last long is buffing you have to make sure you have a smooth nail to start with the buffing part really make sure you get rid of any extra oil debris all that gunk and stuff off of your nail before just sticking on a personal nail it's not gonna stick and sometimes that little dried dust actually mix the nail stick even more now I know that I'm putting on my heart think oh this is just my personal preference if you don't feel like doing nail hardener buffing alone really will like I'm telling you don't underestimate buffing because that little dust that comes on in your nails when you buff the glue loves that stuff and it adheres to it really well my hands are a pretty decent shape I've never had nails this long in my entire life I know they aren't the best shape but remember I'm not a nail tech any I'm a licensed Cosmo girl but I'm not working at these nail salon suite yeah it can be kind of hard to shape your left hand and I broke the snail like literally two days ago Father forgive me no dyes are we prep the nails let's go ahead and do the install I'm gonna be installing this hombre hot pink this set is from dippy cow nails on Etsy I pacifically requested a dark nude so shout out to her for giving me its art nude and honoring my wishes even with a little like french tip whatever I this is a dark nude so you know there's like different custom options and on Etsy they asked you like what kind of new you use so I'm gonna be wearing this paint size today because I told you guys I'm already like I've already pretty much know which sizes I'm gonna use I'm just gonna jump right in I usually use the second pinky size because I like the length of this one these go from the smallest fingernail to the biggest one the thumbnails if you have a wide nail bed or if you think you have a really small nail bed I would suggest requesting like custom and you'd have to literally measure each nail bed and the person who's making your nails can customize the nails exactly to your nail measurement I think it's measured in like millimeters or something like that but I feel like I have pretty standard sized nail beds so I always either get a size small or I'll buy the 20-pack and that way I can choose I can choose oh my god I have another brilliant tip okay sometimes when you order nails and you get the extra gel acrylic grow and the extra gel over the girls sometimes they can be so thick that the nail almost becomes like tight when you put it on and you lose every one press-on nails you know exactly what I'm talking about basically like what starts to happen is the more layers that you put on the more curved the nail becomes like the shape of it becomes curved so then when you stick it on here now it's like digging into your own nail it's really hard to explain you just have to wear press-on nail so understand what I mean a super easy way to work around that is take your nail on a flat surface like this table and just press down you want to flatten this out as much as possible as much as that natural curve and the press-on nail looks really natural and it looks really good it can sometimes be extremely painful I'm not exaggerating like it's actually very uncomfortable and very painful especially once you rinse your hands in cold water don't ask me why that's just it's just really uncomfortable but yeah you just want to take it up again it's a flat service even sometimes I'll just use it's not gonna break because this is pretty thick but I'll use the nail hardener bottle and I'll just flatten it out like I'm literally pushing down all the way down on the nail see how that already looks a little bit flatter trust me I always do my pinkies first please take my advice do your thumbs laughs you want to keep your thumb free and clear cuz you're gonna be doing most of the pressing with your thumb so we've already pushed back our cuticle real quick I'm just gonna make sure this is the size that I want I just like a quick little size check and then before I glue the nail on I just like to go right under my cuticle just kind of push it back again just to make sure the nail will fit nice and snug under there and then I'll put glue on my natural nail I start with a lot of drop and then with that drop I'll spread it all over the nail bed from cuticle to tip you want glue all over the nail and please do not put so much glue that it's dripping off the sides you don't want it to be soppy you don't want it to be literally dripping all the way into your fingers just enough and then you're also gonna apply glue on the press-on same thing a drop and then if you know you have long nails you want to completely saturate that press on until it saturates right where your nails will sit and slide her right under the cuticle and then press down you can hold it for about six seconds you don't gotta hold it too long I remembered like the first couple times I did it I was holding my nails down way too long and girl it was just so painful you see a little bit of glue bubbling up on the sides just quickly wipe it off and when your finger so there's no glue residue putting on the nail is actually the easiest part of this entire tutorial I've done this in the car I've done this on the plane I've done this while boarding okay you know when they're like zone one we're ready to go I've literally done this while waiting to board a flight it is that easy and that quick but also I've been doing this for a long time so okay now I'm gonna do the next nail and again I'm gonna start with about a drop of glue and spread that glue all over from cuticle to tip make sure the nail is fully saturated but not drippy and then we're gonna do the same thing on the back of the nail one drop make sure you get the corners make sure you get like right where the cuticle will sit not to get this to look really natural you want it to look like it's literally right under your cuticle so I kind of gently slide underneath there and push down oh and also before they drive just do a quick look and make sure it's not crooked or leaning or don't a gang size meant like that just make sure it's as straight as you want it and it's going in the direction that you feel comfortable with I'm not gonna lie I've been very tempted to just rock my natural nails but I feel like I just don't have the gumption to rock my natural nails but I just I feel like this would be short-lived I have to protect them next we're gonna do our ring finger so sometimes finding a style that won't show my natural nail underneath it's a bit of a struggle and I always say go a little bit smaller because there's nothing worse than like press-on nail that's wider than your nail bed I feel like that is what is the dead giveaway when the press-on now it's 2y so when in doubt go a little bit narrower and if you have to file your natural nail underneath around the sides you can if you want but I just feel like it looks a little bit more normal and believable when you don't go too wide with the press-on so now I'm just fitting this under my cuticle and then I'm gonna go right in with that glue again hopefully you guys can see what I'm doing I tried my absolute best to make this camera setup perfect for you guys you know obviously I don't have everything ideal for filming this type of content but hopefully it's helpful okay so let's go ahead and throw on that ring finger nail we're gonna slide it right under the cuticle and then press down do a quick check to make sure she's even looks good and now I'm pressing sometimes you will see glue start to like bubble up on top which is totally fine you can either wipe it off with your finger real quick before it dries or use your orange wood stick also it's really important not to get your hands wet for like a couple hours after you do this because if the glue is still wet once water hits it the glue turns white and it just doesn't look cute it is a lifelong like it probably will wash off like by the end of the night but just an FYI if you see the right residue ring of death yet because you wet your hands too soon I think I dressed this earlier but I do get asked like do I do the same things like around the house like normal the most part honestly yeah I mean it's definitely case-by-case like I'm not gonna use my finger to open something or live something like I normally would like if I was like what what's something that I could think of like if I was like picking a lock of my feet like I wouldn't do something like that I definitely would not do that but everything else is literally literally like normal press-ons all right now it's time to do my favorite finger the middle hey I'm just kidding okay so fertile okay so gentle thumb again just keep pushing it back so I went it back making sure them cuticles is cute like you literally want the nail to look like it's glowing come on - yo here - go come on e you Q - Kisha I mean come on this pink ombre this is fire it's dumb time I feel like the pinkies always lift first and sometimes the thumb I mean it really just it's case-by-case it's not always guaranteed but I feel like I could probably get a good two weeks out because I really like this set so I'll probably wear these for like a good two weeks okay so I just finished my nails you can finish off okay so I just finished my nails you can finish this off with a little bit of cuticle oil just to nourish the hands a little bit more yes there is some crusty residue but like I said that does come off that's pretty much my whole nail care routine and how I apply my press-on nails yeah okay guy so that's how I do my press-on nails keep you looking right inside honey it's pretty straightforward the nail care process is little tedious but you know what it's the tree offer not going to a salon I got to do something to pamper myself right I try to do the pamper routine at least every two weeks and my nails so hopefully you found this helpful I probably ain't gonna do nothing nail related for like another like five years like for real like I'm just going back to my makeup Lane I'm just gonna go back to what I normally do and that's a makeup but I hope that you guys enjoyed this video and found this helpful I hope this answers some your questions about press-on nails it's one of the most asked about things I get and this method works with any and all press-on nails I've done this on literal like seven dollar press-on nails cuz I've tried all ranges okay to $14 nails all the way up to $90 press-on nails so this is exactly what I do and have done for a couple years now - the nail care thing though the press-on nail application really hasn't changed I used to use sticky tabs I don't use those anymore but the nail care is something I really started doing like the past like a year or two and I really like it enjoy thank you for watching if you made it all the way to the end and if you did make it all the way to the end why aren't you watching another video I put it right here if you don't like nail stuff once you get your nails right what you gonna do about your brows exactly click here [Music]", "69UbOOuAvi0": "hello friends i am here in front of the easel there's nothing back there but there will be in a second we're going to start painting this painting and try to get it close to this one now i know that the um painting won't be exact i can't copy a painting but i can show you kind of what i did to get this this effect just a big mountain shooting out of the canvas right and that bright orange all over the mountain and in the water so we'll work on this one i'm actually going to show you before we start how to mix up this cad it's cat orange is what it is if you bought it in two but i'm using bob ross color so we're going to use cad yellow and bright red and mix it up and we're going to get to painting this and see how it turns out thanks guys for uh tuning in and let's get to the uh palette and show you how to mix up your colors i'll see you in a second all right so here's the colors we need for this painting but i want to talk about one thing real quick i use cat orange when i'm not teaching classes and painting using bob's name so it's just an easy color to have it's pretty color but it's very easy to mix a color that will work just like on the painting that we're doing using cad yellow and bright red and what i've found is that the best mix to get close to cad orange is about two parts of cad yellow versus about one part or so of bright red and we're just gonna scoop all those up like that on our knife right and put them down and turn them over and what we'll do here just so you can see that you don't have to buy every color under the sun i'm just lazy sometimes and you know i wouldn't use this in a class but i use it sometimes when i'm painting just for myself like the other night i did not intend to make a video of this one but you can see already looking really nice really nice orange never get in there just mix it up pretty good you want to mix this one thoroughly and again that's two parts cad yellow to about one part uh bright red and you'll get pretty dang close okay i'm going to put that out and then i'm also going to show you just so you know i'm going to kind of test it here flatten that out may have a little too much bright red in it that's fine i really like that color but yeah a little bit too much bright red but it's very similar i'm just going to mix those two together right there this one has this this pile has just a little bit too much bright red but i still like that color that's the one i'm going to use in the painting that we're doing that's what i sometimes use and that's cat orange but very similar right i don't you can see this is a little bit darker a little bit darker so actually i'll just put that in there and use it but that's how you mix you a nice bright vibrant orange and it's probably um they said two parts cad yellow whatever your parts are you know big squirts or whatever and then maybe a less than one part red just just under one part red that way you get a true cad yellow cat orange sorry um and it looks pretty similar to what's you can buy tube of course remember i'm using bob ross paints here for this painting so there's the color we're going to put on the canvas all right let's go do it our color mixed up let's go up here to the canvas and i'm going to take a two inch brush here get in my color and you don't need to see me doing that steps just adding the color always make sure you kind of bounce it into paint you want to evenly distribute it throughout and then let's start up here oh boy that is piece of the canvas came off that is very orange right all right some more however brighten up this it would be good to have some areas that are not quite as fiber and i'm going to put some down here but remember this painting has a humongous mountain in it so we don't need to go all the way down with that we can actually maybe we'll make one little change here trying to smack in some color in there maybe we'll look like a little clown floating around i had a couple of little clowns in the other one you can't really see them so that's probably enough for this guy nope i decided it wasn't we'll make that corner brother to be bright all right maybe a little bit more i love orange and blue together that's what we're working with here so there we go if we want to we could just clean our brush off down here it doesn't really matter we'll put more water in here when we get down here i'm bad to put my water in late so we'll just kind of stick with that pattern all right cut our sky that looks pretty good that will work all right i'm gonna grab some mountain mix now just because i'm lazy if there's anything about me that's close to bob it's about when bob would talk about being lazy that's what i have so i'm going to grab that i'm going to wipe my knife off and i'm going to flatten that paint out grab me something and go to town here look at this watch this we gotta figure where we want our mountain oh it lives up here somewhere all the way off the canvas somebody said i need to learn how to crop my photos when but uh now that's the way i wanted it to look i'll take a little bit here just to put this on we got it coming down here we got about that much sky right there not right there maybe there we go just start pulling that let's lay our shape in here i'm looking at the other paintings you can see me turning my head i'm like bob i've got another painting over here off the off the canvas it'll come down like that pull that in so we cut our peak off not very nice with it there i don't want to see any of that i'll get my hand all in that paint later i'm gonna pick this canvas up to move it let's go here [Music] and i've got a little jet right here somewhere and it kind of just attach it in there again i'm using mountain mix great color the [Music] and i just kind of want to throw some shapes in here not sketching i'm not really laying out the mountain i'm just going to think about a little different when you're working on this big a mountain remember this mountain's got to come down probably here this is an 18 to 24 inch canvas i'm working on right now so it's a little bit bigger than the one i did i think it's 16-20 on the original so i'm just gonna put some stuff in here and then work my way down all right we got that in there let's grab a clean two inch brush here now remember to always take your knife [Applause] as you can you want to get just as much as you can off because the less paint you have the more likely you're going to have success of getting it to stick right now we're going to the 2-inch brush here we're gonna pull this mountain down just like normal comes all the way down into here again it needs to come to at least the midpoint it's not a little bit below be as big as we want and i'm pretty much just pulling this one straight down a little bit to this kind of like that like that there we go hold that one in and we're going to change this a lot anyways it doesn't matter need some dark back here for through the mountain i want to show you when i say it doesn't matter it really doesn't the way you lay this thing out does not matter as much as you think get a nice edge on there there we go i can see a peak right here right here there's a little bitty guy here somewhere in this big one and there's a mountain shape that we can work with yep all right let's go back to the pallet for a minute all right so what i want to show you here is i'm going to wipe my knife off because i'm lazy i didn't tear a paper towel i'm going to grab some white up here titanium white okay yeah let's just grab more i know i'll need it i'll put heat it pop it down and then watch this i want this to be orange not completely orange i'm gonna leave it kind of marbled that way we'll have brighter spots and darker spots there something about like that will get us going anytime you're working on a mountain and you're trying to cut the paint just kind of it's going to be hard to see this but put your knife in there and go and you'll cut the little raw paint the bob was always tickled about can also kind of scoot across it and grab the little royal paint too there's 10 different ways here i'm always bad in class to say 10 different ways to skin a cat and i don't think bob would like that saying so we'll quit saying that let's go back to the canvas now and do our mountain all right we've got our paint ready to run take your knife don't lay it down flat just kind of go up here and start laying out this mountain ooh it's really orange i mean it puts more wine in it you kind of have to adjust as you go a little bit more white in there there we go this will be a little bit better and i'm right outside that edge just kind of floating down through here letting it break letting it break don't be scared i got a little don't be scared of the paint just think no pressure i'm gonna hear on my knife no pressure there we go we got our edge done always my hardest part i don't know why here now we're gonna start working pretty much straight down this mountain it's a big mountain so take just a little bit of time to do it you know mountain takes up more than half your campus you're gonna have a little time in it and this mountain won't be exactly the other one i can already see one difference i had a little peak here i think uh let's see i'm trying to think right there a good bit of color right there it's kind of pulling straight down on that but no pressure no pressure you use pressure you're going to be in agony city real quick and nobody's ever wanted to go to ankeny city down in the world so all right see we're starting to make a mountain out of nothing i'll always talk about moving mountain but you also can make mountains not nothing just have to have it just have to have the courage to try all right so we're gonna have a good shadowy i'm gonna put a little bit here and just kind of let this connect right there that's how you kind of create different different angles and things in the mountains so you don't have them all running all the way down let's just i'm going to skip over here and here we go let's just do this one real quick maybe maybe something like that for this guy like that and we're working with a really muted orangey white or white orange we'll come back later and mess with it a little more i did at the end the last time so let me do that again now let's just start working kind of moving our knife a little bit that way so we don't have one straight angle now you don't want just one straight angle there we go all right you always put pure white on here sometimes that will look nice it's a different different way of looking at it all right i'm gonna i'm gonna put one right here a pretty big piece there and this probably won't look as orange until we see a picture of it because this line up here is interfering with us a little bit there we go look at that got all kinds of little crevices in there what we want that is what we want right here let's shoot got some fire on the mountain now we're turning it down maybe some fire on that mountain like that added a little bit more orange if you're careful you can go back over you cannot use any pressure and if you keep going over you're going to lose everything so at some point you have to stop it's kind of up to you to figure out where that stopping point is though right and then a little bit more right here drag that down oh yeah oh yeah i'm gonna do something here forget go ahead and beef up our orange i'm taking pure orange now and finding some areas just to lay that on top of and it's just barely tight i'm not even really you can see how loose i'm holding that knife that's the key to the whole thing if you start um putting too much pressure you just smear the paint and nobody wants smeared mountain i don't think i need a little bit more right here there we go that's what i'm looking for and then we're going to do something here let's work on our shadow a little bit i'm not going to bring you over to the power of the shadow but it's it's gonna be white and crushing blue now let me show you when you work with blue never grab a bunch that may be too much but i'm gonna try it's strong and you know you'll keep chasing trying to get the get the white back you just can't what we want is a pretty blue for a shadow color pretty blue that will go with our orange there it is no prussian blue you could use that little blue too let's get this one and just just come down through here no pressure hope you all can see that i'm using no i'm literally kind of scooting it along you do pull just a little bit kind of pull to the left let's add a little bit a little something here got a little more blue into the mountain this time all right rocking and rolling get here and start working this straight almost straight down but you're kind of pulling pushing up into that paint and pulling a little bit i can't see the light stand up and do it there we go and i'm not going to bring this one i want this pink kind of stand out this time a lot of times we put it in the background that's not back here and just pull and i'll kind of put in a little bit put it back here a little bit that's okay all right fix that and we'll bring it back out just a little bit something like that i don't like that blue this will take a half a tube of white i've got a little tube here i'm working on get my color mix again again i'm just mixing a little bit of blue and white over here nothing nothing you can't do we're still collecting for the retirement fund for squeaky chair not going well bright blue there we go right here get behind this peak pull this one back let that float in one more it'll be pretty a little bit more over here come on oh knife there we go there we go there we go that's looking good oh where else where else where else i'm thinking right here and a little bit oh happy little accident we're going to fix that a little bit in there a little bit in there maybe maybe there's a little bit in there even see how i'm lightly touching it though i can't use pressure if you use pressure it will not work it's probably one of the truest things that bomb said when he was working on mountains if you try to use too much pressure you were going to have a heck of a time getting it to work i'm liking more blue i've got more blue in this mountain than the other one let's um what do i want to do now before i forget just remembering what i did on the other one is i actually went ahead and somewhere in here there's another little peak and i put some more dark back in just help me kind of define where where it lives it kind of goes into that but this is not the second mountain there's two mountains on this thing this is just another little peak that's probably plenty i'm probably gonna add just a touch more i'm just looking at the reference painting off the screen here and we would kind of pull this one out a little bit at the peak right there let's see now where that one's in front of all this so it's actually like having three mountains the time we're done here yeah before i forget i should have did this first should have done this first let's throw a little bit keep your shadow back here for sure look at that just brought it right out now i'm going to actually pull that watch it and pull that through and there's a reason it's going to look like it was cut off so now it looks like it's behind there so we don't know exactly where where that mountain that's what we want all right grab some of our highlight color which i'm fastly running out of a little peak here this peak again is not the second mountain yeah i haven't forgot this is just another part of the mountain yeah that's good it's no pressure no pressure use pressure that'll work down like that i'll tell you what let's let's add here and let this kind of grow together just like that yeah yep that's probably good take a little blue and throw our shadow back here there we go a little more shadow right in there maybe maybe run in here oh a little too much don't mind it being shadow or chunky so no big deal all right and we can always create another peak there shadowy area and you can just throw some some blue in here and there pull it that way maybe there's a little bit in there it's just about what you see when you're paint don't worry about what i see there look at that just i even just pulled it on there however works there we go i like that i like that there's only one painting i'm the one that has to like it that's the rule a little bit right here all right well we're sailing through here i am going to tap tap tap and then lift up on this this one needs some fog and mist this is the brush i put the liquid white and the yellow on the canvas so it will actually kind of soften everything down too tap that out just a little bit a little bit more there over here just kind of get tough with it like that that's a big mountain bright too and at the end what i'll probably do is touch it up a little bit here and do it because i did it you can do that on the mount especially if you don't have trees in front of the mountain it's all area there i didn't like there we go all right these looks i mean this is a huge mountain range right somebody has to tell me where this is at because i don't know all right let's get some more mountain mix we've got our mist and fog down here if you wanted to would be kind of cool let's do it i didn't do it on the other one i'll grab a uh a one-inch brush to do that with and do what you say i don't know we'll try something white and orange just throw a little bit of a glow down here oh went upside down more white i may not like this you don't get the blue and the orange smearing together you'll get a kind of a green yeah oh yeah just the hands of it there there we go grab this brush and just kind of lift that up a little bit see how careful i am about it it gives a little glow i hope that shows up on the camera like this one's sitting in something sitting in the fall i missed all right we've got some more mountain mix out now we're gonna do a big mountain and we're gonna do the big one i'm sorry our second one i'll get around here in a minute it's coming down so about right here and it lives right there it's pretty much just a standard mountain shape change it up as you want to but it does we'll add a little bigger canvas for this one so i'll add something over here maybe it comes out there you can tell i'm being real careful the looser you become on the canvas the better your painting will look don't worry if you you want a nice edge if you go outside like i did right there take your knife get it back that's all you got to do not magic there there we go maybe shoot just three or four peaks i don't know something like that there we go let's pull this guy out let's get the right brush pull that way yeah and maybe pull back this way we don't want to go any lower than that we got a lake in here well i've just sneezed real big you may have heard that there we go it's another little mountain range sitting in front of that and it really makes that one glue doesn't it pretty cool all right grab some orange and some white what do i yeah pretty much much orange and white oh we can start wherever oh getting green be careful be careful mountain mix working this there maybe here put this one in like that i need more orange oh yeah yeah let's just put a little bit over here maybe and now maybe something i don't know all right this mountain is way off too even though it's closer it's still a long way away so you don't have to have tons of detail in it i also got a little foothill to put in so foothill actually looks really nice on this one all right we got that that's what we do next blue and then you start here look at that there's our shadow there sneak in here a little bit there maybe right there or something there's some shadow i love that blue very vibrant really really nice [Music] may need to change that one a little bit here i think down in here we start getting into more shadows so i may need a lot of shadows with that big guy back there yeah a little bit that way pull that one in there oh what else right here maybe what do you think so yeah i'm liking it i'm liking it it's a little different watch this let's go smear some some in there and maybe maybe that comes in right there a little bit of snow on there be right here [Laughter] yes sir all right let's just tap this guy out we need more we need there we go and i want that and again we're gonna probably beef up the orange at the end just because i want to you know my world so you know all that still but it's true i want to beef up i want more orange i'm going to have more orange say okay i like it yes i like it but we do need to just kind of give it a little bit be careful don't go too much lower than that i'm just gonna brush that gently maybe a little bit there just a little bit too hard and some air pull this one this way just to touch all right now we've got to do something that's important take a gum of color here i'm not worried about a sheet all right like bob would always leave a little white here not on mine i'm just so i'm just throwing it in here pretty thick just smearing it out spreading it out i've got liquid white down here so it's going to dilute it a little bit and that's okay and what we can do actually is pull a little bit of that color up into a mountain shape just be careful because that blue will turn a greenish color there set that mountain down anymore i think my uh my lake was more vibrant than the sky and i liked it there we go jump on side to side down here we can put it in we don't really need to just pause we've got trees that live down there we'll put it almost all the way down to the bottom i think about you diploma let's get a little bit more right there i want this so far go straight across there we go there we go i'm actually going to dip you guys down just a little bit so we got a little foothill back there and that foothill is made i'll just show you the colors no big fancy mixing or anything some fresh and blue and a little bit of your mountain mix that's pretty much it pretty much all i used you could also put a little drop of black in there if you had black out but you want to be able to i'm just putting the mountain mix kind of to dull it just a little bit all right here we go you also know that you can change this at any time yep that's what i want dark dark deep blue don't lose your leg though i'm just tapping you can almost see that bounce in that brush it's kind of cutting across in there and maybe here kind of joins up somewhere i want it pretty now dark is going to be the game changer we're going to put this blue in here and if you're not careful you will get a and it's fun you're going to get a little green i don't care you could add a little more black to help with that but to me i like it maybe pop these up barely barely barely you can see the little tree line now just barely you know sometimes i'll go like that pull up some little taller ones all right now the key here is the brush you use i don't want to use brand new all right we need a little bit of reflection we know what you don't want to do is keep pulling just pull it down and be done because it won't look as green if you do that there we go being a little green's okay water's green sometimes sometimes i get green there we go there we go maybe you want that off and just go across the gym gently gently gently put that down it's just two hairs in some air set that down and it is it has a little bit of a green cast to it i guess but it's okay and then what i do here on this one is just come back carefully just kind of pull it just a little bit more a little bit more definition there like that there we go our lake the key here is making sure that you remember bigger knife get some white use liquid white or titanium i like titanium just start thinking of a water line back in here it's orange in that watermelon it'll look better that shoreline make it as thick as you want there we go oh that looks keep it level keep it level yeah i think over here always throw a little bit here if you wanted to make sure it's clean something like that all right we're about crank is out all right some blue and some mountain mix what do you need blue mountain mix maybe a little black if you got it nicely blue all right somewhere down here there's a little piece of land see why i didn't wear it with the light and you could fill this in and what i would do if it was me and i think i did i would add a little bit of green i want to add about that much satin green into my color still blue it's got green in here too let's put us a tree work on a tree here a lot of paint a lot of paint oh we got one big one here let's see where i want it right there just touch touch touch touch oh getting a little crooked a little cricket on me i'm gonna do down trees going going left then right left making sure that we can get through that blue paint behind us and right or right and left it doesn't matter i need more blue you want this to stay pretty much blue not green a little green is okay it's got to be a blue green there we go let's cover up that there we go working our way down yeah it's a blueberry is what i've got shoot in that corner and we paint a couple of these i mean let's stop on the edge tonight kind of took it all the way down the other night we'll all right i need a little more phthalo blue little blue and you know i can see similarities i can see differences in the painting versus the one the other day let's go there i want to darken that tree up a little bit this is the big one yeah we'll let this one come all the way down we'll highlight it to make it look like it's all the way down okay we've got another over here yeah it's a little bigger oh my oh my all right touch touch touch touch touch start working left then to the right left and right i'm gonna keep this one kind of skinny trying to at least you can see that brush bend when i'm working with it i'm using more of the brushes to get down the the canvas it's just what you're going to do there we go the two huge trees and we're going to switch brushes on all right so i'm switching to my trusty trees someone do here with that all right where we want tree we've got one that cuts through that goodness how did i get that in there that's a tiffin all right let's just do it like one a faint line at that it'll work though this is when you might have to take a drop of thinner i think i'm going to a little drop a thinner mark when i say a drop i mean like a sniff like the brush barely touches the thinner like one hair touches the thinner not the brush just one hair of the brush touches it there there we go i think oh yeah see how it sticks i don't want to lose my lake so being careful to not let this tree get big i mean that is wide on a skinny tree it's a skinny evergreen it's been on weight watchers any crag tree i don't know i don't like that there we go get a little beefy there better back off the bars and probably don't like that my trunk's a little off center i'm gonna put trunks in these so no big deal let's uh let's do a couple more we almost got the painting done right there barely touch pull yellow line down no pressure and i'm mainly it's a little mostly prussian blue a little bit of mountain mix and just a smidge of green and you'll have to kind of decide what a smidge is just a hint enough to give it a little greenish color but it still would there we go i tend to be quiet all right right there a little bit down there i really like the looks of those versus these just different i don't know it's probably just it's probably just where it is different i think it's nice make sure you don't have these two the same eye sorry this one needs to go this little bit higher or this one's a little bit lower let's see we got a little just a smidge higher there and we'll put our grass in then we'll make bring a couple of these down that'd be fun a little fat there at the top be loose with them wouldn't be gonna be trees trees grow crazy at times there's a big tree and that one could be that one right there all right thing we do next i still got a little bit of orange we'll grab the brush here let's see if we can get it stick not we'll add just to drop them yeah there we go so just a tiny bit of liquid white yeah there we go a little bit a little hot on our grass grassy areas i'm just loading that brush that's all i'm doing nothing fancy just kind of hitting there like a little hill there maybe a little dark side where all this land lays like something like that that looks good all right i'm going to find some van dyke brown a little band-aid brown we're going to marble that color just like we marveled the orange then that ground white background white take your knife and marvel it and i don't need to show you that you've seen me marvel colors before and hold on here like a little tree trunk there we go just touch maybe this one i'll have to go back over the branches but maybe that one comes all the way down sometimes they do come down all the way there look just kind of a little bigger area there this one like that right there oh that's a big one not too big there there there and there all right now a clean fan brush here all right i grabbed a clean fan brush and i'm going to take a bit of sap green just on the fan brush like that and the pressure blue i'm going to place on my palette here and then white i want a blue green you do not want a yellow green for this this for these trees it'll look odd look really odd make sure you get you a blue green still mostly blue but a little green i'm going to use a little bit of liquid white to kind of loosen it up because this paint i'm using is quite thick i think that the green i want right there looks good touch more white all right let's do this one try it out on this one i don't want a really bright highlight yep it didn't get just touch brighter just darker keep playing with it do you like the color it's not setting stone until you're done you can change it different you know add different things to it just ease my warning on this one and use a blue green something like that the yellow green will just throw the whole color scheme off that's my opinion so free feel free to make sure all right cover ups on those trunks always cover the top and the bottom of your trunk and it will look on well that's perfect perfect for this painting and even though i used the filbert to make these three i'm just going to use a fan and you can really be well with that you can you can just kind of throw it on there it looks nice i think you can also clean the filmer and use it there that's pretty good let's do this one before i hit it before running a color i should say all right i figure i like to come in this way paint there we go bouncing around with that not really there well it looks crazy my tree looks craggly i'm happy there branch is going every which way uh let's do this one and again i did it with the filter but i'm there oh i need to accept the trunk and the last one look at that you just it's crazy looking i don't know i like it i need to do this here let that one sit there all right we're going to script script we're going to switch to a script liner now and go back into our tree color this is where you start getting some details off of these little guys here make sure you get your paint good and thin should run almost like ink starts running away from you you got it right just pulling little limbs out of here orange and blue and blue green here just perfect together all kinds of stuff down there there we go i'm gonna pull some off this guy you can see i'm being super careful which i'm not there may be over there let's clean it a little bit back up and we've got little stick trees get enough paint in our brush we guess there we go one i think on the other one i put grass i mean you can do that you just kind of come in here and kind of pull up like that almost like a circle hitting the canvas little clumps of grass if you want you can always cat tail maybe i don't know like that i think we need a bigger stick tree right there like that okay it comes all the way down in there oh i know what i did i don't know what i did a little brown black color kind of thin oh we've got one that's pretty tall [Applause] there we go and it's just a it's a dead one of these kind of ghostly throw some stuff off of it like that maybe there's a little bit smaller one right there and little things in here just kind of takes time it's kind of like that last painting tedious um the foresty one but it really pays off you could spend a lot more time than me really make it look nice it's pretty just getting a good nap there we go off some bigger ones there we go see i like that i like that a lot and that tree coming all the way down got our grass in now we get to take over the mountain and we're done here i'm getting paint out around nothing nothing fancy there we go this is to be with pretty much orange just a touch of white edge i want to make sure that i don't see any of that dark on that edge for this one even if i go all the way outside of my outline it's okay maybe here a little bit there and this is mostly just orange and i'm just spreading a little bit extra in here to kind of accentuate things even maybe just little pieces of orange in there stand up and look at it now get right here so it's a little more interesting to look at right there yep oh yeah cut right through that blue the blue is as important as the orange on this one so don't lose your blue lose your shadow i think this needs to be brighter oh look at this look at this now it's standing out that's what i want yes this is what i did at the end on the other one i wanted it to be just crazy colorful you got to be careful here because we can't really blend tap it with your finger maybe so they kind of sit down there in the midst oh that's nice much nicer guys don't be scared to go back and you do have to learn when to stop you also have to learn that you can't keep going [Applause] there's no penalty here watch this i'm gonna bring this one out a little bit more like that see what i need to do is get me just to touch them white and blue mixed up there we go oh yeah yeah chunky chunky chunky monkey maybe there oh that's nice nice nice nice nice always trying to sneak back and just pull just a little bit on your if you add any back in and another thing that sometimes i've been doing recently is making sure taking my knife and just kind of running it like this and it gives you a nice shadow top to that mountain you're right here it's just a touch here oh i'm gonna get and get it there stop i'm getting drunk see if i can get that out nobody's here tell me to stop there i'm fine with that there we go brush it a little bit oh yeah come on yeah that works better when i do this just kind of keeps running too there we better stop we better stop we're getting trouble in the video way longer than i wanted to be i am not a speed painter yes that's okay with me all right we got our trees got everything in uh if one more little area maybe i see that i don't like and i will on my big palette this area could use a little more definition i gotta be careful because i can't really blend it so i'm gonna it's gonna stop that's and that's fine the mist can eat that up if it wants i'll just throw a little bit and just kind of walk it back i'm not worried about making changes as i go i'm worried about liking the paint there we go yeah maybe it's right there right there one more little change here that i don't like this area one there bring it out just a little bit more and then we'll have to go back a little bit over shadow a little chunky back there all right there it is we'll call it cream tickle mountain i don't know let's turn this off see if you can see it a little bit there it is all right guys everybody take care i will see you soon", "9eJBV9IiPr0": "this week on redding can we chat about the many traditions in qriket and how they have changed over and over and over again so i brought my friend on to chat all about them uh my name is neil marthal and i'm unemployed madness and i spent a lot of time touring together over the last few years including sharing a hotel room at one stage so i know what pisses him off and i know what pisses me off and that's mostly people whining about the game when they know next to nothing about it what people often call tradition is usually just what they can remember so this episode is clearing up just how much cricket has changed over the years [Music] so matters when i said i wanted to get you on this podcast i said you know what are you passionate about and you have somehow turned that into what are your bug bears and so we're going to talk about the people in cricket who call themselves traditionalists and talk about how much they love the game and actually have no idea about the traditions of the game and how much it has changed this game has changed so much manus you know that's once a subject that i have absolutely no indifference to i either completely leave it or i get really hot under the collar people say just leave this game alone it's perfectly fine it's been going for 140 years why do you want to keep changing it well i've got a list which has doubled in length since you and i exchanged notes over this i've got like 30 key aspects of the game and only one only one maybe we'll save this until the end that i can find has not been changed at some point uh very interesting well i'm gonna go through a couple of the worst ones just off the top my head the super sub condition in one day cricket where they basically came up with a plan where you couldn't use your super sub in any way of shape or form to help your cricket team and i can't remember what period was i think it was just before world war one they looked at having nets around the grounds and it was some sort of extra boundary section that they were looking for those are about the only two that i can think of that were absolutely horrendous there are some others that haven't worked for many different reasons but start me off where are we going manners where to start where to start well the length of an over the length of a test match that's the one that really got me hot under collar just recently when people saying test cricket has always been five days leave it alone why do you want to make it four days and i do get a bit animated about this because do you know what as long as conditions are the same for the two teams playing fine so the ashes why can't you leave the ashes at five days that's an iconic test series why can't you leave england india though you know the really big test series but if afghanistan play ireland in a test series if they want to play each other and lose a million dollars a game why would you want them to play it over five days it's a nonsense isn't it i mean and and for a scheduling point of view for countries like south africa sri lanka or you know the chess playing countries which are also losing money it makes perfect sense thursday to sunday three days off thursday to sunday three test series in three weeks so i understand the arguments and you make several very good ones for why it will change test cricket but think of all the things that have changed test cricket it's a fundamentally different game i mean number of bounces per over that's the one that really gets me you know in 1991 number of bouncers was limited for the first time because the rest of the world had to find a way to stop the west indies from beating everybody but there's so many so many aspects of the game that have changed absolutely fundamentally so don't get so hot under the collar about four day cricket it's quite interesting i don't know how many people know that it started as a three-day affair in england so it was three days in england five days in australia and there was obviously often four day tests there were timeless tests not to mention the amount of tests that we had where we had a break in the middle a rest day what a phenomenal thing to think of now that we literally just went wait everyone needs a tuesday off don't they let's have a break here timeless tests i think i'm one of the more overrated concepts only because i don't think we actually had that many timeless tests that went timeless if you know what i mean like generally they didn't go on but the truth the matter is i think there's a real concern that england australia and india might turn around to all the smaller countries and go you're not worth five days and i can see why people will come up with that but the idea that cricket is traditionally a five-day sport well it's not based in any facts that i can find in the same way that when the hundred came out manners everyone was so worried about the length of an over i'm pretty sure when my father played qriket in australia he played eight ball overs yeah exactly you're right and we had four ball overs as well in the four fifties thirties and in fact we had eight australia was the last country australia and new zealand was the last country to give up eight ball overs weren't they it makes sense i mean you use up a lot of time changing overs i mean you know why not have eight ball overs i think it makes a great deal of sense and in fact have 10 ball overs if we're worried about not getting enough cricket in let's talk about it i don't think that anything should be off limits explore explore the options because as i said everything has been changed at some point or another and people who get worried about test cricket say that it's dying and we need to to make it more sexy and more interesting and appealing to the youngsters that in itself is a cricketing tradition that's over a century old i mean that's why the tri series was staged in 1911 england south africa and australia because they thought that test cricket was boring and it was putting people off so they had to get three teams together it's brilliant oh names and numbers on shirts that's the other one that has been getting people really really hot under the collar and the traditionalists said you know oh it just won't be the same you know test cricket is tradition i tell you what jared in the sort of late 80s when i was trying to become a commentator and even into the early 90s i used to go down to nets and practice matches and watch cricketers for hours and hours and hours so that i could identify them under a broad brim sun hat from 120 yards away and it was a tough skill to master and i didn't always get it right but it went down for hours and hours practicing and i have to say that in the intervening 30 odd years i have often thought what an absolute waste of time it may be a good skill but of what practical use is it so brilliant names and numbers on shirts and you know what we're the traditionalists now i mean all that kerfuffle and unhappiness about it and like all the other changes it's just been accepted and it's one of those changes that why that really annoyed me was i grew up at the mcg and as you know you are so far from the action even if you're on the boundary you're so far from the action so if you're a way back i remember taking my girlfriend once and she just couldn't work out who the players were it was actually it was victoria versus uh india it was a i took her to a warm-up game that's the kind of romance that i do i actually took her because i told her she'd be able to watch sachin tendulkar and then uh the game was called off before sachin came in but that's another story for another day but essentially for newer fans it's a great thing and for us it just doesn't matter i told you maxwell jim maxwell was so upset about it he was saying that um emily dopes loved jim but jim was basically saying that i hope they haven't brought this in for commentators and it's like no we've brought it in because of the amount of new younger spectators that we want to actually love this game we want them to know who that person is at all times and to get a better feeling of it and i think that's what it actually does so i think that's a perfect little change that actually could have a long effect on players and it won't matter for you or me or hardcore qriket fans but it might matter for other people the 1910 1911 series i had forgotten about that that is certainly try series of test matches what an incredible moment that was not only that do you people talk about the golden era and how cricket was great in amateur do you know why a lot of the australian players didn't turn up to that tour man as they were on strike yeah money dispute yeah that was one i noticed a lot when we did death of a gentleman you go on these speaking tours and you go around and eventually there'd always be this one guy usually in some sort of knitted vest who would come up with standing don't you think everything could be fixed in cricket by just having amateur players play and i was like whoa me and sam would race to get to this answer because we both are so passionate about this even though sam's from eaton and basically was an amateur cricketer because we would say how do you think russia can't exist if you have amateur qriket how do you think cricket grows if you have amateur cricket essentially you would have a bunch of posh guys ripping off the system anyway w grace was paid so this whole idea that cricket was ever this holy thing it's just i think i could be wrong english journalists in the 1950s just after world war ii looked back and just sort of pretended that all the normal parts of cricket didn't exist and that they were ah to only go back to those days it's like  off those days were horrible wg grace was a terrible cheat he would have got worse press today than kp do you think so yes he was a cheat and a bully he did things against the spirit of the game almost every game you know the story about him running out was it sammy carter's goes down the wicket to take a piece of grass off the wicket and wg you can't tell me john etheridge in the sun he's going to be writing a good column about that there'd be boots in the journalists these days it's complete nonsense so my point is that amateurism is one of those things that people talk about and realistically professionalism has allowed us to have irish cricketers afghanistani cricketers nepalese cricketers and everyone else and women cricketers it's a brilliant thing what else you got on your list money was right behind the very foundation of why the game was played and yeah a lot of people think of match fixing as a modern phenomenon well absolute nonsense you know you'd have the sort of duke of cornwall's 11 against the earl of sussex's 15. you know where's that from for a start there'd be stories of the fiery fast bowler being poisoned the night before because the these two landed gentry had put a massive wager on the game it was professional in a sense from from the very start i've got loads loads on my list why don't players play in shorts why do we turn our nose up at shorts yeah i think you mentioned to this one on whatsapp so you know i was there when victoria played in shorts no i didn't know that this is such a great story so essentially they thought that they had to make domestic cricket more fun and they'd get more spectators and so victoria became the victorian bushrangers right and victoria would play in shorts because people are just desperate to go down to the grounds and watch cricket is it short but there's a really funny thing because baseballers wear trousers as well and it turns out in sports where you slide on hard surfaces having trousers on is quite important so what would happen to the victorian place the guys out in the outfield had no problems with the shorts and quite enjoyed it the bowlers liked it i think as well the guys around the square who had to dive all day would end up with just their knees tore apart so there is actually whether we knew this or not there was a fundamental reason why we had it but you're right there is absolutely no reason why you can't wear shorts when you were playing cricket in certain positions the victorians wore shorts in the well that was the 70s wasn't it or early 80s it was 93 or 94 the year that they did it okay it wasn't pre velcro then they didn't have those buckles on the pads that they no you wouldn't want to be putting those on with shorts that would have been around the time that velcro had taken over yeah you're right oh my god do you remember going to training with it with the buckle pads and you just get it wrong and picked the back of your calf yeah again another innovation that has managed to move our game on velcro who would have thought that was whatever but that shows that realistically the big bash is just uh i would say follow on from that moment and australian cricket at that stage was incredibly progressive so you had the shorts teams weren't really known by their nicknames back then were they you know so you had australian teams doing that england was still playing in whites for limited overs cricket so australia was ahead of the game for that day night cricket and then they tried day night four day cricket so i was at a bunch of games at the mcg in day night four day cricket where one game they used a yellow ball and another game they used an orange ball now an orange ball at dusk turned out not the best idea [Laughter] very easy to see during the day and at night not so much during dusk but again that showed that they were trying to get something and i don't know how you feel about day night cricket test cricket but i'm sure you're probably in favor of it but for me it's like if you look at the the tv ratings for the whacker test compared to the tv ratings for every other test in australia it's off the charts because it's in peak viewing time for the eastern states so they all tune in apparently not as many people watch tv during the middle of the day who knew i am very much in favor of day night cricket and was right from the outset and again you know you remember all at the time when they were when the talk was of staging the first ones and then people said oh but the conditions will be so different it'll just be unfair and you know just the cricket is a daytime game oh we're absolutely rubbish and you and i have done enough daytime test matches to see how conditions could change from one day to another or from the morning to the afternoon so playing a couple of hours under floodlights i'm getting suitably hot under the collar again now let's go to pictures shall we let let's go to pitches pitch has always been cut no no not only has the pitch always been covered what it used to be completely uncovered remain uncovered it wasn't until 1910 that cricket started covering pictures at the end of play overnight and then it was only the pitch ends wasn't it and since then so so then it was that the pitch ends then the whole pitch then the bowlers run-ups then the whole of the square and then there was a debate about leaving the pitch uncovered and just covering up the bowlers run-ups so you would have had fast bowlers running in like merv hughes on damp run-ups in some games and as i said as long as it's the same for the two teams the sort of people who concern themselves with preserving the sanctity of records do you remember when there was debate about ireland and afghanistan well not even that sri lanka anytime there was a new team given test playing status people would say like oh no it'll just invalidate all the records teams will be scoring 700 and 800 against them that does amuse me i mean how many records are there in test match cricket that deserve to have an asterisk by them because the conditions were so alien you know county cricket very different declaration bowling that kind of thing but in all fairness matthew hayden scored 380 against a not very good zimbabwe team the day night thing and then the pictures all plays together because when that happened ian botham and a bunch of people on twitter and social media and former players all said oh you have to throw all the records out now because it's a completely different game right now those people don't look at cricket records all the time they also don't contextualize them in in any way shape or form so if you go through that entire history you talked about you missed out a couple of things of which you'll know a bit about so basically up until 1900 we didn't use liquid manure uniformly in cricket so i think it was about 1895 that it became in so before that the reason that was so hard to bat in international cricket and first-class cricket is literally the ball would hit little chunks of on the pitch right and fly around right now that's why george loman's record is so good and that's why wg grace is seen as a great despite the fact he's only got a batting average of mid-thirties it's because about mid-thirties when you're literally having to face balls coming off is quite tough you then have the fact that south africa won their first test series on what surface matting matting wickets pakistan i think might have won their first test series again i think was on matting so you've got two teams who basically started out on matching wickets and then you've got all the rest of the evolution that you were talking through not to mention the quality of the balls has changed the quality of the bats has changed the size of the ground the general upkeep of the ground has all changed i hate to say to ian botham but his record looks quite unfavorable compared to george lohmann when we look at day tests he doesn't quite go to the loman level of averaging what did loan average against south africa nine or something eight so you've got all those sorts of things and then and then you're right yeah south africa won two test series in the first 40 years and new zealand won their first test series after 39 years there's a lot of batsmen around the world who did very well and get some ordinary attacks from those two countries in those days yeah yeah chicken or pig and that would have been cow oh no you're kidding it would have been manure it would have been chopped up manure wouldn't it was before muckrakers came along i've actually done a video on this i went into the archives to find out so the muckraker was invented somewhere around the mid-1800s when farming became an industry rather than just people doing it on their own and then it looks like it took until about 1897 for most first-class venues around the world to have access to liquid manure amazing i love that i love that jared i need to ask you about boundaries okay so people may not know many of our listeners may not know that there weren't boundaries in cricket they weren't introduced until 1870 but i've often wondered apparently the story goes that what triggered it was a game an actual game apparently it's a true story in which a ball was hit into a tree and the batsman ran 286 times before somebody said enough or maybe they just ran out of energy and then so the mcc were consulted about this because the boundary was basically formed by the crowd wasn't it that big popular game yeah and then if the ball was hit into the crowd they would sort of part and allow the fielder to run after the ball and pick it up but is the 286 story true i don't believe so and the reason i know this is so weird man is you could not have found a more random expert than me when i went to primary school very small community school on the outskirts of melbourne our librarian was a cricketer gary something i have to look up his name but he recently messaged me on facebook because i wrote about this because he holds the world record for the most runs run in a cricket game and it's way less than 286 it was i wish i knew this story better but i think they were in 28 or 30 hit the ball into the outfield on a big outer suburban melbourne grounds and councils look after grounds in australia it's not like some other countries around the world where the players do which means the councils don't always get to cut the grass and in this case they've smashed them all out to deep mid wicket or something the ball's gone in the grass and these guys have just kept running essentially until they were too exhausted to continue to run so i know that other story is not true but i think it does come from a very basic truth where they realize that sort of thing could happen and it would start to happen and i think boundaries came in but if i'm not mistaken sixes were quite weird didn't you used to at one stage get five runs for a six and you had to swap ends yeah they didn't really know what they were doing did they uh when they introduced the boundaries and and uh six which is based on the number of runs they thought that would have been run on average if the ball had been hit that far into the crowd and often you know the crowd would impinge the fielder and uh depending on whether he was the opposition or a home team so i think it was just a it was a random thing but yeah it was a five a six was a five initially yeah so i mean they had no real idea what they were doing it's funny how so many of those sports kind of got some of the very basics very right i think four runs and six runs are a very good amount for those shots especially i think we're seeing now with t20 like the amount of risk you have to take i think that makes sense but i suppose this goes back to the change that more traditionalists in cricket fought more than anything else which is overarm bowling now yes indeed i love hearing you talk about subjects that you're not only an expert on but passionate about so go on your listeners actually your regular listeners will probably know they'll have heard you talk about it but go on so it's really interesting so basically cricket was a street game yeah as you said there was a bit of gambling two blokes out the corner at the back of their day would do it kids would do it was usually one on one sometimes two on two hamburgen comes along and essentially formalizes the legal betting really as much as the laws and at that stage we then have cricket almost set in a little box we know what it is and this bloke called tom walker comes along he was a batsman i mean he must have been dull as to watch some of the stories about his innings are legendary and he decides to bowl one day and he just sort of pops his arm up neil and tries the ball and the posh blokes at hamilton not having none of it i'm not sure he even bowled ever again in a game after that they were so upset with him 30 years later people are still doing this and lords are essentially trying to fight it and of course the backstory of lords is one of the most brilliant things we use this as a holy name thomas lord tried to sell the ground and build flats on it that's how much he cared about cricket by the end and so they're trying to find it so you then have a couple of people involved one of them was the willis family i think that's how you pronounce it essentially he does it in a game and because he's a posh boy he can get away with it he does it a few times finally does it at lords he's called for a no ball he's thrown out of the game allegedly manus in this case the story is so great jumps on a horse and just rides off into the sunset never plays another first class game that part of the story is true i don't know if the horse is true but he literally left the ground was so upset never played another first class game but they kept fighting so basically for over 50 years people kept fighting to stop people from bowling over arm and cricket and do you know why they did it manners do you know the kicker of all this was is that they were fat old wanky posh gentlemen who basically use four pound bats and if you came in and tried to wang a ball sideways and we're not even talking about overrun yet they didn't got that far yet we're talking literally round down bowling it was scaring the out of 45 year old men who weren't athletic enough to play a proper sport in the first place and so they fought it for years it's ridiculous and it held cricket back so much because the minute overall bowling becomes a thing wg grace invents modern batting and away we're going we've got a proper sport and what about the story that overarm bowling was adopted on mass first of all by women who played the game because they couldn't bowl underarm because of their whale bone skirts yeah that's all fake is that fake really yeah so john willis his sister christiana i think her name is so her part in the story gets infused almost 100 years later by her son when he writes about it in an article and he doesn't mention the dresses in that article by the way it's one of those things a bit like you know the original ufo story if you read back the original person who said he saw a ufo it's actually a long cylinder but he said it looked like it was moving like a plate it's a bit like that with the story i've checked with fashion historians because you know the sort of person i am have a look at this and women in england were not using those kinds of dresses at that time there's no way she would have had that dress but you gotta remember this no women were being trained in how to play cricket properly she was definitely in the backyard playing with her brother who goes on to be the guy who rides off on the horse right who was jane austen's nephew that was her nephew and her niece was the one that you're talking about christiana if you're in a backyard and you've never been taught cricket correctly i know so this with my kids sometimes they come up with new ways of like giving me the ball my son's got this incredible way of almost backflipping the ball to me that makes no sense if you don't treat someone how to do it properly there is a chance that she did it certainly the dresses are not true and i would doubt how much she was involved also by that point that whole family we remember them because they're really posh yeah and because of the jane austen thing in actual truth there is no doubt that for probably best part of 100 years kids on the streets posh and poor kids be playing this game and probably bowling with round arm so there you go but have we not done that this game wouldn't exist it just wouldn't exist as a sport it would be a parlor game well not a polygamy an outdoor parlor game croquet it would be crooked croquet exactly that's exactly what i was thinking we go back 150 years men were playing this game wearing cravats and jackets it wasn't a sport you could play croquet in a jacket and cravat you look at the old photos even when overall bowling started have a look at photos of spotless and those guys they're standing still with their arm up in the end they do not look like athletes and i shouldn't say photos most of them were paintings but they're not in any action poses and look at the footwork of the batsman in those very first photographs with the old lime flashes they had to stand and hold that pose for about about 10 seconds and not move so yeah yeah they're not surprised there weren't too many action shots why don't we let modern cricketers field in gloves oh and we haven't mentioned runners either the gentleman that to whom you refer used to uh they wouldn't even pull a hamstring they'd just get their butler to come and run for them i think it was it was our junior rana tinga's fault wasn't it that uh runners were outlawed in the modern game i don't know if it was him i think he's remembered as it because he was the one that exploited the rule better than anyone else in modern cricket was it ian healy who said to him you don't get a runner for being a fat prick it definitely it was healey that said that i reckon it was sayworks that they were targeting when the actual law changed if it was any international cricketer because i think he had started to do it but you're right it's a really interesting one too because baseball i think probably took that from cricket they have these substitute runners occasionally don't they that come in and just do runnings so obviously there was a crossover there but in cricket yeah it was because of the lack of athletes that was a big deal when it changed i think it's actually probably for the better because i think runners were funnier there's no doubt about that but there is something quite great about a cricketer who is injured having to bat i think at a certain point as well i know i do mean a leg injury i don't mean with a broken jaw or the succliffe story or anything like that but i do mean literally don't you think there's something great about a hobbled batsman who can't use his feet anymore so he just has to slog sleep everything yeah i love it but i enjoyed runners as well i'm just saying it's a pretty fundamental change i mean that doesn't take too much of a leap of the imagination to say that results of some very important matches would have been different not that many but it's a fundamental change anyway you see a lot of changes over the years recent has have been brought in or motivated by player safety so i'm thinking about we everyone complains about over rates i think teams might get on with it a little bit more if you said this whole thing about lunch being 40 minutes and t being 20 minutes actually you carry on until you finish your 30 overs that might be a good motive anything but then somebody will come along and say no that's health and safety mate no you won't get away with that that's that'll never be passed and a lot of things have been changed you know extra water breaks um a lot of things are based on health and safety and potential litigation on that basis how many ripped fingernails and split webbing that would be managed to cut down on if players were able to they use gloves in practice so what is it is that another traditionalist thing oh you can't have gloves we've never worn gloves in cricket why i find that very interesting is because we do have protective equipment for fielders don't we you can wear shin guards you can wear a box you wear a helmet i can't think of anyone who's ever worn a chest guard but almost all the other stuff that they can wear they wear and we see that as safe but you're right i mean it does make sense i wonder what kind of gloves you would have to wear that would make those things that much safer but perhaps you're right the ones that they use in the fielding practice could be certainly something that we could look at would it not just improve the standard of cricket because people would take more catches is that not a good thing yes definitely and also it would be a bowler's aid and when was the last time we had something that would aid bowlers if he had slip catchers with gloves on that and i'm not suggesting that you use glue well players have done that though those slip fielders use resonant things don't they sometimes in their hair i mean that is something we used to talk about in club cricket players doing stuff like that so i'd be shocked if international cricketers haven't done that especially so aussie rules football they use resin a lot in their hands they used to a lot of them wear gloves now so you can't tell me that with all the crossover between aussies football and cricket that no australian slip filters have gone out with just a little bit something a little bit sticky on their hands not much and i know about that but i'd be very surprised if they hadn't moving on to the super modern innovations and changes changes that haven't yet come in your work as an analyst you would have do crapload of research on you know where the ball travels at which period in the game and so it just occurred to me and this is a conversation i first had with mickey arthur when he was coach of one of the international teams he's one of the members of his fourth at some level i remember when it was now it was between australia and pakistan i said to him mickey on a really flat wicket in a t20 game in the last three or four overs why do you need a keeper do you know what i mean because particularly if you've got a bowler who's going to be bowling full and straight and he's mostly going to be hitting the wickets and then you might say well the bats could just leave it but then you have your third man or your fine leg very fine yeah and then if he does just leave it then at best they can push for two bats and you know they're not gonna be that happy with two are they looking for fours and sixes and that there's a rule that says you can't have your designated wikipedia you can't have him like standing at gully so you dispense with the keeper completely you take the pads and the gloves off and you don't have a keeper not all the time obviously you know this has happened no i didn't yeah yeah so um five years ago northampton maybe four or five years ago so you're right and an analyst like me probably came up with it or a random cricket person probably came up with it it must have been a very hard thing to convince the team to go with it but they didn't find it worked i think if you if you think andre russell's batting on that flat pitch and you can set up a situation where you basically have as you said maybe a third man or a fight whatever it is whatever system you think would work and at the very worst he's going to get to a ball he scores it more than to a ball like andre russell legitimately in a normal situation scores at more than two ball at the death if he's already 70 off 30 balls and he's in at the death for me i'd rather him miss the oddball and get two runs from that than i would something else i think you'd have a very fine third man that should be able to cut it off you could only do it with someone who's bowling slow balls because otherwise they'd just go for four all the time so that'd be a slow ball baller with a very fine third man and then you just have a umbrella field on the deep boundary on long on midwicket and although maybe long off as well out and you just bought very slow slow balls at and around middle and legs still and perhaps it could work but north ends did try it so it will happen again one of the things that i think will happen and i discuss this with some of the scotland players when i was there they were like what's next and i said well for me you've got one guy at one end let's say you've got son on the ryan and chrystal and playing in the game right chris lynn scores at something like 12 or 13 runs and over against steam bowling sunderland orion scores something like 12 or 13 runs and over against spin bowling why would you they take a single if you're facing seam and you're chris lynn and you've accidentally hit the ball to deep backward square why take the one and get the bloke at the other end who's only going to score at six or seven runs and over just stay there literally just go i got this scent make the other team do that in fact not only if i talk to the scotland i tried to get i played a solution to do that when he was facing a particular kind of bowling and he was the site i would be roasted by the press if i did that and i was like oh who cares what do you mean it's a good tactic i'm like anyway i have tried to convince them so there are things like that that i think make a lot of sense because right in test cricket what a bowler wants to do is bowl as many balls to a batsman as possible because the bowler is the predator and the batsman is the victim in test cricket that's basically how it works out in t20 cricket it's almost entirely the opposite what you really want is if you're a good batsman and you can see a bowler for two or three bulls in a row i am up it's the baseball rule so why baseball rotate through their pictures so much now they've worked out that through an innings hitters eventually get to the point where they're like they can work out the picture right and in cricket we have that so if you've got chris lynn facing a scene bowler you don't want him to get a single and to get the bloke at the other end who's going to struggle against same on strike and then next over chris lynn is now facing a spinner that's the last thing you want you can literally do that so i think we will actually see things of that nature and you might get similar kinds of things in test cricket more often where there will be what we would call the um manny cohen agreed upon single where joe root's facing spin in a test match just have the field a little bit deeper let him get off strike and let the guy at the other end who's maybe not as good at spin face that and get joe root facing what he's not as good at at his end so you might get little things like that start to come in in tension strike rotation fields i like that yeah i just want to remind you here jared that about three months ago just before lockdown actually a couple of weeks before lockdown started i suggested on air with you that using saliva to shine the ball might be banned and you thought i'd been on the hallucinogenic toads didn't you the reason i bring that up is to ask about the number of overs after which a new ball becomes available in test matches that's an area that i'm a little vague and hazy on i know that it hasn't always been 80 overs but sachin tendulkar came up with a good suggestion the other day didn't he with bowlers not being able to shine the ball he said why not just make the new ball available after 50 overs and i thought that made a lot of sense it hasn't always been 80 overs and i know that for a fact i can't remember i reckon it's been 60 65 40 was 40 the low 40. i think there's a really low one in there somewhere where and then they realized that they were really hurting the spinners and i'm trying to think if it is it was 40 or 45 it's not one of my pet subjects but i'm pretty sure there was one series when it was incredibly low it's actually quite tough as a historian to go back and work out what ball the teams were using at any time so the safra is nawaz game and he says it's not reverse swing even though it is 100 clearly reverse swing it's actually quite tough to tell what stage the ball was at because it was quite a long innings i think if you found the original scorecards perhaps you might be able to put it together but online on qriken phone quick archive and those sorts of things it's a bit tougher to work out when the balls are replaced in some of those older games when you think about it's a fundamental change if you think about how much one day cricket was changed by having the 25 over balls at either end and when srinivasan took over cricket he thought that was prejudice against asian teams which you can see because they wanted the ball to be older for their spinners in the middle overs and i would say the fundamental flaw in white ball cricket is the white ball is house and it doesn't last but you know what i mean so those sorts of things really do affect it so well you're also a big advocate for legalized tampering aren't you yes but there are conditions so i think it's absolutely ludicrous that bowlers aren't allowed to throw the ball into old wicked ends to legitimately scuff it up i mean it's completely unpoliceable isn't it it's it's the only umpires i can remember who were actually was ian gould do you remember he'd tease fielders and say i thought you had a better arm than that or you know you've got a problem with your elbow but that absolutely definitely should be permitted and i think that you can do whatever you like with your thumbnails i i stopped short of taking bottle tops and and broken bits of glass onto the field and i certainly you know sandpaper wouldn't make my permitted list but i was absolutely in favor of kookaburra developing that wax shining stick that they probably are still developing and i think um nobody knows what's going to work and what isn't going to work and but the umpire keeps the the shining material perhaps there could be some choices you know some vaseline or whatever and the empire keeps it and the bowler gets to apply it for five seconds at the beginning of each over you know something like that i interviewed mickey arthur a couple of weeks ago and he sits on the icc create committee of course and they came up with all the recommendations for playing cricket in a biosecure environment and i said to him mickey if the bowlers can't use saliva and by the way jared i'm still not 100 sure that saliva actually is a polishing agent i mean i think it's got more to do with the sugar or whatever they're eating in their mouths but nonetheless i said to mickey you sit on the creek committee you would have debated this and you've decided to give the bowlers nothing no compensation whatsoever why is that they can't shine the ball now and then you vetoed the use of of any shining agent why did you do that and he said because we're all batsmen on the icc cricket committee and he was only half joking that's true and so what's wrong with picking the scene with your thumbnail why is that such a terrible thing when you say it like that i can understand why people are like yeah it's a natural thing you know you you have a thumbnail but i think you and i know that international players and first-class players use strengthening agents on their fingernails to make them stronger and there are certain players who will cut their nails in a certain way so it is like having a bottle top so that's the problem isn't it and maybe we say you can use your fingernails but a bit like the the old children's sports where you check everyone's nails to make sure they're not too long yeah you go out water polo it's a water polo check is it water polo yeah i knew there was a sport i'd seen it happening but i think that junior sports i used to do it a lot too to stop kids scratching each other but essentially if you do something like that i'm up for it whoever comes up with these and the problem with these committees is the icc committee can't be honest manners right they can't say we know that teams have been cheating for let's see sufferers 69 teams have been getting the ball to reverse swing since 69 consistently and teams have been cheating to get the ball reverse swings pretty much throughout that entire but there are some grounds that just help it and it's not always a legal method but generally 85 to 95 of the time there's some illegal help that is brought in with the ball reverses right and the icc would have to actually come out at a certain point and admit that all of these things have been going on and they just allowed them to happen and i think that's part of the reason that they haven't come out and done that there's no time we've ever played club qriket and you haven't picked up the ball and someone hasn't picked at the scene it's just a thing yeah absolutely and in case people are thinking what does jared mean when he says strengthening agents it's actually the material that horse riders and particularly show jumpers use to harden the hooves of their horses so that if they do clip a jump it doesn't split their hooves and there's also the mountain climbers have a product as well which i think a lot of cricketers also own ah do they really it used to be just super glue and nowadays didn't it i can't remember ever going out on a quick round with an opening bowler who didn't have a suspiciously shiny forehead yeah exactly exactly why do you think alan donald had that white lightning paint on his face well to be fair he's probably the only one keeping the white ball together uh the most recent one of course is the substitutions for concussion and now potentially for injuries having a first-class game where you can have more than 11 players which of course has mean so many people are up in arms because they don't know that first-class games quite often had more than 11 players before the 1900s yeah well exactly i really really do believe that the modern game however you define that should be an 11 aside game other than in the case of concussion i think that was entirely sensible and now of course danielle asked me to explain this one but now you can in theory have a coronavirus covered 19 substitute but it is just an 11 aside game you haven't asked me about three team cricket southampton front of innovations three team cricket mm-hmm so who's behind this is it mark nicholas there's a few of our colleagues that are involved in this is that right yeah francois pena or as far as i'm aware sorry francois pinar is the chief executive of three team cricket mark nicholas our colleague at talksport is a shareholder and joe i think it has a future um for schools my problem with it is that it's eight aside and the main reason that six aside cricket doesn't work is there aren't enough fielders it's just and the only six aside tournament that has lasted and it remains popular is the hong kong sixes and that's because everyone gets to go on a massive jolly and go and party for a long weekend which is fine which is great i'm happy with that do you have last man stands in south africa it's part of three team cricket no there's actually a competition that i think started in australia and is now sort of filtering around through the uk and other countries around the world which is an actual competition called last man stand although it also has it also has the last man stands rule it is a decide cricket and it's actually been quite popular with people finishing work and going to play a quick game of cricket so i think eight is the sort of amount of people that you can cover the field a little bit more i think you're right six doesn't make any sense i don't know if you've ever played in a six-man team but you just end up on a boundary 100 meters from everyone else it's such a pointless exercise it doesn't make any sense there's eight-man cricket there's a little bit more that so that can make sense so it's interesting what i don't understand is have we not invented a format of qriket where young kids are going to be off the field more often than not because their whole team isn't being used or have i not looked at the regulations you bowl for six overs you're back for six overs and you spend six overs in the dugout that's that's basically it and you face six overs from each of the other two teams so it's two innings of 18 overs i think it'll be quite inclusive actually and it doesn't have to be six you know you can do it in multiples of 10 and have 60 overs rather than 36 and i just think that it works it's a throwback to those old school athletics meetings you know that was the only sport that i can recall where you played against more than one team and i think it could work but at international level or at senior first class even club level i think it's uh gimmick and i think the company has been trademarked and it's uh it's a money-making tool for the shareholders involved but i do really i'd be quite in favor of trying it out at school levels because everybody gets to baton ball probably more chance of everybody getting to bat and bowl and and there's even talk about you know rotating the fielders and it's i know this will sound patronizing but it's a childish concept and i mean that in a good way it's quite interesting we're just getting to a point where we are exploring what can be done with qrikets so the hundred let's be honest the way that they released it and organized it was uh cluster the of an omnishambles but the basic premise of making t20 qriket much different to test cricket and one day cricket is a solid marketing idea and there's like really little things that i think we're so wedded to because we're traditionalists i'd used air quotes there that won't work well on the podcast but you understand what i mean whereas in actual fact we want fielders to be at the absolute maximum we want the ben stokes catch and the sheldon cultural catch to be a normal event and at the moment having worked with cricket teams you understand the amount of effort that your best fielders have they spend all their time sprinting from end to end there's no reason why we can't have 10 overs from one end and then 10 overs from the other end in fact the only reason i could find that that wouldn't work is that it might be too intense for an umpire to do 10 overs without a break but i think they'd eventually get used to that there are heaps of things that we could do that would be quite interesting like we could actually take t20 qriket and make it really hyper specialist in a way that test qriket one day cricket won't ever need to be so you could pick five specialist bowlers and 10 special advancement and you could do all those sorts of things if you're willing to experiment with the game that would actually improve the quality of the cricket on the field it would bring in other problems but the biggest problem now is that no one is really running cricket and so you have the three team thing and you have the ten over thing and you have the hundred over thing and you're going to have all these different little you know subsections there's a certain point where cricket is spending more of its time eating itself than it is actually growing itself yeah i it doesn't have to be ten overs from one end followed by tennos on the other but five you know five five five five it's there's a lot of changing events that goes on in qriket and it takes up a lot of time even if you just had two overs from each end you know just have 12 balls from one end i enjoy that a little while ago you were talking about ass innovations like completely nonsensical rules and you wrote something quite whimsical and very critical of the changes being proposed or they may even have been sanctioned already now in the big bash what amuses me there is that qriket australia can't just say we expanded too much there's too much of it people are bored we need to go back to a manageable size six weeks is too long for a tournament you know that's just no no no no no we have to innovate let's get the men with ponytails into their marketing room and get them to come up with something exciting and sexy i thought that the bonus point for the team ahead after 10 overs was interesting and i i thought about that and i can see it being both a complete shower of and being quite fun it's like a mini power play in the middle but the really really stupid one for me is in a game that it's all about speed fitting it into 90 minutes each innings keeping it rolling keep it so you have to bowl no balls again but you have to bowl hang on what was it what was the thing about wides that they were introducing so a wide is now a free hit so how long is that going to take yeah well there'll be more balls in the boundary because i mean if you look at it purely on a mathematical thing a free hit goes at 12.2 runs and over and a normal ball goes at eight runs and over so you basically completely changed everything it's so weird because there are actual things that they could do and i think the hundred tried to do this and just got up its own ass a little bit and maybe didn't have adults in the room and i say this trent woodhill was in the room uh one of my friends i make fun of him all the time so it's okay but i think they needed a couple of adults in the room to literally say innovation is great and there are things that we can do that can move cricket forward right here right now and it will make the game more entertaining and more fun and maybe more captivating for fans right but you needed someone to say every time someone came up with an innovation why are we doing that what is it going to do and what are the ramifications what will change here and literally get a bunch of people to poke holes in it and i think the problem with the big bash changes and the 100 changes is that their changes for change's sake and for basic excitement and excitement is it it's waning cricket games are exciting for many different reasons and for many different times if you want to make a change to make the game exciting and better i'm all for it but you actually need to think these things through and i'm not sure at the moment that they are doing that and i honestly i don't think that the wide thing helps the game at all it's one of those things isn't it there's a bunch of things that you always get so when the hundred went to mumsnet and they said are you more likely to come to this thing that you don't like if it's shorter right and my basic thing of always is yeah if you could make russian films half an hour shorter i'm more likely to watch them right i'm still not going to watch a russian film i actually like a lot of russian films so that's not a perfect analogy but the ballet if you made the ballet 10 minutes shorter and you told me it was going to be shorter i'd be like yeah i'm more interested i'm still not going to go because i fundamentally don't like the ballet and i don't understand the ballet i'm not interested in the ballet making it 10 minutes shorter is not going to do that and i think that too many of these changes are things like that wouldn't it be great if there were more sixes so yeah i don't like that thing but when they hit that thing really far how many great games are cricket there's not a six even hitting it's looking through those sorts of things and that's where these problems come about there are many problems within our sport that we could fix and instead we've got these two sides going on at all times so it needs to be more exciting nothing could ever change and so there's actually a middle ground where we can improve things and we don't do anything to do with any of that i'll give you a perfect example of this there is absolutely no reason to use the heavy roller on a qriket pitch once the test has started it is supposed to degrade i like that a lot and i was wondering if you were going to mention it there's many proponents of the theory that the roller should not be used at all just a brush and a sweep i'd be very happy if the heavy roller was no longer part of the groundsman's kit although there are occasions where the heavy roller breaks a pitch up doesn't it and actually increases uh deterioration but that's something that i think is really really interesting and so how about you know i was saying some test matches are going to be played over four days and the iconic one stay at five days fine as long as it's the same for both teams so how about on the world's really super flat pitches dubai abu dhabi how about it being an option for two teams to have as a playing condition specific for their series that we won't use any rollers it would be great it won't happen because the batsman the captains yeah yeah that's why it won't happen i could see that i could also see away teams deciding on those sorts of things as well and i think fundamentally when we're making all these changes especially when making changes to test cricket we need to work out why test cricket is still around let's say 250 years from its original invention right sort of the start of of what became three day cricket through to where we are now the reason is is it has a lot of variables that other sports can't have you could almost say it has a bunch of design flaws you wouldn't invent the stumps at the size that they are now because it doesn't make any sense you make them flat there would be certain things that you would change throughout the game but because of that what cricket should be doing is leaning into those design flaws and one of them is the fact that a basketball court doesn't deteriorate during a game right we actually have a sport where fundamentally even more than golf even the greens and golf don't change as much as that qriket pitch can let's lean into that make the fourth innings great again essentially those are the sorts of things i think we can do and it's the same with one day cricket we came up with one day cricket on a whim we didn't really think it through and we came up with the five bowlers right but essentially what that means is that scott cyrus becomes a legend of a one day cricketer because he has to bowl the fifth overs while being a top six batsman we could actually go  it we'll put a maximum of let's say 14 overs so the guys don't get overbought in a one day international so 14 overs i think is a fair maybe even 13 overs which i think they did in australian domestic qriket one year but would then will mean the best bowlers would go up against the best batsman in every game we don't need all-rounders that aren't really that good at batting or bowling there are certain things we can do within the game to improve the game and lean into the great nature of the sport instead we should do free hit wides sometimes i'm just like there are other ways of making the game better i always look at the nfl is such a ridiculous sport you do have the absolute best cornerback is going up that's all that cornerback can do is be a cornerback and he's going up against a wide receiver who can only be a wide receiver which means at that one moment you have the best quarterback and the best wide receiver out on the field one trying to catch up on one trying to stop him we can do those sorts of things with cricket because we do sort of to a certain extent in test cricket and you can still be innovative as we've already talked about with the fielding i want ben stokes and kyron pollard and martin guptill to be at long on for 10 straight overs and do incredible things without them using their energy to go back and forth across the ground little things like that we can lean into and i think that's where we should be going i like it you know i said right at the beginning that the only thing that i could find that hadn't been changed in cricket was that it's been the topic of conversation now specifically around the women's game but you mentioned the stumps that of course there used to be two stumps and one bale the beginning so everything has changed the ball has changed the one thing that i cannot find has changed is the length of the pitch and that must have been 1700s yeah because it's the length of a chain as you know there are 10 chains in a furlong and it was felt that any other material used to measure the length of a pitch might stretch or like a rope so the one thing that was consistent was a chain that's 22 yards am i right yeah i'm trying to think if there's anything else that we haven't changed i mean lbw laws have changed oh yeah yeah the way we bowl the way we play the game has obviously changed massively the bats i mean in fact the bats are the only other thing that would be almost be almost as old but if you look at the footage of the original bats they're basically hockey sticks because the balls were delivered along the ground and there's also of course at hamilton someone turned up with a bat as wide as the stumps didn't they and so they had to change the width of the bats and to be fair we've changed the laws on bats again recently with the mcc i think their ludicrous idea but their idea of the diameter of the bats players didn't always wear whites they don't always wear whites now you might have it there you might have it the length of the pitch might be the only thing because a lot of people will straight away then say oh we always play on grass and it's like we don't we haven't always played across and we don't always play on grass i don't know if you know this is an astroturf cricket ground in hong kong because they don't have that many places with actual grass so there's literally a uh playing field that is astroturf so yeah i think you might have it there i mean of course the minute we put this podcast up someone's going to come up with another one that was the idea in the comments that was the idea now just before you go you have released an audio book of your original book which i have somewhere downstairs the title of your book is the greatest south african cricketers ever now it's not called that which one did you do you've released a lot of books there's the beer drinking book the beer drinkers guide to losing weight good luck finding that one that's like twenty four yes oh have you of course i don't think i gave you one last night no i haven't already i don't know why i have it i think i might have found you know when you're in um headingly they have that great old couple that run the book selling stand i always pick like random books by my friends who it's always the books that my friends would be embarrassed that to actually uh be mentioned like the beer drinking one although i'm sure you're proud of that it's the pro tiers 20 years 20 matches it traces uh south africa's first 20 years post isolation from clive rice's uh three match to odi tour to india to the 92 world cup and it's not just 20 matches it's uh it's pretty much a history of the the first 20 years so and of course next year it'll be 30 years so i'll have to do an update but during lockdown i did two constructive things i learnt how to make cider because there was an alcohol ban for two months of our lockdown and it was more on principle really and it was totally and it hardly had any alcohol in it it was quite tasty it was like a lightly sparkling apple juice and i recorded my book and produced an audio book which which was very therapeutic i loved it every other white person in the world during lockdown came up with a podcast and you took it to an old school level of audiobook there are a lot of podcasts out

today i'm going to be doing a haul for african mall this haul is well overdue this is going to be my last winter slash fall haul i've been supposed to do this video but i'm just getting around to it like i said if you watch my last video you already know what's going on today i have body suits i have puffer coats all the perfect clothes y'all have been seeing me wear lately are from african mall i've come out it's my favorite spot to get like chill like sets or bodysuits or jackets they have the best puffer coats ever but i'm not going to remember too much you guys this is going to be like a quick little run-through video to show y'all because y'all have been asking where these pieces are from from instagram but i have to do a video on it as well so i just thought why not show y'all in the video pieces that i wore during the winter now i know the season's about to end but it's no time step on ordering pieces and usually when you order stuff off season baby it'd be on sale if you know what i mean so this is some cute little pieces to show y'all y'all know why i'm talking kind of low because it's like it's it's six a.m in the morning so if y'all wonder why my voice is kind of low and i'm not super duper late it's 5 43 so people are sleeping i don't want to be super duper loud everything will be linked in the description box below but i'm not going to rubble too much go ahead and get into the video the first thing that i got was this pink bodysuit that says roquemore it is like one of those high cut body suits that come up higher on the waist or the side or whatever i think it was really cute i just paired it with some denim jeans a orange mini bag and some air max plus i think they called vapormax and they were it's cute it's stretchy i would say go up a size because it's kind of tight fitted i got a smallerness but i think it's bomb like it serves looks and it serves its purpose you know i'm saying you can dress it up bright dark you know what i'm saying i would even see this with like some black all black with just this pop of color but yeah i thought this was super cute and super perfect like for the time and y'all know i love pink so yeah but definitely recommend this nice fabric and um [Music] hey guys so the next thing that i got was a pink bodysuit and this is one of those body suits that come with a corset which was weird about this was i got this in a medium but i also got a black one back in october they looked exactly like it and it was a small but this one didn't fit which was very strange to me because it's a medium and like why would the small fit and not the medium um but yeah y'all see me i'm struggling to put it on it just wasn't going um i thought it was cute but it wasn't really fitting how i wanted to fit and i was kind of upset about that but overall it's cute i love this look and you know i'm saying if you have like a good the corset will help disguise up we're going to get into the puffer coats and i love their puffer coats this is the best thing that you can buy from african mall their coats or like their body suits it's just this orange purple coat i love it like it fits so cute i mean i could have got a medium because it don't close but other than that i think it's a bomb coat like it fits perfect the sleeves are long enough for me i'm five one that don't have nothing to do with it but i have pretty short arms so i don't know how if you have longer arms besides that i love the quality it fits really good um and yeah i paired it uh with denim and this shirt over the weekend but i just put on sweats for the sake of the video and y'all i'll be doing the most when i'm recording next up i have a pink puffer coat that i have not worn yet but i could definitely see this with a all black and white type of look just to give a pop of color with the pink i just paired it with some leggings and my 11's but i can definitely see me dressing that up a bit more um excuse my panties y'all you know i'll be lazy doing my house but um yeah this is so bomb got this in a small it fits great so pretty it's like a barbie pink and y'all know i love pink and yeah next i have this lucky label bodysuit these come like these are i've got most of my bodysuits from them i have another one of these from somewhere else but i got this one from them i got a black one from them a white one from them every color like i love these little bodysuits they're so good to just throw on and just put on whatever and they're cute they snatch you in i also got this in a small and i love it like these are my favorite things to throw on like ever i think i have every color but gray if i'm not mistaken and i want gray so yeah i just put it on some ugg slides in a purse and this is literally how i would wear

here making the internet connections um and we'd like to welcome you to our speaker series with betty kearse on the 270th birthday of president james madison we thought it fitting to have betty talk with us about her acclaimed book the other madisons the lost history of a president's black family she's an african-american descendant of president james madison a writer and retired pediatrician living in santa fe new mexico her memoirs received very strong positive reader and editorial reviews fergus calls it the roots for a new generation um she's going to talk a little bit about her her credo always remember you're a madison you come from african slaves and president and how that is a statement of pride i've had the good fortune of knowing uh betty for a number of years i think going back almost 20 years when we first met when i worked at montpelier she was kind enough to have me involved in reading and commenting on a few chapters of her book or at least the various renditions of the book that she has been mulling around in her mind for many years and until she found her voice and it came out in her memoir and i also had the good fortune of being the staff lead for the 2007 slave descendants reunion at montpelier where she was a committee co-chair with rebecca gilmore coleman if i remember correctly we had john hope franklin and roger wilkins as our keynote address at that event significant historians of american history who are unfortunately no longer with us and there was one thing that dr franklin said in that keynote and i feel it's important to introduce um appropriate to introduce our talk i've been having his head has been bouncing around in my head for the past couple weeks thinking about this event and i got the transcription nearly 14 years ago i think his word still resonates so i quote from dr franklin and i think there are too many people that want to give you only the good news and they don't they won't talk about the bad news and i can appreciate that particularly from black kids who have had such a hard time anyway and whose road is beset with all kinds of obstacles and whatnot i can understand it but it doesn't do them any good in the long run they should know their past as you descendants of the madison family should know your past whatever it is if you don't know go dig it out and find out because that's the past you must live with and if the past is what you are not satisfied with all the more reason you and me should be inspired to do something about the present be certain that we don't repeat the past and so we shouldn't shy away from our past i don't care what it is i don't think we should i think we should face up to it whatever it is live with it otherwise it'll live with you and haunt you and distort you for all your days so i think john hope franklin in 2007 uh speaking directly to betty and and she is committed to her life and her family story and i want to thank you betty for joining us today so i think i've heard enough of me so introduce betty cares thank you thank you tom and sterling um i am really pleased to have this opportunity to share my story with the al remar charlottesville historical society the title of my talk is the other madisons in search of mandy griats women and griot's men carry forth the stories of their ancestors for thousands of years possibly before the birth of christ generations of west african griots and griots have served as human links between past and present by speaking the stories of their ancestors and the history of their people but they are more than genealogists and historians they are also storytellers teachers spokespeople exhorters interpreters advisors judges poets musicians praise singers to name just a fraction of their many functions they shape how each person sees himself in the present and in the continuum of past and future they are the social glue of society their words preserve the values and beliefs of entire cultures and when africans were stolen and enslaved they did not leave their tradition of oral history behind for many african-american families like mine this tradition is all that preserves the legacies our ancestors left for us without it i would not know that i am a descendant of the enslaved cook korean and her enslaver and half brother president james madison madison did not have any children with his wife dolly so many scholars believe he was either impotent infertile or both but the oral history of my family says that james madison jr a founding father of our nation was also a founding father of my african-american family for more than 200 years our family credo always remember you're a madison you come from african slaves and a president has been the source of inspiration and pride but it started off as a mere tool according to the history told by the eight generations of my family's american griots and griots madison became attracted to his half-sister karine and around 1794. that attraction led to the birth of a son my great great great grandfather jim shortly after the end of the war of 1812 dolly madison having learned that jim and one of her nieces were in love had just sold jim as he was being taken away korean pleaded with jim always remember you're a madison she believed the name could help them find each other someday but they never saw each other again yet jim remembered his mother's words and he passed them on to his children and told them to tell their children that they are madisons over the generations as america changed the credo changed after my enslaved ancestors by then living in texas learned that they were free they could use the name as more than just a tool to find torn the way loved ones now they could also use the name as a source of inspiration jim son emmanuel my great great grandfather taught his children to be proud that their name had come from a president and to make the most of that legacy now that they have a chance so emmanuel changed the credo to always remember you're a madison you come from a president two generations and some 40 years later emmanuel's grandson john chester my beloved gramps who was born free was proud that his father and grandfather and other enslaved ancestors had overcome enslavement gramps my family's sixth generation griot wanted his children to know that enslaved people were remarkable human beings who possessed inner strength and a sense of hope by which they survived and many talents by which they contributed mightily to america gramps added two important words african slaves the credo became always remember you're a madison you come from african slaves and a president so for the last 100 years the credo has reminded us that we aren't just descended from a president we descend from african slaves too in 1990 when my mother the seventh generation griot turned over to me the old cardboard box of family memorabilia i became the eighth generation riyadh when i asked her why now she answered in her slight text and draw i want to give you plenty of time to write the book i can probably write a book i thought about our history but i cannot be the one to hold up the family torch of pride for many years i had wondered why or even whether the credo should make me proud for me it resounded with the abuses of slavery so i decided that to become the kind of griot i hoped i could be i would confront the discomforting parts of my family's story this is my family tree and the griots and griots are shaded in you get the laser okay now you've you've just heard about karine the enslaved woman who had the relationship with james madison and who started the credo but let's go one generation back the story actually started with kareem's mother an enslaved woman called mandy mandy was my family's first african ancestor in america and our our first griot mandy told corrine who told jim who told emmanuel who told my great grandfather mac who told my grandfather john chester who told my mother rubellara who told me who told um who tells my daughter nicole and who tells her children peter and madison that she mandy was stolen from the shores near her village in ghana carried across the ocean in the bowels of a wretched ship shoved onto an auction block sold put to work on a small cotton field in a remote corner of a huge tobacco plantation and then raped by her enslaver james madison senior corrine was born through those forced encounters thus making her and the future president have siblings so this is um illustrated here in this portion of the family tree here's karine and her mother was mandy her father was james madison senior and then james madison jr's mother was nellie conway madison and his father was also james madison senior so that makes corraine and james madison junior half siblings mandy had endured all this so i believed that knowing her deeply by walking where she had walked and seeing what she had seen what helped me to become an unflinching griot who understood and had reconciled all that the credo is saying so in 1992 i began my journey of discovery of my ancestors our country and myself i traveled to lagos portugal where the trans-atlantic slave trade began to ghana west africa where mandy was born to baltimore maryland where a replica of a slave ship like the one that carried mandy away from home sits in a museum to travis and bastrop counties in central texas where my great great grandparents and their eight sons learned that they were free and to new york city where an 18th century african burial ground had recently been discovered but my journey began and ended at montpelier james madison's former plantation in virginia where mandy labored and died my travels taught me that wherever african slaves once walked history buried their footsteps at the bottom of the atlantic ocean as slave ships sailed along under a gaudy concession stand in portugal beneath a federal building near wall street among the ashes of burn documents and personal papers in courthouses and in private homes and below a brick walkway and in unmarked graves at montpelier and their footsteps disappeared into the sand along the west coast of africa as looming slave ships waited to take millions of kidnapped africans away from their homeland forever my first trip to on my first trip to montpelier i parked at the visitor center across the road and took the photo the shuttle bus through a wooded landscape when the bus rounded a curve the mansion a stately coral colored jewel set before a sweep of hovering trees came into view the moment i set foot on the soil where my ancestors had walked some 200 years earlier i felt that i belonged there with them and that they and this place would help me to become the griot i wanted to be i started off on a guided tour with a group of visitors but i asked so many questions about slavery on the plantation that the guide directed me to lynn lewis the chief archaeologist she was sun tanned and had short blonde hair and the knees of her blue jeans were stained with virginia's red soil when i told her my family story lynn said let me show you something special she took me to the rear of the mansion and pointed out a path of bare soil about three inches deep at a foot or so wide that ran between the rear entry of the mansion and an excavation site about 70 feet away when we reached the site lynn knelt down and folded back the tarp beneath it lay an open rectangle of bricks at one end of what had been the foundation of a small building shoving her hands into the pockets of her levi's and swaying back on her heels lynn said in her raspy voice this was the kitchen and that heap of bricks is what's left of the cooking hearth and the path was worn into the ground as generations of enslaved cooked walked to and from the mansions serving the madisons and their multitude of guests but what i saw was more than a hole in the ground and a heap of bricks and the path was something extraordinary my great great great great grandmother karine had walked this path i stepped into the furrow and followed the length of it a tangible and symbolic tether that it held her in bondage my eyes teared i had not expected to walk so literally in the footsteps of an ancestor there were no walls and no roof at the site now but seeing where the kitchen had stood and recalling the stories i knew so well i felt the tears flow this might have been where james madison jr became attracted to kareem and where not far away she had stood helpless while dolly sent jim away the visit was taking its toll on me but i said to lynn i really should see where my enslaved ancestors are buried not a good idea she said first of all the grave size don't have any names or dates on them and besides i would not recommend you go there in those shorts and sandals there's lots of poison ivy overwhelmed and tired by being the same place where three of my answers ancestors had been held in bondage two of them raped and one sold i was relieved not to go next time i promised next time three years later i was in ghana west africa chapter nine of the other madisons the castle begins with my favorite sentence in the whole book i'd like to read that sentence and a portion of what follows to you the blue of the african sky was the most perfect color god ever made the air was so clear and the sunlight danced so brightly off the ocean i felt as though i was standing inside a crystal where the ocean swept over the beach the soft golden sand became firm and copper colored i ventured into the water and it curled over my feet soothing away the heat of that african day i stepped back onto the dry sand and turned to watch the water gather up my wet footprints taking them into the ocean's depths disappearing westward as others had gone it was 1995 three years after my first trip to virginia and i had come to ghana with a group from my church my aim was to trace mandy's footsteps from africa to america i stood on the shore the show my shoulders hot under the powerful rays of the sun and looked up at elmena castle built by the portuguese in 1482 it stretched along the shoreline and rose out of the rocks like a white crown the series of spires and tears of walls and balconies embellished with arches and studded with cannons long canoes painted with bright colors in bold designs crowded into the small harbor alive with voices music and fish and nets flopping against the boats beautiful in spite of its history elmina ghana in the central courtyard i joined a group of visitors from distant parts of the world i was surprised when our guide in his melodic punctuated baritone informed us that the building at the center was its square facade and square windows was a church the first catholic church in sub-saharan africa but when the porch the the protestant dutch took over in 1637 they refused to worship in a catholic church and began to use the building to buy and sell goods and slaves in the system of dark tunnels and dungeons below the church thousands upon thousands of africans had been chained together imprisoned shoulder to shoulder then weeks later herded like cattle onto ships that would carry them to enslavement in the new world near the church there was a tiny cell set aside for condemned slaves most often men who had resisted their captivity there was only a handful of us on the tour but when the heavy door slams shut behind us enclosing us in utter darkness i felt crushed among hundreds of bodies the sound of each person's breath echoed hollow in the tight room in the dark our tour guide revealed what had happened here 12 or 14 men at a time he said and almost a whisper were whipped bludgeoned and shackled and then dragged into this cell the door was locked no food no water every few days the guards would look through a small opening to check the condition of the prisoners still no food and no water the guards came back until one by one every prisoner was dead our docents rhythmic voice was like a hymn of mourning wafting from the church across the courtyard on the other side of the courtyard there had been a holding area for female captives the guide pointed up to a balcony and told us of a tradition at el mina because there were a few european prostitutes in africa when a white man wanted a woman he chose one of the female captives the dutch governor of elmina had first choice he would order his soldiers to bring a group of prospects to the area of the courtyard below his living quarters he would step out onto his balcony survey the women below and then point to the one he wanted with everyone looking on the guards dunked her again and again and again into the city of water at the center of the courtyard until she was clean enough for the governor to touch then the guards pushed and prodded the woman up a narrow stairway and threw a trap door that led directly into the governor's bedroom above the trap door was then closed and locked it was the 20th century and i had come to el mina on my own accord but as i stood in the courtyard i could not help but envision myself a score of captive african women huddled together under the governor's gaze we were all thin and weak following days of hunger and thirst but our bodies were tall or petite narrow hipped or broad our breasts were small full erect or flaccid our faces were round or slender our foreheads low or high our cheeks were smooth or etched with tribal markings some of us cried some frowned others cowered and trembled some of us tried to hide our nakedness others knew that trying to hide was useless in my imagination we had short cropped hair or rows of braids or intricate hair designs interlaced with beads our beads were yellow or orange or blue or green or like mandy's our beads were red in reality i was a free american woman but the anguish the fear the sense of loss the sorrow all lodged in my chest when it came time to board the ship the women who had survived were led through an interconnecting series of rooms until they reached the one that offered the only sunlight many had seen for weeks blinded by the light the women entered a narrow gated egress that led out to the beach they intensely blue sky draped their heads but maybe the women glimpsed loved ones as their uh eyes adjusted to the brightness they had walked through stumbled through crawled through or fallen through the gate of no return beyond it they could feel something familiar under their feet african sand but only moments later that sensation was lost forever the ocean wiped away their footprints when i returned to montpelier five years after my first visit lynn lewis was at an excavation site so i waited on the front portico though the april weather in the foothills of virginia's blue ridge mountains had been erratic on the day of my return the sky was blue and clear and the sun was just beginning to warm the morning air the distant densely forested mountains that spread out before me were blue almost purple and so wide they wrapped around the horizon spring here i thought was alluring with its promise of warmth and sense of awakening but montpelier had been a prison once scores of slaves cabins lay south of imagine and i pictured them scattered low on the hillside leaning perilously their weathered roofs slowly giving way to the pull of the dusty earth succumbing to the forces of the land and i pictured enslaved people diminutive in the distant fields their labor coaxing riches from the soil making possible the madison legacy i went to the back of the mansion hoping to step again into the furrow where karine had walked where together she and i had followed a visible dusty red path through landscape that once held black human beings hostage the path was gone a brick walkway now covered korean's footsteps burying my physical connection to my enslaved ancestor i felt alone and lost lynn found me wondering aimlessly sorry to keep you waiting she said no problem i murmured i did not mention corrine's varied footsteps silently we headed toward slave cemetery scattered pebbles on the dirt road glistened in the morning sunlight and wide meadows speckled with young daffodils sloped green and bold but as len and i walked from the mansion i grew more and more afraid i would see an isolated patch of dry dirt with clusters of dandelions and poison ivy a place where enslaved individuals in death as in life had been dishonored burst of when may the trees shudder i huddled into my jacket i'm sure at least one of my ancestors lies buried here i said trying to reconnect to them lynn and i walked toward a low hill that rose behind a cluster of trees a moment later lynn said this is it the field of bright blue periwinkles took me by surprise we stepped off the dirt road and entered the small woods blanketed with fallen leaves and cradling the hidden remains the ground was soft underfoot it's because of these periwinkles lynn said gesturing towards the perky flowers that we know this is a burial ground back then folks in the south planted them to pretty up cemeteries then under the leaves we found linear depressions all oriented east to west where the graves had sunk a little and last winter there was an early thaw the only snow left was in the depressions it was eerie and beautiful lynn guided me further in careful we did not kick the headstones and footstones which were crude blocks of white quartz we stood in a kingdom of many trees but only one of them called to me i approached it reverent the trunk was broad the thick branches pregnant with pale leaf buds nestled at the base was a stone the color of raw flesh its uneven surface shiny and smooth the stories passed down through my mother had set me on the path that led to this very spot i knelt down and touched the rock and i envisioned my family's first griot lying beneath wrapped in white muslin a single red bead in the palm of her hand the gentle morning sun was warm on my back countering the chill in the air and my shadow fell over the rock uniting me with my family's matriarch my five great grandmother mandy's hands sold and reaped the riches of southern soil for someone else mandy's womb gave birth to generations of descendants her own riches and mandy's heart gave those descendants the ability to believe in themselves so that they could become farmers carpenters teachers civic leaders entrepreneurs lawyers dentists doctors nurses social workers engineers homemakers writers psychologists ministers railroad porters musicians artists and much much more in the seven years since receiving the box from my mother i had struggled to understand why or even whether the credo should make me proud but i had become a griot who will not let her footsteps be buried and i believe that through the book i have written i found a way to make the world pay attention to mandy i will always remember i'm a madison and that i come from a president madison did great things for the nation i love but it is mandy a stolen and enslaved woman who was my inspiration it is mandy who makes me proud i looked up from the stone and i said to lynn with absolute confidence i have found mandy thank you thank you betty that was great yes indeed really really appreciate that um thank you it would be a great uh video to uh offer to the public thank you mary hi daddy good to see you and congratulations i don't see you but i see your name so it's good to see your name oh hi mary are you still in philadelphia yes we're still here in new town square pennsylvania oh the wrong city okay got the right state right right right outside of philadelphia oh okay nice to see you this is great but uh what what a story and the history for for no matter what the race did see this to see that and grasp and feel the history of going from ghana to across the ocean oh it's amazing it's amazing and the last the snow in the indentations oh that got me yes isn't that an amazing image oh gosh that's something yeah yeah well thank you for doing this it's very much appreciated and i wish young people watching this so they have a sense that we're survivors we're from we are survivors we're from survivors and that's that's that gives you strength i'll let someone else talk now it's just so great thank you very much uh miss lightfoot i really appreciate you uh that's and i was mentioning to betty before we started that we don't webinar we have the meetings in so it allows you know people to contribute and it's almost as if we're able to kind of be together and kind of at least a zoom way if we can't be together um in person and i love that interaction thank you very much um looking for some questions here uh one question that popped up uh are you continuing your genealogical research um betty i am i'm on a hiatus right now because book promotion is a full-time job i'm not able to do much of anything else i'm not even writing which is a true love but i will um you know maybe toward the end of the year i'll be able to get back to it um yes shelley asked with your book and i guess just your research if you could talk a little bit about any resistance that you have received from any madison's and i'm assuming questions she's asking for the white family madison well i i have met um descendants of of madison sisters who have been two women in particular who've been very supportive and call me cousin and in terms of resistance it's just more lack of not being willing to help me you know no one has forth and been mean to me at all or nasty in fact people are very cordial but there are people that i know could help me but just won't and there's a follow-up there also with uh in terms of montpelier their response to your work i know at least from my vantage point when i was at montpelier and i learned of your oral history your family's history is um it was mind opening in terms of understanding what could be carry forward from one person to the next in that tradition that would inform us you know i'm came from an archaeology background and so i definitely infuse my history with that and very much word is history but but what do you have anything to say in terms of how montpelier has responded to this montpelier holds a special place in my heart um i started going there in 1992 and that's when i met lynn lewis and a few other people and i have gone back uh many times not as many as i'd like because of the distance which has actually gotten worse now that i've moved to new mexico but i've gone back quite a few times and i've met a number of different people as as the staff has changed or expanded and every single one of them has been welcoming and supportive and have done that has done everything they could to help me uh with my research and it's in the book in the acknowledgements you know i have thanked them on paper officially in my book um there's one question here um from david do you know what your gem was separated from korean i think you mentioned that was 1820s well it was after the war of 1812 so it's probably i'm let's say maybe 1815 i don't know exactly but approximately then and leontyne asked if you know of any other um children that were uh by the madison with enslaved um enslaved women oh if whether or not mattis do i know whether or not madison himself had other children is that the question the question do you know if madison fathered any other children with enslaved right so that that is the question um i i don't know but i i wouldn't be surprised and uh i've always had an interest in i know the the oral history and very much um that you in terms of your family but also from your your background as a doctor uh as a scientist as studying genetics um has it bothered you in a way that you haven't been able to make that genetic connection yet or is that still just something that is a part of the search um it it would it doesn't really bother me it would kind of complete the story to maybe add to the story but you know i've grown up with this with this family history and so i i don't for my for myself need to have dna proof has there been any um i know from our work in 2007 with the union and some of the work that was done there has there been any uh steps forward in that direction in terms of being able to have more access on that regards through the male descendants to the white male medicines disgusting yes yeah uh no no i've been caught i mean i think um i have heard from a few that have offered to this but i was working with um dr bruce jackson for a number of years he has now passed away but he cautioned me again and again to make sure the genealogy of who at whomever uh you know you received receive any kind of specimens that make sure that their genealogy is impeccable and so he has passed away and i have i've not been able to do you know do that yet i'm sorry to hear that i wasn't aware that he had passed yeah he passed suddenly maybe about three or four years ago oh because he was not that old no no he he suffered a heart attack yeah but you you met him at montpelier when he yes yeah he participated in the reunion now it was a great part of the conversation and the event we had that weekend uh understanding the the genetics and the dna behind those connections um this one another question from adonya how did it make you feel to learn your connection to the madison family so young age really okay you kind of broke up at the very end the first part was how does it make you feel okay then i sorry to learn that you were your connection to the madison family okay how did it make me feel to learn of my connection to the madison family well i first started hearing about this connection was about five years old and so um i just thought when my mother reminded me that i was in madison and you know she was just trying to get me to behave off to a very high standard uh so i that was my initial feeling about it but as you know as i got older um i you know i began to question how that connection had happened what did it mean what did it reflect about the times and so as i as i stated in my presentation you know for me it you know it spoke to one of the abuses and in my mind probably the the worst of the abuses of slavery there's a question in regards to how montpelier has changed its presentation tours uh to reflect its slave heritage i think uh you know that might be some fodder for christian um to talk with you about on thursday uh your distinction of color exhibit that he was very instrumental in putting together but um i know that there's very a very strong component to what montpelier is doing now that is pulling directly from the descendants um that was something we were involved in in 2007 but even before um so uh yeah i think they've made some great strides there yeah i feel as though montpelier is truly committed to um understanding the role enslaved people played at montpelier um the importance to madison's life and um its effect on the constitution and you know even you know it's its effect today do you have a question mr wilms i saw your hand raised there i do thank you um it's a wonderful presentation i just i can't tell you how much i appreciated it um clear to the point the visuals were wonderful wonderfully awful but wonderful um i i i spent a number of years doing i just finished a book on the los angeles police department and the and the neighborhoods around the south side so i became interested in this whole subject we moved from los angeles to asheville a couple of years ago and i became really interested to understand better how slavery really broke the culture of a people and that you now see evidence of it still on the streets of south l.a so that was the beginning and then i ran into who should be speaking for themselves uh miranda burnett and martin violet who are doing this work at um at highlands you know the um what's his uh the president monroe's place and i'm utterly fascinated with what they're doing and i'm gonna go visit them in a week or two to um see the issues that we share one of them is that my fourth great uncle was the guy who did the brokering of the slaves from monroe to his his place in florida he was building this casa casa bianca it's not a very exciting background to be looking at but it gives me a perspective i think to say holy jesus we are really in this deeply in a very very negative way and what do i make of it all and so i'm going to go up there and spend some time in a couple weeks and meet with martin but i'm i'm curious are you are you taking your work forward into contemporary society i haven't read your book i will does it does it go into contemporary society about the the scars that are left it does not um but the documentary film based on my book that was just recently exactly going to premiere on thursday at the first amendment museum but that begins not to talk so much about the scars but to talk about um the fights you know the struggles i i don't see that as the same thing as scars no no okay so it talks more about the the struggles and touches on black lives matter movements and current okay good well i'll order your book and look forward to reading it thank you so much my pleasure please definitely uh betty was talking to us a little bit before we started up about uh you know the the in-person aspect of of getting to talk about your book and wanting to try to sell some more the the virtual aspect of doing these book tours kind of takes that away so please check out amazon or any of your local bookstores to buy the other madisons and yes there is a trailer i saw something flash up on the screen is there a trailer and i think the easiest way to get to it is to my website which is the othermadisons.com where bettycares.com it goes the same place but the other madison.com is easier and then there's a a tab a page that says film and then if you click on film then the link you'll see the link just it's it's only about one minute and 46 seconds so it's really short the film is about 37 38 minutes yeah and christian is uh chat bombing our uh our conversation here he's re-posted your uh uh his website with the link to their page um screening uh the premiere oh the first amendment music okay great yeah you can see the whole thing uh on thursday yeah we joined with eduardo who's the director what's i guess what would be the most important thing you want people to take away from your book well quoting my grandfather that enslaved people were remarkable individuals who possessed inner strength and a sense of hope and they also had many talents and but i like to take it a little bit further and that is to say that when slaves died those gifts did not die with them and they were passed on to those of us alive today and so i would like to encourage um african-americans today especially our young people to embrace our slave ancestry and to grab onto and nurture our own inner strengths and talents so that you know that we believe in ourselves and make contributions that's the most important message well thank you betty um miss white i see a raised hand is there a question or is it just uh you know given us for what betty's been talking about no okay um a couple of folks mentioned by local here new dominion bookstore you can purchase the book um and i believe also it is also available at montpelier um they are open i would check their website to see when they are open you can find the book their bookstore um well i think i see that's kind of wrapping up the questions um i guess one more um in terms of the unique aspect of your story and the ability for your family to carry that oral history forward have you found in your research and your journeys that that is pretty unique in terms of the african-american experience or have you found others who have similar background who have maintained the great grill tradition um you know i i think it's becoming stronger and stronger you know there may be some catching up to do my i mean i have been very blessed to have had this tradition go on for some eight generations but i think that more and more african american families are starting tradition and moving forward and my word of advice about that is to you know save everything in a special places like in my case it was a box but very it's very important to have one person in each generation be in charge of the stories and whatever um artifacts you know memorabilia and then that person should appoint some body and train them in the next generation and then make sure it gets perpetuated from one generation to the next otherwise it gets it's in danger of getting lost within the generation of the person who is now starting to build the oral history well i think your book um is a definite a perfect example of how to uh to tell that story or at least the as your mom put that upon you to say you you need to write this book and that helps not only with your history i feel but also as an example to others so i think that's a very important part of it well i want to thank you betty this has been a great privilege to have you join us um and uh everyone got some clapping out there and some people holding up your books so if you want to see the movie definitely look to the links in the comments and the chat to check out first amendment museum my buddy up there christian coates who's known betty is about maybe as long if not longer than i have with work at montpelier and uh thank you all for joining us tonight uh remember uh these uh presentations these speakers series our

another video so in this video i'm just going to be showing you all how i achieved this eye look so without wasting any more time let's just get into it i look so angry right now i don't know what's up with me but yeah i'm just gonna space my eyelids using my lego pro concealer in this shade yellow and then i'm just gonna put some tape on the side as you can see because i want this look to look sharp you know like on the edges i'm just using your regular regular tape and then i'm going to be using this eyeshadow palette from azure cosmetics it is called the summer palette and i'm going to be going into that orange shade of the day that's going to be my transition shade and to apply my eyeshadow i'm using my real techniques i think this brush is called a deluxe no it's called a base shadow brush yeah from a real techniques and i'm just going to pack and blend pack and blend pack and blend and then i'm going to go over that shade with this orange shade to just you know make a pop just a little bit and using the same brush same motion pack and blend pack and blend then i'm just going to dust some excess walls so i can just blend out my transition you know to get rid of you know that harsh line at the top between the beginning of my transition and my brow and then i'm gonna go into my crease shade i guess or i don't know like how to refer to the shade to be honest but you gonna see what i mean so i'm gonna use that brown over there and you know i'm gonna mix it up just a little bit you know blend it blend i'm still using another it's a it's called a dome shadow brush if i'm not mistaken like most of my brushes you all like the names and stuff have like rubbed off because like i have like only a few brushes so i'll be washing these brushes every other day the brush i'm using now is my smudge brush well i remember this one because like this is my favorite one like i like even how it looks and then to cut out my crease i'm going to be using my real techniques detailer brush and i'm going to cut out using my la gopro concealer the same shade i used to prep my lids it's in the shade yellow and i'm just going to go in you know work my way all over my crease nice and slow because we ain't going nowhere like i could slap down and stuff so ain't no rush then i'm gonna get rid of some excess and what this does yo it just helps to make it easy to blend my eyeshadow that's on my crease and the eyeshadow that's on my outer corner since i'm not doing like a full cut crease so just removing like a lot of concealer at the edge just makes it easier then i'm going to use those two shades and pack it all up back back pack using my detailer brush again to blend it in i'm using my smudge brush my favorite i love the way this brush looks y'all like i love the way it looks like i'm not even a fan of blue but like this brush like it looks cute so yeah that's why i remember the name of this brush specifically so i'm just going to blend that in blend it in and blend blend blend until you can blend no morses using an old eyeliner brush tip whatever dipping whatever you call this like applicator i think yeah i think that's what it's called i don't know but you can see what i'm talking about i'm just gonna apply some glue and the glue i'm using is the same clue i used to apply my lashes which is the dual glue from mac and i'm just gonna run it you know where the how can i explain this yo i'm so terrible at explaining y'all like i'm terrible but i'm just gonna run it like with the cut crease meets the brown i guess like yeah but you can see what i'm talking about like you can see why are you making a noise using this eyeliner from essence i'm just gonna line and wing this look like i put some tape like i said in the beginning to make this look sharp yo and this also helps not only like with your eyeshadow but your wing as well like if you want your wing to be sharp and like you know like paper cut type of stuff then you're gonna have to put some tape on it my face makeup is pretty simple guys i do the least like i do the least so everything is really simple you can just tell like there's no method to be honest to this like ain't no trusting the process or anything like that when it comes to my face like i ain't even gonna play with y'all i'm not even gonna waste your time like that to be honest so as i wait for you know my setting spray to dry up because i really went to river jordan with that one because like you can just see y'all like it's like i look like i just got baptized i'm not someone who's really fond of lipsticks but for the sake of this look you know like i'm gonna make an exception yo like i'm not nigerian guys i'm actually south african but i'm african okay and that's all that matters i'm african i'm black i'm proud oh girl i'm gonna take you to lagos right now and by the way y'all i actually have an alter ego and her name is adama so yeah like she came through in this look to be honest like she ain't

hot glue right now it was my little gun right here and after that i am going to be mailing in these old little nails that came with our result chair so enjoy while the glow is not ready for us we you this is my first time using hot glue to reupholster I've been using my nail gun lately but it's been giving me some problems so I decided to go this way the hot glue is just going to set the fabric in place and the nails will make sure it doesn't go anywhere so since I'm reinforcing the fabric with old nails anyways I figure the glue will hold for now you it's important to stretch the fabric but not stretch it too much because people are still going to be sitting on this chair you don't want it to feel like you were in something really tight and fragile on the other hand you don't want wrinkles when you're reupholstery so what I did with this chair after I stripped it I found a lot of real real old fabric and sponge and it's falling apart in my room is filled with this orange stuff so what I did is cut old curtains and I just lay them over these blue guys I nailed I put a couple of nails end so keep it in place and now when I put the fabric on top it's going to be held together better and hopefully it will look fresh and new you Franz is going to be a little more tricky see if you can see this is a close-up and the front piece is going to come over to cover this so I'm not worried about this right now but what I have to do is make sure the fabric ends here and folds nicely and then goes over and covers all the way down here so I need to make a lot of really precise cuts what I'm going to do is put a lot of little points of glue and stabilize the fabric and then I will cut it with this super-awesome box cutter you", "oX6rbX4ItH8": "Hi crafters and welcome back\nto another crafternoon! My name is Tara and I work for the Ottawa Public Library.\nToday I'm really excited to be here to share another amazing art project with\nyou. Are you ready? Let's get started.\nActivate your creative mind, warm up your fingers\nand if you think you might need some help with some of the steps of this\nproject don't be shy to ask an adult. Today we\nare going to take a look at the wilds of Africa to create our very own\nsunset on the Savannah. Stick around for a list of items you're\ngoing to need to complete this beautiful sunset scene. To create your very own spectacular\nAfrican sunset on the Savannah you are going to\nneed a sheet of white paper. Now because we're going to be using\npaints today if you have a thicker type of paper that might work\na little bit better, so something like cardstock, watercolor\npaper or even Bristol board would work well.\nIf you're using Bristol board make sure you don't use the shiny side.\nUse the side that's less shiny because it will absorb the paint much better.\nIf you don't have any of these thicker types of papers at home\nthat is okay you can always use a regular sheet of printer paper.\nYou will also need a pencil, an eraser, a pencil sharpener,\na dark colored marker like black or brown or even a dark purple would\nwork well. Because we're using paints we'll also\nneed either a paint brush or you can cut\na little piece of sponge and that works really well as well. You'll need a jug of water and some\nwatercolor paints or if you don't have any watercolor\npaints stick around because i'm going to explain how you can make some paints\nwith the help of a grown-up using things that you have at home. You may also want to have some paper\ntowel on hand and because we may be diluting some of\nthe paints to make them a little bit lighter\nyou may also want to have some mixing trays so plastic lids\nor styrofoam trays work really well for that purpose.\nFor the very end we may want to frame our artwork\nbecause you've put so much time and effort into it\nso you'll need a glue stick and a sheet of colored construction paper. I mentioned earlier that if you don't\nhappen to have any watercolor paints at your home\nyou can ask a grown-up to help you make some paints using things that you have\nat home. The reason you'll need to ask a grown-up\nis because we'll be using teas and coffees to create your paints,\nand to make tea and coffee you normally need to use\nboiling water. So this one over here is coffee\nthis is Mandarin Orange Spice herbal tea, this is a green tea which has\ncreated kind of a golden yellow color this is regular Orange Pekoe tea,\nand this is a raspberry tea that has created a really nice ruby red color.\nSo you can create some really nice sunset colors\nusing teas and coffees at home. But please ask a grown-up to help you\nmake your little paints and let them cool down before you start\nto use them. For step one of our African sunset scene\nwe're going to be using our pencil and you may also want to have your\neraser and your pencil sharpener nearby. We're going to begin by creating the\nground so you can have a nice straight ground\nor you may prefer having a few little hills. So simply draw a line from one side of\nthe page to the other side towards the bottom\nso that you have a lot of room to make your sunset.\nNow the African Savannah is a grassland and there are a few trees on the\nSavannah as well the most common type of tree is called a\nBaobab tree or an Acacia tree.\nThese trees are very sprawled out and most of the leaves are at the top.\nSo i'm going to draw one so you can see what it looks like but i'm sure that\nyou've seen them on TV before. Hmm\nwhere should i draw my Baobab tree? I think right here on the hill looks like\na nice place. Now the branches of the Baobab tree are\nquite wide so i'm going to make several\nreaching up to the top. You want to make sure that you draw the\nlines dark enough so that once we've painted over this\nsky area you'll still be able to see the lines afterwards.\nSo now that I've drawn the trunk and the branches i'm going to add a few leaves\nat the top. So the leaves we don't have to draw each\nsingle leaf we can just kind of make little bunches of leaves like this. They kind of look like clouds a little\nbit. There we go my Baobab tree is finished.\nNow the other thing that we can find in the African\nSavannah are animals. So the animals that live in the Savannah\nare many: there are rhinoceros lions gazelles\nzebras giraffes elephants this one's pretty tiny he must\nbe a baby cheetahs and other wild cats.\nFor this next step you're going to want to choose a few animals to draw.\nYou could choose one two three three is probably a good number because\nwe don't want them to be too crowded in the page.\nSo i would pick between one and three, if you want to draw the same\nanimal maybe a family of the same animals\nthat's fine, or you can do different animals.\nYou can always just choose to draw one animal and that's fine\nas well. So I wonder which animal I should choose.\nHmm I do like giraffes maybe I'll draw a giraffe and maybe an\nelephant. Now if you happen to have little plastic\nanimals like this at home you might want to get them out so that\nyou can use them as an inspiration. If you don't have any animals like this\nat home maybe you have some picture books you can look at\nto get some ideas or you can go online and do a search\nfor African animals. Now that I've chosen which animals i'm\ngoing to be including in my sunset on the Savannah artwork\nI'm going to start drawing them. So we're not going to be drawing all the details\nso i won't be drawing any of the spots on the giraffe\nor any of the parts of the face only the contour. So we're just going to\ndraw the silhouette of each animal.\nOkay? So I'm going to be drawing for my artwork I'm going to draw a\nlittle elephant over here and a larger giraffe over here that's\ngoing to be reaching up to the leaves up here on the tree. When you draw your animals make sure you\nstart them on this line because eventually this\nground is going to be colored in entirely in\nblack as well as the tree and the animals\nthemselves are going to be colored in black or a dark color like brown. The\nrest of the sky is where the sunset magic is going to\nhappen. So I'm going to begin with the elephant\nand I'm going to be drawing him right here close to the tree.\nSo if you have a little plastic animal that you want to use\nas a guide you can keep that close where you can see it\nor if you have some picture books that you want to open up to a certain page\nor maybe you have animals on a computer screen that you've done a search for\nyou can keep them close by as well. If you're not able to find\nany images, just try to use your imagination\nand draw your animal as best as you can. Now i'm going to move on to the giraffe. Now that we've finished drawing the\nground the Baobab tree and the animal silhouettes it's now time\nto do some painting. We're going to be painting a beautiful\nsunset in the background here where the sky is. So at this point\nyou can get out your watercolors if you have some\nand if you have watercolors then you're also going to need\nyour container with water and some kind of a tray or a lid to dilute your\npaint in. You may also want to have some paper towel on hand. Now if you're\nnot using watercolor paints and you've made your own paints using\ntea or coffee this is the time to get them out. If you're going to be using your own\npaints that you've made at home with tea or coffee the paint is already\ndiluted enough you won't have to add any water to it.\nThe only paints you'll have to use water with\nare the watercolor paints. So now we can get out a brush, paint\nbrush or if you have a little piece of sponge\nthis also works really well for this step of the project.\nI'm going to show you how we can use both of them so that\nyou can see how it's done. So for my sunset I've chosen\nsome warmer colors I'm going to be using some reds and some oranges\nand some yellows. You can add some purples\nwhatever colors you like that you think would look nice in a sunset.\nBut these are the colors that I'm going to be using.\nSo at this point I'll show you how it works with a sponge. I'm going to take my\nsponge and I'm going to dip it in this water\nand squeeze it out a bit but I want to make sure that there's a good amount of\nwater on here. Then I'm going to take the sponge over\nto hmm I think I'll start with the red and I'm\ngoing to put the sponge in the little\npalette of red paint and rub it around so that I get lots of\nred paint on my sponge okay? Now I'm going to dip this in the water\nagain just to dilute it a little bit so that\nit's not full strength. And then I'm going to\nput a little bit on this mixing tray. Okay\nas you can see the paint has lightened a little bit with a bit of extra water on\nit. So now I think I'm going to start at the\ntop of the sky with a strip of red. So you don't have to\nworry about going inside the tree we're just going to\ncover this entire area with sunset colors you don't have to\nworry about trying to stay out of this area\nwhere you've drawn. So we'll start in the corner\nand I'm going to draw my paint all the way to the other side.\nOkay? So as you can see it's not a full vibrant deep red it's kind of a lighter\nred and that's sort of what a sunset looks\nlike. If you feel that that color is a little bit too\nlight you can always go over it one more time by dipping your sponge\nback in the paint that's on your palette and adding a second coat to it.\nLike this. As you can see that color is now much\ndarker. We're going to move on to our next color\nso i think i'm going to go on now to a dark orange\nand I'll show you how that's done with a paintbrush\ninstead of the sponge. So you'll take your paintbrush\nand you can dip it in the water make sure it gets nice and wet,\npick your color I'm going to be choosing this orange here\nand I'm going to make sure that I get a good amount of orange\npigment from this little paint. Now this color will be fairly strong so what I'm\ngoing to do once it's on the paintbrush is I'm going\nto try and take some of it off here on this lid\nand I'm going to dip my paint brush back in the water\nand add some water to it just to dilute the color a little bit and make it a\nlittle bit lighter. You can mix it up nicely and\nI think we're ready to do our next layer of the sunset.\nSo starting again at the edge of the page we're going to draw\nour paintbrush from one side to the other. Okay now I want my orange to be a little\nbit more intense so I'm going to do that one more\ntime and I'm also going to bring the orange\na little bit further down. So I'll go over what I've just done a\nsecond time and then I'll do a second layer of\norange just underneath. And I'll go over it one more time\nwith a little bit more orange paint. Here we go we're ready for our next\ncolor. So that's how you would do it with a paintbrush. I'm going to continue with\nthe paintbrush and I think I'll move on to a lighter\norange I think I'll use this one now so once\nagain I'll rub my paintbrush around in the paint palette and make sure that I get lots of that\ncolor pigment on the brush. Great now if you still have paint on\nyour lid you can always use another cleaner lid to do your next color and add some water\nagain mixing it up nicely that looks great!\nOkay I'm ready to do my next layer of sunset\nit's coming along nicely. Oh that's a nice color\nlooks like a tangerine or something. I'm gonna bring it down a little bit\nfurther so i'll add a second layer just below it. That's starting to look really nice I\nthink. Okay! Okay we've been using\nour watercolor paints so far for this sunset but now I just want to show you\nwhat you would be doing if you were using your own homemade\npaints that you had made with tea and coffee. Remember always to ask an\nadult for help if you are making your own paints. So\nthis particular paint is steeped Orange\nPekoe tea and it's cooled down so it's safe to use now.\nYou're not going to need a jug of water because this paint is already diluted\nenough which means it's light enough already to\nadd directly to the page. So you could do this with a\npaintbrush or a sponge it's up to you I'm going to switch back\nto the sponge just to show you how that's done again.\nSo I'll dip my sponge in this tea I'm going to squeeze it out because we\ndon't want our page to be too wet because then it\nwill take too long to dry and I'm going to do like we've been\ndoing dragging the sponge across the page.\nYou'll notice that these colors are much lighter\nso you may have to do several layers. I think I'd like mine just a little bit\ndarker so I'm going to add a few more coats of\nthis paint without making it too wet.\nSo make sure you squeeze it out well enough so there's not\ntoo much wetness or dampness. Okay that's looking really nice\nso now we're going to let all of our sunset\ndry and then we'll be ready to add the black part of our artwork with\nour colored markers. Now that we've finished painting our\nbeautiful sunset you want to make sure that you take a\nbreak and let it dry thoroughly. Once it's thoroughly dry you\ncan move on to the next step and we'll be needing\na dark colored marker such as black but I also mentioned\nthat brown or even a dark purple will work nicely.\nThe first thing to do will be to trace over all of the little pencil lines that\nyou made earlier with your black or your dark marker. Once\nthat's finished we're going to color all of those areas\nin. So when this is finished the tree the animals and the ground\nwill all be black and this will create a really amazing\nsunset effect. Are you ready? Let's get started. All right we are almost finished. Now\nthat we've colored in all of the sections in black with our black marker\nor a dark marker, all we need to do is add a nice frame.\nYou don't have to but if you want to you can. So for this\nstep you'll need a glue stick and a sheet of colored\nconstruction paper. Now I've decided that I like mine with a\nblack border. So that's what I'm going to use but you\ncan use whatever color you like. So we're going to flip over\nour artwork apply some glue and then we'll flip it over center it\nnicely press it down and then we will have a\nnice frame for our African sunset\non the Savannah. I hope you enjoyed this. I had a lot of fun.\nOkay that should do it. I'm going to flip my artwork over\ncenter it nicely on my construction paper\npress it down nicely and there you have it it's ready to be\nhung on the wall. Well I really want to thank you for\njoining me today for another crafternoon art activity.\nI hope you enjoyed learning how to create your very own\nsunset on the Savannah and that you're happy with the results.\nIt's already time to say goodbye but I'll be back again next week with\nanother artistic adventure. If you liked what we did today don't\nforget to like this video and I also invite you to subscribe to\nour Ottawa Public Library YouTube channel.\nThat way you'll be notified whenever we have new content that's been uploaded.\nRight now we also have an online summer camp happening.\nIt's called Summerland and there's an amazing schedule of wonderful presenters\nactivities and programs happening. All you have to do\nis go to biblioottawalibrary.ca That's the library's website and find\nthe link for Summerland that way you'll have access to all these\namazing programs. I'll see you again soon for another\ncrafternoon! Bye now!", "EeFVkunMZQg": "hi guys and welcome to another episode in the kitchen with my burnt orange today we are using west african techniques and ingredients to make a vegan ravioli stay tuned first off measure up some flour i'm using half a cup of plain flour and half a cup of samola flour so we're just going to mix it up real quick and you know what to make it fun i'm using hibiscus and for added softness 2 tablespoons of olive oil i love purple hibiscus but it's not necessary i just love working with greens and purples and that's why i'm doing it feel free to or not so you're just going to mix up your flower and then begin kneading it takes a little bit of patience but it's all going to come together if you find that it's too dry just put a little bit of water i used about half a cup of moisture and i just added it gradually until i got the consistency i felt was right now that it's kneaded wrap up your dough in some cling film and allow it to rest for several hours this will make the pressing and rolling of the dough much easier the next thing we're doing is tapping into west african knowledge now in west africa nigeria ghana gabon other places we have these pumpkin seeds or melon seeds known as agushi for all of you out there an easy substitute is your regular green pumpkin seeds to this i'm adding hemp seeds just because i've come across this ingredient recently and i love it i love using it in tabouleh for making a keto version mix it up and whiz it into a powder in a in a spice grinder or a blender the way a goosey is used in west africa it comes in a variety of ways but one of the most common ways is to use the powder to make a paste and then stew it up where it begins to look like scrambled eggs and it's the most lusciously soft and amazing texture that is added to stews in other methods it's actually mixed up and spiced up with different flavorings and then steamed like moin moin and this is a common practice in gabon and cameroon but today we are going to use this knowledge we have of egusi to make a vegan ravioli now a goosey must be cooked so what i'm going to do right now is quickly steam it in a microwave feel free to um heat this up in in a pot and with rav as with ravioli i'm going to add the flavorings i'm just adding some lemon zest i made from the other day it looks a little bit dry but it's still good i'm also going to add a little bit of salt but not too much i'm just going to gently build up the flavors of this vegan ravioli filling you know under normal circumstances we'd be using ricotta adding loads of lemon zest and lemon juice to make it tangy so i'm doing the same here just popping out the seed and we're going to mix this up season it ever so gently and then do something i like to call an aflata which is to slightly cook it because we want to make sure the egg egusi is cooked before we put it into the pasta pockets and over here i've done that i've simply just heated it up gradually in the microwave for a couple of minutes a goosey can take a lot of water so feel free to add a little bit more moisture next thing i'm going to go in and get some fresh herbs in my makeshift garden we're using 100 west african ingredients so these are scent leaves which are an actual relative to [Music] somewhere between mint and basil and whilst i'm out here i'm just appreciating my sweet potato leaves they make a lovely stew back in the kitchen i'm just gonna chop up the herbs and then add them to our vegan ravioli filling which is the egusi let's just call it a goosey that's what it is isn't it west african inspirations right here we learn a lot from the way we cook in other countries i did not add too much flavor here just a little bit of salt the herbs freshly cracked pepper and you know once you mix it up with the herbs it's actually ready for the filling stage into the pasta ravioli pockets if you have a pasta maker here comes the fun if you don't you can do this with a regular rolling pin now i've made pasta over the years with a rolling pin and that was perfectly fine for me i've recently acquired an actual pasta maker and this is my very very first time using it it took some getting used to but it's pretty stripped and easy all you have to do is exercise a little patience use a little bit of flour to prevent sticking and i recommend going from setting zero up to four maximum because i was overzealous at the beginning and made my pasta sheets too thin they were not usable at all but guys it's just a matter of following the instructions on your manufacturer's handbook and this was relatively easy it fits on any counter guys if you are interested in getting your own pasta maker this was relatively inexpensive on amazon i have included an affiliate link in the comments so that you can check it out for yourself no pressure guys and we're ready for the next step as you can see this process is quite user friendly you only need regular kitchen tools to do this and i'm going to show you the two methods i've used to make my ravioli pockets if you have cookie cutters you are good to go all you have to do is take one sheet place a little bit of ravioli filling spaced out and then i'm using water to form a kind of glue popping over another pasta sheet on top and then get out as much air as you can as possible if that makes any sense and next step is take a cookie cutter and punch out some shapes and it's just as easy as pie no specialist equipment necessary if you don't have cookie cutters you can also use a knife now i am my mother's daughter and this means that several years ago i bought myself an actual ravioli maker so i'm going to make my next batch with that as demonstrated watch on and enjoy so just as before i'm going to take out an evenly sided pasta sheet fill it up with the a goosey ravioli filling what shall we call this this is our vegan a goofy ravioli filling 100 dairy free 100 plant-based and i might even add a hundred percent west african inspired guys we have cooking techniques you need to get on with all right there's so much knowledge out here next step grab your second pasta sheet cover it up and then take a rolling pin and press down and allow the ravioli maker to do its work and the little nudging and look at how perfect that is i've got to hand it to you the ravioli maker makes things look so much better but guys this is home food it's nourishing no matter what the shape just have a go the final step in this saga is to make a creamy sauce and for that i have gone to my favorite nuts that's the cashew nut so i'm just gonna blitz it into a powder add some water and cook it up in a fry pan and build up the flavors as we would with an ordinary ravioli sauce to a hot pan i'm using olive oil and i had a way a brain wave to use a little bit of sheer butter so that's what i'm adding you know see if it adds a bit of creaminess and once that is hot you're gonna add in your cashew nut cream and add a lot of moisture because it thickens it thickens so i'm just adding some of the pasta water in there and stir make sure it doesn't get lumpy it only takes a matter of seconds it doesn't need that much cooking just a little bit of flavor building and we're gonna come to that salt your pan of boiling water add in your ravioli and cook for just a couple of minutes and now it's time to finish our cashew creamy sauce or creamy cashew sauce whatever you want to call it and going along with the same flavor profile i'm gonna add some lemon zest lemon juice and the herbs the scent leaves feel free to use mint feel free to use basil feel free to use oregano i have no doubt that either of these will be amazing and there we have a lovely thick sauce it doesn't have to be too thick guys it's just a creamer it's just something to break up and sauce up the ravioli it doesn't even need much cooking you know it's heated through so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna add in my ravioli add in your ravioli one by one and guys just for aesthetic reasons i'm not going to stir it up it really does look like a creamy mess which doesn't look great on camera you know it is home food but what can i say there is the done deal there is the done deal look at it it looks just like ravioli and here's another shot i'm just gonna garnish with the sauce you're gonna get to admire it we're putting it outside in light just just to get some good images for you guys so you can imagine exactly what this is like have a look around it's beautiful and i'm going to cutting it right now you're going to see the inside of it but guys there you have it a 100 west african inspired a goosey ravioli that is pumpkin seed your vegan a goosey ravioli filling and it looks just right enjoy question for you guys would you make this at home and you know what i think i'll make this again with bolder west african flavors next time", "0g3jSOjTsQ8": "[Music] kathleen here again from the bozeman public library children's room to do a fun family craft with you you'll be able to get all the supplies most of the supplies for this project from the library all you need to do is give us a call 582-2404 and say i would love the pop-up card craft kit and we will have it ready for you at our curbside delivery and if you haven't done a bundle of books with our curbside delivery all you do is give us a call and say my kiddos are three and five and they love these types of books and they have these types of interests and we'll pull together a big bundle of books for you to come pick up so let's get started so some of you might know what pop-up books are this is one i have at home it's called encyclopedia prehistorica mega beasts and it is by robert sabuda and matthew reinhardt now robert sabuda he is the master of pop-up books he's been doing it for years and years so the pop-ups we're gonna make are more like pop-up cards ours won't be quite this complex but it's just something fun for you to see we do have pop-up books at our library but we can't check them out because they often get damaged but once we open back up to the public you're welcome to come and look at them here so here's our first mega beast pop-up whoa look at he can fly let me move my head doesn't that look real look at that how did he do that he cut this all out of paper and they're manufactured but he first has to design these and look at how amazing that is let's try another one whoa what is this this looks like it has some of the skeleton of what is this skeleton of doesn't quite say i don't want to take up all the time but these are really complex pop-ups but you'll see they have all these different ways they're connected to the page and then they fold up like i said we won't do anything quite this complex look at that that looks like some kind of dinosaur see what's in here and he's got these little tiny ones oh my gosh what's that one it looks like an ape and this one that one looks like an ostrich so you get the idea of what pop-up books are like should we do one more i can just hear you on the other end one more one more oh saber-tooth tiger oh look at that i think my favorite is the flying the flying pterodactyl do you like that one look at how cool that is so anyhow we're going to make a pop-up card which is the very beginning steps of how i'm sure robert sabuda trained himself to do that amazing book the first thing i thought would be fun i made a happy spring card because i don't know about you but i love springtime i know it's a long ways off but i made this little one that says happy spring and then it opens and look there's a little three-dimensional garden of flowers i even put in some grass and the bottom it says let the sun shine and the flowers bloom so you wouldn't have to make flowers for this what's the important part is this real simple step here you could put animals here instead of flowers you could put your favorite sports you could put ghosts anything you want and change the theme up this one's really easy to make you'd be surprised so we're gonna learn how to make this one and then also if you have a bird lover in your family um or someone who's having a birthday soon this is actually a template from robert cebuda who did that book you can find this on his website but i'll also have it ready in your kit so instead of saying birthday i put happy birthday and look when it opens up out comes a bird from his little house and look the bird has a little hat party hat and then in his house there's a little cupcake for somebody and i made a little bit of a background you can do whatever you want for yours so that's a couple of ideas i will have the supplies for you guys to make both of these in the kit so we'll get set on the video and you can watch how to make these all right let's get started on this fun project so with your kit you'll get these two pieces of card cardstock and you just cut them out as you see me doing here you'll notice that they have an a and a b that's where we're going to glue our bird and i'm just making sure i got every last bit you can cut off any of those lines so they don't show on your card and then we're just going to quickly cut out this little bird house being careful to stay on the lines so you'll see shortly these dotted lines right here do not cut those dotted lines equal folded lines but let's talk about this so we're going to cut around the perimeter that means the outside don't cut any of the interior lines you'll see those dotted lines we're going to fold on the dotted lines so be real careful just cut along the outside and with pop-up books you have to be pretty precise things are usually lined up very specifically so that the pop-up mechanism will work correctly so just take your time cut out all the details i switched to my little detail scissors because i had to get in that real tiny spot so just take your time you have to get really careful in that little bit of the wing and just work your way around it and then there we go i'm just gonna cruise around the rest of that wing and we will just about have it cut out getting every little bit of [Music] detail [Music] okay now back to that birdhouse circle see how i just barely folded that and then i clipped it let you might get a help from an adult on that party can be kind of tricky so now i'm gonna take the piece of cardstock that's our actual card with the a and the b i'm going to fold where it's a dotted line all those dotted lines we're going to fold gently it gets a little tricky getting that v fold that i just pointed out so just take your time and only fold where there's a dotted line you might need help just a smidge if you get confused on this this is what makes the pop-up tuck in so you see that little v shape it forms a funnel that if there was water poured in it it would drop right in your lap then you're going to put glue on a and b and glue on your bird so once you've glued your bird on you just have to play with that again that little funnel part to make it pop right you might have to grab an adult to help with that and then i'm going to put a little glue here and glue on my little bird house and then i kind of try it out you have to fiddle fatal a little here and there with that darn funnel but once you get it it is gorgeous so i grabbed my bird identification book and i thought look at the beak of this bird look at the body shape i want to find a bird that's similar i also thought i know that blue birds love to be in little bird houses so i decided to do this little western bluebird so i just kind of looked at the colors and the design the eyes and just did it similar and you'll know that i am not the best at drawing realistically but i don't let that stop me i just have a lot of fun playing around and my card's going to be kind of whimsy and fun at the end now if you don't want to color in your bird you don't have to you can do whatever you want with your bird and your birdhouse it is up to you as the artist to decide so have fun with that part so i'm just going to color in my bird i put in some feathers it's kind of hard to see from this angle but when you see the finished product maybe you can see a little better and here i am just looking back at my bird identification book for reference to get the feathers right as right as i want them to be sorry about my hair there it'll only block for a second all right going to finish up that and then we'll do a little landscape okay i think that bird looks fine now i'm gonna make my birdhouse look kind of like old barn wood so i just drew what looks like some some wood and i just kind of colored it in to make it look like old weathered barn wood and i just trace around that little hole you do whatever you want you can paint it all one color if you want and speaking of paint i was using colored pencils but you could do paint you can do markers just even black whatever you'd like to do then i just thought i'd draw in a little bit of a background i saw someone use this same template and they drew a big tree making it look like the birdhouse was sitting on the branch of a large tree i just wanted to make it kind of look like a mountain scene so i just threw in some trees and in the backs and mountains just to give it a little a little bit of depth and background [Music] all right now on to the front of my card it's kind of a funny pun i am saying happy bird day instead of happy birthday i thought that was kind of funny so you'll see i just did some outlining and i'm doing a little stripes and some funny polka dots maybe just to make it kind of look fun and whimsical then i have the idea let's make my bird look like he's going to a birthday party so i put on a little birthday party hat and then i said i'm going to make a cupcake for my bird house and i was thinking that i would put it sitting in the birdhouse hole but you'll see after i cut it out oh here i am making a candle after i cut it out it didn't quite fit the way i wanted it to so let's see i glue the little candle on the cupcake and then i'm like oh it doesn't fit there oh i don't like it there maybe the bird could pass it out nope that doesn't work so then i say oh i'll just put it on the front so then i'm like well i'll make a little miniature cupcake i wanted it to be just a little smaller to fit in that little bird house door there's my second candle and then [Music] i just click clip and clip and glue and then then i thought well you know what else i'm going to need a platter for it to kind of sit on so i finish up my cupcake get a little bit of glue if you have a glue stick that works a little easier i just didn't have one that wasn't dried up so here i'm just making a little cake pedestal for it to sit on so it looks kind of fun and formal cut that out and then i'm probably gonna glue my little littlest cupcake to it a little bit of detail a little bit of glue a little bit of color and there it is i think that looks so cute so glued it there hooray hurrah so cute and i'm gonna test it make sure it pops then i thought i thought i'm gonna put i wanted to first do like a birthday banner with the little pennants that say happy birthday but i couldn't quite figure it out i was writing out happy birthday and counted all the pennants i would have to make and i see i was going to do that but they're just too small and i couldn't get all the letters so i bagged that idea then i thought i'll just make a little sign that says happy birthday so um i'm measuring my sign a little bit there and there i think that fits well then i'm folding accordion style back and forth back and forth to make kind of a paper spring then i glue my little sign to it that says happy birthday and it kind of stands out a little once it's glued on that little paper accordion spring so you'll see how that'll look it just looks a little bit um you know like a sign kind of a 3d sign the whole idea behind pop-up cards is to make them look three-dimensional so there i am gluing on that little spring and there it kind of pops a little bit so then i realize oh no it shows up the side of my card so i scoot it over it's still showing i said huh i'll make it easy oop cut here cut there there we have it all done i want to uh do that border and then let's glue our big cupcake on the front and we're done happy birthday here's what it looks like peek-a-boo that bird is so funny he kind of has a sly little smile on his face doesn't he there's our little cupcake and our background you do whatever you want with this bird bird pop-up let's move on to our second one this is the spring pop-up card so i put some cardstock in your package your kit and the outside is going to be the blue card the inside is going to be the inside part so i just measured a border you see how i did that that's you could use a rule or two if you want it doesn't have to be exact because then i'm going to cut it out in this fun shape here i am i'm using the center of the blue to fold it there see how that's going to be the inside of the card now here's the fun part you're going to cut these little slits and each set of slits is going to be your pop-up so you unfold it and then you have to carefully press these out to kind of make a little step so that is the pop-up portion of your card now i chose to make like a spring flower scene because i cannot wait for spring but you could do animals you could do like african animals or you could do basketballs you could do insects you could do funny emoji faces whatever you want and i just got some scrapbooking paper i had lying around and started to cut out some different flower shapes and just did whatever i thought would be fun so i did a bunch of different shapes i got a couple different types of paper so it looked a little more colorful i kind of did a coordinating orange pink and green theme but do whatever you want and if you don't like the scrapbook paper that came with your kit you can use white paper and draw your own designs on with marker or colored pencil or whatever you have at home and then you're going to glue whatever you create onto those little folded steps and you'll see here in a minute how it pops out [Music] all right we're just finishing up those little flowers and now we're going to glue it onto the blue piece of card stock you might have got a different set in your kit but glue whatever you chose for your outside card and then i thought uh i want to make something else to make it have some dement dimension and some depth so i glued that down and i wanted to make a sun now i hope you saw when i glued that down i did not glue the steps the little parts you cut off because if you glue them down you will not have a pop-up so be very careful that you do not glue the pop-ups that you cut out so there's my little sun doing a little trim work then i thought hmm i'm going to make some grass it didn't turn out exactly like i'd hoped but it's still kind of fun it adds a little bit more depth and some texture so i just kind of folded that to match the perimeter there and i should have cut it before i glued it down because it was a little tricky to cut those little blades of grass but i think it works out okay um you can do whatever you want here maybe you did an african theme you could do trees in the background then i'm going to do the front of the card so i'm just measuring my paper to be the same size and then i thought i'm going to cut it out and make it kind of fun i glue it down with my good old elmer's glue and then i got to thinking what should i put on the front what kind of card will this be so i said it looks so springy and bright i'm just gonna write on this green paper i thought well i could use some stamps i could use my stencil i could just do whatever i wanted on the front so i just decided to spell out happy spring and i've got these handy little stencils if you don't have stencils you could do letters cut out of magazines and glued on you could just freehand it with your markers whatever you want to do and just have fun with what you want to write on there maybe you're doing a safari themed card you might put rawr on the front and then have a lion inside whatever you'd like to do so i got that figured out i'm going to add an exclamation point which is an eye upside down because i didn't have one in my stencil and then i'm just going to fill it in with a little bit of color and go from there [Music] so i got to thinking what could i put inside this card my stencils would be too big so i just took my pen and wrote let the sun shine and the flowers bloom happy card making", "IvwS6BYjHG0": "[Music] [Applause]

"Uq8BRzUq5XI": "hello everyone welcome to my channel if you're no my name is Aisha to Bella I run a block house for letters and standards while we focus on empowering bold farm CEOs to live life through all things fashion and beauty so now that we've got this long intro out of the way if you would like to see how I go from crusty nails to this then keep on watching to start off I'm using my dr. Bronner's pure castile soap and I am leaving a few drops into lukewarm water prior to soaking my hands I am using a hundred percent acetone and removing any residue of nail polish that I may have on my fingers I am now buffing my nose ever so slightly and I actually got this on buffer from my manicurist but you can get any buffers from Amazon just be very careful not to buff your skin because that can create irritation and bleeding now I'm filing away any brittle nails to just make sure everything is even before we soak up the nails [Music] now let's hook these bad boys for about five minutes and move on now I'm applying my Sally Hansen instant cuticle remover on my cuticles for about 10 seconds which makes the process a bit easier because I'm not a professional for extra security I push back my cuticles even more because I don't want to end up putting press-ons on top of skin it's going to be annoying and painful so I quickly wanted to address that I actually absolutely love getting my nails than at the salon but for versatility I love press-on nails guys now onto my favorite part I am using my tree hut coffee sugar scrub and exfoliating my skin to get rid of any dead skin [Music] now I'm making sure my nails are squeaky-clean and I'm using an L brush that I got from the beauty supply also found on Amazon my nails are pretty fully breath but I'm taking the extra step just to make sure any strays cuticles or brittle pieces of my nails have been taken care of I'm finally evaluating which press-on nails I'd like to use this impressed nails is eight dollars at the drugstore I also actually had a set of twenty of these simple matte pink nails from Etsy for $20 and I went from the more expensive nails which was about $45 on Etsy now I'm going to go ahead and moisturize my dry ends using my African raw shea butter before even using the press-ons because they're going to seep through if I do it after oh guys ASMR is that ASMR I don't know this is satisfying to look at now I'm removing any excess butter from my nail bed prior to choosing the nails that I'm going to go with I'm laying out the neon nails on a flat surface so I'm able to I it and move quicker so guys this is the secret sauce the no lean nail glue is so strong it could probably put relationship together so I'm putting the tiniest amount on my finger applying the nails by pushing it in under my cuticle now one thing that I realized is that when I add sticky tabs in addition to the knellman it lasts about a week a week and a half realistically you're sticking nails on so it's not going to last three weeks like acrylic however when I only use an L lean glue it lasts me about three days which I hate so I definitely recommend the tabs so now that one hand is done let's move on to the hardest hand which is my dominant hand so usually I will do my nails on a flat surface especially for my right hand but for the purpose of the video I'm very close to the camera note that I use q-tips to wipe away any excess glue I'm rather than just letting it dry because it's going to turn out white so I quickly wanted to show you guys my cuticle oil which I use the next day because believe it or not the adhesive is not fully dry and there you have it guys thank you so much for watching don't forget to Like comment and subscribe and I'll see you on my next videos bye darlings

tips video and in this one i will be telling you guys about europe tips i personally use all of these tips on playing geoguessr so if i forget something or maybe if i don't know something feel free to add some of your tips in the comments below so let's begin so first location this is norway let me tell you how i know that this is norway first of all we have this generation 4 camera if you don't know about camera generations i will leave an info card up there you can check out my video where i explain what are those also we have this yellow line in the middle a dashed yellow line in the middle and this yellow sorry green plate right here in norway some vehicles will have green plates others will have the usual white plates with the blue on the left side the usual european uh plates and also in norway most of the time you will see mountains very beautiful mountains all around so the second location i feel like many of you might not know this because this is not in the battle royale uh if you get this location uh with lists like nordic looking houses and this car with these side mirrors and roof racks these are faro islands these are faro islands as you can see we're driving on the right side the cars will have the blue strip as well so let's go here ferro islands somewhere so third location we are in the uk as you can see we have these yellow license plates on our back side of the cars also we're driving on the left side uh we have these uh arrows towards some cities and these a roads they are in uk but i don't think these a roads are in ireland so that's another thing how you can distinguish between those two this is a very easily distinguishable country this is iceland looking around you see these mountains uh you see this long long antenna on the google car this grass feels very unique i don't know how to explain it and also these bollards of course in this video i won't talk about bollards too much if you don't know bollards i will leave a video on in the info card where i explain most common bollards they definitely can help in europe as well so the fifth location here is ireland in ireland we will often have these yellow dashed lines on the sides of the road and also in ireland you will see these rectangular yellow signs that you will not see in the uk so that's another clue how to distinguish those two apart in if you don't see any cars around as in this case so the next location is in finland let me show you around in finland you will often get these signs which will be in two languages one of them being finnish the other one being swedish and uh in both finland and sweden you will get these yellow signs there will be yellow like like this uh in norway there will be white so if you see these yellow signs it's either finland sweden or iceland in iceland you also get yellow signs but iceland is very easily distinguishable i feel also we have generation 2 camera here and i feel generation 2 camera is more common in finland although you can find it in other nordic countries as well so this is sweden we also have generation two here so it is possible to get it in sweden as well uh in sweden you oftentimes will see these short dashed lines they will be shorter than in other nordic countries so that's a good clue if you see these short dashed lines on the side of the road that is sweden you sometimes see them in sony as well but i'm talking about nordic countries right now especially again we see these uh yellow signs here as i said they are in sweden as well also in nordic countries you will often see these flags uh which will be in the colors of the national flag so in this case sweden being blue and yellow and if you see a street sign ending with gotham it's a good indication that you are in sweden because it means street in swedish now we are in denmark here we go this is the typical danish bollards you see them a lot in denmark so i wanted to show them but it's important not to confuse them with belgian bollards because in belgium you can have similar ones as well except the reflector will have like a straight edge instead of this tilted one in denmark you will see lots of these signs like with this this like metallic border around them uh that's a good good tip that this is denmark and also veg means uh street in danish this is finland again i wanted to show you guys finnish road lines uh in finland you will often see these like white dashed line and yellow solid line in the middle or you can also see double yellow line that's also a clue that this might be finland and this is denmark again as you can see we have this like metallic border around the sun very typical danish thing we have a yellow and white license plates in denmark you will see them both and also we have this letter you will get this letter in both denmark and norway speaking of letters i have a spreadsheet created where i have marked which countries use which letters so if you wanna learn which letters might be indicative of a particular country i will leave this spreadsheet in the description so you can check it out for yourself and now we have arrived at luxembourg in luxembourg you will get generation 2 camera coverage and also the license plates will be yellow in luxembourg it will also usually be quite hilly so that's a good clue how to tell it apart from netherlands this is germany in germany we often times will have blurred out houses blurred out cars and everything so that's a good clue as well i will have generation two camera because the coverage is quite old and of course everything will be in german in germany only the largest cities are covered so you won't usually see any rural locations or anything like that this is a very typical french location here we have this very typical french bollard also of course french language these yellow road numbers are french so if you see these it's a good indication that you are in france also like these uh black and white directional signs also are very french the stop sign i've seen similar one in spain as well but you can get them in france too location number four here this is belgium as you can see we have reddish license plates a little bit because in belgium they use red uh characters on their license plates so they often have like a little bit of a red tint to them also we have these orange sign backs oftentimes you will see signs like these in belgium and of course the architecture as well i'm not the best at architecture but these houses just feel very belgian to me so this is netherlands in netherlands we will have also yellow license plates on the cars as we head in luxembourg however in netherlands we usually won't have generation 2 camera also looking at the language it's usually quite easy to tell dutch apart and for the street name they they will use wig so this is italy in italy we have very distinguishable front plates they will be more narrow than typical european plates and they will have blue on both sides on the back side we will have like the typical white european plate but also with blue on both sides speaking of language i feel language is also pretty easy to tell apart you will have lots of eye letters and on the street signs you will see via a lot of the time so this is portugal in portugal you will often see these types of kind of brazilian looking uh poles with these triangular poles with these horizontal sections like looking almost exactly like the ones found in brazil you will also see kind of similar poles but not exactly like the ones you will see these type of poles in spain as well sometimes in france and sometimes similar ones in belgium as well in portugal you will of course have the portuguese license plate with the blue on the left side and yellow on the right side so that's a very good clue that you are in portugal if you see those this is another one that some of you might not have seen this is san marino in san marino you will have a generation 2 camera and the front plates also will be more narrow however they will not have any strips keep in mind that you will often see italian plates in san marino since san marino is in the middle of italy so that that can happen but uh yeah if you have generation 2 camera with with a few plates with no blue strips you might be in san marino this is spain in spain you will of course have some spanish language so it's very very good if you can distinguish that also in spain we will have these signs which won't have any like white border around them so that's another clue for spain and in spain you will also have like kale uh most of the time as the name for street so this is switzerland in switzerland you will have this low camera as you can see we have this uh white blur on the car and looking around the camera just feels lower than in the other countries as well the language we will see some german around so that's that's a clue and another clue that you will see in many countries not only switzerland is that on some of the cars you will see this like circular sticker with the country letters on them so that's a good thing to pay attention to as well because i've seen some people just rush past the cars and ignore these stickers completely so this is poland in poland we will have these signs with a very thin red border and yellow of course they are yellow as well as you can see these arrows will be thicker than in other countries that's another clue and these uh like uh directional signs are green i feel it's very it's a very polish thing as well of course many of the letters are unique i know this l letter is unique to poland so it's good if you know some of those unique letters that are in polish the next location we have is in austria so here we have some austrian bollards but you can also have these bollards in slovenia and montenegro uh however if you see this like almost black reflector i feel like that is way more common in austria than the other two so that's a good clue also of course we have some german language around as as expected uh i think these signs are also only found in austria correct me if i'm wrong on that one and also these are the austrian bus stops another good clue and one more thing that austria can have generation 4 camera as we have right now slovenia and montenegro will not have generation 4 camera so now we have come to czechia czechia can sometimes be very difficult to tell apart from slovakia so let's look around this letter this e letter and this r letter with the little hats on those are found only in czechia so if you see these letters it's a good indication you are in czechia and not slovakia well of course if you see any dominant names that's a good clue as well also if you are in prague you will see these street signs these red street signs which will also say prague on on them in slovakia and slovenia they can have similar ones so pay attention if it says prague or not and also cheki can have generation 4 camera as we have here but slovakia will not have generation 4 camera so this is slovenia in slovenian language you will have some of these uh hats on the letters but they will be far fewer than in czech our slovakian languages again you can check out that spreadsheet that i mentioned and all of those letters are there also in slovenia you can find these little house numbers they can be either green or red you can also find red ones in slovakia i believe as well well similar to the czech ones except without the frog text on them and this location is from slovakia as you can see we do not have generation 4 camera this is generation 3 and the best way to tell slovakia and cheki apart is by the language the languages are quite similar but there are some differences as i said in the czech language they have those unique letters in slovakia and you will see more of these apostrophes you can have them in czech as well but but fewer than in slovakia the next location is romania in romania you will often see these holy poles with these holes in the middle you'll see similar poles in hungary as well and kind of similar ones in poland you can see them as well there but they are most typically in romania and hungary if you see some yellow stickers on those poles it's more likely romania keep that in mind and speaking of language i feel romanian language is also quite easy to tell apart even if you don't know those special letters that are in the spreadsheet but if you do know them that's that's another clue this location is north macedonia in north macedonia you will usually have no antenna on the google car so that's the first clue the second clue is that the most of the car plates will not have that blue strip on the left side as you can see some of the cars still have it but most of them do not have that blue strip also in north macedonia you can see that jay letter in the cyrillic so that's one of the countries that use that that's another clue in croatia you will sometimes have a fall coverage sometimes you will have a summer coverage but if you have full coverage that's a good clue it might be croatia also the language will look kind of similar to slovenian so that might be a clue and also in croatia you will have this car like blur sometimes not always unfortunately but if you see this car like with some unblurred fragments it's a clue that it might be croatia this is hungary guys and hungary is a doji role so i have these holy poles but this holy pole almost looks polish to me because these holes are kind of smaller than the typical hungarian and romanian poles also on street signs we will have this utz here meaning street so if you see uttar that's a good clue you are in hungary speaking about language lots of the letters will have those accents on those letters as you can see here it's a little bit blurred out but you can still see lots of those accents and also the coverage uh some of the coverage was taken in winter however uh there is some generation for coverage as well so if you have generation four coverage in this area it can either be hungary czechia or bulgaria so this is serbia guys similarly to north macedonia most of the time you will not have any antenna however on the license plates you will have that blue strip most of the time so you can see most of the cars will have that blue strip also a good thing to notice is that the top level dominant name in serbia will be dot rs which might seem weird to some newer players speaking about language there will be some letters that indicate that you are probably in serbia for example this th letter i believe it's only in serbia and montenegro so the next location we have is in montenegro in montenegro and albania most of the time you will have these rifts in the sky so if you see those it's one of those two countries in montenegro however you will have the normal style european license plates with blue only on the left side as always it is good to pay attention to the language for example this d letter can only be found in iceland montenegro croatia and serbia next location is malta i feel like malta is quite easy to tell apart if you are driving on the left side as we are driving here if you see these rock walls all around you and also you see some english some non-english language you are in malta this is albanian guys as i told you in albania we will also have these rifts most of the time and however the big difference from montenegro will be the license plates these are the old style license plates with red on the left side and these are the new style license plates with blue on both sides the difference from italy here is that the front plate is like the normal sized license plate in italy as you remember they had those narrower ones and in albanian they have a unique name for street in other countries you will not get it it's ruga so this lovely location is located in greece in greece you will get of course the normal european license plates as well however you will get some license plates which are also narrow with no strips so that's a good clue if you see a few of those license plates and also of course the language language is very unique with lots of letters that you will not find in other languages at all in turkey the biggest clue i can tell you is their language the language is also very easily distinguishable with all of those unique letters that many of the other countries don't have and also in turkey you will oftentimes see some flags around i don't think there is a flag on this location but they are very patriotic so you will often times see some flags in some locations this my friends is bulgaria most of bulgaria is covered during winter time so that's why it looks quite gloomy in bulgaria you will sometimes see this tape on the antenna you can see the tape in a few countries actually i've seen it in bulgaria hungary romania czechia slovakia in a few but if you know it it can help narrow it down a little bit also most of the sounds will be in cyrillic but sometimes you can see them in both languages both cyrillic and english this one is russia guys in russia you will often see these pedestrian crossings with yellow and white on them these signs are very typical to moscow especially the license plates will be all white no strips on them in russia so completely white and also in russia you will often see these like reflectors around pedestrian crossings however you can see them in some other european countries as well so it's not just a russian thing this is ukraine ukraine can sometimes look similar to russia so let's see what are the clues here uh the big glue is language the big lewis language we have this letter which is unique to ukraine you will not have it in russia and also this eye letter without any any dots that's also is not in russian speaking of license plates many of the license plates will have blue and yellow on them on the left side in the flag collars of ukraine so if you can notice that that's a really really good clue as well this one is ukraine again i wanted to show you the red car if you see a red car in europe most of the time it will be ukraine sometimes in very rare occasions you can see red car in belgium as well but it's quite rare most of the time it will be ukraine in this location i wanted to show you guys these yellow pipes these i believe are gas pipes and they are very common in russia i believe i have seen them in ukraine as well but they are way more common in russia and here are some tips for baltic countries as well if you get like a narrow road like this and white flowers it's a really good clue that it is estonia white flowers can be found in all baltic countries however they're most common in estonia i believe so that's a good clue this one is lithuania in lithuania you will have this g letter which means street shorthand from god and also many of the words will end with us or i especially i so that's that's a really good clue that you are in lithuania as well in lithuania and estonia you will have three characters and three characters on the license plates like two groups however in latvia you will have two characters first and then anywhere from one to four characters on the other side well this one is a stoney it's quite easy to tell apart the language it's different from both latvian and lithuanian this letter is only found in estonian for example as well also here are the short dashes that i mentioned before as well you can also use these triangular signs to tell both the countries apart in estonia and lithuania they will be quite similar however in latvia this red border will be thicker than this so yeah if you see a thicker border on these signs it's probably latvia i also wanted to show you this estonian bus stop here which is like like a metallic pole with this sign next to it that's that's very estonian and also these poles you will get them both in latvia and estonia however in latvia you will often times have some other things tied tied to the poll as well i have another video about pause that i believe in the info card if you want to check that out where i tell more about the polls in baltic states you can also use the kilometer markers to tell the countries apart as you can see in estonia they will be perpendicular to the road in latvia they will be parallel to the road and in lithuania they will be like in an arrow shape towards the road so that's a good clue as well so this is latvia guys in latvian language you will have these horizontal bars over letters a lot you will have them some in lithuanian as well but in latvian they are more common so that's a good clue as well and also in latvian the street is yellow so you will see that a lot on the street signs and this is another lithuanian location where we have the language again this i you will see that a lot uh in lithuanian and what i wanted to show is the bust up here this is the lithuanian bus stop you will see these black and white like railings a lot in lithuania there were some in estonia as well before you don't see them a lot in latvia though so that might be a good clue as well and after making those locations i remember that i have forgotten about andorra so this is andorra guys in andorra you will have the non-european license plates or sometimes you will see some spanish or french plates as well but most of the plates will not have that european strip houses also have a unique style so it's usually easy to tell them apart and also you will have mountains all around so that's another clue and i had forgotten about monaco as well so here it is too in monaco you have generation 2 camera also some cars will have the european strip as this one others will not have the european strip as well but as you can see it looks very different from andorra the houses have a completely different style we are very close to water as well so you can sometimes see some beach you can see some boats as well so that's a good clue i hope you guys enjoyed this video it took a while to prepare and film it so i hope it was useful to you if you have any other tips leave them in the comments below another tip video will appear on your screen shortly thanks to all the members for supporting the channel you can join the membership

you guys new at the channel monbak monday is all about fishing tips and tricks we discussed a little bit of fishing tackle and gear just to take a little break from the road discussions i thought this week i will show you my trace that i use for cob as well as the complete setup from the length of the trace the hook sizes the swivel sizes the mono thickness and i don't know if i mentioned the length of the length of the hooks needs and the trace so everything that you need to make a cocktail to catch a cob like you've seen in that intro i'll show that to you right now so just before we go into this video i just want to mention guys that we really need to protect our cob species and practice catching the release as far as possible it i don't say i'm not saying that you shouldn't keep a cob or fish to eat but what i'm saying is we need to release as much as possible especially the big fish if you really want to keep a cob i've got no problem with that but try and keep it in the range of like a two to four kilocopt don't kill all those big cop cobb only start to breed and get sexually matured at one meter of length i don't completely agree with the legislation that we currently have in south africa i think there should be a minimum as well as a maximum length on cop that you're allowed to keep but i don't want to go into that that's a whole other discussion guys this is a species really close to my heart and it is a dream fish for any angler in south africa to catch and every angel wants to catch a big cob but if you're not going to protect the species there's not going to be any big cop for anyone to catch in the future my son is 8 years old and he loves crop fishing and he already has the mindset of catching fish and releasing them for the future and that is the mentality that we need to get through to young anglers and anything like any anger out there on in the angling community and i really want my son one day to catch the size cop that we are currently catching although the numbers have declined a lot we need to protect that specie right now for the future otherwise we're not going to have any cop so that's the reason why i'm saying this is guys i am showing you guys some tips and some tricks on how to fish for cobb and how to target com i want you guys to actually catch more cop and be more successful in your cop fishing not to kill more cop guys i don't want that blood on my hands so i really ask you guys please please please release as much as possible hence the saying and the slogan on my channel teach preach catch and release this channel is all about conservation and sustainable fishing and ethical fishing ways so guys please if you support me in the channel please support catch and release i would highly appreciate it but enough said let's get into the video and help you guys catch some more cop so first off um i don't know the exact lengths of my traces i just i'm so familiar with my triceps i just go like this and okay that's long enough okay this is how long i need and i cut it off and i make my ties but for you guys that are really an analytical and wants to know the exact measurements i brought my measuring types i'm going to measure my traces so you guys know exactly how long it should be like a tip for you guys if you're using a soft measuring type old maxima spool leaders pool your top fits in there perfectly it doesn't tangle up in messy or all over the place because it's always like a bundle of mess and then yeah anyway let's get into the video so i use different thickness of mono and different hook sizes when i'm targeting cog it all depends on the size of cob that i'm targeting and our bigger stronger the sea is and our flatter seals obviously so the general trace is exactly the same the only thing that's different is the hook size the thickness of the mono and the swivel side so bear in mind that when i walk you through this whole tray setup that the that the trace for the smaller cup is exactly the same it's just a smaller hook but i'll discuss it through the throughout the video as we go along so for this video i'm gonna make the thrice that i use for big cob um like i said it's exactly the same as a smaller cob the only reason why i'm using the big cocktails is because it's a bigger look and it's a thicker mono and it's just easier to show that to you guys on on camera just easier to form so we're going to start off with our hook for for big cob i like to use a nano bkk inline a lot of the guys use offset circles like the fusions or the um or the offset bk case it is all personal preference i just like the inlines they work well for me i've had great success on them and if something works me i don't like to change but you can use um your favorite hook just gauge it up to it so it's a similar size as a nano bkk so when i fish for smaller cop or just general cop fishing i use a 7-0 vkk and that is for when i'm targeting like any size carbon i'm throwing onto a bank and nice working water i want to sketch any cob from like two kilos and up usually in those working waters with a small trucker by the targeted cop that you or the size cop that you're targeting is like 2 kilos to 10 kilos but if you hook a peacock like a 30 40 kilo cob you will land it on that tackle and you will land it on a seven hour it will get perfectly in the corner of the mouth and you will land your fish but when i'm going for big gob i like to use a nano vkk because we're using bigger baits generally we use like alpha for oki or a whole aki or two big aki legs that we make a bait out of or a big choco bait or the choco head or we use live mullet because your hook size needs to be in relation to your bait size you don't want a tiny small hook on a big bait because then your hook is not going to be fully exposed or exposed enough for the circular to do its job and hook the fish so you know your work size needs to be in relation to your bait size and then also when unlike my toes for the bigger cob i like to use like a eight .85 or point nine i looks in it and when i use the seven o for smaller cob or for any size cobweb i'm targeting with with smaller bytes mostly because i need more distance i use a 0.70 or 0.75 works in it once again you don't want to loosen it to be too thick on a thinner look or thinner but a smaller bait the reason why i'm using a thicker hook smooth for bigger cob is that if you might have a longer fight with the cop and when you're fighting a big cop you'll actually feel the teeth of a cabinet if the cop won't bite you off but the lion shoots from the teeth one tooth another tooth and like as he shakes his edge and turning around you can actually feel the line rubbing on its teeth and eventually it can rub through through a thinner through a thinner looks need so that's why i like to use a thicker looks nude but that's not to say that with a thinner hooks knit you're not going to land the fish you will land it but i just like to play safe when i'm targeting big fish we're going to start off by doing a snail knot on your circle look this is not your normal snail knot i do a slightly different one there is a video on how to make the smell mode on my channel but i'm going to show it to you guys really briefly now again just to to recap on that but if you haven't seen that video go and check it out it is on my channel it will be underneath um tackle tuesday playlist or underneath knots and leaders or how to make traces on it will be in one of those playlists okay let's start off so you're going to take your piece of trace you're going to put the one end of the minor facing up and then one end of the mono facing down just make sure this is out of your way and then you're going to pinch it between your two fingers and you start at your index finger working your way down around the shank of the as well as around all of the mono like four to six times just keep it firmly in place and then you just hold on to the bottom tag end and you're going to pull the top in pull it all the way through just make sure that you don't kink your line put it through put it through and as it comes through just secure it with your line a little bit you shouldn't use your teeth but yeah anyway um then just secure it all the way up now you can see that knot is already tight around the shank of the hook we're just going to cut our tag end off and leave like two or three millimeters and then really important we go from the back of the hook coming out on the front of the eye of the verge like that okay so remember guys we're not throwing our bait um this is just to to get a better hook up on your circle look it just allows the hoop to turn better into the corner of the mouth of the fish if you can imagine that is the corner of the mouth or a fish now guys this has been working really well for me and now we're going to tie on our swivel really important with the swivel and swivel sizes you need to choose the right size swivel that is applicable to the thickness of your leader of your throats you can't just go and take any swivel you don't want your swivel to be too big and too bulky and you also don't want your swivel to be too small so the problem with thicker line and a smaller swivel is that the swivel is so thin that it can actually cut through the trace under pressure so you don't want that to happen like i said you need to keep your bait size and your excise in relation you need to keep your look smooth and your swivel size in relation as well so just to to let you guys know the swivel sizes that i use on a 0.70 hooks net with my general cop trace with smaller boats using the 7-0 circular i like to use a number three japan power swivel and on your 0.85 or 9 0x net or one mallux net i like to use a number two japan power swivel these two pan power swirls that are a little bit more expensive than your normal battle swivels but you save money at the end of the day you just lost a way a lot longer and um you're already incredibly strong anyway i tied this with a figure eight i'll quickly show you a high timer figure eight put your swivel onto your line you create a little loop and then i go like three three wraps around my index finger and i take it off and i push it through from the swivel side downwards towards your hook now you're going to open your knot and as you've got it open you can see the figure out starting to form and you're going to pull you keep your hands in in your two lines not applying pressure directly on the swivel there because then you're going to kink your line so put your hands in and then form your knot by pulling on this end and then that end while keeping that tag in firmly in your hand quickly wet your knot and then slide it all the way to your swirl go there we go now what i usually do in that little clip on your sinker i take that and i clip that into by the the eye of my swivel and then i secure my knot and you'll see it go will go neatly into place that's a knot right there once again take your tag end off so just for you guys to show you the length of this trace see i just normally go yo that's long enough let's go let's go fish but for you guys that wants to know i'm going to to measure that that is exactly 60 exactly 60 centimeters long so my eyes to the swivel 60 centimeters and then guys what you do is if you used 0.90 here for um a bitcob trace you're going to use port 9r again if you use 0.70 or general crop trace you're going to use 0.70 again so basically this section you're going to use the exact same thickness as your hook's knit so then again i know i need about about this much cut it off i'll measure that for you guys again i'm not going to show you the knot again but we're tying a figure eight onto the opposite side of our trace there we go got the tagging off so now we have your hook 60 centimeters of mono your number three or number two depending on the size of your lux net japan power swivel and then about this much of another piece of mono and then we're going to take a little bead we're going to slide that onto our piece of money that we just tied on and then i want to show you guys this you can use just a swivel and slide it on here you can just take a swivel and slide it on your number four or number five japan power swivel but i like to make my own little tea swirls you can buy some tea soils if you want to but if you want to make your own i'm quickly going to show you how to make your own tea swivels using a cotton blood all that you need is a cotton bud a lighter and something to cut the cotton bud with so we're going to push it through the eye after the swivel and we're going to burn the one in not too much just keep it uh like five millimeters away and move it closer just so that it creates a little little edge there for the swivel not to slip off then we're going to go like 45 millimeters and we're going to cut the pieces of cotton butt off just make sure your cotton bud is still in place and then i think this is a little bit long make it a little bit shorter now we're just going to burn the opposite end again so you guys can see what is happening okay so there we go that is just to protect this piece of mono that the swivel is sliding on and not for that swivel to cut through the mono if you get stuck or something might happen or for some reason um your single gets stuck and um there's pressure on it i like to play safe guys and we're just going to add a t-swivel and then another bead the second bead is optional but i like to to put on two beads so now you've got a bead a t-swivel and another bead see right there sliding on this piece of mono right here and that's where we're going to attach our cinque tres to we'll get to that now shortly okay and then again figure eight a number two japan power shovel because you're using point niner if you're using 0.7 remember you use a number three once again another figure eight okay so get it tag end off okay so this is where our cinque tres is going to be attached and onto that sliding swivel right there but we're not going to do that just yet and i'm going to explain to you guys why firstly i'm going to add my dingle dangle okay if you if you guys want to know how i make this thing not angles there is a video on my channel on how to make these um it will be under the playlist everything cob everything mulloway there's a lot of tips and tricks and some bait demos on how to actually use the um dingle dangle as well so you're just gonna hook it through the docker on and there it is on now we're going to add a little bit of now we're going to add a little bit of foam the foam is there for for two reasons um first reason it's a little bit of buoyancy for your bait to float just above the bottom of the of the sea floor and then secondly it adds a little bit of body to our bait when we're building our body so to add it we're just going to cut a little section like this big it should be the length of your dangle and your loop still um still being exposed the whole loop should be exposed when you're putting on your little piece of foam and you're going to split it like off open not completely open just like halfway the two-thirds open like a little cut there open and we're going to slide single dangle into that i'm going to take latex cotton now i'm going to take latex cotton nice and stretchy some of the guys like to use super glue then super glue together i just use latex cotton and i just close it up to keep it in place remember guys the tighter that you put your cotton on the less buoyant your float is going to be so just a little bit to keep it close not too tight and then break it off and there we go there's our dingle dangle on now we're going to tie our sinker throws on while we do our second trace after we attach the dingle dangle because we don't know the exact length of our dingle dangle and the size of the bait we're going to use so we put our dingle dangle on then we just use a normal blood knot this is usually the my sinker trace is usually like a 0.60 or 0.55 or 6 5 but it's generally lighter or way lighter than my hook smooth and the rest of my tries so that if my sinker might get stuck for some reason then i can break it off while i have a fish on and i'm not going to lose my fish and i'm only going to lose my sinker and i can still fight my fish got a normal blood knot on that little t-swivel that we created and then we're going to measure the length of our single trace so your single trace is going to be like three or four centimeters longer than your dangle or your loops in it and i cut it off just leave a little bit of mono for you to tie your sinker on you can use a single clip here if you want to i just normally tie it directly directly to my sinker just again with a blood knot double double blood knot and there we go the sink it is attached go let me just get this wire over and i'm going to give you one really important tip with regarding sinkers and what sink is to use for cob you can't just use any sinker and i'm going to explain that to you guys now i just want to show you the purpose of the dingle dangle and um the sinker so there you go the sinker trace is slightly longer than your hook trace and the reason for that is is you're going to clip in your dinner dangle onto that little clip there onto your sinker like that so when you cost it's going to travel through the air as a unit and you're not going to have this your bait trailing grind and swirling all around the place and getting tangled up with with the rest of your trace and also it's minimizing um resistance through the air when it's traveling so you're going to get a lot more distance if you throw your bait like a unit like that so as it hits the water that hook is going to unclip and it is floating around and the cop is able to get to it okay so i said i want to mention something really important regarding your sinkers so guys i don't like to use cone sinkers when i'm fishing for cob i also don't like wheat eater singers because um you the video sinker is not able to clip over and a cone sinker just drags along the bottom all the way and it's just yeah you lose a lot of fish when you use the wrong sinker and the reason why i'm saying that is is when you use a wire sinker is you can set the tension of these wires to clip over so as soon as you put pressure on the sinker it can clip over so this wire should be as loose as possible so it can clip over as easy as possible and just it should be just enough to keep your bait in one place and not to clip over while you're waiting for a bite the reason why i'm saying that is is if this wires are not clipping over while you're fighting the fish it's dragging all along the bottom and it's getting ripped in the sand getting out of the sand into the sand again and as that crop shakes it can be hooked in the lip and it can shake the shaky hook more easily and you can lose your fish but if this wires clip over once you have the fish on it's just going to drag freely on the bottom and it's not going to get stuck into the sand or into anything or anywhere even sometimes what happens people throw the traces off or the lines off or break off and you can look into that if this is unclipped it's going to drag freely and it's not going to look into any structure and you're going to fight be more directly in contact with the fish and it's not going to shake the look that easily so guys it's really important to remember this i think i didn't mention sorry one thing guys i think i forgot to mention the length of this trace on top here so to recap the trace we've got our 60 centimeters of ukraine's hookshot right here your swivel and then your power swivel then a bead t swivel that we that we made then another bead and that is our sinker trace sliding up and down on this piece of mono that we added right here on the top and it's going to slide all the way up to that swivel there the reason for the beads are is for that swivel when the fish is taking line or when you're holding um your bait in the water just waiting for bite or doesn't get stuck on that knot on either of the two swivels so it can move freely okay so here we have the top section and i'm just going to measure it out to show you guys how long it is it's usually like a meter 1.2 meters 1.1 meters yeah this one is you know just under a meter like two or three centimeters under a meter i usually do it like one meter to 1.2 meters it all depends on your style of casting so this can vary from person to person from angular to angular this is just how i fish it i'll actually prefer it a little bit longer but this is fine you can use it like this but the longer your drop is when you cost the longer this section can be so if you're not used to throwing a long drop when you throw because this swivel should be at the tipping when you cost so just just before your cost when you clip your payload over this is going to be like this much out of your tipping and obviously if you can't throw a trace that long you can shorten this don't shorten um don't shorten your hook snoot don't shorten this keep it at this length rather shorten this section if you can't throw a long drop if you can throw a longer drop you can make this longer so you can play around with this to find it where it's comfortable for you so now going so now we're going to our leader and our reel so this is the reel that i that i'll use i usually fish with 30 pound braid for for cobb and i just want to pull this off to show it to you guys so i imagine this is now on my on my rod that's my 30 pound braid main line on that i attached a 80 or 100 pound braided leader via fg knot you guys can see there's a fgnot right there okay so it's 30 pound onto 80 pound or 100 pound braided leader and usually i use like three arm lengths of braided leader that's one two three so it's three full arm lens that i use and a little bit extra that's the timer not so that braided leader is running through your guides and you're going to attach it to your swivel to your trace and i usually attach that with the exact same knot that i use on my swivels i use a figure eight but i do it like eight turns um opposed to three turns and um she never let me down i've got some really big fish on it they're not the scope really big bronzies and black rays and all sorts of things and that's not that i use so the leader the private leader that we're using is just a little bit of protection through if there's any structure in the water as well as that if you're going to tie 30 pound directly to a swivel or 2.90 it's not going to be as strong as when you taper it from a 30 to 80 or 100 pound tying into your swivel another reason for that is that when you're going to cost you should have actually used a darker leader that knot should be on your spool when you throw the reason for that is is that um you want this braided leader if you're using a baronic finger to be wrapped around your bionic finger and not um your main line which is 30 pound it may damage the 30 pound braided leader so at the braided line so we want our braided leader to be wrapped around the blinding finger and if you're of coursing with a glove or with your finger um you've got much less chance of cutting through the glove of cutting through your finger when you're crossing from a 80 pound or from a hundred pound then you can continue costing from 30 pound so yeah and you leave it also shouldn't be too long usually there should only be prior to your cost should be like maximum two turns around your spool to about one turn um i usually do like one and a half turns around my spool before my cost that um that just ensure ensures that you don't get any rod slaps in your cast or during your course or um wind knots or anything like that so yeah guys that is um it for the video so that is my complete trace that i use for cobb so like i said it's basically the same um trace that i use for big cob and smaller cob for life bait and for smaller baits only difference is the size of the swivels and the thickness of the mono so recap again your swivel japan power swivel either a size 3 or a size 2 depending on the thickness of your mono then one meter to about 1.2 meters of mono with your sinker trace with a swivel and two beads sliding on that then we go on to another swivel same size as the top one then about 60 centimeters of hooks in it exact same thickness as you used here and then a snail knot to a 9-0 or 7-0 bkk with your dingle dangle and your dingle dangle is going to differ to the size of the bait that you're going to throw so obviously the bigger the bait the bigger the dingle dangle the smaller the bait the smaller the dingle dangle and i like to use dacron because it's nice and flexible and you know i don't like the wire dangles and then our single trace synchrotros is slightly longer than our electrodes so that we can clip it in and that's it that's it for the cocktails and guys remember like i said in the beginning of the video i'm showing you guys this to catch more cob hopefully or to catch more fish not to kill more fish we need to protect this species guys it's really important to me to protect this specie a cop is really close to mud and we don't want to kill those things but yeah you guys know it i preach it every time every day and you need to do it um yo guys all the tackle that you saw that i used now can be purchased from still fishing they have an online shop with really great prices really great servers i can really recommend them um they are big supporters of zurich fishing and i like to support them as well so have a look at the online shop it's www.stallfishing.com use my promo code zlf like i said they support zulu fishing so a little bit of every purchase that you guys make goes towards zulu fishing and it helps fund this channel and it helps me to buy a little bit of bait fuel and tackling gear to make these videos for you guys because it's not really cheap doing this but it's not about the money you guys know it it's all about the passion of fishing anyway i would really appreciate if you guys can support them the link to the website will also be down in in the description go and check it out there will be a little bit more information in the description with what videos to have a look at regarding cop fishing as well as go and check out the playlist on my channel everything cob editing by the way and you can find some tips and tricks right there so yo guys that's it that's the end of the video i hope you guys enjoyed it give it a like give it a thumbs up and please subscribe cheers guys", "eb12iPC3JHE": "um so okay should we go ahead and get started um yes good um good day everybody my name is lynne goldman i'm dean of the milken institute school of public health and it's my pleasure to invite you to our dean's seminar um on racism and health we have been exploring a number of topics in this area and today's topic is about climate change and health we're very fortunate to have on our faculty people who are incredible leaders in this field dr melissa perry who chairs our department of environmental and occupational health as well as dr susan annenberg who's on our faculty of environmental and occupational health and um the person who we called on to to put this seminar together and i know that we have some very special guests with us today i'm going to hand um the podium over uh to dr annenberg to uh to begin us um this morning susan take it all right thank you so much jean goldman and welcome everyone thank you so much for joining us here today i'm really excited to introduce this uh this topic and our excellent panel um and so i'm going to actually start by talking about some of the work that um that our research group has been doing in the last year or so um at the intersection of climate change air quality environmental justice and public health sort of as an entry point to the conversation and then i'll turn it over to our panel um to give their perspectives and at the end we'll have about 10 or so minutes to have a moderated q a session that will be moderated by two of our current students so really excited for the conversation here today i'm going to go ahead and share my slide and i want to start by talking about the clean air act because the clean air just had its 50th anniversary last year in 2020 a year that many of us would like to would like to push away from our minds um but yet it was a good moment to take stock of the success of the clean air act and um the challenges that that remain and actually the clean air act is it's considered a really really successful um environmental law it has reduced air pollution concentrations dramatically over the us since the 1970s and in particular since the 1990s and you can it's so successful you can actually observe the nitrogen dioxide change over time from space we have a network of earth observing satellites that are constantly taking images of the earth's atmosphere and we can actually see this dramatic drop in air pollution from space and yet there's two really important challenges that remain that the clean air act has not addressed um and i'm going to talk about those today the first is climate change so the way that we have reduced our air pollution concentrations is largely through technological controls things like catalytic converters on our cars and diesel particulate filters on our trucks scrubbers on our power plants these are really effective ways to take air pollution out of effluent streams but they do nothing for greenhouse gases and so climate change is just continuing unabated and of course climate change is contributing to worsening air pollution over time by leading to larger wildfires and more dust storms and more smog formation for example um so to reduce both air pollution and greenhouse gases we can target the same emission sectors the other challenge that the clean air act has is that it has not reduced air pollution equitably we have study after study that shows that air pollution concentrations are higher in communities of color and communities with lower educational attainment and lower income levels and in fact the air quality monitoring network that the epa set up to determine whether counties are attaining the national ambient air quality standards were not intended to be able to tease out these neighborhood scale effects so they you know we have a handful of monitors for the whole washington dc region and this tells us whether our overall regional air quality is improving but it doesn't tell us whether one neighborhood might be more exposed than another neighborhood luckily we have sort of a confluence of events here where we have an administration that has put climate change and environmental justice as two of their top priorities at the same time we have expanding capabilities to do exposure assessment we have satellite remote sensing and we have another technique that i'm going to talk about now which is a which is a mobile monitoring of air pollution so this is a study that we've been doing over the last year it should be coming out next week in the journal called environmental health perspectives where we partnered with the environmental defense fund who who themselves partnered with the wool to outfit every uh not every but at google street view mapping cars with air quality sensors and drive these around oakland california and what they did is they drove every street of oakland california taking measurements of air quality we were able to combine that information with neighborhood scale information about disease rates and try to estimate how air pollution health risks vary within a city and in fact within even a portion of the city in west oakland california an environmental justice community that is exposed to very high levels of traffic related air pollution as well as air pollution from other sources we found 38 full variation in mortality attributable to traffic-related air pollution across the bay area california and this was driven not just by air pollution concentrations but also the disease rates the vulnerability of the population that is breathing in these air pollutants so we were going about this study under you know increasing our understanding of how traffic-related air pollution contributes to inequities and air pollution health risks within cities when a dramatic natural experiment occurred and that is the lockdowns due to the pandemic and now of course um you know we don't want this block that we don't want this natural experiment but it's a natural experiment that we're all living through where we saw passenger vehicle traffic drop by about 50 and with that 50 drop in passenger vehicle traffic we've been able to sort of isolate one important emission uh sector when all other emission sectors were relatively constant through the pandemic um also at the same time we were already using satellite remote sensing to study air pollution levels within cities and so we were sort of at this perfect position to use the satellite remote sensing to study the changes that occurred during the natural experiment and try to understand did population subgroups around the country experience the same reductions in nitrogen dioxide or were some population subgroups did they experience you know more reductions in traffic related air pollution compared with with other communities and this is a study led by our postdoc gage kerr that is in the final stages of the review right now um which shows that the the covid 19 pandemic reveals persistent disparities in no2 pollution so i just want to break this down for a minute um the graph on the right shows no2 levels in the least white communities shown in the orange points and versus the most white communities shown in the glue points the connecting line that is solid indicates the baseline period that's before covid and the dashed line indicates the lockdown period that's during covid so what we see is that in the baseline period the no2 levels and the least white census tracts were already about two times higher than levels in the most white tracks prior to the pandemic that's really unfortunately not that surprising because there's other studies that have shown that you know that communities of color are experiencing much higher levels of air vision compared with more white communities but what was very surprising is that during the pandemic um the concentrations of no2 dropped for both of these white census tracts and the most white census tracts but if you compare the orange dots connected to the dashed connecting lines to the blue dots connected to the solid connecting lines we see that the least white communities experience higher levels of nitrogen dioxide during the pandemic than than most white communities faced prior to the fandom so even about a 50 drop in passenger vehicle traffic was not enough to bring no2 concentrations in the most and the least white census tracks down to the levels experienced by the most white census tracts prior to the pandemic and similar results held for ethnic income and educational attainment population subgroups so um we're working now on trying to understand the contributors to no2 disparities across the united states but one thing this is showing us is that it's not just passenger vehicle traffic that is important but also um diesel uh trucks and it's really pointing finger actually diesel trucks if you look at the primary road density on the top uh graph here we see that the there's much higher primary road density to the left portion of this graph correlated with communities that are that have lower income that have less education and that are less white and that's that sort of correlation is not the case for indus industrial sources so industrial sources are not especially correlated with these communities compared with road density um so in addition to on-road um passenger vehicles we need to also be considering and reducing nitrogen dioxide from heavy-duty uh trucking as well so what does this all have to do with climate well any time we reduce fuel burning we're reducing both greenhouse gases and air pollutants and those have many health benefits but targeting some fuel combustion sources may go further to advance environmental justice and health equity and we've been pointing finger in our work at heavy beauty trucking and i'm very interested to hear the perspectives of our panel here today um they really come from a variety of a variety of backgrounds and a variety of professional experiences and it's my true pleasure to welcome them to be a part of this panel and so we will hear from dr adrian hollis adrian is the senior climate justice and health scientist at the union of concerned scientists and she's also a professorial lecturer in the environmental occupational health department at gw and in this role she reads the development design and implementation of methods for accessing and documenting the health impacts of climate change on communities of color and other traditionally disenfranchised groups prior to joining ucs she served as the director of federal policy at react for environmental justice after dr hollis we will hear from dr jalan white newsome jalan is the ceo and founder of empowering a green environment and economy llc she's also a professorial lecturer at the environmental occupational health department at gw she was previously at the kresge foundation and she was a senior program officer responsible for the environment program's grant portfolio on climate resilient and equitable water systems and supporting kresge's climate change health and equity initiative and prior to joining kresby she was also at react for environmental justice and then finally we'll hear from dr melissa perry she's the chair of the environmental and occupational health department at gw she's a leading public health researcher and she has wide ranging epidemiologic and preventive intervention studies over the past two decades and in addition to her many very teaching and research roles she's truly been a leader and ensuring that our programs here at uh the in the environmental and occupational health department address environmental justice and and climate change to the extent that they they deserve um so with that i will welcome dr adrian hollis thank you dr annenberg and thank you to um georgia to the george excuse me george washington university's milken school of public health and the faculty and staff and to all of our attendees i'm very excited to be here so i want to speak briefly about why systemic racism is a public health issue and what its relationship is to environmental justice and and to climate change and and climate change's impact on communities what that looks like and then use covet 19 as an example of just how all of these issues come together and result in what we call the ascendemic so i'll begin with systemic racism so in here in the u.s systemic racism has affected black and brown people i guess in every aspect of our lives from education to employment the housing to health care from the water we drink to the air we breathe and it takes many forms and you know one of them is redlining which has been outlawed but still occurs in in some form or fashion so what is redlining it is a it actually it is as described it was it began in 1930s and it was back at that time by the federal government where many banks literally outlined areas in major cities urban areas in red if they were a majority black to say that these are communities where mortgages should be denied because there is um there's a greater chance of them um forfeiting on those loans and then of course they had areas that were considered um a little less undesirable those were normally in yellow like this is turning into a black community then they had um blue which is better and then they had green which was the majority of white community and so it wasn't just used for mortgages but it was also used to determine places the best places to live and so because of redlining and other issues including like racially restrictive housing covenants which prohibited black americans from buying certain properties in certain areas it prevented generations of families from gaining equity in home ownership or from beginning to develop generational wealth and two other terms you should be familiar with nimby nimbyism not in my backyard is um a term that originated in the us and is usually used by communities that uh of greater wealth and usually white communities to say we don't want facilities in our communities we don't want landfills or hazardous waste facilities or recycling plants in our neighborhood to the point where we don't care where they go they're not here and they traditionally end up in communities of color environmental justice communities um communities with black americans and uh the final word that i would like you to know is lulu which is locally unwanted or locally undesirable land use including power plants and landfills where people didn't want them now the chances of a business wanting to move into a community with a lulu or with a hazardous waste site is slim to none so these communities our communities were also unluck were also um unable to in to develop economic power because they couldn't get good jobs and they couldn't bring businesses into the community so all of these things were affected by systemic racism a big part of systemic racism is the environmental contamination that was present and that led to the issue of what was originally called environmental racism and now environmental justice where you place black communities and other communities of color and poor communities directly in the path of producing excuse me pollution producing industries like landfills and incinerators and in some instances confined animal feeding operations and so long before mr eric gardner or mr george floyd or the 70 plus other people who were murdered while screen while saying that they could not breathe communities black communities and communities of color were insisting that they had an inability to breathe thanks in large part to where they lived and the contaminants to which they were exposed on a daily basis and their voices were largely ignored but it's hard to ignore the data for example people of color are much more likely to live near facilities near polluters and breathe polluted air they have 1.35 times higher burden of facilities in their communities than the average population and non-whites had a 2.8 times higher so the first group was black americans which is with a 54 increase for african americans in those facilities in their neighborhoods they were also exposed to environmental pollution at a rate a rate that far exceeds their white counterparts and we heard some of this from dr annenberg when we talk about pollutants one of the ones that i'd like to just bring up quickly is particle pollution or pm particulate matter because this is important um there is a there are studies that have been done about the potential relationship between particulate matter and called it 19 and the thought the theory being that the coven 19 uh virus particles sort of pitch a ride on particulate matter which allows them to enter into the lower lobes of the of the so if you have a person uh who is already at risk because they're breathing in polluted air and and being exposed to environmental contaminants they're already compromised right they already have difficulties in breeding they have increased asthma rates increased chronic obstructive pulmonary disease rates increased cardiovascular issues but also because of where they live they may lack access to healthy foods so that you may see increases in diabetes and other health effects all of these pre-existing conditions make people more at risk from other environmental harms for example just talking about um uh climate change severe weather uh events for example let's talk about heat um communities were placed uh because of racist practices as i mentioned earlier in areas that did not have much green space so some of them are considered to be urban heat island where the heat is absorbed by the concrete during the day and released slowly at night but there's really nowhere for it to go there's very little tree cover access to parks is um something that most people in these communities are not familiar with and also because of infrastructure issues the uh some of the communities that i work with have said what we're doing is heating or cooling the outside because the homes are so are lacking in um structure or correct being correctly built also because of the the fact that these communities as i mentioned earlier about the economic aspects live below the poverty line in most cases they can't afford to pay a utility bill so they don't run the air conditioner they don't run the heat if they have access to it and those are things that have to be considered and have to be addressed when we talk about the effects of climate change also have almost half of latinx and black americans black people live near national priorities or superfund sites and are and are also exposed to diesel particulate matter and we've just heard dr edinburgh talk about that the um proximity to high traffic areas so lack of green space lack of cooling centers energy bills all of those things are um some of the effects that we see and when you add that to uh the health effects that we see in these communities in general living in an area that recently flooded you can't afford to have your home raised so you can't get home insurance so you may be living in a home that is for example filled with mold now that is another attack on your respiratory system so let's just say that that is the current condition then you in in um you know we see the appearance of covet 19. this pandemic has highlighted a host of racial and geographic and class disparities we know that black hispanic and native americans have died and are dying from covet at nearly three times the rate of their white counterparts and that was a according to a cdc analysis non-hispanic black and asian health care workers are more likely to contract covet and die from it than their white counterparts so what we have now with all of these with racism with environmental exposures environmental challenges environmental threats and climate change and covid19 is a syndemic a cindemic is a set of linked health problems that interact and compound each other's effects any one of these on their own can be deadly can be deadly but together they are spectacularly um effective in causing death and illness among minority communities we've come full circle and hopefully i've shown you how systemic racism is the public health threat that a lot of um agencies and entities are calling it and that many of us are dealing with these every day and because of systemic racism and because of all of these other conditions lies are destroyed and health is destroyed but there is hope i think we'll be talking about that later thank you very much thank you dr hollis and we will turn it over now to dr dewine white houston hello everyone can you see my slides yes awesome thank you so much uh let me just uh so first of all thank you dean goldman and dr annenberg and dr perry for the opportunity to be here today and even having this conversation and i just want to also appreciate my friend and colleague dr hollis as always for setting the stage wonderfully and so i'm just going to add a little bit more um but before i jump into my comments i want to acknowledge that i am calling from my home in southeastern michigan on the original but stolen lands of the padawatami so when i reflect on the opportunities that i've had to work across different sectors this conversation around environmental justice raises a couple of questions when i think about the time i spent as a chemical engineer working in manufacturing in really really nasty plants across this country i often ask the question why are most of our nastiest manufacturing facilities always located in low-income communities or communities of color and then i have opportunity to work for state government and i questioned uh to dr annenberg's point earlier why the air monitoring system seemed to not be as present in the hot spots or the communities that really needed to know what pollution they were breathing in and while i was at uh we act for environmental justice for a couple years and running the federal policy office i continue to ask the same question why on capitol hill there weren't enough advocates representing the issues of low-income communities and communities of color in these offices talking about health and climate and equity and then i think again on my last five years in philanthropy as a grant maker and why in 2020 and now in 2021 we still see these ridiculous disparities between the amount of funds going to people of color-led organizations versus white-led organizations or mainstream environmental organizations and so as i continue to ask these questions which i hope you can appreciate as students and researchers uh i cannot not think about the environmental injustice and the way it shows up in all these particular spaces and places and so that brings me to the question that i want to posit to you all today who's most vulnerable the institution or the people so as public health professionals we tend to use the word vulnerability but really i don't know if too many people that like to be labeled as vulnerable but when i think about my grandparents who have gone on to heaven now but lived in their late 80s and 90s and i was their primary caregiver for some time and it was my responsibility to make sure that the systems whether it be the health care system the utility providers social services worked on their behalf and so while my grandparents had some characteristics definitely that would make them more at risk particularly to the impacts of climate change and extreme heat which drove the subject of my dissertation research it also really exposed the vulnerabilities of the institutions and systems that contributed to their risk so from a climate change standpoint there were many things the limited understanding of how homes could actually be hazardous to your hazards to your health if they were in urban heat islands with no parks and less green space the fact that energy remained unaffordable particularly for folks on a fixed income a lot of the seniors that i worked with that doctors really weren't making the connection between climate impacts and the environments that many of the seniors were living in and then this translation of heat science and hazards had not yet woven itself through the institutions that were supposed to protect people like my grandparents and their neighbors so when i think about that and the fact that i've been working on these issues for many years i again notice trends in my grandparents experiences and even in my work experiences that just seem to be the same things that exacerbate these injustices particularly on the climate side so i think about the systems that blame the individual particularly low-income communities and communities of color versus the system being broken because we know that again we only can make the choices that we can in our environment and if our environment doesn't present us with choices that can help us be healthy and sustain us then that's a problem really not acknowledging to dr hollis's point the racist policies both historical and current that again contribute to the lower base line of health that we see in many of our communities because of lack of access because of lack of access to good education or investment or even the ability to get covet testing and then i think about which is really again striking but the insufficient root cause analysis that happens around the disparities that we do see that oftentimes we don't ask the question why enough and get down to really what is driving this disparity leaving the impacted folks out of the solution so coming up with solutions in a box or in an ivory tower that doesn't involve those that are most impacted and of course the thing that i hit on all the time is accountability or the lack thereof accountabilities particularly for the institutions that are supposed to protect us and our health so our reality of climate and justice and health disparities is one that is really of no surprise because we are on shaky foundation i hope you all can agree and as it's been stated before our health is connected to so many things where we live how much we make our education how we are treated or mistreated in our legal system our access to green space all these different pieces and so when i think about these injustices and and the factors and their connections i get excited because we all have the power to actually shift this we have the power to change what we're seeing we can begin to rebuild a stronger foundation by challenging those norms by using research and data and science and partnerships to disentangle the conditions that continue to elevate the risk particularly for our indigenous brothers and sisters our low-income communities our communities of color and other folks that are at risk and so what's great is that there are organizations that have already been in beginning to challenge these norms and set the stage for a stronger foundation particularly at this intersection of climate change health and environmental injustice and so as i think about many of the public health leaders the community health workers that are on the front line have been on the front line the nurses the medical practitioners and those that we are partnering with in communities what has been critical i think to their progress has always been shaping their solutions and keeping people at the center because we can do good planning we can protest we can write good policy and and change our practices and use our power for good but all of that is not it's done for not if we don't keep people at the center of what we're doing and so as a recovering dc policy advocate i am heartened and encouraged by the current administration statements and efforts to make climate change and racial justice a priority particularly across all government institutions and i was reflecting because back in 2016 i had written this piece in a journal called the black scholar that highlighted the characteristics of what an approach to climate justice could look like and i'm excited because several of the ideas that were presented in this this paper have been elevated on multiple community platforms and efforts by advocates across the country which again is super exciting and a change from what we've seen over the past several years or at least the last four but again we can't just rely on policy we have to consider the vulnerability of all of our institutions that we depend on our health care system our schools of higher education are institutions that deliver water and energy our local state and federal governments and places of research because the climate and environmental justices we continue to see are the result of racism and the shaky foundation that we have built in this united states and we have to change so how do we begin to change philanthropy how do we begin to change how we invest in what we invest in how do we begin to shape research questions that get at the root cause and how do we run our government again we already have foundational principles like the environmental justice principles and the climate justice principles that were deca that were created decades ago to start from so we're not starting from scratch but my humble suggestion is that in terms of the institutions there are three things that need to be done institutions first of all need to create intersectional agendas and platforms and policies that align support in the needs of community experts and those that have been harmed the most again that that needs to drive the work of the institutional level the second piece is that institutions must begin to do their own equity analysis again ask those questions who's benefiting who's being hurt unintentionally and how can we do this better and last but not least i believe institutions must build in a system of accountability because again we can't change what we don't measure so again as a public health practitioner whether you're current or future or changing or wherever you sit i encourage you to utilize your power and privilege to adapt and that is acknowledging harm demanding accountability addressing racism power and privilege prioritizing equity in whatever you do and in that way we can begin to transform systems and doing that in a way that is in love and not fear so i hope you might have answered this question for yourself and really as i think about the core tenet of my practice now in terms of transforming communities using people-centered solutions i firmly believe that the only way we are going to begin to change the lives of folks like my grandparents my parents and probably many folks you know is to begin to transform these institutions and rebuild back on a solid foundation so again our institutions must begin to honor the right of everyone despite where you come from what you look like or who you're connected to so we can get to that aspirational environmental justice where people can live work play and pray in homes and communities that offer the quality and the quantity of life that everyone deserves so with that thank you so much for your attention i'm looking forward to the discussion thank you so much dr white newsom and we will turn now to dr melissa perry that was inspiring wow i feel so grateful extremely grateful dr annenberg dr hollis dr white newsome you do us real pride and it's a real pleasure to have you in this department of environmental occupational health at gw your vision your research your messages are really inspiring thanks everyone for putting this together as a really important opportunity to highlight these major intersections between environmental justice and climate change i wanted to just make a couple of brief points about the science because it very much feeds the source of inequity so if we understand about carbon dioxide being the most important greenhouse gas and the way in which emissions have have advanced just gonna have advanced over the past century at the same time the way in which temperature has changed radically it really demonstrates what's been happening on a global scale and the question becomes well how is this distributed uh globally we know that in terms of the current carbon dioxide levels that were at 405 parts per million an increase in about 1.8 degrees fahrenheit since pre-industrial levels that by 2050 we are looking at 2 degrees celsius 450 parts per million increase which really puts us at a dangerous tipping point and then here's the goal for the paris accord that the u.s pulled out of that we're due hopefully the biden administration will put the u.s back in of 1.5 celsius increase that's really where we're trying to get but you can recognize how that measures below where we actually need to be but how much work and how much effort it's taking to get there so why do i bring this up i bring it up because of when you think about this globally where the distribution of emissions come from you quickly see across the globe that the most highest levels of emissions are not coming and not distributing equally they're coming from the more industrialized higher income countries but how about the burden how about the burden of impacts and where does that happen who's at highest risk and i raised this to talk about on a macro scale and bring it down to a micro scale so the emitters are the most affluent countries the most resource countries the countries that are experiencing the ravages the burdens of climate change are the more under-resourced countries and that is very much playing out as we've been hearing from our presenters in terms of how it impacts the united states what are we doing about it so it seems as though when i first came to the department about 11 years ago the importance of climate change was really just emerging if you can imagine because things have moved very very quickly in the past 10 years so in fact when i came to be department chair and said our department's going to have a very strong focus on climate change believe it or not that was partly controversial there was still a lot of detraction there's still a lot of skepticism just 11 years ago and other department veterans like dr peter lapuma can attest to the fact that very few people at that time in the country were talking about the intersection between climate change and public health so it's only in recent years have we really said well actually what parts of public health are not being impacted by climate change if you really think about it and if public health is very much an access to medical care and so when you're extreme experiencing extreme weather events look like extreme heat or tropical storms or arid conditions or power outages like we just saw in texas you can't get access to medical care if your basic electrical systems aren't working but what's interesting also not only that it took us this long to come to terms with the fact that climate change is all about public health also these inequities that we've been talking about it has not been obvious and it's really through the murder of george floyd and this awakening to environmental justice and systemic racism have we seen the critical intersection so globally we're seeing major inequities but um locally in this country we're also seeing major inequities as spoken about so eloquently by dr hollis and dr white newsom so dr newsom asked us what are you all going to do about it and i'm sure that there are many students online today and we really want you to take away a message of tremendous opportunity i heard optimism from dr hollis from dr white newsom tremendous opportunity i can say personally the past four years have been a dark period in realizing some of the opportunity that i knew when i came to gw we could accomplish as a department being in the nation's capital i thought that we were poised to make major aggressive change on climate action and the past four years have been difficult to endure but the good news is that there's no better time like than now to be involved in environmental justice activism and also climate and health research public health awareness public health analysis and also policy and contributing to those areas that we know are very very much necessary and where we have to make major inroads so i wanted to give you a few examples of what's happening in eoh we've just launched the online mph concentration in climate and health this was work that the department had put forward led by dr annenberg dr sabrina mccormick and others contributing to getting more and more focus in in climate and health our longer term vision is actually an online mph eoh degree in that area but for the time being we'll be offering this concentration and that will be offered starting in september we also have assembled a climate and health center and that's been bringing people together across the university students researchers very much interested in climate and health very much led by dr annenberg several students that are funded by a gw grant dr mccormick dr lapuma they're they're all contributing to convening greater and greater interest both from a research and a public health perspective and then also the climate and media lab some of you may be familiar with dr sabrina sabrina mccormick's work she's had international acclaim in telling stories about climate and health and bringing a very informative and also personal perspective in an artistic way and so her lab is a way in which she can bring students and into learning how to produce documentary films that are very much science-based and science informed we also have the environmental justice action network that was founded by lauren johnson one of our moderators for today's panel and so i'm going to ask lauren to put the link in the chat so that you can have access to getting more information about the justice action network that students can be involved with it's entirely a student-run student founded organization focusing on environmental justice we've been doing a number of things in our department including our diversity and inclusion subcommittee which has developed a series of presentations on environmental justice issues here's a list of some of the many topics that we're covering at the end of on march 29th we'll be talking about water policy and research and environmental justice and i'm rushing through this because i want to get to the panel and i also wanted to mention the important work of dr ami zota and her colleagues at environmental health news they have given voice to neglected voices they've given prominence to neglected voices in environmental health and environmental justice and this is focused on up-and-coming researchers and leaders of color who are providing blogs and also podcasts to shine a light on environmental health and environmental justice issues that are timely so my message to all of you is that climate change at its very heart is a phenomenon of injustice it exacerbates uh injustice and disparities and that there is much that we're doing and much that you all can do to contribute to reducing those greenhouse gas gas emissions and impacting uh and affecting communities of color that are more disproportionately impacted about from climate injustice so with that i'm excited to get started with the panel thank you so much dr perry and thank you to all of our panelists such inspiring and motivating uh talks just really appreciate hearing your perspectives and i'm just feeling really grateful to be a part of this department and part of the school and to be able to know you all so now we're going to transition to our q a moderated discussion and we're going to be joined by two of our current mph students in the department of environmental occupational health at gw and so we already heard about lauren johnson lauren johnson is an mph student in environmental health science and policy she's the co-founder of the environmental justice action network at gw and is helping to support the climate health research network at gw thank you lauren for being here and also nick pendleton is also an mph student working on his global environmental health mph um and is also supporting the climate and health uh research network at gw and um nick uh was was a co-author on a study that got a lot of attention and is still being reported on by the new york times david team showing how redlining has contributed to persistent um disparities in heat exposure in u.s cities so thank you nick for that work and for being here today and i'll turn it over to you guys thank you dr edenberg first of all thank you all panelists for such an enlightening seminar we definitely learned a lot about a conversation that needs to be addressed more often um so we'll first start with some questions and we would also like for any and all attendees to post questions in the q and a so that we can address those but the first one could be for dr amber dr ollis or dr white newsome should we focus more on climate mitigation or adaptation when lawmakers are producing equitable climate policies to combat air pollution and achieve climate justice um i'll start um um so just from um the work that i do while i think that both are are necessary i think right now we do focus more on mitigation and in order to create resilient communities we need to prepare ahead of time as opposed to picking up the pieces afterwards and that is just um from discussions with communities who are their questions have been people know that this area is going to flood people know that you know these are where we live is more susceptible to whatever the extreme weather con effect is so why aren't they prepared in advance why don't they prepare in advance and give us what we need so that we are able to um you know rebound or prepare for exposure so thank you i'll just add yeah i think um both is the easy answer but but i do think it's the answer i'm going to go with because you know mitigation is imperative i mean we have to be undertaking mitigation to avoid really dangerous climate change in the future um at the same time we can't wait uh there are people suffering now and so we also need to be undertaking adaptation and and doing both in parallel um mitigation is where i think we'll you know achieve all these co-benefits that i was talking about where if we earn less stuff you know figure out ways to reduce our combustion of fossil fuels of biofuels we will mitigate both climate change air pollution contribute to public health improvements and you know in ways that extend beyond heat and air quality and extreme events too if you think about things like shifting transportation from personal vehicles to bike ridership and active transportation you get physical physical activity and cardiovascular benefits as well and unless it's honestly you know too long to mention here in terms of it's evaluation so i'll stop there and see if anybody else wants to apply to dog wants to reply too the only thing that i would add is uh i would say both and i think definitely historically a lot of effort has been spent on mitigation which is great because we need to address the source of the problem but of course communities have been suffering and continue to suffer because adaptation has taken a back seat but what i will say as we go down both of those paths we cannot not make sure that we when we do respond that we're not recreating the problem because i think a lot of even when we do begin to adapt sometimes we adapt in i would say a stupid way and so we're actually not solving the problem for the issue that happened so how do we build back not in the same way we need to build back differently and smarter so i would just add that on all right great um so for this one to echo that i really love the presentation thank you so much for the pants for being here but um for our next question for dr perry she was i'm asking about the climate health concentration and when it become available if you're already involved in the program you are also enrolled in that as well yeah yes you certainly can it will be available in september so now is a great time to be looking at the program and dr annenberg dr mccormick have information about it we're getting the um advertisement distributed on the web very very soon and so this was a fortuitous opportunity to make sure that everyone was available it's really intended we already have a great bolus of courses online that are focused on climate and health including sustainable energy climate change social change and a course that i've been teaching for the past four or five years which is researching climate and health and then we're also offering a new course which is looking at climate change and systemic change which is from the perspective of a variety of different lenses policy makers documentary filmmakers atmospheric scientists epidemiologists those different angles that people take to contribute to actual solutions both the science and also the communication and the policy impacts so that course is going to feature a variety of different perspectives but yes we're ready to go live in september as i say it's taken a lot of care and feeding and tlc to make it happen but it also has been very much in response to our students so i talked about the darker days where we couldn't always get traction as to the connections between climate and health if you could imagine well our students are pushing and clamoring for more and more and that's what we're responding to well thank you so much dr perry for the answer i do understand we are at time at one o'clock p.m and i know you have an obligation um at this moment but if anyone else is available to stay on we would like to get through a few more questions um so one of them is just considering the opportunities that exist now in the bible administration what are some possible changes of federal legislation you're most focused on this year and what opportunities now exist that was not present before for climate health equity environmental justice well um you know i'm um focused a lot on the work behind the executive orders you know not the um i mean i'm excited by the fact that so far 38 have been released but more than 12 of those specifically mentioned environmental justice and now it comes you know the question becomes how are these going to be implemented and i say that um because we have a number of people um in the administration now who have experienced environmental justice experience so to be exciting to watch how that plays out i'm also hardened by the fact that science is back in um its rightful place and you know because of the importance behind it when it comes to data analysis and data gathering so that's what i'll be watching and in the past what we have not had is science being recognized for its importance or the effect of a variety of different issues around environmental justice so this is an important historic time for us but it's not the only time this should be the beginning of the way things are to continue so that um and sort of what dr newsom uh said uh white newsome said that you know um that things are going to be you know are going to be different like there is no normal for me there's a new normal and that new normal involves everybody so thank you yeah the only thing that i would add i mean i don't work directly on federal policy anymore but what i will say is one thing that i am encouraged about is the fact that there is conversation as to how you're you're you're assessing risk and not doing it in silos i think the environmental protection agency and other agencies have talked a lot about previous impacts and it's been like this really hard thing to measure to quantify to push and appreciate and so my hope is that that becomes not just another part of this conversation but there are actually actions taken on that how do you begin to assess cumulative risk whether it's department of transportation epa whatever and do that in a way that is in partnership with those communities that have been experiencing multiple environmental insults for so long so that that's one thing that i that i am excited about and i hope um you know on the other end will bring more accountability to all of these institutions at the federal state and local level that are responsible and are charged with protecting our health one of the things one of the specific things i'm excited about is the focus on mapping environmental justice because we're in a position now that i don't think we were in the last time the federal government had major action on environmental justice and that's in these novel exposure assessment tools like satellite remote sensing and distributed networks of low cost sensors and mobile monitoring so we have the ability now to have information at the neighborhood scale in a way that we didn't before and i think that's going to shed a lot of light on the you know what neighborhoods are experiencing and um you know who you know where we might uh marshal our efforts to improve quality of life for people all right i believe um dean goldman you had a question i do have a question for each one of you actually so one of the things that um jomon mentioned that i think is so important is the need to um impact philanthropy and how philanthropies look at this issue and i was struck earlier this year by the fact that um bill gates who came up with a new book about climate and is in embracing you know climate as an issue for philanthropy is so silent about climate and health where he and i i'm seeing that what dr perry said and i'm sorry that we monitored what dr perry said it's still true in many queries even people who recognize how significant the climate problem is don't see the connection to health so selfishly i'm asking you guys you know if you had 15 20 seconds with bill gates you know on an elevator you know you know the vaunted elevator speech how would you use that time to put this issue in front of him why should he be cognizant that health is linked to climate what should what should his foundation and other foundations other philanthropists be doing to support us as we're trying to address this issue i don't know who wants to go first like this i i chill on maybe since you raised it oh boy um i you know coming from again the kresge foundation where we spent a lot of energy no pun intended really trying to solidify that connection between climate change health and equity and it was a privilege and honor to be a part of that program but i would say you know it's still again a hard sell for some reason which seems ridiculous to you know philanthropy to kind of get behind what do we really need to push on the issue and push more investment and so um in thinking about a conversation with mr gates i mean i guess i would maybe say two things one investing more in communities and frontline communities and and their solutions is is it's it's a non-starter um and then the second piece which i think is one of the the gaps and challenges we have a huge infrastructure problem particularly in our low to medium uh size communities particularly around water infrastructure which i spent a lot of time on and there's these these gaps and investments that continue to put these communities at risk multiple communities um that are either on the other side of the tracks or you know have dilapidated infrastructure so really kind of trying to see investments that will bring like sustaining change in communities that and and i think about water infrastructure because i think about the leading copper pipes and those issues i think about combined sewer overflows like that is something that's super personal to me and so i would ask him to invest in communities but also invest in infrastructure in the communities that don't seem to get the investments that they need yeah um i totally agree with what um jalon said and also um someone just asked me this question not just about um mr gates but also about um bezos and i forgot his name the gentleman who wants to plant three billion trees and um the my answer is would be the same for each of them is look at the impact of what you're doing um i know for what um bill gates wants to do there is some potential impact on communities but then i would also say look at who's around the table when you're coming up with these um issues who are your partners why are you not involved you know who's missing from the table where are the communities you know and people need to step out of of their silo for sure but you need to ensure that those who are going to be most affected have a voice in whatever project you're coming up with um and i think that there's a lot of these are opportunities for economic growth for example with the the billion trees who's going to maintain that whole you know i think it's a great idea but it's also an opportunity for farmers for uh people to have jobs maintaining these uh issues so maintaining these um um objectives so i think that for for him i would say first of all you can't talk about climate change without talking about health there's just no way you can do that and then you within that you have to talk about environmental health environmental justice so i would corner him literally in an elevator to tell him that you're leaving out more than half the story and then invite him to speak with people who could um provide that knowledge for him you know who could partner with him to give him that missing piece of information all great ideas too a very difficult question thank you goldman for challenging us i think i would just start from saying you know the whatever strategy we choose we have to bring multiple stakeholders in the public along with us and it has really helped the lens of health that galvanizes people and you know whenever you see these uh um studies of public perception of climate change and and which messengers are most effective you know health always comes out on top and hearing from doctors in the health community um really is an effective way to um inform people about climate change and so i think it's a um you know it's a key uh lens that need is needed to be brought into the equation to bring multiple stakeholders along and with that it looks like we are probably out of time and we've gone over actually so thank you so much all of our panelists round of applause for everyone i know it's very hard in the remote uh cyber space we're living in but really enjoyed it today and thank you so much dean goldman for bringing us together and um and hosting us really appreciate it and thanks to all of you who stayed with us a little bit over time it was great to have such a wonderful audience with us today for this uh seminar we'll be in touch with you about future topics some of which probably will involve environmental health as well but i i'm so appreciative not only to dr annenberg but also to tonia vollmer and natasha kazim for helping us to organize um this and and thanks also to nick pendleton who works with dr annenberg thank you so much it's so exciting to see our trainees involved with issues that are so important nationally bye and it's been been a real privilege lauren um adrian and jalon to be able to to see you as well and in this bye you", "lfMTyxMx5Pw": "an affordable fragrance-free alcohol-free mask safe makeup routine for sensitive skin the video hasn't even started but you are welcome yes this took forever to put together but i care about your skin and as your acne big sister who also knows what it feels like to waste an entire paycheck on products that promised not to irritate my skin but then did i wish that i had had guidance like this or options like these that we will talk about in just a second to put on my face that made me feel and look my best without causing additional damage now that being said this does come with a disclaimer because no i do not hate artificial fragrance or perfume in skincare or makeup products and i don't hate denatured alcohol either i understand how in the right formulas these can be a part of the formulation process or can be essential to the way the product works on the skin that being said i fully understand there are some people who do have a true fragrance allergy and want to avoid artificial fragrance or who don't like denatured alcohol and that's who this routine is for and yes you can find most if not all of these things at drugstores like ulta um oh and yes they are vegan and cruelty free are you welcome are you welcome do you do you love me because i mean this took forever but you know it's so worth it this video is also in partnership with nyx professional makeup who has options for all skin tones some of which are artificial fragrance free vegan and cruelty free isopropyl alcohol free and not all of their products are but i searched for the ones that would be best for sensitive skin and yes support skin colors and tones of every variation so that we actually have options for our sensitive skin that wants to wear makeup every once in a while or every day i don't judge you as long as you don't sleep in it just remove that stuff before you go to bed oh and did i mention they're 14 when it comes to your skincare routine your skincare routine really is the prep for your makeup if you have a really nice protected base underneath your makeup is going to apply better and that is why things like spf your bff and makeup primers are important but let's start with the skincare aspect you want to make sure that your face is protected after your serums and your moisturizer should come your sunscreen and i have two different options for you the first is this one from isn't tree it's the hyaluronic acid watery sun gel at spf 50 and it's the one i'm currently using it has niacinamide and ceramides these are super soothing to the skin and this has hyaluronic acid that actually helps the sunscreen and helps your skin doesn't dehydrate your skin or degrade the sunscreen which yes some hyaluronic acid products can do hyaluronic acid is a glycosaminoglycan and sometimes the sodium form sodium hyaluronate is used in products and that is basically a big bunch of fancy words and fancy talk for the fact that if you put a hyaluronic acid serum or moisturizer on your face that is not moisturizing the way it should it could actually grab onto sunscreen if you apply it right after and cause a little bit of issues with the way that this creates a film or sets up on the skin in the words of my dear dr dre you know i simp but this one is amazing again it's a korean sunscreen it's a korean filter so it is an organic slash chemical filter but this goes onto the skin so nicely and it does not leave a white cast which we love because we don't want that flashing back underneath our makeup if we take a photo but we still want to be protected from the sun but going this one is affordable you can get it on style vonna on yes style on amazon etc but what if you want a physical mineral block well i also have an option for you that i am fresh out of because i literally use this physical sunscreen the way paula deen does butter the australian gold tinted face mineral sunscreen spf 50 is a ride or die and yes it is tinted but it is for men and women um it does work on most skin types if you are a fitzpatrick type one it might be too dark if you are if it's patrick type six it might be a little bit too light however you can get it to blend in really nicely this has a base of shea butter it is so super soothing on the skin again it is vegan it is cruelty free it is artificial fragrance free it is denatured alcohol free it is all of the things except for cost free but it's only 16 which is very close to free especially when we're talking about sunscreens it has a gorgeous tint it has no white cast and again spf is your bff because it really protects your face this goes so nicely under makeup it smooths on so well and if you haven't tried either of these again they are affordable i cannot recommend them enough now after that it's time to talk about primers and nyx professional cosmetics creates literally my two favorite face primers because number one not only are they all the things free and only 14 at ulta but they also work well underneath foundation they work to fill in my acne scars and they grip my makeup onto my face like the gorilla glue hair but without being gorilla glue and not putting in your hair and not having it stay on yourself for a month and having to go to a plastic surgeon to get it taken out of your hair that poor human my heart goes out to her but in like a less aggressive and less tick-tock viral form of that that's what i consider these because they keep the makeup on my face at least until the end of the day which is what i want them to do this right here is the nyx professional makeup shine killer primer this is my favorite for oily prone skin and it has a little bit of charcoal in it and here's the thing when it comes to people who have sensitive skin a lot of people who have sensitive skin and oily skin look for primers but most oily skin primers are made for people with acne so they have things like salicylic acid which is great we love salicylic acid it is phenomenal however it can be irritating to people who have oily skin but aren't necessarily acne prone and they're looking for something that is for sensitive skin and it's soothing not exfoliating this is infused with charcoal so it can wick away oil and shine from the skin but again it doesn't have any of those ingredients that actually fight acne or might cause irritation in some people it's super gentle on the skin and it has that really nice primary feel and it comes out black and then watch it's like magic and it blends in to be completely invisible and transparent is that not the coolest thing this sits on my skin so nicely and what i love about nyx professional cosmetics both on their website and on ulta is that it says you can wear this under makeup as a great base for primer or you can just wear this alone if you are embracing the makeup free look you are letting your skin glow and shine through this can help to control the oil so that you're not as greasy but it's not going to give you additional color coverage if you don't want that again it's 14 they also have a six dollar one and i'm actually looking at myself in these lights and she a little shiny today so i'm gonna take this i'm just gonna stripe it right on over um and we're just going to be a little bit mattified because we kill the shine for the rest of today's video cash me with no shine how about a hat now let's say that you're not shiny but you do have scars from acne or other reasons you're trying to smooth out texture in the skin i cannot recommend this enough this is the pore filler primer i used to use other primers um 10 years ago when my acne was at its worst and i used to pay like 50 bucks 60 bucks for a tube of primer which was good it was moisture wicking but it was discontinued by the brand and this didn't exist yet and again this is 14 or like six to eight dollars if you get the small size this is the pore filler again it is completely artificial fragrance free it is completely isopropyl alcohol free it is vegan and cruelty free and it is all of the things that i expect and at a price that is pleasantly unexpected this pore filler is one of the driest touch but still skin soothing primers i have ever used you can almost see i want to describe it almost like bouncy cottage cheese do you see how it's almost got like this ricotta texture to it and then it blends right into the skin and i want to show you one hand compared to the other because you know our skin naturally has wrinkles and creases do you see that it's like it smooths them over like a literal blur and as long as you don't cake this stuff on it does not peel up over sunscreen or under foundation this stuff is amazing and if you have acne scars if you have the box car or ice pick scars like i do this is absolutely phenomenal if you do have small amounts of texture to your face whether it's from acne piterosporum folliculitis aka fungal acne even if you've got rosacea there's nothing in here that should irritate it and by the way sunscreen is helpful for rosacea fyi but this goes onto the skin so nicely it is so soothing and actually helps to smooth over and fill in some of those scars again i love that the brand actually says you can embrace your face without makeup if you want and this gives you kind of like that smoothed instagram filter in real life look without having to apply color cosmetics but if you did want to apply color cosmetics you could apply them right over the top of this and again these hold foundation to your face until you're ready to take them off now in comes a little cast caveat because there are some other options that are still vegan they are still cruelty free and they are still denatured alcohol free but these do have a little bit of fragrance flash perfume not pushing this on anyone and if you are not interested in these then feel free to go to this time stamp you can just kind of skip forward but i must say that if you have dry skin if you don't mind fragrance and you're looking for something a little fun or if you want something luminizing and glowy then honey i do got something for you you see what i did there this is the honeydew me up primer slash base this has these little gold flecks in it and if you are someone who likes the glow if you are someone who wants that luminosity to shine literally through the skin do you see how goopy this is it is vegan so there is no actual honey in it but it is honeydew and this is very close to honey in my opinion it goes on super sheer it really blends down nice or if you just want to use a little bit kind of here on your cheekbones and a little bit on your nose it sits nicely on top of foundation and it has those little flecks that are like reflective gold color that actually give you luminosity if you're a little bit more dry there's also the hydra touch i really like this one especially for the price this one almost feels like a moisturizer that holds makeup to your face i know they call it a hydro touch primer and i guess it is but like literally i would describe this as a smoothing moisturizer that holds onto the face it kind of reminds me of the neutrogena water cream actually the texture is very similar but neutrogena is not cruelty free or vegan but nyx professional cosmetics is just saying you know i'm picky about this stuff and if you are someone who is all about color correction this is the bright maker and i just have to say especially for those who are fitzpatrick type four or five or six this is so nice it has a little bit of an orange tint to it as well so if you do have hyperpigmentation if you have a little bit of discoloration to the skin this can really help and it actually smells like almost like a papaya smoothie actually it doesn't you know what i always say papaya because i think papaya smells good but does anyone ever realize that papaya sometimes smells a little bit like barf like have you ever smelled the papaya like it's delicious and i eat papayas all the time but like they smell a little bit like barf um so i would say this smells like a tropical fruit smoothie because it smells good not like papaya but when you are sold a papaya smoothie that's what this smells like i cannot tell you guys enough how much i love these and as long as you have a really good base that is both protecting and smoothing out anything underneath the skin your foundation is going to go on much more flawlessly but then let's talk about that because yes there are a lot of foundations out there that put fragrance into their products and again this is okay this is not a bad thing i don't hate fragrance but i understand some people want to avoid it and especially if you are you know a prick for cruelty-free vegan options like yours truly you don't want to compromise your morals and values and use products that might irritate your skin um when you could have options that don't do that so this is where some of my favorite products come in these are from nyx professional makeup total control foundation drops nyx professional makeup was one of the first brands that ever came out with literally like 40 to 100 shades they launched these amazing like drop makeup foundation things and you could build foundation onto your skin this is kind of like the second gen of that but they actually launched with inclusive shades which is so appreciated and again they have tons of shades when it comes to this formula as well but they also have these little mix-ins you know someone would look at this on the shelf and be like why is this bright yellow what am i going to do with this on my skin or like how am i going to make this weird red tone look and you realize you're actually supposed to take this out and you use this to drop in and be a cosmetic chemist be an artist when it comes to your face in the morning and you can actually mix in the shades that you need smooths onto my pores so nicely and it feels like rubbing mashed potatoes onto my skin imagine moisturizing mashed potatoes that don't like gum up but actually feel really soothing on the skin and protect the skin yes like a liquid mashed potato don't don't you know what don't question me just roll with it just try it and you'll see what i'm saying anyways they actually have these total control pro drops and this one is in the dark shade and as you can see um it's a very dark brown almost black and so if you have the blackest most melanated skin if you're african-american this is actually something that's going to work for you and you can build your color especially if there are other brands that are not inclusive and you need something to make your previous purchases work for you and if you are someone who has more yellow undertones to your skin and you're constantly struggling to find something that works this is something i would highly recommend again this is the yellow color if you are a fitzpatrick type one if foundations are never the right shade for you if your face is literally as pasty as this bed sheet that i use as a backdrop then this is what i would recommend again it's a pure white pigment just in one of these liquid drops from the nyx total control and you just drop this into your foundation to actually make it match you i can't recommend these enough again vegan and cruelty free but also when we do look at those ingredients this doesn't have a bunch of those extra fragrances this doesn't even have oils or plant extracts that could irritate the most sensitive of skins which is really wonderful because it's actual color cosmetics it's actual professional makeup at an affordable price that does what we want it to do and doesn't have all those fancy things and again you know that every now and again i love a good fancy thing but to actually have options that i can recommend that's what i'm here to do this basically has some dimethicone ingredients and then pigments and that's it then you mix it into the foundation which guess what has many of the similar ingredients too again it's basically this dimethicone it's very liquidy so you can actually build it up in coverage and then it does have that pigment so you only need a couple of drops to get a really good base for your face my two best colors are vanilla and natural and again the fact that they're 14 means that i can actually mix them to my skin's needs my acne used to be so bad and i was so insecure thinking that the world judged me based on how i looked that i needed super full coverage makeup every single day and um now that i've gotten a little bit older i've gotten more comfortable with my skin and my scars it's looking really good right now like it is looking excellent especially because about a week and a half ago at the time that i'm filming this it looked like this which was definitely not ideal but again i'm not hating myself over it which is nice but now that i can embrace my skin with a little bit less makeup if i don't want to wear a bunch of it i don't have to i can just go for a drop or two or again i could load this up and do five or six if i so choose and that is the beauty of being an artist and using your face as the canvas that it is a little picasso you the thing i love about this formula is that it is liquidy but you can build it because they don't have all these extra ingredients that other foundations do there aren't any ingredients in here that are going to clash with a sunscreen or there aren't any fragrances in here that are going to clash with a salicylic acid from you know an acne primer uh you know and cause like degradation or some chemical reactions on the skin and usually with color cosmetics that doesn't happen that's a very rare thing but for those who have super sensitive skin you have to be a little bit more careful and that's why this is where i start and then once you've got your foundation applied it is time to talk about powders and sprays and again most sprays have a little bit of isopropyl alcohol but we'll talk about that at the end because that actually discusses why i don't hate isopropyl alcohol and why i see reasons for denatured alcohol in products if you do have super sensitive skin i find loose powders to be a little bit more gentle and delicate because you don't have to stab your face with a brush but i also recommend powders that actually have sunscreen in them again this is for sensitive skin and whether you have sensitive skin that is rosacea prone sensitive skin with acne sensitive skin with hyperpigmentation all of these conditions can be exacerbated by guess what your friend the good old son that gives you uva uvb and yes even uvc rays even though the uvc rays are blocked by the atmosphere unless you're a welder in which case you better be wearing a helmet moral of this story is that you need sunscreen and yes i would recommend that underneath your foundation as well as using it in a way that you can reapply throughout the day this one is from super goop you just kind of dust it on there's also this one from color science this is an spf 50 as well and this is actually made for rosacea prone skin in mind there's also the dr sandra lee md she has a really good one that's probably my favorite but i am fresh out and all these are are basically these little brushes that actually dust powder onto the skin and again this makeup tutorial is for people with sensitive skin and there is nothing in here that should irritate or aggravate the skin especially because now we're applying this over a layer of sunscreen of primer and foundation so even if there are things in your color cosmetics like your blush or your powders they shouldn't be as irritating on the skin because they have these layers that are separating them now if you're going for like some of these really heavily scented peach things and you have sensitive skin you might not want to do that if you're super sensitive or red number 40 sometimes irritate sensitive skin so just turn and learn those ingredients and look out for them and actually get tested by an allergist to see if you truly have a problem but if you are looking for a loose powder that does have spf in it these are two that i would highly recommend just using over your makeup and again you can put your mask over all of this you can choose not to wear a mask in your selfies if you're not going out in public and you're just doing makeup for you but if you do want to put cosmetics on this is something that you can use that doesn't irritate you throughout the day and still makes you look the way that you choose to present yourself to the world now let's touch on the interesting topic of these makeup sprays i have to admit i do love these there's a mattifying one and a luminizing one again these are from nyx professional makeup this is the radiant finish one this is a little bit more of a dewy look and then there's also the matte finish with most sprays including these there is denatured alcohol denatured alcohol or isopropyl alcohol does evaporate that's what allows some products to feel so smooth onto the skin that's what allows some products to penetrate into the skin and in cosmetic whether it's makeup or skincare manufacturing sometimes denatured alcohol or isopropyl alcohol is used kind of in a first phase think of that as like a first round and it actually helps dissolve ingredients in others or it evaporates off or it's actually used in the formula because of how it works and again if you're looking for a spray you want to deliver something like an oil in a mist form have you ever tried to mist an oil oil is globby it likes to stick together it's not going to work very well but if you put it into a formula that has denatured alcohol which naturally evaporates very quickly you shake it up and then you spray it you can actually get pigments oils and other helpful ingredients dispersed onto the skin you don't have to use these but if you wanted to i would highly recommend them both vegan cruelty free they pass all my checks and standards and they don't make my wallet feel like it's hemorrhaging this video took forever to put together and it took two memory card crashes and a whole bunch of editing to get to you so if that like button doesn't match my shirt please fix that and check your priorities if you are not subscribed and if you are subscribed but you're still not wearing sunscreen then you still need to check your priorities and again i will list all of these below i do always encourage you to put your money where your morals are and remember that whether it's skincare or whether it's makeup it's an experience that's a ritual for you it's not a routine it's not a chore it's a ritual and it's something that you should do for yourself to help you decide how you choose to express yourself to the world so with that being said thank you for letting me express myself here always remember to be youtube inside and out and i cannot wait to see you in this next video love you guys bye", "zTM9m0M_oIw": "[Music] hey wassup yo boys car fender and we're back as you can see there are two canvases I just want to canvases of own thing right now I have them just on those little cups and we are going to um I got a lot of response on Facebook and Instagram for the rainbow bubbles painting that I did and I have a few people that asked me for it but you know someone got to it first so I'm gonna try to do two more and so just to see if you know if if it goes well if anybody wants it I'm just halogen boy you know all of the social media links and everything are in there or in the description here and the description on Instagram and Facebook and all that kind of stuff always oh all that stuff is there so I'm using all of the same colors except for the differences all of the colors are Anita's man and with the exception of the silver the artist low-flow acrylic silver that's what I'm using and I thinned it down a little bit as I understand it thinning it thinning it down and using a little bit more silicon and make this a little bit better so I've already got that prepared so we're using I need beep denim and this is where I switched I'm using the Anita's true red the same as before the Anita's canary yellow and another one where I changed I'm using Anita's orange so we're gonna do this the same we're just gonna I'm gonna flip cup each of these I'm a prepare both of them at the same time and basically flip them at the same time and try to get all that I prepared I had someone asked me what I use to just kind of keep me into it and like the reason why that there's music in the middle and I'm not really saying anything there's two reasons one because of my freezer I mean you could probably hear it in the background now maybe maybe not because of the because of the music but my freezer is really loud so I try not to try to try not to talk through the whole thing so I just kind of listen to stuff and most of the time is marching band music so today the marching band music that I'm listening to is southern versus all pulling fifth quarter from [Music] so just in case anybody wants to know I listen I listen to a lot of marching band music when I'm actually making the paintings because I love marching band music so that's what I'm gonna do so just in a moment we're gonna go ahead and get this thing popping and we're gonna do two versions two alternate versions of the rainbow bubbles [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] there we are here with close-ups we're gonna do a close-up of both um they both came out really really nice I like them a lot but one thing I noticed when I was tilting man this orange did not come out this order did not come to play with y'all today so I had to try to tilt a little bit of this orange off and with this painting here I turned it so that the red is on the same side with the red it looked like if these get sold together and they get hung up it seems like this is a nice way to hang them or you can twist it and do the blue side however you want to when I poured them I poured the colors into like four different sized sides so they didn't mix very they didn't mix very much you can still see some let's take let's take a closer look as you can see I did get a little bit of green in here which is dope the silver isn't quite what I wanted to but I probably should have used less of the colors that is my fault but I like a lot of yellow in the middle one across here it's a lot of yellow and with the red on the side I thought that worked out very well I like how the blue kind of comes across here and he hit the orange on the bottom I was really trying not to get as much orange or just not one of my favorite colors so I was trying to get the orange kind of out of here a little bit and then we're gonna go to this side and like I said this part here but the Reds they kind of look like they connect a little bit so that might be a way to hang them if I sell both of them at the same time or to sell them both to the same person but this one the orange did not come to play with charge so let's start from the bottom and there's a lot more a lot more colors into intermingling but still with the silver throughout it which I like a lot I mean there's a big silver but it still works with the rest of this like I said that's a just a lot of orange a whole lot of orange and with some blues and the yellows and a little bit of green throughout here but still that orange that orange is not playing what y'all today so yeah man so these I'm gonna post the pictures up and if anybody wants to try to get it these send me a message anywhere so the boy goes for the Facebook page facebook.com slash PTC NC and yeah I'm outta here thank you

happened is unlike you i'm your highness we have stories to tell you [Music] you", "tclyfrxJ2z0": "hello started off with this quick hour-long tutorial this head was sent to me by Ali pearl and I got it a few months ago it is in the 613 it's 3 bundles I think it was 20 20 and 18 inches and a lace front oh I'll definitely leave all other specs in the description bar below so I went to Sally's and I picked up some hair color the young lady said I can use this which was the color brilliance right ion and also did you have this already on hand which was the Manic Panic and also I wanted to purchase this which was another color brilliant and it looks like a Salomon color as it states on the actual packaging it's a Salomon color also did have this already which was a color Easter I can't remember offhand who was by but it's the peach color and I wanted to give this a try and color blend it in but I had to go back to Sally's because the original dark brown that the young lady gave me was incorrect that needed basically like some developer with it so I had to go back and return it so overall the beginning of the video experience was not that great so I'm gonna go ahead and just brush this dark brown on to the roots it's not a dark brown but it's a medium brown and this is the one that you don't have to mix together and that's what I was going for the first one that I did show you you had to mix it with like a developer and I really wasn't into all doing all that I just wanted to get it over and done with so I'm just gonna take this little brush that came with the color Easter brand the drugstore brand I'm dry and I'm just going to brush that into the roots of the hair this brush is easier it's smaller and it just makes life much more simple and I will be honest to tell you this whole entire process of just doing the roots of a frontal can take so much time like for real it is very time consuming so I would suggest like you know being patient sometimes you got to walk away from things I wouldn't suggest walking away from you know finishing the dyeing on the actual frontal but once you're done with that portion just put it down and take a break another easy method would be just to have it on a mannequin head as you will see me doing that later on in this video now this was supposed to be like a medium brown like I said and when I actually finally was able to you know finish dying the roots and washing it off and allowing it to air dry it did not look anything like the color on the box or the color that I actually painted on the color actually was like a reddish Auburn Brown especially in the light once she went outside with it it was really arbor and brown so as you can see the roots do not look like a medium brown they even look more redder when you bring it into like light or space car just outside or just in front of a light bulb it looks totally different so I went back to Sally's I returned the the original one the first one that I was dying to hear with and they will return your money to you if you don't like the color as long as you bring the packaging back so I returned that and I got some different hair dyes which is like a darker Brown just to go over that I didn't really want to have to do all this but you know it is what it is so this is what the roots look like now and only one little portion seeped through this is the argan oil like medium dark brown that I'm using this time around and for the most part it came out okay but still the color was not that like the dark that I needed it to be but in the end it kind of did work out so we'll definitely get to that part so as you guys see I'm just going to do the roots of the actual bundles because I do like to keep the roots like dark in case you know the hair moves or the wind blows or just for just certain reasons only now that I've finished that portion I have allowed it to air dry after washing it out I want to just pick a few pieces of the hair loose and these pieces that I'm just flipping over right here with my rat tail comb they're going to be used just to highlight I'm not going to take the entire boxes of the salmon and paint the entire hair with it I just wanted to highlight with it so I'm gonna cut the bottom portion of the EON or the ion salmon tube out and I'm just going to put that in my mixing bowl and then because it looks so pink in person I went ahead and I used some of my Manic Panic which just makes the colors a lot lighter for real it did not look anything like the box color that was not peachy like at all it was very bright pink so I was trying to diet down all I should have just returned it back to Sally's but I was so tired I've gone back and forth to that store so I decided just to kind of like wing it and hopefully hope for the best now this is the color that the ion should have been which was like the color Easter it was more or less like that peachy orange color no as you guys see as I'm painting it on it was totally pink pink pink I'm going to kind of like use the color Easter peach color at the tips but I won't do that throughout the entire unit I'll just do it through some of it because like I said it did start to be get time-consuming plus I didn't really think the color Easter would hold so well because it is very watery based it's not as thick as like the ion or any other guys it's very watery and very creamy it reminds me of like a cheap lotion at the dollar store now I have seen a lot of videos and people have got great color results from using color Easter but your hair has to be really really light in order for any results - kind of like shine so I just used a little bit it doesn't have a bad order or anything I left this hair dye on for like 24 hours because it doesn't have any type of harsh chemicals and either one of them so it's safe to leave the hair dye on for 24 hours the longer you leave the hair dye on the better the hair dye will adhere to the hair so I have two different bowls one is the bowl with the Manic Panic mixed in it so you do see is coming out a little bit lighter pink and then the other Bowl is just the original eye on the one thing that really upset me was the fact that it's dead saleman and the color is like a hot pink honestly once I finish this entire way or I'm finish their process of doing this hair it was so bright pink this is like Halloween color pink there's no way that I would even dare to make this into a wig so now we're gonna strip the haircolor out because I really don't like it so I do have some vitamin C pills you do need the pills not the capsules I have the 500 milligram and I have the Head & Shoulders version or the Walmart version of heavy shoulders which is equate you will need to crush these pills so it doesn't really say how many you need to use so I just wing it like I said I did get them from Walmart it comes with like either 250 or 500 our definition of posted below and I just put them in a blender until they get really powdery and yeah I do apologize for the powder and I just pour enough of the equate version of head and shoulders into the bowl you do need a bowl for this and even if you're going to do this on your head you will need a bowl for this and you want to mix it up really well you don't want it to be too thick and you definitely don't want it to be so runny so you want to make sure that the consistency is kind of like a creamy paste kind of like texture kind of like sour cream texture um you know kind of like that and as you guys see I'm going to go ahead and then run some really really hot water into my sink this hot water is just going to make the hair bleed and it's going to also help strip the color out so you can either put some really really hot water in a sink or you can just boil some water on the stove and make it really hot and just dip the hair in and out of it I did this for several minutes I actually worked on another wig that I did um but the hair was a dark brown and it came out a lot easier this one as you guys see the water is turning really pink and it didn't remove all of the color but it did bring and dye it down and did like dull it down which I was happy about that because it was very very pink so once you dip the hair in the hot water you do you do want to make sure you do that because the hot water will also open the follicles up up the actual hair which will make the hair dryer a lot easier to come out so just do this for a second time and I'm now going to go ahead and put this hair into a bowl if you're doing this on your head you're still gonna want to make sure that your hair has warm water on it and you're going to want to rinse that out and you're going to want to put the paste mixture onto your hair so once you put this in the bowl you'll just want to make sure that it's saturated through the hair and just get it in there really good and it kind of doesn't smell that great but it doesn't smell that bad either and you want to put some type of coverage over it I'm gonna use a plastic bag it doesn't have to be aluminum foil you want to make sure that there's something over just to keep the heat in and you can keep this off for like a couple hours the longer you keep it on the the better it is you can't keep them on for 24 hours but I did leave it on for like about three and then I went ahead and rinsed it out so all this is is the actual you know conditioner or shampoo and the pills the pills and the shampoo mix together and it makes like this very pasty kind of like mixture now it is really tango looking but no worries I did get that outdoor conditioner what's up guys so this is going to be actually the third type of me filming this video simply because for one I wasn't too happy with the first one I've been like I did like the hairline so I wanted to protect it then what I did it second time I just realized I really did not like how the actual lace color was in the news so I wasn't like too fond of it what was the purpose of this video I'm going to try out this new gel by Walmart which is the equate brand this is like the equivalent to they got to be gel it's right next to it in the store one more hats come out with a lot of other gels that I've noticed and it does take super strong hold for multiple multitude of hairstyle it also has like the same consistency so I'm not sure how it's going to work but we are going to try it out hopefully it works out in my favor I'm not really sure if it's going to I have high hopes okay guys so let's get into this tutorial we're gonna use this equate version they got to be I'm just going to brush the hairs up away from the hairline so that way when I do put this equate got to be gel down doesn't catch on to the hair so it is white as you see it's just like the original consistency of the got to be to me it just feels a little bit more smoother I'm not really sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing but you know we're just gonna wing it normally I would do it a little bit different than this I would more or less adhere my wig cap down so that way you wouldn't slide around in my wig after like a few hours or days but I'm not going to keep this wig on for a few days I did actually keep it on overnight but that was the most so I'm gonna use my blow dryer and I'm just going to allow it to get kind of like tacky feeling just as we would do but got to be jump it was really smooth and to put on I didn't notice like a difference in the consistency that got to be gel to me seems a little bit more oily err and it does take a little bit longer to dry versus this one here okay so we're gonna try a second layer like we do with the doxa tee and what I'm feeling it doesn't feel as sticky as the got to be but you know it's not all the way dry this honestly feels like like a cream okay guys so now for the second layer I wasn't really going to do a second layer because I didn't want to keep the wig on for too long but I decided you know what if I'm going to test this out and try and see if it is comparable to the got to be I should do it exactly the same so now that I've done with the second layer I'm just going to go ahead and blow dryer as we would normally so that way once it gets a little bit tacky err I can go ahead and adhere the wig to my head so I'm just going to go ahead and place this down onto my hairline or before my hairline and it is it does get tacky and it does actually stick I'm just going to reposition it before it gets too tacky and too dry unfortunately I did put a little bit too much glue on past what I would normally do it but you know that's okay I'll just clean it up afterwards I'm pretty sure we all do that I do that a lot even with the hairspray and mousse when I apply it but you know what nothing like a good washcloth or cloth and it'll clean it right on up so I'm just going to go ahead and press down into the unit and blow-dry it so that way it becomes dry as well as that it's just able to stick and I also do this with all of my wig units when I'm using like the God to be gels or actually cool and I'm gonna also go ahead and take my moon so that way I can form my part now as you guys see in the actual lace the lace I'm not like a huge fan of for a leaper because it's still a white color the lay seems really thick so it wasn't able to kind of like it wasn't able to just melt or disappear into my skin the lace seems thicker than most frontal laces that I have ever worked with so I will say that they do need to work on the front so of the 613 I'm not really sure about their darker colors but for the 613 the frontal lace was kind of thick thicker than normal and it was actually more whitish tone so this would have not blended in any one woman of colors scalp and it doesn't even blend in mine so I'm just going to take some of my baby hairs and I'm just going to kind up try to camouflage the lace because there's nothing that I really can do about that I did try to bleach it and so forth but it still just looks the same and it just kind of looked like probably white roots from camera but that's actually the white lace that you see and I'm going to also use my barrel curler just to flatten down or straighten the edges out so that way it lays you know lays properly I'm gonna try this Sally Hansen leg spray that I'll use all the time or like my legs but it didn't work out [Music] you gave it like this tannish color brassy color wasn't working out either so I'll just all the way a different way so that way there isn't a part and I don't have to worry about the actual part and as you guys see right here at the sally hansen in the part it didn't work out either so either way the white scalp age or the sally hansen leg spray just didn't do it for this lace frontal like I said the lace is very thick and it's just very like non transparent so I'm just going to take my favorite wonk Rolo which is my irresistible me and I'm going to just curl it up and style it and you guys I hope you enjoyed the video and stay tuned for the finished look [Music] this is actually the finished look I actually do like this a lot better than the first instead the time that I did the videos I just found it totally different and being that the lace frontal is like this yellowish whitish color I just went ahead and listened to flip over message so that way you don't have to see the parting in it because regardless of what is still very jealous we even with the makeup on it so to avoid all of that I just did the flip over method so as for the Walmart brand equate gel okay is it comparable to got to be so my opinion in my opinion the wig is stuck it's not going anywhere but two layers on as you've seen and it's just very comparable it's two dollars and 27 cents that I spent for this and it's six ounces of the same size as the guys to be jealous you keep like the extra-large but yeah it does work just as well as the dr. B they don't have anything in clear I was looking for that below my only makes this one the yellow one which has a white that's a right consistency so I would definitely say try this product out and let me know your thoughts about it but for the most part just came out really nice I'm happy a kind of mind me up strawberry shortcake I love strawberry shortcake as a kid I will say I don't really like the late on and the front I think they need to work on it a little bit Victor to me and I don't really like to color too much but overall the hair has hints through trial and error and - a lot and it definitely deserves a thumbs up in my opinion yes I feel like they need to work on the lace so you guys I hope you enjoyed this full long tutorial on this unit let me know what you think of her and I know I love you guys stay deep into delicious make sure you rate comment subscribe thumbs this video up and all the information will be in the box and I'll see you guys on next [Music]",

it is not our fault [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] let me give them can you please do it", "KzT26FQtqOs": "[Music] uh [Music] [Music] hi and welcome to tiger art today we're going to be continuing our lesson on africa and african necklaces we learned that africa is a continent all the way on the other side of the world so we would have to leave our home continent of north america and travel across the atlantic ocean to get to africa when we get there we're going to find a lot of styles are different from what they are here now that goes the same for anywhere you would go you could go to south america you could go to china or japan anywhere in the world there's going to be a culture that might be different from ours and it's really important that we understand and appreciate different cultures knowing our cultural differences is an important part of studying the world being an artist involves an in-depth study of the world the artistic styles we were looking at mostly were african jewelry and necklaces we noticed how their beautiful handmade necklaces were wide and laid over the shoulder we noticed that they contained patterns they looked handmade though very skillfully handmade they were made up of beads and string and we started using a paper plates to get that ready we applied an a b pattern to that today we're going to be adding the beads all right so today we're going to finish up this african necklace and we're going to do that with some glue and some beads so in your arch kit you should have a small cup with a lid on it with a bunch of beads in it these are just regular plastic barrel beads that you could find at any craft store you're also going to be using some glue now when we are in the classroom i always use tacky glue this stuff works the best for holding the beads on now if you don't have that which i understand a lot of people don't you could also use elmer's glue that could work just fine and even other types of glue might work as well but i don't know for sure because i've never tried using them before obviously you can use whatever it is that you have at home available if you don't have anything uh and you're gonna go get something i would get this otherwise uh worst case scenario you have no glue you can just draw dots and patterns on here with marker or crayon and i'm sure that would look fantastic as well so whatever you need to do to be creative and make something cool i support you so for glue you want to put the beads on in some kind of pattern what i mean by that is like every yellow part should get the same number of beads so you may decide to do like one bead in the center of every yellow part so when gluing with this stuff i always put a little bit more glue than the size of the bead so that when you push it on there you can see a little white line around the outside the glue will dry more clear so you won't really see that it's not going to look as bad as having the beads fall off if you can't see any white around the bead around the outside of the bead it is going to fall off so you put a little bit on there when i'm squeezing this glue out i put it and i touch it to the plate that way it doesn't drip everywhere if you squeeze it from way up here you're going to run into some issues it's going to be going all over the place so i put all the glue on first okay once the glue is on there then we put the beads on and you can see a little bit of white around the outside of each one that means it's going to stay on there hopefully fingers crossed okay now i can choose what i want to do with the other color i can leave it blank if i want and just have the beads on the yellow that's totally acceptable i probably have enough beads in here i tried to give you enough to do like one or two on all the orange ones so that would be i think i have enough so i'm going to put two things of glue on every orange stripe all right when you're all done you want to find a safe place for this thing to dry somewhere where it's not going to get messed up at all once it's dry then you can put it around your neck by sliding these two things apart and putting it around your neck so when you submit your picture of this you can take a picture of it now and submit that if you want to get it out of the way but if you do end up waiting a little bit longer and you want to take a picture of yourself wearing your african necklace i think that would be pretty cool too so you can do that if you want you don't have to you can just take a picture of it just like this but have fun with this you don't have to do yours exactly like mine obviously make up your own patterns how you want to put the beads on i'm just providing you with beads and a little bit of guidance so have fun be creative i'll see you next time", "Uaga0ns6BlM": "hello everyone my name is connie chapel i'm a multi-disciplinary artist based in winnipeg i use mostly photography sculptural assemblage and insulation to explore correlations between the natural world human life inanimate objects and the cycles of growth and decay life and death i have the privilege to create and present my work on treaty one territory the original lands of the anishinabe cree oji cree dakota and denny peoples it's in the homeland of the metis nation the home to the inuit community in manitoba this is a territory in the land where i harvest my organic materials such as tree roots sticks bark and soil i'm grateful for my life on this land this presentation features work that explores body forms incorporated with tree forms imagined observed or utilized within the natural environment some of the works feature artists from lands beyond manitoba i invite viewers to reflect alongside me on the complicated history of our land on treaty one territory as well as the history of the land and other parts of the world may that reflection inform the ways we contribute to building a world community that is just and equitable for all as a fourth generation ukrainian settler using materials from tree one territory i dedicate this presentation to the original owners of this land thank you to the manitoba craft council for this opportunity to present the primordial female power a talk illustrated by my work and the work of others that examine the image of the tree in art as a universal mother symbolizing all phases of life i would like to thank mentoring artists for women's art that's mawa for partnering with manitoba craft council and to everyone for making time to listen to this first presentation of the spring heart talk series also i would like to thank the health care professionals as well as the front line workers who are bravely confronting their fears and anxieties and dedicating their lives by going out going out there every day to look after us in the coveted pandemic as an introduction to this presentation i'll discuss the work titled the moving finger from 2019 which is the first slide on the screen the moving finger finger uses paper mache pulp a mannequin hand nylon netting grapevine branches and tendrils plant root and paint the detail of the sculpture shows a hand with palm facing upward and the fingers missing at the base of the hand where the digit where each digit was severed is a hole sprouting roots in twigs draped in netting they suggest an energy and movement that personifies the travels through a life journey with all its twists and curls wrapping itself around things ideas and experiences the netting alludes to life's entrapments and barricades as well as safety nets the title of this piece references a quote by omar kyam an astronomer astronomer poet of persia from the 12th century his quote the moving finger rights relates to the notion that whatever happens in life happens and cannot be changed once something is done it is done and time moves forward so moving forward welcome to this talk primordial female power in case you're wondering about the title of the presentation i'll start with the definition of primordial primordial is an adjective meaning to exist at or from the beginning of time perhaps and it is giving origin to something derived or developed i discovered this word in a reference book the women's dictionary of symbols and sacred objects by barbara walker in her book john williamson a botanist landscape architect with an interest in ancient and celtic mythology writes that the northern teutons an ancient germanic tribe in the late second century bc believe that the elm tree was the source of the world's first woman her name was embla and she represented primordial female powers i thought it was a brilliant expression so i adopted it for this presentation williamson also wrote about the unicorn tapestries which are from the late middle ages 1495 to 1505 they are on view at the mat cloisters in new york of the seven individual individual tapestries which are luxuriously woven in wool and silk with gilded threads the unicorn in captivity is one of the most admired and its meaning has produced much scholarly debate for example it is said to represent the beloved tamed or the symbol of christ in this tapestry the unicorn is confined within a low fence with a pomegranate tree which is dripping juice from the ripe fruit onto the body of the unicorn the pomegranate tree is a medieval fertility and marriage symbol although the tree has diverse cultural religious significance it is widely recognized as the fertility womb symbol with its red juice and numerous chambers of seeds continuing the debate about the tapestry i'm suggesting the pomegranate tree as a primordial mother with bursting fruit-like breasts feeding and watching over its young offspring the imaginary unicorn lovingly nested within a low profile crib like fencing please hold that thought of the pomegranate tree as a primordial mother as we move forward in time to 1975 in boot tree by phyllis green please note i do not claim to be an expert on any of the works or art artists that i'm presenting i discovered their fascinating work during my research for this presentation and wanted to share my limited knowledge of it the phenomenon of manifesting ideas for this presentation was at play so many talented artists working with tree imagery popped into my mind my instagram scrolls and google searches it was not possible to include within a 60 minute time frame all of the amazing work i discovered my research pointed the way to branching out a professional quality magazine published in the 70s it was produced by volunteers featuring literature art feminist analysis by canadian women i love the title of the magazine and also that i found two works to share for this talk boob tree by phyllis green and arabesque by diane carrier and danielle bouchard firstly i'll present booptree and leave the arabesque work for later in the presentation phyllis green is an american artist born in minneapolis she grew up in winnipeg and currently lives in california green's boob tree from 1975 is a mixed media crochet tree brilliantly handcrafted using needles and yarn i see it as more than just boobs it could be a type of hybrid pomegranate palm tree blossoming with an abundance of fruit-like breasts for nurturing the earth for a tree it shortens stature at three and a half feet but it packs a punch the crop of pink breasts with brilliant red nipples suggests a transformative scale of the interior seeds of the pomegranate fruit they are ripe evolved and ready to feed and conquer the world boot tree with the catalog cover and promotional poster image for the exhibition women as viewer at the winnipeg art gallery in 1975 years later it was restored for an exhibition winter kept us warm at plug-in ica in 2012. most recently booktree was featured in horizons magazine winter edition 2021 in an article by bev pike deconstructing patriarchy in the article bev revisits the 1975 groundbreaking feminist art exhibition titled women as viewer as it it is referred to as groundbreaking because it was an exhibition unearthed independently by the committee for women artists which was a feat in 1975. in 2014 boob tree became part of the collection of the winnipeg art gallery women create artwork by incorporating the body with the tree in many diverse forms and for many diverse reasons birch bark biting is an art that involves a paper-like bark as a white birch tree as a medium and eye teeth as a tool the mouth has two eye teeth which are the longest slightly pointed teeth towards the corner of your mouth they are the teeth used to bite intricate patterns into the bark the resulting patterns become the artwork the patterns also are also used for storytelling quill work and beadwork angelique maristy was born in 1924 she died in 1996. she was a member of the peter ballentine band a woodland cree first nation in northeast saskatchewan she learned the art of bark biting from her mother she was also influenced by competitions among the women near her home mercy became a well-respected saskatchewan artist known for her complex symmetric images created by birchbark bike created by birch bark biting her motifs include flowers insects animals and landscape many having symbolic and religious significance her work has been displayed at museums including the museum of mana nature in 1980 our arbor glyphs are another form of recording images and messages onto bark unlike birch bark biting it uses bark removed from the tree arbor glyphs are carved directly onto the live bark of the tree whereas bark biting is harmless to the tree bark carvings make it vulnerable to disease from insects and fungi nonetheless since earliest time the human touch has left its mark on trees by carving messages pictures and symbols into the bark as a form of communication for others to discover the cover the carvers treat the bark somewhat like tattoos at death the recorded stories will be physically lost some may live on through memory or photographs and this picture at the top is a screenshot taken by taken from my passion for trees a documentary film with judy dench the beech tree has been called the graffiti tree because this smooth bark invites carvings many beech trees that are carved into its names initials and dates go back centuries at the bottom is a picture of me pointing to a beech tree and the carving is of the name land i discovered the glyph while wandering around the royal botanical gardens in england llenn is the name of my husband and no i didn't carve it beach trees can live to be 300 years so i'm imagining it might have been carved before i was born another form of marking trees is ribbons um what is with ribbons fabric or notes ribbon trees are found in various countries around the world and represents a variety of beliefs religions and prayers the wish tree an ongoing installation series by yoko ono invites viewers to tie a personal written wish for peace onto the tree this leads me to the red dress project created in 2010 by jamie black a multi-disciplinary artist of mixed anishinabe and finnish descent instead of ribbons bits of cloth or written notes black uses dresses and installs them in various locations the iteration of her red dress project takes place in a forest while this particular iteration black's installation of dresses hanging within the birch trees is a haunting aesthetic response to the staggering number of missing or murdered indigenous women and girls across canada in this image i feel the presence of the indigenous women their strengths power and ancestral knowledge even without their physical bodies their spirit is present among the trees with an energy projected towards the trees a healing for the future life of the forest as well as the women i will feature another work by black later in this presentation okay so um sorry taking on a completely different sensibility is a book project women in trees which presents the physical woman purposefully posing within the tree women in trees published in 2016 was so popular that a second book more women in trees climbing up again was published in 2018. these book these books hold a nostalgic collection of flea market photos that were taken between the 1920s and 50s perhaps an energy derived from the tree and the exhilarating climb up into it for the photograph contribute to the sense of joy and freedom these women express the telegrapher the telegraph reviewer lucy davies states the very best of photographs or those where the knowledge that she is doing something mischievous is written all over the climber's face oh and what about cats and trees i grabbed this image from instagram the little mischievous cat is learning to climb trees the popularity of this image is difficult to determine as the likes are not posted but i will say it had 112 favorable comments and this this is my work it's called family tree from 2012. in the full image the base of the tree is a pot resting on a rock i later converted the pot into a large egg shape so please imagine an egg at the base at the top of the tree is a nest housing a spiral shape surrounded by a twig like straw nestled in the knot of the trunk are photographs of my parents my dad's picture is tucked into an open poultry egg shell inserted into the lower knot on the trunk my mom's picture shown in this detail is featured in the higher knot it shows her as a young carefree woman playfully playfully holding onto a tree both photographs have a scattering of broken egg shells at the base of the photograph on one of the branches is a copper ring a symbol of eternity copper is considered a healing metal this work is loaded with symbolism each element was carefully chosen for its intrinsic meaning for example the egg often represents death and rebirth in the past a symbolically decorated ukrainian egg called a pisanka was buried with people to ensure the dead one's rebirth eggs and trees embody the essence of life merle mcmaster is a canadian photographer born in ottawa in 1988 her family is from red pheasant first nations in saskatchewan she is a member of the sika first nations in alberta mcmaster's photographic work from 2010 titled sentience is from the series in between worlds sentience is defined as the ability of plants trees and animals to experience feelings and emotions the image depicts a forest scene with arms presumably mcmasters wrapping around a tree the arms and hands have been transformed sticks are wrapped onto each finger and the arms embracing the tree wear sleeves of feathers the work suggests a spiritual energy and that a capacity for feeling mutual love between the tree bird and human is possible merle mcmaster currently has an exhibition running until april 17 2021 at the urban shaman contemporary aboriginal art gallery here in winnipeg the gallery press release writes that mcmaster is known for the large format self-portraits that have a distinct performative quality she explores questions of self through land lineage history and culture with specific reference to her mixed playing planes cree european ancestry is a south african artist born in 1972 her family name name muholi means leader maholi works in photography and calls herself a visual activist her work explores issues of race and representation and celebrates the lgbtqia plus community in south africa and beyond this portrait is from a series of self portraits zulu for hail the dark lioness she says that her self portraits were taken over time and draw back to moments where she wakes up where she breathes where she connects calabashe ambla beni from 2019 draws back to historical moments in praise of her ancestry calabasha is a gourd emblem any zulu for on earth or world world in this photograph muholi responds to indigenous trees and asserts her cultural identity by wearing a type of bottle gourd as a headdress while standing in front of what looks to be a palm tree it is believed that the bottle plant is indigenous to africa and is one of humankind's first domesticated plants in south africa the leaves are commonly eaten as a vegetable it is also used as a medicine and for utensils and musical instruments the calabash gourd is the traditional container used to store milk muholi's work presents a dialogue concerned with memory and memorial and absence as much as presence her work has a strong presence in my memory as i've been fortunate to have viewed her work in prison in 2017. memory and memorial is one reason photographers have long haunted cemeteries i find myself frequent frequenting cemeteries not only for the grave markers and inscriptions but also for the trees this is my work from 2019 entitled inside out lung installation i installed a chest x-ray in a tree and photographed through the transparency in an attempt to capture an ephemeral natural environment within the grounds of an urban cemetery the dematerialized body appears fused with the tree that provides this life-giving breath above ground and feeds the buried decomposing under the earth my intent my intention is to express the human body in harmony with the rhythm and transience of life the transience of life is something observed and accepted within the world of plants and trees but often difficult to acknowledge and accept in the human corporeal life arabesque is another work i discovered on branching in the branchy note magazine the movement sequence called arabesque a live dance in trees from 1978 shows the energy of women in trees which is which is captured through choreography and dance by diane carrier and photography by danielle bouchard they often worked with the dance group amarel based at the university of montreal the reviewer in branching out calls arabesque visual poetry carrier and bouchard strive to capture evolving feelings through their photographic stills which they marketed on puzzles mobiles and card games to invite interaction with the viewer interaction is prominent in the work of carolee schneemann an american artist trained as a landscape and portrait painter she was born in 1939 and died in 2019. she is well known for her performance work and she has said i'm always a painter who went off the canvas schneemann's water light water needle from 1966 is a performance first staged indoors before she filmed it outside at it was an outside version at lake mawan new jersey where she said the trees are perfect and there is a beautiful little lake she began to look for an implicit energy that she thought she could find within the trees her intention for the performance was to was to create an energy and say and sensation of weightlessness that she had experienced while visiting venice italy the video's opening scene portrays six naked bodies into individually floating in slow motion across the face of the the surface of the lake reviewer morgan quaitans describes the sequence as a pre-eudentic engagement with the body this engagement continues as a group performance on ropes suspended between the trees as the performers move on as the performers move on the rope they would need to collaborate with each other she envisioned the bodies floating along the rope lines as a whole a connected community not as a loosely collection of bodies schneemann directed four different versions of water light water needle performances another schneemann performance up to and including her limits from 1973-76 was first staged outdoors before presenting the work within a gallery setting she performed nude in a harness suspended from a tree the use of tree energy and a motif of rope frequently appear in schneemann's work the rope is loaded with metaphor she says the rope can't have that the rope can have a useful purpose but also a murderous element or it can have it mystical quality this mystical quality is a moment when the rope starts to spin while she is suspended during her drawing performances i'm also thinking there's an inherent mystical quality of rope because rope is sometimes made from fibers of a plant in the cannabis family and probe in this study for up to and including her limits schneemann seeks out the energy of the tree before moving the working doors and marking the energy onto the floor and walls with crayon carolee schneemann was a friend of anna mendieta in may 2020 gallery lelong and company and ppow presented an online exhibition of their work called irrigation veins anna mandiana and carolee schneemann selected work from 1966 to 1983. the exhibition created a dialogue between the two artists who confidently integrate their bodies with the natural environment anna mendiada was born in havana cuba in 1948 and died in new york in 1985. indiana arrived in the united states with her sister at age 12. she was sent there by her parents during operation peter penn in 1961 which was a mass exodus of children fleeing fidel castro's government she spent time in orphanages and foster homes and ended up studying at the university of iowa she became a performing artist working with trees and other materials from the natural environment mendiada did more than 200 earth body works called siluetas or silhouettes using her body in various landscapes she would cover her body with plant matter mold it out of sand carve it into the material or burn its shape into the landscape the silhouetta performances were recorded by photographs and films this image from her film from 1975 energy charge shows a fiery red silhouette of her body with arms raised against the backdrop of a dark stately tree she created her silhouette from a fallen tree and set it on fire and filmed the burning process as a symbol of renewal and transformation mendieta used her body as a medium to talk about identity and belonging she was forging her place upon upon the land and presenting herself as a primal female force a frequent posture in her silhouettes shows her arms raised towards the sky toward an unknown world beyond the one she's declaring herself part of perhaps progesterone signifies a unity of earth and sky or even a surrender of her body to the earth as it emerges against the tree with her eyes closed in prayer or even death or perhaps your arms are raised in guardianship of it for many mendieta is still here with us in the spirit of the trees sarah fuller she's another performing artist she's a canadian artist using photography video and installation while fuller lived in banff national park while fuller lived in bound national park between 2005 and 2015 she began performative video work immersing herself within the natural environment in 2017 she developed a project titled underwing based on the underwing moth found in the forest in the ottawa valley the underwing moth is a very well camouflaged is very well camouflaged within the tree because its wings have a tree bark pattern when it is startled or in flight it reveals a surprising color in its hind wings when it lands the color is concealed and the moth is once again camouflaged against the tree difficult to see but she's there in the underwing project fuller flies into the forest and records her activities with her camera she enables herself to disappear and become one with the trees or search her presence she does this by wearing an underwing moth camouflage suit she designed and created by printing photographs of old growth white pine trees onto linen fuller's anthropomorphic moth is presented larger than life as a costume costumed woman it still presents as a diminutive being while struggling to blend in with a majestic tree you can see her she's on the big tree if you look closely perhaps this is fuller's way of trying to make sense of the natural world and her relationship to it and to the encounters and behaviors behaviors she has experienced with both humans and non-humans continuing the theme of performance is rebecca bellmore elmar is a canadian multi-disciplinary artist born in 1960 she was raised in sioux lookout and is a member of the lac sewell first nation she is of anishinabe descent belmore is internationally recognized for her powerful works related to body language and body land and language that address history of indigenous communities this is a fun photo i took of bellmore in 2019 at winnipeg's urban shaman gallery the book wordless the performance art of rebecca bellmar is a remarkable collection of her performance work i'm going to talk about a work featured in the book titled facing the monumental the performance took place in queens park toronto home to the ontario legislature on canada day july 1st 2012 with the eight of three others bill moore wrapped craft paper around 150 year old red oak tree that is indigenous to the location she then wrapped one of her helpers onto the base of the tree the performance concluded with a recording of a 21 21 gun salute the highest number of rendered the highest number rendered as a military honor i don't know if you can see the figure wrapped but there's black hair and um right in the middle of the tree at ground level in her book wanda nani bush writes in the book in her book um in the book word list that i was just talking about once the nanny bush writes a response to the performance nanny bush refers to the craft paper wrap as symbolic of paper treaties that were broken and land that was stolen exploited and destroyed all of that being true perhaps belmore's tree wrapping can also be viewed as a symbolic gesture where the ceremony ends and new life begins with the unwrapping somewhat like a cocoon a place that undergoes a profound transformation nanny bush comments on the performance i think her actions is paying homage to the life of the tree in contrast to a british queen and king cast in bronze in the park belmore's monument was living i was struck by the indigenous woman becoming one with the tree because it prompted me to reflect on the earth as female here's the other jamie black piece this performance work from 2008 18 by jamie black is titled they tried to bury us she uses photography photography and video in this series i couldn't find any writings about the work so i will describe it from my perspective this is a screenshot captured from the video on her website in the forest is a small structure of branches and sticks behind it is a hidden figure presumably jamie black with exposed arms and hands sensually moving stirring in the earth and rising upwards the triangular shape of the stick structure is symbolic of manifestation enlightenment and a higher perspective the shape is also suggestive of the tpa a historical lodge or dwelling used by some indigenous peoples and primarily used for some more ceremonial purpose today the title perhaps a shortened version is reminiscent of the words of poet dinos christianopolis from 1978 what didn't you do to bury me but you forgot that i was a seed and the phrase they tried to bury us they didn't know we were seeds can be traced more recently to mexican activists who adopted it in support of the 23 students who were disappeared in iguala mexico in 2014. they tried to bury us has become a well-known protest phrase and is a fitting title for this powerful work by jamie black a type of performance happens while i'm walking in my urban neighborhood i pro process my surroundings and create something from the experience such as metamask a series i started in 2020 that's what you're looking at on the screen i built sculptural relief masks from photographs of a variety of trees species in various states of health the image files were printed on paper cut out and reassembled into hybrid masks made from paper the masks became by-products of trees they are designed in a wearable fashion suggesting a ceremonial purpose a death mask momento or spiritual union with the tree itself displayed alongside each mask is their corresponding full tree image or the stump of a tree noting location by longitude latitude and sea level as an acknowledgement of the tree life this is a detail from the mountain ash tree mask my interest in trees ability to filter air linked to the use of cover 19 masks one of the masks was from images of a diseased elm tree on the left is the photograph of the elm tree used to create the mask a fluorescent orange dot with number tag is marked for death by the city of winnipeg on the right is a photograph of the site where the trent the tree once lived i was thinking trees are dying of disease and people are dying from coven 19. these are details of the elm tree and of the el mask and the burial site of the tree the day after i discovered the tree removed i returned to do another life recording through stump rubbing to my surprise the stump had been ground out and replaced with a fresh layer of soil my connection to that tree continues with some new work wenge mutu was born in kenya in 1972 she has lived in new york for more than 20 years mutu is a a prolific multi-disciplinary artist known for her painting mixed media collage work sculpture performance and film her work has been described as both ancient and futuristic she draws from her sculptural hair her cultural heritage folklore and traditional african crafts her pictures seem otherworldly the primal woman emerges as a futuristic woman strong and elegant warrior goddess mootoo's recurring themes of past and future with an individual work as well as an expressed femininity or evident in the material and posture of these figures sentinel one oh sorry sentinel one is a nude female form fashioned from material such as paper pulp wood and stone branches wrap around the tree and a large branch suggests the head a beautifully decorated gourd in the shoulder socket replaces an arm emerging from the tree and the earth she presents as a beautiful female form entwined with nature another hybrid female figure is sentinel 4 the wood and the reddish soil incorporated into the into the materials for sentinel 4 were sourced in nairobi tree woman presents larger than life the body framed within roots is painted with the color suggestive of mud she has arrived emerged from the earth posing with an elbow raised over her head in a wide leg stance hip tilt with one leg stepped forward to complete the look is an appearance of high heels she present she presents as a powerhouse in a classic pinup pose this description of her work was found on the victorian mural gallery website mutu possesses proposes worlds sorry proposes worlds within worlds populated by powerful hybridized female figures her practice has been described as engaging in her own unique form of myth-making barb hunt is an interdisciplinary artist born in winnipeg in 1950 she works mostly with textile the influences of domestic life war mourning the natural environment and contradiction are found in her artwork she worked a summer in bc as a tree planter hunt has an interest in echo feminism human relationship with the natural environment particularly trees and how they communicate and affect human health she has done embroidery pieces regarding these interests as a metaphor for the inner landscape in the mid 19 to mid 90s hunt made life-size dress patterns webb dress root dress leaf dress from steel the daunting size of the dress is approximately seven feet in height was an internet and was an intentional act she wanted men to have to look up to them these works from 1994 a leaf dress and the root dress are shown together for a comparison of materials the leaf dress is a work on the left on paper a study for the dress before constructing it from metal the dress on paper reads is powerful as well as delicate unlike the totally imposing power of the steel dress on the right using a high tech plasmic plasma arc welder and steel material hunt sews together dynamic female power within a dress as well as within a tree in visual arts news magazine kelly kelman comments on the root dress barb hunt transforms the cutout doll dress into a symbol of for more formidable female strength the root dress is in the collection of the winnipeg art gallery panda dia kitay was born in portland oregon in 19 in 1992 and currently lives in los angeles she grew up between mali west africa and portland her mother was born in canada in kansas and her dad was father was born in mali her work presents her bicultural and biracial identity the aquitay d kitay's work explores black feminine identity blending race and culture through her collage work her influences include the work of wenge mutu this collaged image red black and blue from 2019 presents a woman kneeling on a mound of earth's browning grass sprouting grass-like branches under the mound is a web of tree roots the images suggest of of kiki's upbringing rooted in the land of her two countries as well as her blossoming womanhood the female form is composed of collage bits arranged as body parts there's a raw primal expression to the work the figure with its arched head and kneeling posture rooted to the earth is formed through bits of animal print and collagea fleshy raw meat within the arms thighs and buttocks the butter collage includes a butcher knife within the meat the prominent drumstick object within the torso suggests a phallic symbol perhaps a painterly black back perhaps a painterly background of watery swirls indicates her travels across the ocean between the united states and africa the central female figure grounded to the earth shows an underlying root system the roots are suggestive of a stabilizing powerful and empowering home for creating a primal female force this is my work body topography a collage from 2015. this piece began with a photograph i took of a large root embedded into the sand on a beach it is probably from a tree that was either washed up onto shore or felled by a storm the route became a type of landmark or meeting station for people using the beach i had the image printed on a brown cotton t-shirt i didn't plan on wearing the t-shirt it was just a quick and easy way to get the root photo onto fabric i cut out sections of the root image reassembled and glued them onto a small painted canvas the root is transformed it is recognizable as a body shape yet it is still a strange and unfamiliar object my intention is to suggest aspects of the human condition such as diversity self-generation the inescapability of death and the search for ultimate meaning i'd like to visit the root and observe how it has changed over the years this photograph is the same route taken a few years later this is my work again titled reach from 2015. it uses a it uses a pile of discarded branches and tree matter combined with plastic arm fragment from a mannequin salvaged from a flea market from the arm extends a tree branch i assembled the work in the outdoors and photographed it it presents a human connection to the felled tree and the earth the rubble becomes a life force energy transforming into something new the connections seem like a natural fit even though the arm is manufactured the work was intuitive intuitively assembled but while doing so i was posing some questions to myself how do trees and roots relate to the body and human life in general how does the human body change over time how does the environment change over time how do those changes relate to memory endurance survival and reconstitution or regeneration of a form both organic and manufactured in other words what do we do in an attempt to remember the past and to survive as long as possible on this earth in an acceptable form and what is an acceptable form manufactured objects are patched and painted and refurbished organic objects such as trees are staked pruned fertilized and seeds are scattered our natural our natural human bodies are also fertilized as well as nipped and tucked and grafted colored and tattooed for memories stories and images are recorded through assemblage the tree parts of this work the arm pardon me through assemblage with three parts the arm although only a mere object takes on a new life and introduces a dialogue about the future does the work represent a final resting place for the body as well as the fragments and discards of life or is it or is it a new beginning filled with life potential this is my work titled rare gestures from 2019 instead of planting the arms outdoors in a natural environment i brought the natural materials indoors and assembled them the hand rests on a branch of the root while finger well sorry well a root with finger like tentacles reaches out to the rock the shadow is also a part of his piece the shadow has many symbolic meanings it is said to be the first image of the soul after death i do not think of this piece as something dark and foreboding there is no shadow without light the root is from a cedar tree and i sell that i salvaged because i felt it still had some life potential the arm is painted a turquoise the color of tranquility and hope i began painting the mannequin parts that are incorporated into my work for the symbolic meaning as well as for a comment on the way humans beautify their bodies in life and after death after death the body is often painted with makeup to make it look lifelike which creates a plastic appearance which is totally unnatural but is deemed more acceptable for viewing my intention is for the plastic arm to exceed mirror object hood i'm trying to express deep inward feelings about life and about life after death this work is a hand embroidered photograph by miriam miriam yin a moroccan artist yin photographs her neighborhood in marrakech which is located far from the gentrification of the tourist areas she superimpo poses embroidery scenes on the photographs giving them a new life filled with vibrancy this image titled the reality of shadow from 2018 depicts a shadow figure reaching upward towards a shadow tree the tree comes to life with embroidery and fruit like objects perhaps cherries mosaic patterns extend from the image and move beyond the frame of the photograph the patterns echo the cement pattern on the walkway embroidered footprints legs a figure on a bicycle and the cat complete the scene perhaps her neighborhood tree amongst the cement is a gift of life that she honors through this work ishii bashi yui was born in 1985 in japan uh yui creates mesmerizing sculptures of figures with transparent white bodies intertwined with the natural world these are her words from the statement on her website since my childhood i have been attracted to the concepts of death sexuality and religion and that is still the motivation for creating my art my internal feelings may contain many things universal to all the people i want to explore that feeling that feeling is something like an ancient memory that lies deep within the human heart it is a source of life in a very sacred space however on the contrary it is a world that includes everything that has wild cruelty a world where all conflicting elements are united holy and evil man and woman yin and yang sadness and joy life and death all forms all life forms have this memory and they long for it and hope to return this very universal and nostalgic feeling drives me to create end of tears from 2018 shows a young nude female figure with pale pink almost lifeless skin branches sprout from her mouth and body the branches are blooming and growing as if preparing to engulf the body the figure slumps with its head slumps with its hands and hips on the ground knees slightly splayed with the head tilted back and the mouth open it's reminiscent of the line posing yoga except the figure is displaying a posture of resignation rather than one of fierceness eyes look upward with a forlorn look of having been forsaken calling from 2011 shows a young girl sitting in a chair raised high off the ground they are being engulfed in roots a tree from 2011 shows a pale female form sitting on its hips with hands resting on the feet the head has become a tangle of deep red branches and the trunk of the body is morphing into the trunk of the tree with its root system visible through delicate transparent skin of the young and soft looking body there's a sense of resignation and submission in yui's work as roots and vines take hold of the life of the figure imprisoning the body through nature creates a mythical and unsettling feeling louise bourgeois was born in france in paris france in 1911. she died in new york in 2010 at age 98 she was a prolific artist probably most widely known for her spider sculptures bourgeois bourgeois has used distinctly different materials and forms within her art her nature inspired sculptures present the body as an experience happening from within in the late 90s she did a series of topiary works using trees and plants as a metaphor for the human mind combining the conscious and unconscious into her work topiary 3 from 1999 incorporates steel fabric beads in wood the tree trunk becomes a woman's body with her legs replaced by a peg or stick supported by a shiny metal crutch the branches of the tree become outstretched arms growing some sort of clusters of blue blossoms made from beads the figure wears a sheer nightie style dress with a hem finished in lace hanging in the trees suggest um hanging on the tree branch suggestive of a nest is a miniature oh boy i'll try and pronounce it it's translated as a fairy dress maker anyway this object is similar to the one she created out of plaster in 1963 as a fairy dress maker what is it a fairy is an imaginary being a female human form that has magical powers and of course a dressmaker sews together fabrics from from scratch and makes custom clothing bourgeois presents the tree with an anthropomorphic quality the trunk of the tree takes on human care characteristics of the female form perhaps suggesting she is in a primitive state of existence or perhaps in a broken emotional or physical state as indicated by the missing leg but her state seems to be repairable with the gift of wood from the tree and the nest like fey couturier that is the uh fairy dressmaker some form of fabric such as the sheer nighty dress worn by the tree figure was frequently incorporated into her work bourgeois was a lifelong hoarder of clothes and heist and household materials such as tablecloths which he cut up and refashioned into her artwork she saved them because they were lived materials sometimes bourgeois used the full dress in an installation such as reseller works these minimal works also from the topiary series potently unite the body with the natural environment sprouting from various orifices of the body are tree and plant forms these works suggest your connection to the tree and plant is metaphor for the human mind's conscious and unconscious thoughts from the website of the museum of modern art in new york are these quotes by louise bourgeois my poetic license is to remove the arms to remove the head and then if i want to fetch them back my own body could be considered from a topographical point of view she said a land with mounds and valleys and caves and holes our own body is a figuration that appears in modern earth i love that expression oh this is my work again it's from 2018 titled amongst the oldest living things it uses wooden golf tees embroidery floss raw wood sequins chunky powder paint colorant glue watercolor pencil and found log lycan is said to be amongst the olden oldest living things it first appeared on earth more than 400 million years ago lichen thrives with a symbiotic relationship between algae and fungus pollution can cause structural changes in some sensitive lichen species and also the death of the lycan lj air quality can be determined by lichen health and species loss of diversity loss of diversity in the liking community as a response to changing climate and environments on this work i designed beard lichen from embroidery floss and raw wool i wanted it to appear healthy on a seemingly dead log so i created it growing long and plentiful the weather log was sourced from my flower bed it presents as a body form displaying tassels of beard like in suggesting hair a transformative scale of pixie cup lichen erupt along the leg-like forms of the log this work is presenting a thriving relationship between algae and fungus body and tree this work was created following a workshop at the university of manitoba herbarium this is my work from 2013 titled what the gods give you it uses paper pulp a mannequin hand badger hair paint plaster teeth sage leaves black not gall branches and a medical retention bandage black not gall is caused by a fungus which infects trees once it is establi once it is established and more branches become infected and die off which eventually causes the death of will eventually cause the death of the tree spores from the gall can travel to neighboring trees through the wind the title of this work is borrowed from an expression in palmistry the left hand is said to represent what the god gives you or simply your fate resting in the palm of the hand is a branch swollen with a fungal growth one end of the branch is inserted into the vein at the wrist of the hand suggesting a symbiotic interaction between the hand and the branch symbiosis is a close association of different species usually animal and plant it is often but not always a mutual benefit at the end of the arm extends a branch budding with human teeth they're green painted green the hand is presented on a scroll of bandage material this work suggests a parallel between disease in humans and non-human life sometimes regardless of effort the disease wins this assemblage work called the last from 2014 uses a vintage wooden shoe last rock tree branch nylon nylon netting and cloth this is my work uh a last for those who don't know is a foot form used by shoemakers and cobblers in making and repairing footwear the word last comes from the old english l-a-e-s-t last meaning footprint it is the soul of the shoe also the word last applies to something at the end of a series but does not always imply that the series is completed this work shows a woman's vintage last tipped onto its side revealing the soul it has been partially resold on the toe area with a thin slab of rock at the ankle area of the last extends a tree branch attached by a nylon netting the branch suggests a leg extension the assembled form rests on a table structure draped in a white shroud like material one end of the fabric is raised is it preparing to wrap the form this work as well as many of my works provide a glimpse of my ideas regarding relationship between the human body objects and trees and their hidden life this is the final image and it's my work from 2018. the healer the healer uses dry plant root hollow birch branch a vintage mannequin hand nylon hair netting cotton string natural air current and shadow perhaps you're wondering what causes a branch to hollow a fungus eats the branch from the inside out it is sometimes called heart rot because it eats away at the heart of the tree the bark of the birch tree is rot resistant while the root wood inside is not as the inside decays the bark holds its shape a broken or cut branch leaves an open wound for fungus to enter like the tree humans can contact can humans can contact fungal infections well certain types of infections are rather harmless others are serious and life-threatening to organs or limbs i find the parallel the parallels of disease between trees and humans fascinating now returning to the description of the healer the vintage mannequin hand is inserted and secured with netting into a hollow sleeve of the birch tree branch from the opposite end of the sleeve extends a plant root the pieces tied together and suspended by a cotton string the healer is a type of kinetic sculpture that moves gently and naturally through the energy derived from air movement created by the breath or motion of the viewer within the surrounding space the assembled parts are balanced in a horizontal position hanging from a string which gives it the freedom to rotate about the string the shadow component is a two-dimensional silhouette on the wall represented as the spirit of the healer the shadow moves and changes shape as the sculpture moves this movement reference this movement references the spiral a motif i have frequently used in my work i'm ending the presentation with the healer because it is a quiet spiritual piece that calls for the physical and emotional healing of humans the non-human environment and beyond thank you for attending this talk the primal female power if there's any time katrina craig the program director for the manitoba craft museum will join us and take a few questions if there are any thank you everyone hello hi katrina we have a little delay until youtube will pick up our questions but if anybody has any questions they can feel free to enter them into the chat here i guess i i'll apologize first of all for rushing at the beginning i felt like i had so much material and then i slowed right down halfway through and then it got really slow towards the end so i'm honey your top is beautiful well i i hope that i wasn't you know talking so fast people couldn't catch what i was saying as i was stumbling through some of the words but um thanks everyone whoever tuned in we have lots of thank

sewing showing so much amazing work i agree something i really appreciated about your talk connie was that you gave us a lot of context about premarital female power within art but you also integrated your own practice within it i understand your own practice lot better now after listening to your talk so thank you so much oh why thanks for saying that yes like i couldn't believe how much information i had so much editing there's so much i wanted to tell everyone about you know what things that i had discovered and but i had to be ruthless and i was even editing this morning because i was like i'm gonna go like way too long so yeah i'm gonna read through a whole bunch more compliments that came in we have wow connie's super informative inspirational talk it really packed a punch from tracy peters yvonne zarnkowski i apologize i butchered that last name thank you for sharing adam b says thanks connie love your work and sky color says thank you for the talk oh well thank you everyone hi yvonne hi everyone hi adam hi skye hi shawna if there are no more questions we can wrap up the night and thank you so much connie for that really beautiful talk it was so great valerie sharksman would like to ask can you tell us a little bit about your future projects and what you're working on right now well it has to do well it has to do with trees surprisingly and um i haven't done any physical work i'm just doing a lot of preliminary collecting of materials and writing down my ideas and i have a few ideas which i haven't um um ideas like um well it's like related to the barriers of masks and well they're related to disease and um because we're still in this covet i guess i'm still thinking about the masks but i'm trying to do some other things with them um maybe use some other materials but i have to see how it works out so i have taken some um earth from that the elm tree grave site and um and some of the tree shavings from that site and they're in plastic i gathered those last year and i wasn't sure what i was going to do with them but i'm thinking i'm going to put them in some um well in some container um um well i don't want to say in case it never happens but yeah i have ideas for it and also recently i noticed that they um that's one street over there's a lot of freshly trees and trees have been freshly filled by the city and there's a lot of material at their site so um i i'm looking at those i'm visiting them and i'm trying to think do i want to keep going on this because you know and then i have i have this stay tuned for this one it's the most incredible route that i didn't source it but my neighbor sourced it for me and it has a huge rock and growing um the roots have grown around the rock he dug it out from his lake and he said oh my gosh you know connie wants this i know it so he brought it home for me and um so i just need to clean it because i can't bring it in my house when it's got who knows what in it and um so that's another piece that i'm looking at so but what they're going to become yet you know i've got ideas but i'm just not quite ready to share them connie i'll have to text you after this there's a really great cut elm tree stump in front of my house that's absolutely massive and would make a beautiful rubbing also i'll have to let you know on the side where that is okay okay yeah you know i've played around a little bit with the rubbings but i don't know like you know i have to get better paper you know i i tend to use like my masks that i was making it was just like photocopy of paper and i'm thinking like does it matter because like everything kind of like you know decomposes some things quicker than others so you know um yeah i'm thinking about the papers to use because i've only tried it on on you know one type of paper so yeah i'm still playing around yeah thanks but the degrading of that paper is actually really interesting in itself i wonder if different paper the paper degrading you've got me into like a thought now it does degrade well that's why they sell you know the um the rag paper the acid free paper because it will degrade it will turn yellow you know you know paper and and you know i don't know if you have photographs yourself but some photographs just degrade really quickly and they turn i've got photographs that are turning in frames like you know family pictures that are turning like purple and you know they have to be restored if you want to keep them yeah yolanda paulson wants to know where we can see more of your work oh well you can look at my website i have connie's website linked in the description as well yeah i i think i put a few like this one is in my website but um i don't have well i have a new website and it's got lots of promise but um you know it takes a lot of time to to get it you know put it together so i spent a long time with this new website and and then all of a sudden i started doing artwork and i left the website so i guess you can look at my website and um that gives me you know inspiration if you want to look at it to maybe put some more stuff up on my website and um but other than that no um what about your instagram account connie is that a place people can see your work well kind of yeah sure some of it mixed in and um it's called you know my thing is body has fled and um i got that idea body has fled when i was doing the um the x-ray the chest x-ray in the um at the cemetery because i was thinking you know there is no body there's bones in your x-ray that you look at and you see some you know um you know you see the shadows of the the lungs but um you don't see the flesh or anything so i was thinking well the body has fled and then i said oh it's brilliant so that's why i adopted it for my you know instagram and um yeah so yeah you can look at my instagram too i sometimes post things i'm working on on instagram but azul um i wanted to tell you you know some of my black knots i still haven't got any sculptural work um estimates for i because there i want to see what i can do with getting some molds made so i can actually use those in um in other shows because of the material people don't really want some you know fungus in their gallery or in their house and um so anyway and i know quite a while ago i was talking to you land about doing something so that's another thing on my to-do list i have way too many projects and ideas so um one day that's a good problem to have i think uh susan lambert wants to know when i see the arms and hands in your artwork they remind me of prosthetics was that ever a thought no you know um i the id um the idea of replacing something like a prosthetic yes but um it has they have more has more to do like an elbow an arm elbow is more like symbolic of a change or a turn in events or a turn in life and hands are more about touch and healing and spirit and um [Music] um so it's not really about it is missing limbs but it's not really they kind of stand in for symbolic ideas and the body you know because you know even if you're looking at this it makes you think of a body and like some i have lots of um mannequin parts that i've installed and then just taking a lot of pictures in parks in trees and things and like i guess i don't show them because i keep saying people will say oh that's creepy well i don't think it's creepy and people will you know stop doing it and watch me and then just kind of you know kind of slink away like what is going on here you know so i don't know i don't think they're creepy and um because they have i don't one of my symbols doesn't creep me out you know it's healing you know disease healing and and the parallels between plants and roots and the fungus and things that happen the the you know the systems in in trees and how you know our fluids travel up the trees just like in our body there's you know we could have evolved like you know from the body from the elm tree all of us we don't know you know so these are things that you know i question what's it all about where did we come from and where are we going so yeah thank you connie for such a fascinating talk and also such an enlightening and interesting q a you have so many interesting ideas and we really appreciate you joining us for spring talks well thanks very much yeah this was great and you were fun to work with and anyway it was it was good to you know do our techie tests that was good so we'll talk again everyone all my facebook friends out there on my instagram friends and all my real life friends", "LtLfCvLwd5U": "[Music] what's up you guys welcome to my channel my name is kiara but i go buy kicks kicks on the beat kicks with the cheeks kiwi which everyone is following me today i'm going to be showing you guys this glueless install i shocked myself with this one i hang a lot this bob was cute as i'm also going to be doing like a mini lace workshop i will be describing them showing the difference and then i'll also let you guys know who was most suitable for so we're just going to get into the video this hair is from af system i will get into the specs and all that stuff later let's get into the different types of laces so there are many types of laces on the market right now um and we're going into the first one the medium brown lace medium brown lace aka french lace it's the most common lace used the durability of a medium brown lace is very durable so if you want like a very long install you want your wig to last a long time with this type of lace then you will go with a medium brown lace but it's suitable for people who are my complexion a little bit lighter than me and then darker it's not suitable for those who have a lighter complexion or fair skin because it's going to sit it's going to be sitting right on top of your forehead it should look so bad also medium brown laces they do have different materials here some medium brown laces are thick as hell some of them are not so just keep that in mind now we're moving on to the transparent lace now lace have been you know recommended more and more nowadays which is always a good thing because transparent lace you have a little bit more freedom you can match the lace to the complexion but to an extent transparent lace is also very durable so if you want your lace to last a long time then you will go ahead and consider transparently but it's only suitable for those who are my complexion and lighter if you have very light or pale fair skin then transparent lace is ideal for you being that you're able to tint and customize the lace to your liking now we have swiss lace swiss lace i believe in my opinion is very slipped on because hd lace is the theme i'm going to talk about hd lace today because i don't have like a swatch for you guys but i'll do another video and compare those two because swiss lace is pretty much like hd lace it's one in the statement to be honest so swiss lace is very very sheer you see you guys see it um it's actually more transparent than the transparent lace which is so crazy to me in terms of durability it's way more durable than a hd lace but it's less doable than a transparent and medium brown lace so it's if we were to put it in a category it's like second to last in terms of durability in terms of who is suitable for swiss lace is suitable for all skin types to an extent like i said you guys can see this already has like a little brown tint to it so you just really have to eyeball it if you know you have really really really really light skin i would just suggest go ahead go with a hd lace or transparent lace just to be on the safe side because some swiss laces come with like a brown tint it's not as brown as a medium brown lace but it'll be noticeable if you are light as hell and you know you try to stick that on your skin and try to blend it in it's not going to work but yeah swiss lace i definitely recommend um i think you guys should look into that more if you do want to save a little coin because hd lace is very expensive nowadays and it's very scarce because of covet um and some companies be capping out a big cap and time box and they sell hd legs we still have that phony ass but like i said look into swiss legs because definitely slept on the same thing that hd lace does if you ask me but it's just a little bit more durable we're going to get into the performance of these laces because you guys are about to see i'm doing it in the order in which i just described them so the medium brown list is first the transparent laces second and then the swiss laces last i just want you guys to pay attention to how it interacts with my skin so these first two laces i'm not gonna lie they're gonna be sitting on top of my skin but in this instance the medium brown lace is working more than transparent lace for me because the transparent lace is a little bit thicker this time so of course it's going to be harder to melt and then also being that i have to match to my complexion it was just a little difficult this time around but like i said there are different types of transparent laces some come thicker some are thinner but as you guys can see via these side by side comparisons the swiss lace is the most ideal for this install because it's melting into my skin like it looks good all three of these are okay but you guys see there's a different you know a different outcome with each type of lace and if i want to get like the melted appearance then i would definitely use two slices in this situation which i'm going to be using i also just wanted to show you guys do a little demonstration of the erica j holding spray i always use this spray it's similar to gossipy but it has a better it has a way better hold it's more it's more durable but at the same time it's very temporary like you guys will see me spray the water and it just comes right off so it's a very temporary hole but it does the job like if you need something to stick and not lift then get you some holding spray because it's going to you know do the job in the amount of time that you need to so we're moving on into the install like i told you guys this is the af sister wig f sister wig this is their 13 by four swiss lace frontal wig um this was about 10 inches i believe if it's not 10 inches i'm gonna leave the actual specs in the description but i'm going in and i'm just going to be cutting i'm making like a blunt cut i want the blunt cut look because when i put this damn wig on y'all i was not feeling an angle i really don't care for bob to begin with so when i saw that i'm like i don't know and i also want to say that this bob is more on the thinner side it's like thin as hell so if you're looking for a very natural bob then this would definitely be suggested but if you want to do like a bad bubble you know it's extra bounce extra shine this is not the wig for you because it's not giving that it's giving natural for real we're getting very natural today and this is this this bob would be moving they got a little body like stiff as hell no then as hell yes so yeah just keep that in mind so yeah i'm just going to continue to cut [Music] you always when you're cutting the bob you always want to make sure the head goes down so that you can get all of those hairs that are underneath the initial cut if that makes sense because the cup be cool until you put your hair down do you see all the little strays i never really was a pro at bob cutting and also these still is like dull as hell so don't expect no fast you know okay we just go move right along because [Music] baby [Music] one thing i do want to know about swiss lace as well the knots on the swiss lace wig are always small always i never had a swiss lace wig and the knots were big as hell that's something i find when i'm using like a medium brown lace or a transparent lace those knots tend to be bigger because the the actual holes on the grids are bigger you can go back and look at it so you guys can see what i'm talking about but y'all this lace was beautiful so i had the intentions on gluing the lace down but as i was cutting it and seeing the waves just sat there i was just like damn do i really need to glue this down no i'm not i'm not going to do it so this wig was so cute and i dyed it j black and i also customized i bleached the knots off camera and i had no problems whatsoever with that you guys can see it's a very clean very even bleaching process i'll do a video on that later because that's another video in itself but y'all i was just so amazed man i love me a good swiss lace so for my ear tabs you could just completely leave this bead but i like to i like to go in with the little holding spray and just spray down my ear tabs because you could very well go in with a um a scarf and just tie it down and it will lay but i know me and i know i'll be pulling my wig and i'm brushing my hair i don't want that to slide back too much so that's why i secure the ear tabs and you don't even have to do that but that's what i decided to do and you guys see i use the erica j holding spray and as you guys can see it's a very temporary hole once i spray some water or even sweat is going to come up so yes still glues now i'm going to go in with some powder that i use like a bronzer powder and i'm gonna go in and i'm gonna go over it with my hairline because while it is laying it's definitely leaving like a little casper like you know situation and i don't like that so i went in with this little powder but the thing is when you guys go in with the powder make sure y'all doing this up close because i'm doing it from far back and i got a little heavy handed so at some point it's starting to look orange and i didn't even notice that until after i filmed the whole damn video but even still it looks very good so as long as you're using um a product that matches your complexion perfectly you should be good to go i always recommend you guys use a product that's you know your complexion or just one shade lighter just a little bit lighter because our scalps are naturally lighter than our bodies so it's always good to go lighter and not darker because if you go darker you're going to see the lace and you're going to see where the lace starts so i always recommend your complexion or a little bit lighter i'm just going to bump the ends a little bit i like this little bob y'all it's kind of cute it was a jet black that's what it was the jet black for me man some about j black just give me grown ladybugs for real and yes i did a lot of customization off camera but i'm gonna go in with my hot comb y'all know the deal section by section get it real flat [Music] okay y'all so we get into the good part i'll be shocking myself sometimes and i just be so excited like i just love love love a good install so y'all just about to see me admire the hair for a good 20 seconds but yeah this is pretty much the end of the install like i told you guys this hair is from af sister wig man it's the bob from instagram for me what dorkaneva what's the late name from um incredibles she could never and laura farquhar no he better not look my way not pig look at this it's getting very natural it's growing out of my scalp this is my hair i just got a fresh silk press and i got my hair cut girl i was i was just floored look at that okay y'all let me get up off here but if you like this video make sure you leave a like comment down below what you thought about it um

this works but some oh yeah this looks really orange I might have my orange and I'm gonna put some on the hair as well underneath see things think Dad and you quote copy and paste that's what I think I should put it on first and then child yet do you remember those cotton that was some magic yeah you remember Samurai Jack pretty nice and it always used to play like really late at night I wonder why but yeah so as you can see the band is actually pulling it back quite a lot so I don't need to like stick it down or anything like a lance okay cool Oh help me help me this is not matching my hair

[Music] [Applause]", "KilehMXMxo0": "Alright. So today, we're making my version of the best burger ever. I smell bacon, but I don't see it. I'll show you where it's hiding. Let's make it. So, I'm starting with two cuts of beef. I have chuck and sirloin. The reason behind this is because the chuck has a little more fat; the sirloin's a little beefier flavor. And then this is a secret cheat code right here. Ground bacon. And the reason for adding the bacon, you get this nice, smoky tone. Everyone was a bacon burger, but when it's in there already, mixed in, it does a beautiful thing. Now, I'm gonna move on to my spice rub and my umami bomb. Dried shiitake mushrooms, ground to a powder. When you eat them, it's like natural MSG. Just keep eating if you're hungry. You like it. You love it. You don't know why. It's because of that. Now, I'm gonna add garlic powder, some dried thyme, little earthiness to it, and some onion powder; pretty standard when it comes to burger rubs, and then a little bit of liquid. Not too much, so you don't want the burger patty to break down. A little bit of Worcestershire. Make sure it's nice and mixed. Corporated. You don't wanna eat like, a packet of onion powder. It'll ruin anyone's day. I'm just going to move on to our \"secret sauce.\" Starting with ketchup, a little bit of yellow mustard. You definitely wanna use yellow mustard for the brightness. Cream it out a little bit with a little bit of mayo. A little bit of sweetness. A little bit of maple syrup. Cheek over here. Chico. And then, a little bit of heat. And you take these already pickled jalape\u00f1os. I'm just gonna run my knife through them real quick. You want the pieces to be nice and small so it blends in with the sauce. And add this straight in here. A little bit of salt. Couple twists of fresh black pepper. Give it a little bite. Llittle more sharpness. And a dash of sherry vinegar. Just gonna mix this all up. Kind of looks like, you know, Big Mac sauce, a little bit. But trust me, it's a lot better. It's kind of make patties. We're making small patties. I like nice, thin patties for they're gonna be double burgers. So, each patty is about 3 ounces. Man, I am so hungry already. Nice and mixed up. You don't want like, a chunk of bacon sticking out because that part will cook fast in the beef so we're gonna be nice and corporate. So we're making patties nice and thick. Now, I'm just making some burgers. While those are going, I'm going to toast my bread up on this grill pan. A little bit of butter, and oil. The whole reason for the oil is to make sure the burning go up a little higher. Turn up my heat a bit. Give it a nice char. Tiny bit of salt, to make it smooth, salty, in the patty, and a little bit of black pepper. Now you go over. You just kind of see them kind of breaking apart a little bit, but don't worry, we have the cheese as our glue. I'm just using straight up American cheese. Just like Mommy used to make right? And once I put the cheese on, I like to stack them. These are double patty that helps to cheese in the middle melt quicker, and it gives us more room to make another burger. Alright. Now, it's time to just assemble. Nice and cheesy. Beside all of the smokiness and all the richness going on with the burger, bread and butter pickles. Nice sweet accent. Pickles. We're almost there. Adding in these pickles on, we're adding sauce, and that's it. The best burger ever. Nice toasty bun. Crispy, chewy on the inside, juicy burger. There you go. Let's bit around it.", "ubFWaaS3zYw": "[Music] hey it's your girl Jame Emily Utley holistic lifestyle maven and possibility trainer welcome back to the channel possibilities so as you can see young storm is in the building so today I figured that I would share with you guys how I dyed my hair white if you are not following your girl on Instagram follow me on Instagram right right now okay ya'll said on instagram hey Jame how would you get your hair white look I got a number of dm's like janae how did you do that are you going to do a video on it and I was like yeah of course y'all know I have you so typically on my channel people do really enjoy my hair videos which I'm so glad about so if you're here for the first time and you here because of hair I want to encourage you and invite you to stick around for me it is way more important that you are internally beautiful that you are internally fit then how you look on the outside right but I love to make my people my tribe the women who watch my videos I like to help them make the fitness and the beauty that they feel on the inside definitely mesh the outside so there is some congruence there so come in stick around also look at the other videos that I have to help get you fit spiritually mentally emotionally all that now let's hop into this there are multiple ways to skin a cat and through years of testing and trying different things I found that this has worked best for me I'm not a professional I'm only a professional in like managing and handling my hair so I am just here to share with you what I do in the hopes that it might help you do what you want to do if you want to be young storm yourself I will be using L'Oreal's quick blue salons care for tea volume cream developer shimmering light purple shampoo I also have some processing caps in spooley brush to mix everything up and apply it to my hair be sure to check the description box below because I will link everything now it takes me three times yes three times of dyeing or processing my hair to lift it white so to be economical what I typically do is I only use half the pack so this right here you see is half the pack of that quick glue and half of the cream volume or developer I whip it up to a nice yogurty consistency and then I start applying [Music] the day that you plan on dying your hair be sure not to do anything that will educate your scalp or scratch it why because if you apply these products on it and you've been brushing your hair or brushing your scalp when you put this dye on baby it will burn just like a perm so don't do anything that's going to agitate your scalp before or during the dye process additionally do not lollygag when you apply this out of your hair it's always my goal to get everything on and evenly coat it within 5 minutes why so my scalp will not burn so you want to make sure that you slept this on like I said very concise and consistent because you want it to be evenly coated but don't lollygag and do it also do not neglect behind your ears immediately after I finish I go ahead and throw my processing cap on because I process my hair for 60 minutes when I put this cap on it ensures that my scalp does not burst and just in case you are wondering this is a face mask that I'm using I will link it in the description so after that 50 minutes is up then I'll go in and I wash with my purple shampoo and I will deep condition my hair this is a word to the wise the lighter your hair gets the more you will need to dilute the purple shampoo meaning you will need to set it up really good in your hand to make it not purple before you wash your hair with it if not if you let it stay really really purple before you apply it to your hair it will stain your hair purple instead of doing what it needs to do pulling that illness and there brassiness out so again the lighter your hair gets the more and more it get towards that platinum blonde and that white you will need to dilute it meaning you will need to make it really sudsy in your hand - really really dampen down there purple there deep purple color now through my various trials and errors but because I still care about the health of my hair I'm going to always care about the health of my hair even though this processing is very stripping and can be very damaging and because even though I have no short hair I don't care I still want my hair to be healthy so instead of me dying it back to back or like dying getting then doing the toner right after it and I don't use toner anymore because like I said I tried it so many times and it just never worked for me well a mini Pennock it never worked for me I will wash it out with a purple shampoo and I will condition it and I will leave my hair long for a full 24 hours so after 24 hours this is typically what it looks like it's very yellow and very brassy now some people they could get to this point and be like you know what I like this this is good and this is where that purple shampoo comes in handy I'm telling you because the more you wash with that purple shampoo the more that the yellowness will diminish and the brassiness will diminish not all of it but enough for it to make it like oh yeah this is kind of cute so after 24 hours I do the same exact cry 6 I use the other half of the blue powder the rest of the 40 volume cream developer mix it up make good yogurty consistency and then I make my passes around my hair very quickly and put that plastic cap back on and I said it again for 50 minutes now this time when I wash it out with the purple shampoo I'm going to put conditioner on it because by this point it has lifted to a really really pretty platinum blonde it's not quite white yet for me but it's a really really pretty platinum blonde additionally I did over we can't record a video showing how I got my hair this color now it's not white like originally promised it's just so pretty reflect number one but I'm going to wait to release it so I can make your way so after the second day I personally wait about a week and a half two weeks and the reason that I wait is because in that time that's when I am nurturing my hair I'm watching it I'm deep conditioning it I'm conditioning I'm loving on it I'm wrapping it up at night because I do still care about the health of my hair now when I dyed it the third time so after about a week and a half two weeks I got at a third time and I leave do the same process same process put it on saturated really plastic cap leave it on for 50 minutes then final process lifts me all the way to what now this is a major key of alert this is something that I've done that I've made mistakes on I recently made this mistake another oh why isn't it Dwight didn't turn out super duper right like it did the first time this is why the first time that I got my hair white and I dyed it successfully I rolled my hair out for like two months I would my husband would help me keep my lines clean in the front and my lines clean in the back and my design clean but I knew I wanted to dye my hair and I knew I wanted it to have some lip because I like the way my hair looks when it's dyed and it had some limp so I grew it out for two months in preparation for me to got my hair so I lifted it the first day waited 24 hours and I lifted it again then I waited a week and a half or two weeks before I dyed it then third and final time that lifted me to white now going into that third guy I had about an inch or an inch in the ham of Herot they had already been processed twice and I had only had maybe a quarter of an inch that hadn't been dyed right I am drenched I just finished doing challenge number two from my three-week fitness program we have workout together every Monday Wednesday and Friday and on Tuesdays and Thursdays I give challenge the challenge from today seemed very inconspicuous seems you know doable easy but when I tell you these thunder thighs hey fire on fire so when I got it that third time I had like an inch of an inch and a half of hair that was pure white and this small piece underneath it they had lifted to yellow so when I washed it with the purple shampoo day after day after day it looks better and better and better and their small piece that had only been lifted one time and y'all knowing you my children when you lift it one time is super yellow and kind of brassy the purple shampoo was helping it to not be so yellow and brassy but since I had so much lip they had been process three times when I just brushed it down you really couldn't see my roots and it came out super duper I see to know why this time when I did the process I went into it with a fresh could I have two months of new growth on the top I should not have waited a full two weeks or almost two weeks to dye my hair again I only should have went in about four or five days to being redone and lifted the third time so I wouldn't have any or very little new growth now because I waited so like two weeks I had just as much hair that had been dyed twice as I did that was only going to be dyed once so this time my tips are really white but I have new growth underneath that's peaking through because I don't have so much hair on the top so as you can see now I am white but you can see how some areas a little bit of that yellow is peeking through so there is a word to the wise that I'm going to share with you I lift my hair three times to get me all the way super-duper-duper I see right now if you're going to do this and you're going to do it on the low hair or fresh hair on this third die don't wait a week or two weeks wait three for five days and then read I it so it'll lift every single piece of your hair all the way white get it so I hope you enjoyed this video I hope

your own risk but remember you still need to be doing stuff that keeps your hair healthy so you still need to be conditioning it you still need to be deep conditioning and putting oils on it you still need to be wrapping it up at night and sleeping on a silk pillowcase or send pillowcase because that is things that I still do but it's till next time bye be blessed", "uc3BhyrDhJs": "the cap at home

like to thank our sponsors the community education commission of the city of detroit and general motors for allowing us to make these videos four times a week at 4pm on facebook live and all right i think i have everything i need here um today i am showing you how to do a lena iris victor inspired painting and it's really about experimenting with a different process to kind of get you in a different mindset so it's not going to be exactly like her artwork which is not the goal at all the goal is to just kind of get your juices flowing and help you think of something in a different way help you think of art in a different way so if you want to do this as a painting then you will need some paint i have acrylic paints here and i only chose a few colors because she has um she uses a limited color palette in a very exciting way so i'll have a couple colors here and then if you have paint you're probably going to need some paint brushes and some water so you can see mine is a little used already a little loved and um with her artwork she uses metallic paint so you may want to get some metallic paint um if you can't get your hands on metallic acrylic paint then you might use um nail polish or puffy paint or something like that what else do we have if you're going to be painting you'll need some paper towels or some kind of towels to dry your brushes off and clean them off you'll also need some glue and you'll need a face cut out from a magazine and in addition to this cutout i used mod podge to seal my paper and by seal it i meant to kind of protect it kind of like a lamination um but it makes it shiny and a little bit thicker so that works for me it's it's an optional step but you can do it if you want this is available at craft stores and at the dollar tree and you're also going to need some something to paint on so um i got this canvas from the dollar tree they sell them in several different sizes now so it's readily available for you you don't have to go to a craft store and pay a lot of money this was only one dollar and then um if you don't have this you don't need to have a canvas you can always use cardboard which will give you a nice sturdy thing to background to work on or you can use paper so i'm going to show you the process that i went through to get here but i'm going to draw it out because painting is going to take a long time and i want you guys to take your time but i want to show you the steps that i went through with paint and glitter and different things like that to get to this point so i won't be painting on this video because there will be absolutely no way for you to see everything if i did that so what i'm doing in pencil and marker and all that you can do and paint glitter whatever you want to use to experiment with this process alrighty now set her there i'm going to make sure i'm on camera still okay it looks like you can see everything so the first thing that we're going to do is create this halo like effect here by drawing a circle and if you need help drawing your circle you could always trace a bowl or something like that of course not a bowl with water in it oh i have something else here so if you want to draw a perfect circle you can trace something so that's going to be that background halo effect that we have going on there and one thing that might be good to do is to kind of measure how big your head is to see you know how much of it is going to fit in the circle and how much if you need to make your circle bigger or smaller i think that's a pretty good size for what we're doing next you're going to draw a triangular shape kind of from the middle of this circle down to the bottom of your canvas or whatever you're working on and mine like you'll see it kind of has some shoulders to be more like a body in a cape so if you want to give it a little like stylize it a little bit you can but a really simple way to do this would be to just kind of make a point close to the middle it doesn't need to be perfect and then sketch a triangle shape and my sides are kind of curved because that's what i like it's personal preference and i would really suggest this part doing this on canvas even if you're going to paint do this in pencil so you can get your ideas down and then once you have your ideas down it'll kind of be like a coloring book page so you can fill it in with color later but get your ideas down with this pencil okay so after you have this this is the general shapes that you are going to paint in and now you're going to fill in this background with color so if you are using paint i highly suggest doing what's called a wash over the entire background with your lighter color you don't want to start with your darker color because then when you go on top of that color it's going to be really difficult to get your brighter color to stand out so you want to start with the lightest color and let's grab some markers so i can show you kind of what i mean okay so i'm going to use yellow and purple why not because that's what i did so we're imagining this is my paint brush and i'm just going to fill in this background completely and take my time with my lighter color and on my canvas i did a couple of layers so i painted and it was okay if i got kind of in my um inside my drawing right here that's fine if you go a little bit over the edge because you can kind of clean it up later but i went through my background and i did a couple of layers of the lighter color see if i do this with the darker color there's no way that me trying to put this yellow paint over here on top is going to work well so after i did my background i added my shapes and you'll see like now i have this purple that's kind of in the way of my yellow and even though your paint will eventually layer up and you can get a solid color it's going to take a lot more work if you use a dark color in the background that's why i encourage you to do the lighter color first and then when you do your shapes in the background you may still need to do layers because you might see the color shining through but you'll have to do a lot less work so let's work smarter it is art and you can experiment and do whatever you want to do but that's my suggestion and in the background of um lena's artwork she has a lot of geometric um shapes so you'll do squares triangles that kind of thing if you are following us on facebook instagram and even on youtube you've probably seen the ad that we put up for today and you've seen her actual work you can also google her her name is let me write it down it's in the title and her work was featured in a music video with kendrick lamar and scizza um it's a song that came out when the movie black panther came out so if you see the artwork you'll be like oh i recognize that so you can go ahead and google her and see the artwork that we're kind of working with and hopefully you get inspired too but back to what we're doing with our background so you can fill it in with your background shapes and i would definitely suggest getting this part done first before you get into the subject of your painting because it's going to be a lot easier to work with the background and then because you might kind of get into this um inside area and you can cover it up when you actually get to the subject of your painting so go ahead and put your geometric shapes back there and remember that we are not copying her artwork we are being inspired by it we're trying to see what her process may have been see how she got to where she um started doing paintings like this and maybe that process will inspire you to start working differently or to use a new medium like so maybe if you don't paint all the time start painting because we're trying to um see how she did what she did so and then they also have she also has like some metallic lines going through everything and overlapping and my metallic pan ran out because i would have liked to do a lot more in the background but i'm going to use this orange to kind of represent those metallic lines it's kind of and another thing is if you um have a way to kind of look at her artwork while you're working that would be great i'm using my cell phone to record this but when i was working on my example i had the picture that i was being inspired by next to me so i could kind of get an idea of what she did in her background and some things that can kind of make my artwork artwork look a little bit more like hers and have that same kind of feel so just go crazy have fun with it and i think also working like this you kind of realize like wow people really do take a lot of time to get uh where they are because you you'll realize oh i can't just pick up a paintbrush and do exactly what she did you know because she spent some time so it might give you a deeper appreciation for um working in a way that you don't normally work alright so we have our background what is the next step now we are going to fill in this circle with our metallic paint so i'm going to let you go ahead and do that with actual metallic paint if you have this i would definitely suggest the acrylic paint um don't put a lot of water in it because that really kind of messed me up on mine that's why i ended up using glitter because it was shinier and i wasn't getting the shine that i wanted with the paint um i do know that this artist used what's called gold leaf which is like actual flakes of gold and you kind of glue them down to the surface but that is not something that i have at home so i didn't go out and buy anything i just used glitter that i already had so it gave me a similar effect and like i said we're inspired by we're not copying so you're going to take your paint and you're going to go inside of your circle and you're going to layer that paint so that you can get a very shiny gold or whatever kind of metallic you're using you want that to be very very bright vibrant so go ahead and fill in that circle and then you're going to decide what color you want the cape to be because like my girl is wearing like an african print kind of cape which in the artwork that we're looking at is what's going on so i try to mimic that as much as possible so you're going to decide what is the lightest color you want to use in that cape and then you can go ahead and put that in the background i decided to use this really light orange in my background which i think worked out really well even though you can still kind of see the orange through the purple i like that you don't have like gaps of white in there it looks a little more complete when you um put a background down first so on the case of my my example here we can just fill that in with yellow because that's the lightest color i'm working with and i would definitely suggest layers as usual you definitely want to come in with layers and build that up so you have a really solid background i'm going to just kind of trace this cape out so you can see what i'm doing next and i'm just going to place my head in here to make sure my cape looks the way that i want it to along with the head and i think i want to kind of add a little shoulder-ish kind of curve there so when i'm painting i'm going to make sure this cake part comes all the way up around the edge of my face cut out i'm gonna fill it in there just like that and then i know where my cape will be and how i need to decorate it in relationship to my face cut out so i can slide her to the side um and if you want to use the mod podge to seal this and make it shiny kind of like her face is on here you got a little sheen then you can go ahead and do that because this will need to um you need to paint it separately and let it dry off to the side so you can do that at any time but i just went over it with my pad mod podge and a paintbrush just to get that sheen so back to our cape um now you are going to create all of the patterns in the cape and i thought that part was kind of fun it really did force me to experiment and do some things differently than i normally would have in fact i didn't use paint on all of this i ended up pulling out some gel pens and like some writing pins and even some white out so you can really push this to the limit and try some different things that you wouldn't normally do or mix some things that you normally do with some new ideas so with this you want to divide up the cape into small sections so that you can create your patterns so i just did um let me see you can create what i call other like other triangles in here it's kind of a triangular shape i'm coming from the edge wash it the edge of the cape which i will darken up so you can see triangular ish shapes they don't need to be perfect triangles and then just kind of have them come together in different ways okay so now i have one two three four five smaller areas and um in the example the fabric kind of has these bold stripes with smaller patterns in there so now i'm going to go back and add some stripes starting at the bottom kind of and it will kind of create a checker board and when i did this on my painting this is when i was using the pen because i was not going to challenge myself to create this structure with paint because that would be a little bit difficult but you are definitely welcome to try doing this in paint if you have that kind of patience to do detail work like that with paint but i would suggest even using your pencil to block it out first and then adding your paint if you want to paint the lines in or your shapes or what have you so now i'm making some stripes that go more vertically and then i'm going to create some wider stripes and then okay so now that i have all of these little um stripes you can break it down even more because i noticed in her cape there are a lot of stripes inside of stripes but that is up to you you can make up whatever kind of patterns you want to go in your sections so i will show you what i kind of did i made it kind of i made squares and then did little sample um pattern so i did stripes here or vertical stripes here and then right next to it maybe i'll do some horizontal-ish kind of stripes and because this is fabric and patterns tend to repeat i would do this same thing and several more places so let's do it right here in the center front area now break this down a little more so that it kind of looks like training tracks but inside each box i will do draw some stripes or paint them if you're painting and start to bring this cake together so like i said i used um gel pens and regular ballpoint pens and stuff like that to help get my design in there the way that i wanted it so even though you start out with paint it can become a mixed media kind of thing it doesn't have to be all paint so i'm going to do some more stripes in another area and so i think stripes are pretty easy easy pattern to get started with and then once you have stripes in enough areas it's up to you to decide how many areas is enough you can do the whole thing in stripes if you want and you can also switch up the colors that you do the stripes in because i did that too so got some orange stripes here now add some orange in there and i think i did um maybe four or five different kinds of patterns so i have some stripes i have um some kind of checker boards just to make it a little more fun and more interesting so once you get started with this and you break the steps down you'll see that you can do this this is not something that is outside of the scope of things you can do you can all you can definitely do this you can handle making stripes drawing simple shapes like circles and triangles i think once you break it down you can you have the confidence confidence to say oh yeah i can i can make that so if you have any questions about what to do with this project or maybe um if there's something i didn't explain clearly enough go ahead and leave me some comments in the comment area because i will be happy to explain it further but basically it's just about looking at some artwork and asking yourself how can i do this you know someone else actually painted this i can paint that too it might be a little off when you first do it but be patient with yourself and really practice if you do something that you don't like you can start over you can try to fix it in a creative way it doesn't need to be perfect but it just gets your mind going about different ways to do things so you're not always creating the same thing because i know it's easy for us as artists to kind of get stuck in a rut doing the same things over and over again so maybe look at someone else's work and go how do how did they do that and try to figure it out yourself so you'll keep going and filling this in with patterns you'll see i started to do my checkerboard pattern which is really just diagonal stripes going over each other is not even that much different than the regular stripes but it does give us a little variation and a little bit of difference going on in our patterns so hopefully i have simplified this enough for you before we get going i would like to thank you all so much for joining me and i really hope you try this out if you do make sure you email us a picture of your work or a picture of you working on your work to cap at community i'm sorry you're going to email cap at college4creativestudies.edu go ahead and check us out in that little caption because you can just copy and paste that right into your email and send us a picture of what you're doing we would love to feature you on our social media which includes facebook instagram and youtube we have a library of videos so you will never be bored if you want to do some art you can do some art at any time but if you want to do live art here on facebook live with us meet us at 4 p.m monday tuesday wednesday and thursday we will be here cap and go detroit will provide art tutorials for you for free thanks to the community education commission of the city of detroit and general motors so i am miss rachel today we did some inspired painting hopefully you guys got into it and we would love to see what you do so i will see you next monday here at 4 but make sure you join us tomorrow tuesday with miss ali and so you guys can do some more artwork all right i'll see you later bye", "eBXqWgWqk6E": "[Music] oh [Music] hi good evening everybody good evening guys welcome yeah good evening andrew hey good evening guys hi everyone um can everybody um hear us

and randy for hosting tonight and to all viewers out there thank you for tuning in instead of watching korean dramas or netflix movies after your dinner you decided to tune in to learn more about ancom so thank you very much so let me allow me to introduce and come to everyone now what does ncom do now a lot of people know us as a chemical company but let me share a little bit more with you guys now ncome manufacturers aggro agrochemical products and we sell them worldwide to more than 40 countries and why do growers across the globe seek our products year after year that's because our products perform a very crucial function in the plantation field now imagine yourself driving along a malaysian highway passing by rows and rows of palmer trees now those palmer trees are what we call as crops and crops are what we intentionally grow they're what we deliberately invest in to harvest you know so that we can harvest the fruit to sell for money now for growers this would mean you know selling uh crude palm oil for instance now on the same piece of land apart from the crops there are also unwanted plants growing around them now these plants take up the same food source as the crops so imagine yourself as a plantation owner investing in fertilizer food for your crops for your babies and you have all these weeds you know unwanted weeds proliferating around now what do you do you have to get rid of the weeds and to get rid of the weeds you'll need a class or category of products called herbicides now this is exactly what our products do our products target the weeds so that we can kill the weeds and the growers can grow the crops as best as possible now this is what our products do generally we have herbicides insecticides you know pesticides etc now all these is a total solutions for growers worldwide now in our company we have a tagline called we are all customers of ancom now why do we say so that's because uh the crops that we serve are mainly palm oil sugarcane and cotton and these three are amongst the most basic and important commodity that you know you and i consume on a daily basis for one we are wearing you know cotton clothes we need oil to do our cooking you know to do uh chocolate tail for example and we need sugar to make a tatari or even coca-cola so uh you know from uh we have a joke in our company so you have to think of an com daily morning afternoon and night you know in the morning when you have your data rate you think of ancon because you're having sugar and you know lunch time you're having chocolate everything of ancon when you go back home at night you take off your cotton shirt for shower you think of and coming in so ancon manufactures agrochemical products and we play a very special place in the whole food security supply chain where we provide solutions to growers worldwide to solve their weed problems let me just move the slides now in the universe of you know agrochemical producers there are thousands and thousands of manufacturers but only a handful of active ingredients manufacturer now allow me to clarify a little bit more on this active ingredients part now when we refer to active ingredients or in short ai you know active ingredients are the compounds in the product that gives it its unique properties for example whenever we're having a headache we would take a panadol pill so the compound in the panadol pill that makes it work that makes it effective is actually paracetamol and you know it constitutes just a tiny bit of the product in terms of a percentage so same goes for agrochemicals we are a active ingredient producer while the rest are called formulators of course we do formulation as well but in terms of producing active ingredients because it requires a higher level of capability a higher level of expertise and know-how we're able to command a higher margins compared to just purely formulating products just another analogy you know formulating products would be akin to mixing drinks in the bar you know mix and match but making the ai is like you know producing whiskey so it is a different different aspect in the whole production process now in encom we are very proud to be the only ai manufacturer and not just in malaysia but also in southeast asia so this is one of the very few achievements that you know we are very proud of now apart from agrochemicals uh you know within ancon group we are also one of the only two manufacturers of ethanol in malaysia so i think we're the second largest ethanol manufacturer in malaysia after hexa so uh the whole group have we have a 50-year track record because you know the key subsidiary which is the agrochemical subsidiary called an com crop care it is actually started in 1969 and more than 50 years ago so as i've mentioned before agrochemicals would be our key division which is the subsidiary giving the highest profit contribution to the overall income group now our products apart from producing active ingredients were formulated into herbicides insecticides fungicides as well as timber preservatives now timber preservatives are used to enhance and preserve the wood used in you know the shipping industry or even laying the rail tracks to prevent fungus and termite attacks now for ancon we also own and control another listed company called nylex berhad now for nylex uh they are also a manufacturer of industrial chemicals such as ethanol phosphate acid adhesives and sealant as well as for the trading division they are one of the largest distributors of methanol in the region now of course another smaller subsidiary within the whole ancom group would be an com logistics berhad of course we have some of our logistics assets parked under alb but as you all know alb is undergoing a uh asset sale with nylex and it is also undergoing a reverse takeover process with a target company called s5 systems now coming back to uh agrochemicals you know apart from being an active ingredients manufacturer we are also very proud of our products being able to export to more than 40 countries worldwide now we are export-oriented agrocamp player where more than two-thirds of our products around 65-70 percent is exported worldwide and what enables us to export worldwide is not only our product quality or consistency in delivery but also because of this thing called a registration now unlike other industry for example fmcg or food industry where you can push your product from lab to sales within a short span of time for example if you're a manufacturer of biscuits you know if you have a new flavor you can push it out to the market in maybe one or two weeks or a month or two a month or so but for agrochemicals because our products are essentially uh poisonous products used around crops that are actually food source it is heavily and strictly regulated by you know the respective authorities in each country now in malaysia our products our pesticides are regulated under the ministry of agriculture and each product registration would take roughly around a year and a half if we are lucky to an average of a two-year time frame so it is a very uh long and tedious process from lab you know to feel to be able to sell them commercially we have to go through a lot of a data collection a lot of field tests lab tests until we've satisfied the paperwork only then we have the necessary registrations to sell of course this would mean that the whole industry is uh it's a very it's a very uh protected industry in a sense where you know the entry of the barrier entry is pretty high and pretty tough it's not just about money but also the time needed to accumulate the necessary registrations it's just like having a passport where you can enter different countries so our products you know we are registered in more than 40 countries and this is a accumulation of hard work over 50 years you know i think not many company or not many agrochemical company can say the same way as we do apart from manufacturing active ingredients we have integrated value chain where we synthesize active ingredients we also formulate them into end products under our own brand name as well as oem for other manufacturers and we also do some trading and distribution now to give everyone a little bit of a flavor of our products and now the two main products that we sell are actually msma and dairon as you can see on the screen now for msma we have more than a 50 percent of a global market share and we are one of the only two producers worldwide and for dairon we are one of the only seven uh dairon producers worldwide so you know as you can see the products that we are in are very specific it is very niche msma this is a little bit more technical msma is a post-emergent contact herbicides that is uh appropriate for you know palm oil trees in the nursery stage now msma is post-emergent contact and dairon is a pre-emergent systemic now we don't have to really know too much about this but you know one refers to killing the weeds at the leaves dairon will kill the weeds at the root stage so you know top and bottom both also you know we can whack and kill the weeds effectively that is about you know providing a total solutions to the uh plantations now apart from sugarcane cotton and palm oil our product portfolio caters to a wide variety of other crops as well for example cereal pineapple corn citrus cocoa coffee and turf etc now our products portfolio as uh as shown in on the screen you know msma and dioramon would constitute the two main products a 2 4 d glyphosate moniks are other products and of course monex is a mixture of the first two msma and dairon this is what we call as a cocktail products you know as the name suggests cocktail refers to mexic so we are the only one in the world doing this specific mixture this cocktail and it is our signature product and yes we name it to sound a little bit more like money you know it's a it's a one of the highest profit generator for ncom [Music] now we manufacture out of two locations one in sha alam and one in clang the capacity for shah alam is about thirty thousand metric tons for clang is about twelve thousand metric tons now the utilization rate is at seventy percent and fifty percent respectively of course on the same piece of land in clang we are undergoing an expansion where we are building three new production lines to cater for three to four new active ingredients going forward now throughout the 50 year history of ancom we've relied on four main active ingredients and it has carried us you know so far for 50 years but to grow in a in the next stage to grow exponentially and to continue the uh amazing growth momentum that we've experienced for the past few years yeah we're undergoing this expansion and it is expected to start contributing commercially starting uh next calendar year so uh the world map here and the list of countries uh just illustrates the number of countries that we are in the country's in red we are registering for for the uh for our new products uh just to give you an example of how challenging or how much challenge that we have to overcome to get into all these international markets you know as i've mentioned before for the malaysian market uh we require around two years of registration to be able to sell our products but the longest that we have faced is actually in brazil you know our our lab our our people have spent you know a total of seven years registering going back and forth brazil you know replying to tons of emails you know uh before we were able to sell our products into brazil and it has paid off handsomely because you know uh since starting uh our business in brazil uh in mid uh 2000s brazil has grown to become our number one export market out of malaysia it contributes around 13 to 15 of our annual revenue that's because our products uh are especially suited for sugarcane now as you know brazil is the largest sugarcane producer in the world and we are very lucky we are very proud that we are i think the only malaysian agrochemical company to have a presence in brazil and united states two of the largest agriculture markets in the world for our revenue breakdown as you can see malaysia is still our number one market where we provide agrochemicals to palm oil plantations brazil is our second largest market for the united states we are catering for their cotton market you know for the cotton growers and in australia new zealand uh this is where our timber preservatives market are and as well as some asean market now in terms of the product breakdown as i've mentioned before msma and dairon constitute majority of our revenue revenue and profit now you can see here this pest control time to do a little bit of advertisement we have a unit under ancomp called antopest you know this pest control unit we've acquired since two years ago and it is the unit responsible for providing sanitizers and sanitizing services and you know business has been booming since uh the pandemic because of this a new requirement for for sanitizing spaces so if you happen to pass by watson's or any other supermarket if you happen to bump into a you know sanitizer with the label and got this is from us on the left the green one is the non-alcohol version the regular alcohol version would be the blue one the one in blue now for our agrocam market the customers uh uh would mainly consist of growers such as the locals that most of us would be familiar with you know on the bottom we have syme dolby fgv you know ioi klk these are the plantation big boys in malaysia but for overseas market uh the list of clients for an com is uh pretty impressive for example you know the the top left one upl uh upl is our customer for brazil it is a company listed in india with more with a market cap of i think 26 billion ringgit united phosphates limited and on the far right lonza is a swiss listed company uh 200 billion ringgit market cap so we are very proud of our list of clients because you know to comply with the requirements of products from all these multinational companies you know it uh we demonstrate uh ancom has been able to demonstrate our consistent delivery and supplying quality products to the top agrochemical companies in the world of course this is uh the management of ancomp crop care we have our group ceo mr lee also helming ancom crop care the subsidiary in charge of agrochemical products and of course we have a new addition to our company last year you know we've grown organically throughout the years uh to where we are today and last year we appointed a new director mr wong on the right he was previously the investment director of navy's capital partners he brings with him a wealth of experiences for deals that he's made throughout southeast asia so we are very excited going forward apart from the new active ingredients that we are embarking on at our port clang site we are also looking at a lot of m a opportunities and we'll consider them if there is any now the second segment of ncom apart from agrochemicals would be industrial chemicals as i've said before we own and control nylex another listed company in malaysia now for the manufacturing side we have ethanol phosphate acids and sealants now of course uh you know it wouldn't uh time wouldn't allow me to get into two specifics but uh what we are trying to do with nylax is that if you have studied us for the past two years you know encom was indeed loss making for the past two years it was because of a downturn in the oil prices where the trading division of nylex being one of the largest distributor of methanol which is a petroleum derived product now on the downtrend uh you know as a trader and distributor nylex was having a challenging time but of course uh given the reversal in the oil prices as well as the uptake in uh petroleum products demand with economic recovery we are slowly seeing 9 lakhs turning around going forward and of course with the growth in the agrochemical as uh as the most profitable division if we are able to contain the losses on nylon side coupled with a profitable agrochemical division we are very optimistic uh of our coming few you know coming few financial years where we are able to deliver what we've always been telling investors of course this is uh okay on the ethanol side we are running at six million liters capacity running at full speed because of this new demand on alcohol given the pandemic situation and we have applied successfully for an expansion plan up to 10 million liters and we are currently undergoing the uh pre-construction phase for this ethanol now logistics would mainly be encom logistics the assets under alb is not very large in the context of the whole group so we would not spend too much time on this i would then pass the floor to my group ceo to explain more about how he sees encom going forward how he plans to steer the company into you know profitable years uh you know putting putting all the losses behind us and i hope uh what i've shared has enabled everyone to have a little bit more understanding on ncom and our agrochemical division because a lot of investors perception on ancom is that we are a industrial company or we are a chemical company but of course in the universe of chemicals there are so many types of chemicals and what we are doing is very specific we provide solutions in the food security supply chain we solve the wheat problems for growers not just in malaysia but worldwide for palm oil sugarcane and cotton and this is the gist of berhad thank you for listening and i would like to pass the floor back to my ceo thank you andrew for the concise and clear presentation about the group now minte and uh randy i realized that the um the youtube version i think the slice comes out about 30 seconds is that is that right our um our stream yard against the uh the life yeah andrew one step before okay okay i think there's a 30 seconds so basically uh while waiting for the page to come in i'll explain a little bit about the group a bit further so going forward essentially a chemical company involved sorry there's a bit of people right so essentially we are a chemical company involved in the agri-chemicals products and also the industrial chemical products so here we have a one page to explain about the growth catalyst going forward a lot of people are asking you know going forward what a key reason for growth for the company uh in the coming years or coming two years or so so this page uh essentially summarizes the key growth factors going forward here we have the first part is basically the new product o1 and second the expansion plans we're going to talk a little bit about and also that the macro recovery mostly for the industrial chemical sector so on the right side basically new ai as andrew mentioned uh currently we're involved in about four active ingredients in malaysia and in southeast asia we are the only uh active ingredient producer for herbicide related product and also indonesia we have a one small pesticide active ingredient producer so in the entire southeast asia there are only two companies involved in the synthesizing of the african india that makes angkor very special compared to a lot of other industrial players in the region most of most of the players are formulators instead of the synthesizer of the molecules here going forward in the next few pages i think i'm going to explain a little bit about the new ai new active ingredient that we're going to embark on in the next two years second part basically the capacity expansion so for every chemical products the new ai requires new capacity and new factories to house our facilities and house our production so going forward we're going to expand the capacity for the every chemical division and later we've got one page to show the expansion plans and also for the industrial chemical division we will have expansion on the tunnel production under nilex so uh currently we're producing about six million liters and going forward we hope to be able to produce about 10 million liters a year and the last part is basically the expected recovery in the global economy as you may have realized a lot of mobility prices are on the price uh the petrol chemical prices are also on the rise and diesel the petrol uh already i think the the crude oil prices has already increased to maybe about 70 usd uh at the moment so uh uh going forward our industrial chemical condition is very much positively correlated with the petrochemical industry and also the industrial chemical now next page we're going to talk a little bit about that all right if you take a look at this uh bloomberg the global food prices are at six year high and are set to keep on climbing if you take a look at the graphical depiction here 2015 we are at the low but prior to that it was coming down and now we are at the all-time high for the past six years as you are real as you may be realized uh a lot of commodities uh on the high cycle at the moment in the last two years we were talking about 9 lakhs especially the industrial chemical product is on the low cycle but at the moment everything else is on the high so next page especially relevant to us next page we would have the prices of the sugar now everybody consumes sugar and now i try to reduce the intake of sugar because i want to lose some weight but sugar is a commodity it's a staple food that everybody will require on a daily basis if you take a look at this graph from 2017 uh actually it was on the way down to 2020 and in the last one year we are now reaching 17 cents per pound for the sugar now sugar price is on the rice and not only sugar price the animal feed and a lot of other commodities especially industrial chemicals like methanol they're all on the rice so how is it relevant to us in the sense now for sugar uh as andrew's presentation shows that we sell a lot to the sugarcane plantation worldwide especially in brazil africa and also australia so high sugar prices will translate into higher purchasing power from the customers so uh with the high sugar prices uh generally we can expect farmers will spend more money on the fertilizer and also on the practice side so this trend is definitely a good trend for uh agrochemical division uh proceed all right so that's irrelevant on this page now next i'm going to talk a little bit about our entry chemical division in terms of the regional now as andrew mentioned when you wake up the moment you wake up to the moment you sleep actually we consume sugar and we consume we also use a lot of cotton so our food supply basically is a key catalyst for our business and revenues now with the increasing population and also land scarcity there will always be growing importance of the reliable supply for the main crops hence there is a rising demand for good quality pesticides so our involvement in the in the food chain industry is through the administration of the poisonous or the poison and of the pesticide to help the main crop to get away all the weeds so that nobody is fighting or this week will not be fighting for the same nutrients for the for the main crops as you can see here population worldwide since 20 30 years ago is ever rising with the rising population there will be rising rising demand for the food with the rising demand for the food there will always be rising demand for fertilizer and also for pesticide so from food security uh perspective ancom's business will continue to grow going forward now secondly diversity diversification from china now the biggest active ingredient producer are always china and india because china has got a huge network of the chemical production so i think worldwide in terms of the active ingredient for chemical industry i think 60 70 comes from china so for the last 20 years there has there has been a lot of dependence on the active ingredient coming from china for herbicide and pesticide all the products are using the raw material from china but however for the last few years three to four years at least there has been a lot of issues on the supply of active ingredient and the intermediate chemicals from china it is due to the changes in policy or due to certain sizeable accidents in terms of the plant explosion or due to other maybe viruses and all that so the supply from china has been uh has not been very consistent for the past few years for example i think two weeks two to three years ago along the yangtze river all the chemical plants within the one kilometer radius distance from the river must be relocated that's why there was a huge disruption of the chemical supply from china resulting from that many customers has come to us to ask if we are able to synthesize certain molecules certain active ingredient for them in order to reduce the dependence on china for the last few years policy changes and also for example i think in 2018 there was a huge explosion that took place in jiangsu province as a result explosion of one of the plants i think about 120 people disappeared and some evaporated it was a huge explosion resulting from that there was a four month the interruption of supply for certain chemicals so uh realizing that a lot of customers wanting to diversify their sources of supply not depending on china and hence they come to southeast asia or indonesia they are limited very limited corporation that does this molecule or active ingredient synthesizing so we income poised to benefit from being the sole producer of the herbicide active ingredient in southeast asia so this is one very important aspect going forward and that's the reason why we wanted to focus on our core competency to really focus doing the ai going forward so we are going to increase from four to eight active ingredient going forward all right next slide please now we target to double the number of ai's from four to eight as mentioned here so currently we are building a new 70 000 square feet facility uh on the land adjacent to our existing facility in port clan now on the on the darker part basically a shader part is basically our existing formulation plans as you can see here uh the blue line uh the the three boxes depicted in the blue line it is basically our new factories for the new active ingredient to be produced for the next two years going forward as you can see here 70 000 square feet split into three distinctive uh factory space now our products are very sensitive to the plantation sector there there cannot be any cross contamination of the active ingredient between one another uh cross contamination will cause a lot of trouble to the plantation administration in the sugarcane farm as well as the cotton or palm oil industry in malaysia so for every active ingredient we need to house them and put them into one specific space so for this new additional capacity we are going to about to increase about 4 000 metric tonne of new active ingredient to be sold to our customers and we expect the construction to complete by third quarter if not the fourth quarter because during this pandemic we've got huge issues getting the development order i think we just recently got the development order approved and also uh in terms of the production in terms of the factory uh established factory building i think we're facing a bit of challenges during this pandemic period at the same time for all this design for the installation of all the equipment we are waiting for some chinese engineer to come in at the moment traveling uh overseas and inviting chinese engineer to come here is a bit of an issue but nevertheless we will work hard we will continue to press to complete it by third quarter if not four quarter and we hope to be able to commence operation by fourth quarter if not the first quarter uh 2022 all right next page now just to give you a little bit few on the new ai's that we produce now we here we put the active ingredient by the capital letter due to the due to the confidentiality of the requirement with the customers we are not divulging any information relating to these but we put a calculator to represent the product so b e t c and s basically for example for b it is used in pineapple and non-crop usage in japan mostly in japan and a bit in u.s and mexico and indonesia for the pineapples so the market size is about a thousand five i think we are i think this year i think maybe increase to two thousand so we are targeting to maybe uh capture about three to four hundred metric ton in uh the second half of this year or in the first half of next year uh sales potential is about 20 million now targeted gp here or we put 15 percent generally our existing product commands the gp margin of approximately 30 to 40 percent uh now this is these are new molecules that we are about to produce usually there's a learning curve for uh conservative reasons i mean we are looking at 15 for the initial year of uh production until we achieve the economies of skills i think we may be expecting 25 to 30 for the new product so we take it roll out in third quarter which is about three months from now so i think we are able to produce this product because we started about two years ago the second one e for australia specifically for australian market uh technical about is about 4 000 so we target to produce a technical now for e they are only limited i think about three to four uh producer in the world so basically for this also we target the row outer to four quarter this year now t is a bigger value product used hugely in brazil south africa australia it's basically for the herbicide also so we plan to produce about one thousand metric ton and the potential sales resulting from the one thousand metric tons about 64 million so uh 15 in the longer term about 25 to 30 percent right so there will be another two product coming soon i think we will talk about it in future all right so this will give you a bit of view of the product that we produce we will soon gonna produce in in moving forward all right so next um all right this page if you have time you read the the reading here but basically the next page uh i'm gonna talk a little bit about the financial now as a group we produce i think in terms of revenue we achieve about 1.5 to 1.9 billion ringgit malaysia so that sounds like a a big number so in terms of the contribution by the different segments within the group i think we put it simply uh we simplify it into this diagram to show that the contribution of pat by different segment within the group as you can see here historically for the past six years the highest contribution of profitability to the group is true that every camp division is the provision that andrew has just presented to you so uh 34 being 35 million be the highest in 2019 2020 there was a dip down to 25 million pat is still attributable to the uh natural disaster that took place in 2020 uh 2020 we have a flood in u.s we also got a bush fire in australia if you can still remember there was a huge bush fire that took about three to four months so every time when there's a natural disaster the agrichemical division will be affected because when whenever there's a natural disaster they will be lesser dependent on the pesticide and also on the fertilizer because the main crop will be killed by the natural disaster so this year i think for the first six months on the public on the quarterly result we already announced better uh result for the agrichemical if you take a look at our segmental reporting in the quarterly report the second part in terms of the profitability contribution comes from the nylax group as you can see the orange color now as you can see here nylex for the past two years experienced a loss after tax of 4.5 and also 20.3 the orange line this is inc this is in line with the low cycle experience in the industrial chemical uh division all other businesses are also similarly affected but for the first six months if you take a look at alex and also encompass result you will see a bit of recovery of 9x and going forward as we we show you the rising commodity prices with that in place we hope the industrial chemical division the trading part of nalex will recover very very soon now alb ancon logistic rehard actually is involved in the chemical uh tanking and also transportation of the chemical bond liquid we've got about 100 iso tankers we also have this tank farm amounting to about 44 000 cubic meters so all these businesses are there to support our chemical group as a whole it's housed under income logistic as you can see here the profitability is not significant hence that's why there was a announcement earlier to transfer the business to nylex group i think you can refer to the announcement to understand this be further now two other factors that will change a lot going forward would be the red line now redline uh basically shows our profitability from the media group as you are when media group now exp is experiencing very challenging time when there is whenever there's a pandemic or there is a downturn of economy most people will cut back the a tax advertising expenditure now 2000 uh 2018 about two years ago the group has decided to focus on our core business of chemical involving agrichemical and also the industrial chemical going forward hence we we have disposed of maturity state of the media business to our partner in vgr in thailand they are quite a big company market cap about is about 10 billion ringgit they are the regional players so we have uh relinquished our majority state for them to turn around the group so at the moment we are minority state and going forward the contribution from from the media group will be minimal and the last part is essentially the corporate cost as you can see here the corporate cost uh is on the reducing trend from 20 over a million to the current level of 13 million and going forward will continue to reduce the corporate cost uh as a result uh of this corporate cost reduction i think going forward most of this profitability can surface can come back can contribute back to the shareholders now the reduction of this corporate cost from 2017 to 2020 is mostly attributable to the reduction of the debt at income prohibit level the corporate debt so all this that was incurred in the past in financing some of the businesses loss making business so going forward we are very focused in the debt reduction program in enhancing the profitable business and also to stop the loss-making business all right next page all right a little bit about the first quarter and second quarter result that we announced uh a few months ago uh this page basically one of we want to show you that uh since last year 2018 19 and 20 the last three years especially 2020 the patami of angkor prahat was 9.7 million loss all right uh the loss was contributed mostly on the last quarter where we have some right now in the industrial chemical uh divisions goodwill and all that but for the first quarter and second quarter we are on the recovery trend three million and six million and overall the margin has improved and we are about to announce our third quarter result and hopefully uh is on the rising trend all right and next um next page basically uh shows a little bit about our determination in terms of that reduction now this page to show you the last line basically the net gearing from 2018 it was 0.79 times and 2021 second quarter we are already at 0.56 times net gearing so basically there is a reduction of the of the borrowing at a group level uh basically is attributable to our effort to make sure that our debt level is not too high going forward and hence with the reduction of that we will have lesser interest going going forward hence the lower corporate cost so basically i hope uh this uh a little bit uh talking about the strategy and catalyst going forward and also a little bit uh pick uh a showing of our financial through the graphical division will give you a better idea of our group so with this i hand over back to uh rondi and also maintain thank you very much thank you mr lee for the wonderful session and also andrew um i like the presentation a lot you answered a lot of the question that people have in their mind but we also have some questions from the floor that i think is quite interesting so we'll go segment by segment so we'll start from the crop care business first so maybe randy you have some questions first maybe you can shoot it first um randy you're muted sorry sorry okay so yeah i mean mr lee and andrew very good presentation thanks for letting us into your business and understanding better about your business i think some of the questions that i have and seeing some of the questions from the floor um you know just to apologize in advance you might maybe need to um kind of like repeat some of the things that you mentioned earlier yeah but um yeah i think the first question i would like to start with this i think i have a similar question as well you know like over here michael is asking that um due to the uh kind of like agricultural commodity super cycle that you mentioned earlier you know cpu cpu is at 13 year high corn is at eight year high soybean is at seven year high and sugar is at five year high coffee is at five year high um how you know um how has your average selling price been you know has it been trending up and if yes how big is your profit margin now and how would it change in the future if you decide to increase your product price yeah i guess michael is asking here about your average selling price right now on the commodity super cycle as well as the improvement in margin okay thank you for the questions yes everything is on the high all-time high for the last few years here uh definitely the average selling price will be increasing along the way because with the high prices i think customers are able to buy more able to buy at higher prices now the high prices is also driven by the higher cost a lot of people focus on the revenue side people don't talk about the cost side the cost side is also important now a lot of material especially especially the raw material the chemical intermediate from china has also rise to the all-time high so correspondingly we are able to increase the average selling price in at the same time we are we are also facing the cost increase in terms of raw material from china but all in all we are expecting generally the margin should be on the upper trending because not everything get to password not all the costs get to pas sorry the cost of the password customers generally when customers are having the good run their ability to buy more product is there and to absorb higher prices is that so we hope we are able to capitalize from this trend just bare reminder is not only the revenue that the cost has also increased something for us to manage going forward but generally we are excited about the high trending of the world commodity prices thank you uh sorry just one more question before i pass on to minktek um can i just also roughly understand mr lee right in terms of your products which is the biggest source of revenue by crop is it sugarcane is it coffee or is it cpo like what what's the what's the percentage like okay for all the active ingredient that we sell the biggest crop that we are selling uh we are serving the plantation sector is the sugarcane so for all the sugar cane farm in the world we are supplying the product today because for example our main product msma there are only two producers in the world one is israel and the other one in malaysia here so i think we share the market quite equally for these two products and for the new entrant to come to this product is quite impossible due to the lengthy uh registration requirements uh so uh uh that that is used to serve uh the sugarcane industry and second product dialogue is also used to serve the sugarcane industry so with this true product i think it costs maybe 45 of our total revenue so sugarcane is about 45 of our total revenue and interest interestingly going forward when we decide on the new active ingredient to be produced uh it is also there to serve the sugarcane market uh it's due it's because we of the infrastructure that we already developed over the years all the distributors who come forward to us to ask us to produce the active ingredient comes from the sugarcane industry so going forward there will be more dependence on the sugarcane industry but also at the same time with some of the new active ingredient we are about to go into soya soybean also the soybean is the biggest crop in the world now uh the other one the other two that we are serving is basically the cotton and also the palm oil the second largest is palm oil we have one or two or two product that's serving the oil market and we are the only producer in the world so i think that maybe takes about twenty percent of the revenue and coffer may be approximately about ten percent of the revenue so our active ingredient serves 70 percent these three main crop is will constitute 70 percent of our revenue source so basically that is a big background on the three props that we are involved in yeah okay thank you um a side question a little bit about this on commodity um wondering what's your view on the soybean price growing up sugar price going up all the commodity price going up what is the reason for this from your view and do you think this is sustainable because i see almost all the commodity prices going up uh well there are a lot of school of thoughts uh all these questions i think uh maybe economists will be up we'll be able to answer better but i'll tell you these are shared on the sugarcane part the reason for the sugar cane price increase is is attributable to the pandemic now india is also a very important sugarcane producer now due to the pandemic india we all know india is experiencing very bad pandemic situation the sugar cane production in india is badly affected as a result of that there is lesser supply of sugar resulting from that i think for the last one year you see the sugar price keep going now because there are lesser sugar to become to be produced from all the plantation now india is a big plantation supplier for sugar so for that reason i think sugar price came out now the increase of a lot of commodities are also attributable to the rising uh oil uh petrochemical prices now petrochemical prices are the derivative and also the raw material for a lot of industrial chemical product so when the oil prices crude oil prices are on the rise generally you will see a lot of raw material on the rise as well in tandem with the rise of the crude oil and also for transportation cost you know for the last few months the transportation costs have gone crazy you know all industries experiencing the highest rate cost worldwide is attributable also to the pandemic many containers go overseas they cut they cannot come back or stuck in europe because of the pandemic lesser people working so uh but of course uh uh the key here is to your question is with a high uh commodity prices is it sustainable it is attributable technically to the shortage in supply and also attributable to the high oil prices generally speaking now sustainability i think there are a lot of cool of course anything that goes too high is not sustainable right because and then the negative economic skills percentage uh we are talking about the balance uh rise so anything that's too high certain uh players will be affected not everything can be passed by the customer so at the moment it is still rising at the acceptable level if it goes another twenty thirty percent uh in terms of sugar prices that will actually uh cause this electrician to the market so generally i think at the level at the current level is sustainable but going forward we're still going to see how it goes otherwise a lot of industry will get affected too low it's not good too high is also not good so that's how it is yeah thank you mr lee i like this answer i've heard another another business also say there are all material price going up also because of the logistics so i think this frame is a real real really really big factor just give you a bit a bit a few of the logistics for example we send the cargo to brazil for example to santos in santos so last time to send one container 20-footer container is about 2002 to 2007 usd per container i think since december january has shot up to 9000 usd per container so 400 increase uh in the in the container so uh in the free course to brazil so all these are actually uh challenges not only by us by a lot of players in in this region uh it is because uh there are lesser ships you know going around because of the supply interruption and also a lot of containers not enough containers or all stuck in overseas they cannot come back because of lesser people working at the port so actually if you realize a lot of stock uh logistic related stock has gone out because of these reasons or past few months because uh it's crazy and is at all time high yeah okay so and and this cost is factored into the price of let's say if i buy sugarcane then they come they already factor that in uh well generally when the price of logistics goes up a long-term win-win solution would be to share together with the customers and at the end of the day we see we always try to find a way to prosper the customers but if customers cannot pass it to the farmers then it's a bit difficult the other reason to consider is also whether the competitors are having the same logistical cost right luckily this logistic cost is affecting everybody in the world everyone i think everyone is facing the same problem so hence it is a universal problem not only a problem applicable to us so that's a good thing okay so like you say just now the revenue increased by the cost also increased but the profit margin remains the same right well generally speaking usually when the prices increase uh we sell evp going upward we try to maybe conserve a bit more profit with the product if it's possible but generally when customers are able to buy more then not only the prices is in place i think the volume is also important better so we always hope that the customers can buy further and with the higher prices always the case when you see the soil being the corn the sugarcane with the height the prices is higher generally customers are able to buy better fertilizer more fertilizer and also more pesticide so there are two parts one is the selling price the other one is the volume so when the volume is when the prices are low uh the farmers has got lesser money to spend on the product so that's a general uh trade trend that we observe in the market so has that already been factored in the q2 earning or that hasn't been factored in the result yet it is there already because it's on the rise along the way i would say partially it's there already uh q2 we're talking about two months ago and revenue is the price that we entered into end last year so along the way that could be generally both income crockett and also nine lakhs with a higher prices we should be experiencing higher revenue okay do you have any follow-up question randy yeah um yeah a lot actually a lot of questions with regards to okay which is good actually because uh you know it's it's it's the star of uh mcom right so i think this is a very regular question um i even have this question uh being mailed to me as well um i guess you know like um a lot of people are uh wondering like from a competitive point of view what's your competitive advantage from your competitor say the other listed company in malaysia right like for instance hackstar or something like that um yeah okay competitive advantage as we mentioned in the slides a few times the key competitive advantage or not only has i mean generally on compared to a lot of other players in the region is that we are the only city a molecule synthesizer in the region for herpes sites so that's a huge advantage because in our manufacturing field of herbicide the margin is much higher for manufacturers compared to any formulators formulators by communities i mean uh the players are usually the the industrial player that will they will buy the active ingredient from china or alpha in the world with the mixing we are also accumulated so we formulate import plan our revenue formulation is much smaller compared to our equity so our competitive advantage is that we are synthesizer the only synthesizer here and also the product that we're involved in for example msma the only two producers in the world so this is very important competitive advantage because not easy for other people to come in due to registration requirement for dairon we are they are only six to seven player in the world and from more next for example we are the only player in the world and for some of the typical preservative product we are like that about three to four players and for example uh a timber personality product we command forty five percent of the whole market share so not easy for other people to come in because of the complication of stepping out of france and the registration process so these are our key competitive advantage compared to a lot a lot of other players now you mentioned hexa hexa is a well-respected player in malaysia and hexa is very strong in the downstream distribution in the region so i think everybody has advantage for us we remain very strong in the core competency of contributing to active ingredients so that remains our key competitiveness yeah okay um thanks mr lee um i think we would like to touch a little bit about your factory expansion let me just answer a question one second uh yes so i think that's a good question so um you know can you just update us um sorry so i think a lot of people are wondering also that um from the presentation slides from andrew just now you know um both of your factories are actually not at 100 utilization and therefore like why would you like to expand right um is this kind of like um on the backdrop of a strong demand of your products right so that's that's perhaps question number number one and basically over here it's it's saying like can your sales team cope with the expansion um when it's when it's up and running i certainly hope so okay now 50 and 70 relates to our current production of the existing active ingredient and also our existing formulation plant all these are relating to our exiting product only four ais our new extension in uh pork clam factory is to cater for the new active mobility so basically these are two mutually exclusive right so 70 percent why are we not serving at the 100 percent now in our industry is very important in any given year assuming uh if there is a huge surge in demand for the pesticide so it is important that we keep some reserve uh capacity to cater for the sudden search in the requirement in certain even years for example in 2013 when sugar price was very high there was a huge demand that we were producing about 80 and subsequently even at 100 levels we cannot we couldn't we were not able to supply the msma to the brazilian market so then we lost the opportunity so it's always important in our industry relating to agricultural support for the administration of hexistai it's important that we keep certain reserve margin it's like electricity for tanaga it will always keep a 20 to 30 reserve margin uh just in case there is a shutdown or there is a blackout from certain power plant in malaysia so we cannot go for 100 uh capacity i know in malaysia now a lot of uh top a lot of killer factories are going for 120 percent uh but for our industry is very because certain products like msma the only two producers in the world if there is a bumper year good year coming along and we cannot produce that year it will be forever gone because the two years may never repeat the following year so hence the reason for the 70 for our active ingredient we're quite comfortable with the reserve margin the 50 is applicable to our formulation plan so formulation usually sometimes it goes 70 sometimes 50 for the same reason we are looking at keeping at 70 70 level yeah so that's the reason for this and the new factory to cater for the new active ingredient certainly i certainly hope that i'll still think and cook because uh technically these new active ingredients are the regret are at the request of the customers from brazil or from worldwide for one reason they do not want to depend fully on china now china used to be the is still the biggest manufacturing producer for a lot of active ukrainian but overly depend on china in the last few years xps has taught us that uh only dependent may have an issue when they have policy changes or if they've got big accident uh big explosion in the plan and all that the entire province will shut down so due to that i think that's our competitive advantage really uh is the customers who ask us to grow the to to manufacture the new molecule instead of first building it and go and ask customers to buy so that is a very important part of our growing uh our core expansion so you would say that you have quite a good order visibility on your new active ingredients generally yes of course we have to produce to the quality they wanted it is not a simple process to synthesize the molecule it is a complicated chemical reaction process so always for new molecules new active ingredient it will take a while for the team to get adjusted to it so the challenge is more on the production part there is not so much of the marketing part because market they're always looking for diversification from china since three years ago so actually when we announced this new plan to do these three or four molecules a lot of our customers they are quite happy with these options that they are able to source it outside china okay i guess yeah i'm also seeing a lot of questions for people wanting to understand more about your raw materials like you know what are your raw materials in income crop care that you're getting the supply from china and how um it's now you mentioned something to do with how you are trying to be less reliant on china due to some sort of like inconsistencies from your china supplier right um so and and and i think you mentioned also how you guys are trying to develop your own formula um for the raw material so i guess the the question is do you guys have the technical capacity and capability to do it well certain chemical intermediate unfortunately for malaysia we do not have this capability because in order to produce a lot of chem intermediate chemicals that is used now all these chemicals are basically a derivative of petrochemical product or the mineral uh minerals from from from mostly from china because china has got a huge mineral mining activities so all these forms the basis of the chemical uh raw material and it's important uh when all these chemical plants do this product they have got the economies of skills and that's the reason why china has got a huge one now for us when we do this product we are looking at getting the support of internal media from china not everything we can do it here but apart from china now we are also sourcing from india from morocco from certain places to namibia from all the mining activities so we are diversifying certain minerals and certain chemicals from uh so in malaysia to do the chemical intermediate is very difficult because we do not have a lot of chemical plants uh surrounding a malaysian region so that is unfortunate is unfortunately the case but going forward i mean generally everybody is practicing the classification of china so uh uh generally i think from the last three years there has been a lot of diversification uh activities uh that took place with a lot of uh formulators and a lot of industrial players in this region everybody is doing the same thing to reduce the dependence yeah and also over the years i think china in terms of the land cost because a lot of all these plants are at the eastern coast of china so the labor cost compared to 20 years ago china has got the lowest labor costs in the region but at today's rate china is actually having higher utility higher labor and higher land cost compared to southeast asia hence you will see a lot of relocation of a lot of chinese factories by the mnc to the southeast asian region vietnam indonesia thailand myanmar that i mean due to the recent output retards so deeply difficult but in the region there are a lot of fdi follow flowing into this region due to the less competitive state of china uh given given the growth in the past 20 years um i think there's a question here mr lee um they want to find out about your r d team and perhaps your r d expenses okay in the u.s a lot of mncs uh allocate about three to four percent for r d in our case uh it is uh much lesser uh now uh in our industry to produce one new molecule uh it involves a lot of scientists there's a huge cost attached to the new molecule a new active ingredient so our research team generally we do a lot of cocktail a lot of mixing and do the new product through the mixing but to produce the new molecule a totally new molecule patented molecule we are not incapable of doing that but once all this molecule becomes uh of patent i think then there are opportunities for other players to come in including us and through our economies of skill and also our specific demand from client then we do this a bit of r d for the new product with the help and collaboration technical collaboration from mostly china engineer so for rnb we are not like those a big company like monsantos that mean a bsf sumit no more all those companies for hundreds of scientists doing the new molecule which malaysian company of automata southeast asian companies are not capable of doing but what we do is when certain products become patent and because of certain commodity advantages we have we choose to do uh uh at this region that's what we do usually so our staff r and e may be left skills i think we've got about 20 people so but this is important competitive advantage because in order to synthesize new molecules of new player in this region to come in they need to set up the lab the equipment the experience from the manufacturing the experience from the production and also all the necessary uh technical requirement or that that requires a lot long years of experience so it's not easy to become a synthesizer or molecule generally speaking yeah okay any um what's the progress of the new factory because i forgot has it been delayed last year i forgot when target completion okay uh as per the presentation just now we're supposed to completely by meet this year based on last year's plan but during the pandemic construction sector i think everything closed down when we applied to the for two reasons the delay was attributable to two reasons one is i think a lot of government office also closed down or minimized a cut shot the working hours so for us to submit the plan and all that i think there's been corresponding delay in terms of improving the plan and secondly the plan also requires the input and participation from engineers from china oh and from china still i think remotely through the fb is pretty difficult because they need to observe the start and now that so we are having a good delay attributable meaning to these two reasons so now the new targeted complete of the construction of the factories will be either september or december in between this period and after we finish we need to install the equipment for the new product so that is likely to take place maybe beginning of next year so all these are due to the mostly due to the pandemic because construction activities are reduced significantly and also the approval process is taking longer than expected so otherwise end of this year and we hope to be able to produce by beginning first quarter next year the target for the max capacity will be above i don't know how many times i know in terms of number revenue is 100 million right four thousand four thousand metric ton yeah yeah now interesting part about this new molecule is this uh as we go along uh whatever we use the msma those are those are the old activity or in industry we keep this calling more reviews going forward the new active ingredients in the prices per unique per kilo is on the rise for example at the moment we sell a msma at about a 3000 past ton uh 3 000 plus usd per time is about now it's about four thousand plus percent money is about four thousand percent uh but the new lesson p the page right just now there's a page uh three uh category being the first product we have launched and we've been deported this year the per unit uh one is about 12 000 usd so uh the t is about 18 000 usc so generally all this new product will have four to five times the price of the old equity ingredient because uh the ai is getting better and better uh using is getting higher and higher concentrate due to technology so so when it's fully utilized you expect the new factory to bring in about 100 million revenue right design projection well without going too detailed generally speaking four molecules gave us close to uh together with the formulation gave us historically uh last year's auditory supposed to 300 million revenue eight molecules the general rule is in the beginning period is lesser volume but the per unit price is higher so we hope to be able to double the 24 to 36 months in terms of revenue generally speaking we hope to be able to depending on the market condition and also depending on our ability to do the technology fast to do the production uh acceptable to the client fast but generally we eight molecules a active ingredient maybe it will be on a gradual rise uh it's impossible to achieve a first round uh beginning at a higher margin but generally over times the margin will increase and although the volume will increase that's the general trend so we hope we're able to achieve good economies of yeah maybe there's one last question you know with regards to income crop care right um i think there are some questions here um what would you what would your strategy be for 2021 for an com crop care and what are the challenges in 2021 because i think um as you mentioned just now um i come crop care is very very kind of like um it's very sensitive to natural disaster right which seem like uh it's getting more and more regular these days due to like global warming and things like that okay okay that's a fair question okay answer your first question first what are the challenges and what are the plans for 2021 or 2022 our financial year and year ends may 31st to uh every year uh from june to may so now by much i think we are finishing two uh financial year 2021 in two months time generally speaking and our new financial aid will start in june this year generally we are seeing recovery we hope the recovery will continue and this year there aren't any there are not there aren't any natural disasters too much of it so i think we are experiencing uh generally a good year so we hope to be able to continue the good trend the challenges this year in particular is relating to our distribution and freight cost it's applicable to a lot of players in the industry uh so for january february march april we are experienced uh no april at the moment is still high the highest rank like example 400 percent uh by much i think it's due at 300 percent we hope these distribution cost this freight cost will resume back to the normal level going forward maybe close to the original level by may so that would be the challenges that we hope to be able to maintain and for generally for the group we hope the rise and prices uh will not deep just when that when there's a deep in crisis that you'll be the other way uh in terms of the benefit in terms of recognizing the the business opportunities so that's a general uh uh trend in general uh outlook in 2021 and also the challenges now coming to the question on the natural disaster due to global warming yes every time when there is a liner l9 latina l9 it is not good because it will cause floods it will cause extreme drought in certain places so in our industry as we mentioned flood is no good bush fire is no good drought is no good so generally with global warming all these are part of the uh natural phenomenon that we see in in the world uh water plantation uh these are these are the common challenges we face however generally speaking whatever it is if this year you have a bad year next year should have a good year because everything will have to be recovered because we are dealing with food industries the shortage of the current year should be sufficed by the surplus or additional demand in the following year or extreme high supply this year will lead to lower demand but what we do is over time if you plot the graph over the projected time of 10 years of 10 years generally when you average it out the basic demand will always be there so the ups and downs usually should not exceed 20 percent generally speaking uh it's not like like a pandemic sensitive to the pandemic would be the hotel the f the airline industry all these will be affected at 80 90 in our industry in every chemical generally uh maximum fluctuation is perhaps 20 percent generally speaking so with the natural disaster one year should be recovered or compensated by the following years uh in terms of demand supply yeah so that's the general trend of the industry yeah any other questions for i'm concrete or we move on to nylax let's move on to 9x okay yeah um okay so i think uh maybe i start off the question on my legs with i guess it's it's it might seem like a relatively stupid and i mean it might seem like a relatively basic question um but you know uh generally speaking from the past few years and few quarters um oil price is positively correlated to nylax's financial performance right so um but you know how does actually oil price impacts uh nylex's business uh well generally uh why is it that the oil price has got a positive correlation uh somewhat i think eight seventy eighty percent of knowledge businesses now now let's go two part of businesses one is manufacturing which is less sensitive the oil price as mentioned manufacturing sometimes with the fluctuation oil price we should be able to pass back some what some level of cost to the customers generally speaking for manufacturing but for trading is pretty difficult now nyls is a trader in uh solvents in malaysia for example like like metano is one of the key products that alex trades so when the price is on the downward trending because we are the stockist where the traders so the general rule is buy low sell high but because we are traders we've got tank farm we keep the product so it means on the downward trending uh trend so uh the the the chances of buying low and sell high is lesser but if it is outward trending on the other hand the chances of buying sell high is highest that's why generally speaking when the price is on the downward trending uh nylex result did not perform too well in the historical performance when the oil price is on the output trending that's why for the traders dynalex and for the matter for a lot of traders in the industrial chemical industry they will be able to experience better margin due to the outward pricing so that's how the positive core relation between the oil price and mileage trading businesses is um not much question but um has the q2 result reflected this in the dialects like january yes if you take a look at the next result compared to the last two years nylex on the recovery trend based on the public announcement we have made so far for the q1 and q2 nylock is on the albert trend yeah yes so uh capture some part of this yes as you can see the the oil price rise is not uh overnight or not not due to the last one two months is on the constant rise so the lowest at one point if you remember i think about a year plus ago uh somebody need to pay to take the uh uh pay you to take the oil because there's no not enough storage and all that and a lot of ships are stuck with a lot of this uh pet this uh uh oil so uh uh from then he has been on the general recovery trend so now uh for example uh the oil price is about sixty seven seventy uh tunnel prices uh nylex is a main trading product the lowest of mechanical prices was at 180 usd to 200 usd per metric ton it was about a year ago about nine months ago now it is trading about 300 plus so generally yes there is a positive correlation between oil prices generally speaking it is not only oil prices it's also a function of demand and supply all right so these two things demand supply and also the oil prices but as i mentioned to you 70 to 80 positive correlation uh based on historical performances of nilex yeah so even if the oil price remain the same as long as it doesn't go down trend my right nylock should be profitable right generally that is the that is the uh observation yes yeah because i see it is a profitable segment just that in 2019 because oil price started to drop and in 2020 the superbowl's drop that's one correct for two reasons one is the prices on the downward trend trending and second is because of the pandemic when there's a pandemic there will be lesser industrial chemical requirements now a basic economy basically when the economy is doing well the industrial uh uh uh general industry will be doing well following the better economy when there was a pandemic the demand for a lot of quota has come down hence it is due to price and also the demand for the last two years so that took there's a reason for the lower performances of the trading distribution yeah okay so yeah i don't have any more question on lilacs randy if you have you can pass yeah i mean so on on the methanol how has the demand been in malaysia right now uh mr lee generally we are seeing a recovery of better demand and definitely the recovery of prices has already taken place from the low of 120 to 200 per metric ton usd to the current level of 350 to 380. so we already seen the price recovery the demand recovery also we are seeing the graduate increase in terms of demand generally i think a lot of industries still got to go on so we are experienced we are seeing the recovery also in terms of the mass generally speaking okay um so i guess i would like to move on to ethanol because you know um that's that's a very sexy business right now um you know i understand that on on your ethanol manufacturing it's it's done via a subsidiary called firm pro and how does this constitute to your overall industrial chemical segment actually in terms of top line and bottom line well in terms of top line is not significant because trading division contributes to 700 billion contribution from the account of production every month i think use about four hundred fifteen thousand liters or half a million liters so general revenue a year is about 30 plus to 40 so that is very small compared to the revenue of the trading division however uh i know uh during the pandemic tunnel price shut up a lot due to the requirement of sanitizer due to the requirement of all these the cleaning agent so uh tunnel prices go up so do not mix ectano with methanol that's a huge difference um ethanol can be consumed methanol cannot be consumed if you remember i think about two years ago there was a group of near miss i think a lot of miami's they mix they pre-mix i think they were 20 27 or 28 deaths recorded two years ago it's because of mixing the wrong product is for the consumption of food grade and also for the industrial use methanol is more for the industrial chemical use so these two so we're specifically referring to the ethanol yes i think for the last one here we experience good profitability because of the higher price and because of the shortages of the ethanol so in terms of profitability contributions revenue i think will be profitability contribution i think that the fund produced with the amount generally speaking i think we do about into eight to ten million profitability for last one year this and um can you can you give us you know some light on on the current ethanol price like how is it like i think i read somewhere and i understand that you know methanol actually sorry malaysian ethanol price could be different than those ethanol price in other markets right is that is that true correct yeah now malaysia we do have a lot of people producing ethanol one of the biggest ethanol producers in the region is thailand they produce ethanol from sugarcane they also produce ethanol from cassava right so uh for thailand because of the economy very competitive uh uh product in malaysia uh to import a tunnel there's always a tariff uh because there are only two producers in malaysia so the general price for antano is for non-food grade it's about five six uh uh ring per liter for food grade which is 99.99 for food grade for drinking purposes and all that it is not possible to have high impurities so it needs to be 99.9 percent that's about everybody so that's general price of ethanol for the local consumption for the for the price comparison but for thailand usually they are more competitive because they produce a huge amount of ethanol generally speaking and what about the price trend right now for ethanol because i mean as you know a lot of hand sanitizers prices also has kind of like half or even like more than 50 discount than last year this is a this is a business situation whenever there is a shortages everybody just buy a lot of quantity and when they apply and then they will throw the prices in order but generally our standards uh uh ethanol used in sanitation is one very small part most of the ethanol are used for industrial producers like through the fm regime between the so between the industrial processes and all that so really uh the sanitized sanitizer is the small part of the tunnel usage generally speaking yeah so but but because of the shortage because of the situation of no more shortages the prices is not like last time i think during the pandemic peak i think some are selling even 12 ringgit per liter and all that yeah so now there's no such prices i think generally you resume back to the original but for the additional capacity that we are about to build malaysia generally with another compar another player in malaysia we produce perhaps at the moment about 10 12 million liters i think malaysia also import another 10 12 million right for usage so with additional capacity there is always room for uh for the malaysian companies to rely lesser on the neighboring country or from the importance of that okay there is there is a question here right i think you might want to answer this how does the global ethanol policy affect the group's business knowing sugarcane hold a sizable proposition in their company's portfolio yes that's a good question global uh tunnel has got some correlation with sugar prices now for example brazil is the biggest sugar producer in the world in brazil half the sugar are used for food consumption basis and the other heart is used for car uh basically a biofuel a biofuel car a brazilian has already uh used their sugar cane produce ethanol to use for the bio diesel purposes right so it all depends generally spk it's always a striking the balance when the sugar price is high like at like at the moment sugar pipe is high the tunnel usage is lesser because you cannot compete with the international prices sugar when stupid price is low there will be more usage for ethanol because they have to strike the equilibrium there but generally speaking uh ours is more sensitive to sugar and hamilton is lesser generally speaking for sugar foreign for our pesticide product for our manufacturing under nylocks the entire milk we hope to have a high and tunnel prices so we've got different businesses that requires the different pricing strategies so that's how uh generally attacked our business model in a way i think we have a natural hatch but the entire prices are doing well info pro or knowledge will be doing well but the sugar prices are doing well then our pesticide will be doing well generally okay um and i think finally there is a follow-up question here with from again sean he asked how does rcp plays in the company's outlook uh rcep is the new uh new situation new collaboration here uh it is we are still observing uh the condition of all this just generally speaking for all the apac last time uh i think australia mexico and also india malaysia and china all that so all these asia pacific related countries uh if we are having positive or zero tariff on all this region that will make it very very good for our product compared to certain competitors not within the rcp all right so i think we are still observing because it is a new thing that is established we are still observing the condition of this but uh usually for all these rcep uh related countries uh uh if we have business with them that would be good because for not ask the ep they will have maybe not so good carry for not to prove impossibility but for this this is still very new uh something that we are still observing to see the benefit of it yeah okay um mr lee you know it's already 10 o'clock so uh maybe yeah maybe we'll just um we'll just if you don't mind we can extend for another 10 15 minutes maybe we just touch a little bit on your financials and maybe uh and come logistics yeah yeah you wanna ask anything on on those two things yeah i'll ask the elephant in the room a house um didn't it's fine well generally speaking i think as announcer uh we have signed a hoa of course uh uh undertaken to complete the transactions and we have done a lot of the due diligence a long process and also the continuation of medical statement and discussion with the target companies we cannot develop too detailed but generally we are working to complete the transaction as announced before so it is in progress okay yeah i think there is there is a recent um article i'm not sure whether it was last weekend or something like that the s5 um person um he was talking about how it is nearing its end if i'm not mistaken right yeah well yeah it is an income session s5 or article talk but iris if i if i read it also i mean we are not here to comment about other companies generally speaking but definitely we are working hard to complete the transaction uh and we are working towards a submission but of course uh like any other business uh due diligence process sometimes takes longer than expected and negotiation also sometimes take that longer than expected but generally we are working towards the completion uh that's what we are working on okay um so i think i think the the sorry i'm going to keep pushing on this question but you know um as an income investor uh perhaps maybe you can run us through on how um as an income investor we might be able to benefit from the s5 rto um you know maybe can you share some light on perhaps how many shares at the group level does ancomp has in com logistic braha and okay is that time for you to stay invested or to cash out or like what's the big plan okay the second part of the question i can answer first but first part a bit difficult because uh how does the impact the detailed calculation would entail a lot of uh negotiation information so that i cannot divulge if i talk a bit more about it i think people can work out the details so that's very dangerous and we are guided by busan rules not to talk to details about all these numbers but the second part of the question is how to end con how does income shareholders benefit from this now uh generally we are on the consolidation process basically we are consolidating our chemical business we are disposing the non-poor business to refocus back on the first distance as a result of that we have one mr company available for any objection so it so happened that i think uh x5 is the companies after uh negotiation after deliberation we think it's quite suitable for injection because of the historical track record and all that and they are they've got a lot of capability after deletions we find that they have a lot of capability to do a lot of it related work so after injection and com is able to participate in this it business not in the subsidiary because rto means we'll lose the controlling state but we are able to benefit from the growth from s5 going forward if the deal is to be completed as a minority shareholder just like the media will be disposed of the majority state so not in the controlling manner but if that's why doing well or income shelter also will benefit from the performance of the new business in the smaller state uh as the house mostly i think that depends on the final negotiation or final announcement so that's difficult for me to commit anything but generally we can benefit from the i.t if they're doing well we can benefit from the smaller portion of it but going forward generally speaking we are focusing on our poor competency that is chemical related businesses industrial clinical and also okay okay that's my final question okay um i guess you know um just last two questions um from from me mr lee um on your financials um i mean we we are seeing that you have been kind of like carrying down your debt which is which is very good but um you know can you can you sort of like guide us about your prospects in 2022 i would say right because this current calendar year is going to end in may so what are your future prospects that you can do what are your kind of like a kpi um any targets kind of thing in terms of your balance sheet numbers and your p l numbers okay uh right thank you for the questions uh now without uh divulging to detail the numbers general outlook for 2021-22 going forward we are very determined to continue to rebuild the proper cost and also reduce the debt enhance the proper cost we are very determined to continue to nurture the smaller business uh if really cannot i think we are determined to close down the loss-making business three we are very very focused on the chemical growth going forward as can be seen from the plan we expanded the plant uh we are actually quite excited about the new plant and new active ingredients so going forward 2022 we will be focusing on every chemical ai and expansion of the portfolio and for nalex also we are hoping and we are working towards the recovery of the industry and hence the fabric itself so basically that sums up the general outlook for us going forward in the next year and we are hopeful that the recovery will remain and also we are able to execute as soon as possible the completion of the plan plus the installation of equipment for the new active ingredient and also uh the debt reduction consistent debt reduction program that we embark on two years before and relating to this maybe a lot of shelters will be asking this question also what is the dividend policy and uh in the past few questions and also in a lot of announced i mean engagement with the shareholders and ir we are determined to pair down that as a result of that i think dividend policy in the shorter term may not be there but we have we are concentrating in consolidation and also in making sure that the growth of better balance sheets lesser growing and better cash flow going forward for the expansion so that's how we are going forward in the next 12 to 24 months okay um thanks for that mr lee i guess just one final question we before we wrap things up yeah um i think this is this is sort of like my my final question to a lot of companies that comes on on onto the live session um i think because you know in any investment one of the most kind of like important aspect and the greatest asset or liability of any company is not really in the balance sheet but it's actually in the boardroom it's leadership and you know um from the from the first time that i think minktek and myself we met you um last year you know we have definitely seen the transformation um of ancorm you know i think during that time a lot of things were really down you know nylex was down heavily and com was really in bad shape it was a down cycle and you know i think from what we can see from the financials especially in the past two quarters um you have actually managed to turn it around you you sort of paired up the debts you you kind of like consolidate all the good assets together and kind of like sell off the the um all the other kind of like more negative ones i suppose so perhaps you know maybe you can tell us a little bit more about yourself like what is your leadership style how is the encompa team in general are you more motivated now than ever and you know what what would what would keep you awake at night well personal management style are generally speaking i think as you mentioned riley mentioned before i think the group has got a well diversified background about directors that give a lot of support and confidence and it's very important for the board directors to have a confidence in management and at the moment i mean for now we work very well together with the poor directors to chat a new direction for the company and in terms of style personal style now i i like to always focus uh talk about a few attributes that is very important in building a business uh number one we always must be focused on what we do focus on the core businesses focus on the core competency with whatever things we do for the smaller businesses that have uh potential we also will nurture and then we will assign the rightful customer and rifle talent to e8 but generally our core competency is in chemical related whether it's agrichemical industrial chemical that's where we will continue to grow our competency two is to to have passion personal style really i like to work with people with a lot of passion uh work with the management team that's got a lot of initiative and passion and that's important and that is the underlying uh factors pinning the uh the growth uh story of the encompass as you can see from the financial numbers for the last few years is supported by a very very strong profitable talented management team under the division so i'd like to look for teams that's got a lot of passion so the style open we are very focused and we like to have work with people with passion and uh going forward uh the the the interest and also the trust uh placed by the board and shareholder is always our guiding principles in making sure that we always want to deliver better returns for the shareholder so that is the few things that i always think of when you know i remind myself to be uh because we are actually managing a public uh uh asset so we have to be very very focused and displaying uh and hence also the debt reduction program we are very very focused on that yeah so a bit about uh the management style yeah okay [Laughter] all right um i think with that perhaps you know we can we can wrap things up wanna maybe even take mr lee if you guys have any last words you can just deliver them um i don't have much password i can see that you know for those who are listening i can see that the company promised to do many things last year and most of it they have already delivered and um you know i was thinking to invest then after that you know got lost in other countries and you bet what i want something so and you know um maybe i want to ask mr lee one last question then after that you know after mr lee you answer this question you can you know give a summary of what people want to remember so this last question will be on what are the things that are making you worry about this business uh making me worried about this business now uh well there are a lot of things i mean like any other businesses there are a lot of challenges uh we are facing foreign for example at the moment the free course is a huge uh trouble for us because that will reduce the competitiveness and that will reduce that will give us a lot of issues with the margin and all that so we're gonna find a lot of way to start general business going forward my worry is uh every morning i wake up i i hope not to see natural disaster all right that is because every time when i push earlier i will no natural disaster recovery is there no low cycle of the petrol chemical to the level that is so difficult and also so these are the general worries i have but otherwise i think in terms of competitive advantage is more important we are in the business unique business and i would like to see ancon's industrial chemical and also every chemical we are the very integrated very much integrated chemical players in this southeast asian region in both every chemical and also industrial chemicals with the revenue of a billion paths at a height of 2 billion i think it's something that we take pride and it's something that we wanted to use that to grow further in the region so these are the looking forward and also the worry some of the worries i have here and also i think it's just apparently we hope the dynamic can recover through because uh enemy is affecting business all around i mean in terms of because we already seen some recovery so hopefully vaccination can take place and can overcome all this problem and also we hope that this pandemic will be over then the heydays will come back again so uh pandemic for example uh pandemic in a certain region like for china they are better managed but in terms of having them to come here it's not possible because that will delay a lot of work so generous people might worry also i hope the pandemic will travel soon so that all businesses can recover entirely yeah thank you mr lee thank you very much so no more final final questions [Laughter] okay thank you everyone for staying all the way to the end um i think i personally enjoyed this session very informative as usual definitely um we will be ending this session have a good evening everyone bye-bye all right thank you everybody for tuning in good night andrew [Music]", "q-TgOxsaCng": "[Music] hi dolls as you can see in the title today i'm going to be showing you guys how to do distress locks on yourself this video was highly requested um if you have or haven't seen i also made a tick tock on kind of the transformation of this hairstyle so after that video i got a lot of dms and comments like girl sis you need to show a tutorial i usually don't do tutorials and things like that but i plan on starting my hair is actually done but i'm going to take a couple down to redo to show you guys how to do it or you can walk through it with me whatever you want to do um before we begin make sure that you follow my new business page follow me on instagram and also i do have a p.o box now so if you would like to send me any things that you want me to like post on my instagram or just wear whatever you can do that you can send it to my p.o box the po box address will be on the screen or in the description y'all send me some things because i plan on doing a video like a small business supporting video if you have anything it can even be like a little note or anything it can literally be anything i will definitely shout you out so make sure you put your name and everything else so i know who to shout out and tag and all of that so with that being said let's get straight into this video these are what i call distress locks everybody calls them different some people call them butterfly locks mermaid locks i don't know just whatever you want them to look like that's what they are you name them because all these names be confusing me i just i don't know distress butterfly they're not that long they're kind of to my hip you can see a little to my hip yeah when i parted them i didn't really care what they look like in the back so the parts are kinda they're not small but they're not big they're just the perfect size because these are kind of big so you don't want too many small parts because if you had a lot of these with small parts it'll look like an umbrella on your head and we don't want that we don't want umbrella hit so make the parts a little bit you know spread out i have no idea what the ones in the back look like i also didn't even do these three in the back i didn't have enough hair so i'm like whatever and i thought i was going to redo them but i just left them there first i'm going to take these down and as i'm taking these down i'm going to show you guys what supplies you would need for the style the very first thing you would need is a comb a comb to come out your hair any comb it doesn't matter then you would need another comb like a rat tail comb so your parts can be more defined because you see this is skinnier and then this is kind of thicker so it might be a little hard to part then you would need any kind of jam any kind of jam is okay like this is shining jam extra hold it really doesn't matter what kind of gel or jam you want to use then you would need an edge comb just in case you want to do your edges at the end my edges are already done so i won't need this but you know you need your edge comb you would need some clips just to you know move your hair out the way it helps also ponytail holder scrunchies just to get your hair out of the way again you don't need it but you can use it scissors is also what you need for the ends we're going to be cutting so you need some scissors then you will need a crochet needle this is the important part you need a crochet needle so if you don't have anything else make sure you have this crochet needle the two types of hair that i use for this style would be freetress waterway let me focus it for you guys freetress water wave and color one 22 inch water wave so when you're looking at the hair there is going to be one that says water wave bulk i prefer just the regular water wave because the waterway bulk is one shorter and then two it's kind of like looser and we don't want looser it's just a slight difference in the waterway but i mean you can still use it but i prefer this one and for the second type of hair we have cuban twist 24 inch um it depends on the length that you want your locs i will get in more detail with that when i'm installing deluxe cuban twists 24 inch i believe that you can use any kind of cuban marley any type of hair like that it just really needs to be any type of coarse texture hair but i feel like the jamaican twist other things like that would be fine just make sure that it's coarse those two types of hair can be found at literally your local beauty supply or you can buy it online or you can buy it on amazon but they're at your local beauty supply store most of them have them before you go make sure you call and see if they have it most of the beauty supplies have this type of hair you can go get your hair tomorrow do your hair and then send me a picture now that those are out we can begin i did these two weeks ago and my hair is already growing this is why i love styles like this because they are very protective style you don't have to mess with your hair you don't have to do your hair you don't have to touch your edges really you can just let your hair grow so to locks my hair is already sectioned out so i'm just going to put this to the side for the parting i really didn't do anything like special i didn't try to do boxes or anything i just literally um parted my hair here to here i did the back didn't see what i was doing and then i came to the front and actually tried to part my hair but i just did um one two three four rows and then i kind of just zigzagged or whatever parted it any kind of way i didn't want the parts to be square and perfect i kind of wanted them to be like everywhere i feel like lock styles are supposed to be messy or eventually get messy so i really don't care when it comes to doing mine i want them as messy as possible i forgot to mention for the cuban twist i actually used um three packs well i really used two but i only needed three more for this back part i have like 30 to 35 locks in my head so it's not that many but i did need two packs two and a half so i suggest to just get three packs of the cuban twist for the waterway um i used about six packs i believe but just get eight you know in case because i was cutting some and finishing wrapping because they were longer so i did have to use like more pieces versus if they were like mid back or shoulder length i say about six seven packs of the water wave so let's get started we're going to use our gel put some gel on the part that you just parted and i didn't put any rubber bands on the part i really don't like rubber bands unless i'm getting like super super jumbo braids or something rubber bands are kind of hard on the hair especially if your hair is a little thinner and your edges are kind of thin i suggest to just not use rubber bands so just part a piece of your hair get it real slick and ready for the install i'm going to start off with one piece of cuban twist so you see how long it is when you just stretch it out versus when you do it like this so i did all of mine like this the reason i did that is because when the cuban twist is like this when you wrap the other hair this will be thinner so if you were looking for a thinner lock versus what i have in my hair this will be okay to do you just have to play around with that this is okay so try one of these and wrap the other hair around and you'll see the difference but for mine i did all of them like this because i wanted them to be thicker and then i wanted to use less of the wrapping hair first we're just going to braid this in i feel like braiding it in saves times and going and braiding um all of your hair first and then putting this on so there we just have a braid boom nothing special braid marley hair and that's it so we're going to get one piece of this water wave hair and what i mean by one piece is if you open the hair it comes with a little rubber band over it so you take all of that off you can kind of tell where they separate so you see this part versus this part of this that's what i mean by one so you just grab one of these and then after you grab one of these stretch it out just stretch it all the way out until it's no longer together just kind of stretch it out a little bit you don't have to do it like completely completely but as you can see it's not so tight then we get our crochet needle and with our crochet needle we're going to crochet into our hair put this piece on the crochet close the crochet needle pull it through [Music] that's it after you pull it through i leave a little piece up here just a little bit i don't go all the way up all the way down but i just leave you know just enough up there then you're going to leave the longer piece of the water wave to the side you're going to actually hold the marley hair in that little piece that we left you're going to hold that together because that's what we're going to be wrapping over in just a second we're going to be wrapping over the marley hair and little piece so hold this side any kind of way that you want just make sure that these are together and wrap over so when i'm wrapping first i wrap tight on the root just wrap wrap kind of get it on there so you know it's on that little top part so now we're gonna get to the key to making it look natural butterfly-ish if you're watching my thumb you're gonna put your thumb through a piece of the curl before you wrap so let's see see how my thumb's leaving that part out and it left that little piece that's the key putting your thumb also another thing is don't wrap so tight now just kind of wrap over the marley hair do your thumb wrap over the marly hair and just do it gently because that's the key if we do it tight you see how tight it's getting it's too tight and it's not giving us that distressed look so that's the reason why we do it lightly just throw it over there do your thumb like that just do it just throw it literally just throw it over put your thumb in every now and then you don't have to do it all the time keep going yes yes girl yes and then yeah when you do it every now and then all of them won't look like this some will look different they'll just all have their own little personality because you just do it through it you did whatever i used two pieces on one lock but some people get two of those water waves and did what we just did and we're not doing that we saving some hair so now we're going to get our other piece and put our other piece out and this is how we get the other piece connected to the marley hair now we take a small piece again just put it right behind the moly hair in front of it doesn't matter and hold it with the marley hair so now again you have this long piece and you have the marley hair in the short piece and then just do the same thing that easy do your thumb sometimes don't forget wrap lightly and go just do it girl just rap rap rap wrap wrap wrap do thumbs sometimes then when you get a little faster you can throw that thing over there y'all let me stop so keep going keep going keep going and we're getting to the end now for the end we're going to stop here stop where there's a little hair left i want to say one thing if you want to continue then you're just going to um get some water wave cut a little piece and continue but if you're okay with this stopping here then let's stop here or wherever you're at we're going to stop leave this little piece and then wrap upward wrap upward because we're securing it more and wrap all the way until you can wrap no more just wrap all the way up you don't have to use glue or any of that you could just do this whatever but it's going to stay it's not going anywhere so this is when our scissors come cut the marley hair off just cut the roller hair off and then you have your lock and if you don't want the end to be so blunt you can just pull down a little bit not too much just a little bit so you can have like more of a little curly looking end and there you have it very easy to do anybody can do this literally so you're welcome let's do it we're done with that one it's cute we got that thing secured next get your section parted now we're going to gel it up get it defined get it crisp again one piece of marley cuban twist whatever you have you want it to be a skinnier lock do it this way you want it to be just a perfect thick kind of medium looking keep it like this now we're going to do the same thing over again but before we do this i do want to say that if you don't know how to braid the marley hair onto your hair what you can do is actually braid your hair just a regular little plait braid braid your hair down and then when you braid your hair down so just crochet the marley twist and the normally twist will be in there crochet the waterway and literally do the same thing that's just for the people who don't know how to actually braid this onto their hair you can just do it literally the crochet way and just plait your hair or twist it any of that it just needs to be in a form to where the crochet can go through it but i'm going to stick to how i do it which is braiding it on my part and then crochet our waterway get one piece of waterway unravel it a little bit put it on the crochet latch close it pull it through boom leave some hair out grip the cuban hair a little hairy left out and wrap it over how you can do it tight at the beginning to get on that route a little bit like two three times wrap it over before you begin doing it lightly making your distressed using our thumb to give it the butterfly effect or not using our thumb wrapping lightly and so on y'all this is the best style ever like who invented this somebody tell me who would get to distress locks and stuff because i need that number because they need to come out with something else because i'm ready now i see that i kind of skipped over a little bit i'm going to show you guys how to bandage that so as you can see it's like a lot of cuban twists right here because i wasn't paying attention so either you can keep it there because when it's all done the hair is just all going to look distressed or you can get a little piece of water wave so you might need an extra pack because you might want to twist this twist that fix that you might want to do that sorry i'm looking outside and it got dark it was light when i started filming and that was dark but you're just going to cut a little piece and then just go over that part literally just put a little band-aid over it wrap it all the way to the end and boom just like new we're going to get our second piece of water wave unravel this and get ready to finish our lock again leave a little piece close to where you end it grip that in the marley hair leave your long piece out and wrap wrap wrap wrap but yes y'all make sure that you follow my new business page i actually just did some really cute locks and i put chopsticks in them it was too cute y'all like it was so cute i love doing hair i was 16 when i started doing hair that's all i've been doing i'm 20 now now we're here continuing to wrap and as you do more you get faster at it don't forget leave some pieces wrap back upward all the way to the end and leave it there now you see that it's shorter a tad shorter you can leave it like that or again you know just cut you another piece add it on there to how you want it to be and continue continue and continue and wrap back up back up back back back up why did i just make that a song boom we get our scissors cut close to the end where the marly hair and roll it around a little bit and boom boom boom boom boom like i said they're not supposed to be perfect they're just supposed to be distressed fun cute and yeah just let them things do whatever they want [Music] you [Music] hmm [Music] you [Music] wow [Music] bye we are officially done with these four look how pretty they are y'all like you cannot beat that stay so cute hey bro because wow cuz my hair done oh you in my business man don't do that anywho y'all just playing but for real anywho y'all this was it it is so easy like it is so easy i hardly do anything to them i hardly even wrap them talking about wrapping them you can get a big bonnet big bonnets are also at the beauty supplies like a big bunny y'all like a large bonnet and i just put them to the side like this i do this and just put them in the bonnet just put them all in this little trash bag or you can use a trash bag low key didn't think about that and i just put them on there like boom but it'd be slipping off a little bit so then i have this little scarf or whatever but it's not silky it's like cotton cotton and i don't know i don't know my fabrics like that but cotton polyester i guess and then i just put it like on the top and wrap it in the back and put it back on the top okay and go to sleep like that and then when i take a shower i just wrap that thing like this and then i put this over that you see i'm saying compromise and now we can take a shower can't tell me nothing so yeah y'all i really really really love this style like it's my favorite so far other than the bob ones i really like this like they really look natural i love them oh y'all it's so cute when you get your little scrunchies and you put the scrunchies on and

[Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Applause] [Music] [Music] you", "LC4zeozX5do": "our session today is continuing in our series on kingdom laws for kingdom living and that's what our focus is this year please write this down as the topic for our session today the value of law in kingdom living the value of law in kingdom living i want to focus on a subtitle understanding the role of law to life [Music] understanding the role of law to life how important is law to life how valuable is law to effective living i want to begin with reconnecting to the vision and the goal of god what is god's vision for you and for his creation and what is god's goal for placing us on this planet what was he after first number one god's goal was to colonize earth with heaven it must never be forgotten that is his original vision the same way the british colonized the bahamas and jamaica and trinidad and the way the spanish kingdom colonized cuba and hispaniola and dominican republic the same way the french colonize saint martinique and haiti it's the same way god wants to colonize earth with heaven he wants to number two he wants to colonize earth by establishing a community of kingdom citizens in a distant territory colonization is the process by which a kingdom extends its influence to a distant territory by extending its kingdom to that territory the bahamas used to be a colony of great britain that leads me to point number three and it's found in genesis chapter 28 how do you colonize first you must establish a community from your kingdom in that distant territory the bahamas speaks english today and drives on the left-hand side of the street and drink tea more than coffee because the british sent a group of english people to live here and over 259 years ago that group came here with a governor and they colonized by converting this entire region of the bahamas to their culture how did they do it they first sent a community to live here you cannot colonize without establishing a community in that distant land the french went to haiti the spanish went to cuba the british came to the bahamas the portuguese went to brent brazil wherever you want to establish a community of colonization you must send the people there god's plan therefore was to colonize earth therefore his goal was to put a community from heaven on earth that's why you came out of god you are in the image of god the word image means nature characteristics personality he gave us his own nature and then put us on the planet so that we can be naturally naturally a manifestation of his culture in heaven here's a scripture that's our foundation all last year and will be for the rest of our lives genesis chapter 28 verse 3 says these words may god almighty bless you and make you a fruitful people and increase your numbers until you become what [Music] a community of people imagine god saying that's my intention god's original idea was to develop a community of his own people on planet earth so that they could become the influencing culture on this planet now notice what god's goal is is to create a community of people so the question is what is a community and how is it developed write this down matthew chapter 6 verse 10 write the reference down christ says when you pray don't pray to go to heaven he said pray something else he says pray like this our father who is in heaven that's the home country holy is your name and then he says make this request thy kingdom come and thy will be done where on earth how just like it is in heaven in other words let the same culture in heaven come to earth and you do that by the community so the culture of heaven on earth is god's goal that's god's passion god doesn't want earth to come to heaven he wants heaven to come to earth get that in your mind because that works on monday tuesday and wednesday to me this is very practical i am experiencing this because i believe it if you only use this as head knowledge you will never experience kingdom culture in your daily life it has to become as it was for jesus it was a reality in other words he wanted to see god's kingdom come to earth through a community of people who reflect the nature of heaven now let me give you a definition of community write this down what is a community and it's important to our session today a community is a common group of people or a commune of people who are unified because they are dedicated to a common set of laws that is fundamentally what a community is a community is any group of people who decide that they are going to dedicate themselves to a common set of laws and those laws will produce values common values they will produce morals common morals they'll produce standards common standards that everyone in that community lives by and therefore it produces a social norm that word social is important from the word society a community therefore is a society created by a group of people who obey common laws that word society is also from the word social which has to do with relationships so a community is a group of people who follow obey submit to and adhere to the same set of laws and that produces a distinct culture so you can go to many countries and find that within those countries there are communities that are very distinct you can go to new york and find an italian community you can find a haitian community in new york there's a cuban community in new york uh there are african communities in new york why because even though they are in one country they have certain social norms that they follow in their little context therefore god's idea was to create a distinct community on planet earth that followed the laws of heaven let me put it this way write this down community is two words put together common unity simple simple a community is not a religion it is a national entity it's a nation matter of fact community is a product of law everyone write that down please everyone write that one down that's very critical what did i say community is a product of law community is a product of law i'm going to repeat myself community is a product of law i'm going to repeat myself community is a product of law do not attempt to adjust your cd player community is a product of law what did i say community is a product of law you just can decide that you can have a community first you must establish standards boundaries laws by which everybody agree to live by then you got a community even in your house as a married couple with children that home is supposed to be god's first community how do you create a community in the house the head of the home must establish laws by which everybody must obey so when your parents say you be in at 12 midnight no later they're trying to establish a community if you violate that law then you are becoming a cancer to that community when you think about any country then they are only as strong as the laws the people obey if you want to destroy a community it's not difficult just encourage people to disobey the laws and the community falls apart [Music] and this is why most great civilizations were not destroyed by armies they were destroyed by a violation of internal law for example immorality can destroy a country a conflict of values can destroy a country or compromise of standards can destroy a country without an army because law is more powerful than an army write this point down and very important point the priority of law and you got to stay with me for the next eight months to understand what i'm talking about when i used to turn law i'm not talking about religious law god was very specific his laws had to do with national development the ten commandments was given to build a nation not to build a religion and so it's a national ending god says i will create a nation out of you not a religion and the first thing god gave them is laws write this down then law is the foundation and it is inherent in creation law is the foundation of creation and it is built into creation point number two law is the glue that holds the universe together without the laws that god put in creation and you in the universe it would fall apart that leads to number three everything exists by law everything exists by law if there was not the law of gravity you couldn't stand up straight on this earth did you know that i can stand up right now because there's something holding me to the earth it's called the law of gravity if you get rid of gravity everything will float away from the planet just float away what's holding us here is a law this is why when astronauts go out in a spaceship do you know what space is space is the point where gravity stops pulling you so when you see a plane flying they're not in space matter of fact what's making them fly is the law of gravity it's pulling them down and the engines are pushing against gravity and it creates what they call lift that's what makes the plane fly gravity makes the plane fly but a rocket is a different idea than an airplane a rocket is built with an engine to break not just the sound barrier but the gravity barrier and it violates the law it bursts from the law of gravity and you'll hear sound every time a rocket hits that point [Music] this sound can deafen you that's why they have those guys locked down all kinds of stuff when they go on those things because they're going to hit something bam and they hit this point you can't see it where gravity lets you go and they become space creatures and that's when you see them floating around why because nothing is holding them they violated the law when you violate the law of god you float [Music] there's no grounding to hold your life in order people push you around life pushes you around you become used you become a prostitute of life people use you and life uses you and you end up with nothing but a floating life you were never supposed to exist without something holding you down and it's a law when those men out there in space you see them smiling they are scared all the while do you know why because if something goes wrong out there that's it even when they are outside the spaceship you'll notice they're tied to it with a rope they ain't stupid because if something bumps them and they start drifting you can't swim back you know what makes you swim is gravity you can swim through all the things because something's pulling you to it but if you ain't got nothing pulling you to it you could swim all you want you start drifting still are you swimming this way and you're still going the wrong way you know why there's no law holding you some of us are trying to live life without the laws of god and they keep trying to swim to get success and failure keeps pulling and saying look you can't succeed without the lord rather there are those who watch the program say i don't need god oh yes you do if you don't need god then why don't you leave his gravity stop using his oxygen and do you know as long as they are out in space away from that law they are at the mercy of space you realize they can't even breathe out there they're gonna carry portable oxygen when you leave god's law you gotta find our own support and even the support they use out there they borrowed from god they fill tanks with god's oxygen and then go violate god's laws there's some folks doing that right here in this church they're living on what you call borrowed grace [Music] but you know what out in space the tank runs out [Music] oh yeah you think you got away because you're doing some stuff but god said don't worry that's gonna run out that great gonna leak out you can start suffocating and you're gonna realize that i can't live without god get back to god's law it protects us [Music] one more thing about violating law out in space as long as they're out there the only way for them to get back in is they need a bit of help so the government is called rocket engines and they use the rocket engines to turn themselves toward earth then they use rocket engines to push them away from space toward gravity and the engines work hard to get them back to the point of gravity as soon as they hit gravity bam there's a big sound in the spaceship like someone's exploding and then it suddenly takes on a power of its own and it shifts that [Music] and it travels so fast to earth they got to slow it down otherwise it will burn up that's how it is when you come back to god when you come back to god life takes on a life all by itself glory hallelujah and suddenly you began to be drawn to god faster than you were ever before and suddenly you find a new love for god a new passion for god and if god don't slow you down you'll burn up in love for god tell your neighbour i want to burn them burn me burn me burn me god why god is a consuming fire everything exists by god point number four make a note everything exists on law point number six everything exists for law nothing lives on this planet without obeying laws the animals the plants every river everything lives by laws the rivers run to the sea that's the law it's a law what they call convectional rainfall where the sun soaks up the water and then the water rises and cools becomes clouds and then comes back down as fresh water called rain and then it comes back up as salt water and then it becomes clouds and come down to fresh water that's what's keeping us alive there's this law of convection they cause thank god for the laws he put in creation and we live on those laws that means that god has established his divine laws not only in the spirit world but in the natural world and there's no difference between the two worlds in god's mind [Music] all right what is law you never saw this before write this down what is divine law law is [Music] inherent principles are you ready law is inherent principles that regulate natural life or the nature of life itself it also regulates relationships it is inherent principles that regulate the nature of life and inherent principles of relationships in god's creation both natural and supernatural both physical and spiritual in order to guarantee maximum fulfillment of the purpose and potential of life long definition one the most important i've ever learned what is law laws are inherent principles built into the creation of god both natural and supernatural physical and spiritual that regulate the function of that creation in order for that to fulfill its purpose and maximize its potential what can i say given a good example a seed a mango seed is created by god and once you have that seed obey law the seed maximizes potential okay in my hand is a mango seed can you see it by faith usually imagination it's a mango seed now what's in this mango seed a mango tree right what else is in there a mango tree with mangoes what else is in there a mango trees with mangoes and also have trees in those seeds so in my hand i really have an orchid of mango trees that's the potential of one seed an entire orchard of mango trees with mangoes that's the potential of okay how do i bring this mango seed to fulfill its potential and maximize its life first of all i got to submit it to the law of soil i gotta bury it in the soil then i have to commit to the law of what moisture i got to put some water on that then i got to also submit to the law of nutrients so the soil can get the nutrients into that seed and then i have to depend on the law of growth where the vascular bundles begin to explode in the seed and germinate those seeds vascular brands begin to push out and growth law takes over and it pushes through the seed breaks through the soil comes out as a little shoot and i am totally at the mercy of laws do you know that when you plant a seed that's where you leave off everything else is done by what laws it becomes a massive tree and then mangoes come out in the season and here you are with a productive mango tree with sweet mangoes that you can use to make money because you obeyed some laws you see law regulates how things function so they can be maximized in their potential and fulfill their purpose you are no different from a mango seed you were born loaded with dreams loaded with ideas loaded with vision and god says look even though you are loaded you need to submit to some laws in order for those dreams to germinate ignite and then go to the process of cultivation development and an incubation so they can bring forth a shoot and then a a a tree and then to become fruitful and they'll prosper you but you gotta obey laws that's what i'm talking about when i say laws can i ask you a question if you planted a mango seed look at me if you planted a mango seed in the soil and put water on it can you expect a mango tree are you sure yeah why because certain laws kick in automatically it was automatically let me tell you something because you obey a law it also automates other laws i'm getting at something very important [Music] success is predictable okay let me ask the question again if you plant a mango seed and you put it in the soil and you put water on it what do you expect a mango tree with mangoes right so you can expect what success [Music] interesting why can you expect success because you obey the laws some people are in this church sitting here today and millions watching me around the world by television they are trying to be successful you don't try to be successful in life [Music] success is automated what you got to do is learn the laws that's why god told joshua he said joshua i just gave you a million people to lead you are a young guy but you could be successful if you keep my laws if you obey my laws they will cause you to be successful lord have mercy you know to tell your neighbor i can't help it in other words when you obey the laws of god success is so automatic that your critics will have heart attacks clap man that's a good piece of clap you are supposed to succeed not because you try but because you obey why am i the way i am i have no explanation except i am foolish to obey god foolish enough just did he say jump how high that's me [Music] because the law has built into it its own uh consequences this down please very important and this one i think is very critical the law of nature you know uh law is essential to life what did i say also law is necessary for all relationships do you know why marriages fail easy to figure out they violate law you know ain't nothing wrong with your husband you know anything wrong with your wife it's just that both of you are ignorant about law you god designed life to succeed your divorce was a product of the violation of laws for example if you love someone the bible says you lay your life down for them is that right then how you can lay your life down for them if you keep in sweden so you violated the law you you supposed to lay down your your passions for another woman for the sake of your life that's how you keep the marriage so you can't just violate the law and expect to have a good marriage everything in life is built on law you keep spending money on clothing you can't afford buying shoes you know you shouldn't be wearing trying to buy a car to compete with people who ain't got no sense and now you've broken fighting from paycheck to paycheck and asking god to bless that mess are you crazy you invited the law of management and self-discipline uncovetousness that's the laws you violated there's no mystery about life [Music] one of the greatest laws i've ever seen violated in my life is the law of advice [Music] people don't take advice you know what i mean you give them good advice and they go ahead and do the opposite that's a law violation of good sense [Music] i am the most teachable man in this place you won't believe i'm teachable i know my ignorance let me tell you something secret leadership a good leader knows how stupid they are that's what makes them so smart see a good leader will always staff his weaknesses you understand what i'm talking about if you know what you don't know hi somebody you know it don't walk around think you're supposed to know everything and you everything you weigh all of that know your weakness know what you cannot do and then bring someone else who can do it better than you and then pay them and you get the credit [Music] you gotta learn to take advice it's a law the bible says do not make battle before you take advice don't go into anything without good counsel especially things like marriage and business they will destroy you write this down please the concept of need is the concept of law what do i mean by that god created laws because of needs for case in point god made you need things so that it becomes a lord and needed [Music] still don't get it okay god made the fiction need water so the the fish cannot say i don't want water anymore it's a law for the fish to be in water why it needs it to exist you don't need to kill this plant right here hopefully it's a real one if you root this plant out of the ground you don't need to kill it do you know why you simply violated a law and so the law kicks in it needs soil not an option fish cannot have conferences discussing whether they'll go in water today but humans do it all the time let's decide whether we need god they say let's let's see if god is dead or let's see if god exists i know these big meetings on the existence of god this is why jesus kept on teaching the kingdom of god by using simple things like look at the birds of the aliens they don't hustle they don't run around trying to have 10 jobs they don't lose sleep over two jobs and yet the father tastes kept them you know why they don't try to be nothing else but birds they obey the law of birds he said oh ye of little faith you are so full of worry and stress because you are doing things even the birds don't do [Music] god made you need him god built you to need him the same way the fish need water without god you can do nothing christ says without me you can do nothing he says if you abide in me and the word abide in you you can ask anything unlimited and it shall be done but you gotta first abide in me see the law is you gotta stay in the soil [Music] you can't negotiate with god a fish don't negotiate with the water you imagine two fish debating should a fish need water or not that's a lousy debate it's like a debate between two feathers saying is there a god i don't understand the debate write this down please plants need soil true fish need water birds need the air and trees need carbon dioxide and humans need oxygen you do not decide to breathe oxygen that's why god designed certain organs in your body to operate without your permission have you noticed that your heart beats without you telling it your lungs breathe without you telling it you do not consciously breathe did you know that no one in this room right now is breathing by conscience because god designed your body to need oxygen so you built it to get it in place you don't want it your body needs blood so the heart says i can't depend on you to decide whether you have blood today i'm gonna pump this blood whether you want it or not or you will die god designed you to need him the way your body needs oxygen no matter how deep you think you are intellectual you are the main degrees you get you never impress me the minute you tell me you don't believe in god i think you are the biggest fool in the world [Music] no one creates a universe as precise as this out of a big fight [Music] even if i wasn't sure there was a god i'll take a chance of believing because i can't explain nothing [Music] the law of god is built in to creation i watched one of our trustees in the hospital recently who was here you know his testimony joe and i'll never forget myself and pastor richard and others went there to watch him on that bed and the doctor says his lungs stopped working do you know what they did they hooked him up to an artificial lung which means he didn't even know that a machine was keeping him alive he was completely unconscious he needs oxygen whether he is even alive or not because the body needs it to live you young people let me tell you something no matter how deep you get how cool you think you are you better get your act sorted out with god because you're going to be a big failure if you don't keep close to god my success as a teenager was my love for god and i'm still a teenager slightly older and i'm impacting the world because i obey the laws of god this ain't no luck you see here the same luck this is obedience my striving to keep god's laws in my life how can a man man keep his young man keep his way pure by adhering to the laws of god it says but by getting girlfriend and boyfriend and wearing fubu and stuff you need god in your life to keep yourself hooked up to oxygen what's your need some of you business people you start your business all of a sudden you stop coming to church you better be careful god will pull that plug and that machine on you you wonder why you hawking and spitting and stuff god will pull that plug out [Music] ladies and gentlemen write this down man was created to live by both natural and spiritual laws now we got some folks who don't agree with that them humanists who walk around saying well you know we could solve our own problems because we get the ingenious intelligence mentally psychologically intellectual act to solve all problems let me tell you something if this is the world that man built with this intellect set me free quickly our intelligence produced the united nations and there are more wars since the united nations than before how smart are we we have concluded intellectually that the only way to bring peace is to kill people i mean this is intelligence at the highest level as a matter of fact we've concluded that the very baby we conceive if it is an inconvenience you murder it and we call it choice this is this is intelligence i can't understand we were designed to live by laws natural and spiritual and laws are not produced by the product they are always produced by the manufacturer you don't decide what laws you obey now you can disobey them but you don't decide what the laws and this is when men run into problems with god is when they start telling god ah by the way i found a better lord than yours you know it's like telling it's like telling uh uh the ford motor company i found a way to put orange juice in my gas tank and ford says try it you can't decide the laws you're going to obey life comes with them and if you want to live life you obey the laws make a note of this social relationships are products of law the plant relates to the soil the fish relates to the water the sun relates to the firmament the bird relates to the air all relationships are built on laws let me give an example again how practically it works how many of you like gasoline let me see your hand do you like drink gasoline let me see your hands anybody gasoline don't you like top grade egg gasoline i mean i'm talking about unleaded quality premium gasoline don't you like it oh you don't but then tell me this why do you keep going to that place to get it let's see this is amazing to me you don't like it but you keep relating to the gas station not only that you keep taking money to get it your money to get something you don't like [Music] do you know why because you have something that needs to function and it regulates by gasoline and you want it to function for you so what do you do you have to submit to the law of the thing in order for it to serve you and so you give it even your own money to keep the law so you can experience the benefit it's like a man and a woman living together women need affection men need sex oh my jesus have mercy now we got issues here most men not affectionate just like you don't like gasoline but you want the woman to function for you she said you haven't told me you love me all week woman i told you when i got married you five years ago no wait a minute wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute see a faction is telling her every day a few times a day that's affection [Music] you don't have that built into you the same way you don't have a need for gasoline you don't need to have that kind of response every day but you want the equipment to function so here's a guy in the office on the construction job his brother's around him and he picks up the phone and it's 11 o'clock in the morning and he says hi darling i just call to say i love you and you hang the phone up and all the brothers around them say boy you are hand-picked i'm watch this now you're handpicked you are controlled by that woman she makes you call at 11 o'clock you're a weak man listen to me they are the dumbest man you shouldn't have none of them with your friends clap clap clap clap they have no idea what you're doing tonight gonna be a good night and you're working on it at 11 o'clock in the day [Music] you ain't no dumb fool big rusty intelligent man going to a gas station every week and given your money for this thing you don't like that don't make no sense you're hand-picked by the gas station this car is running your life or is it when you obey laws they protect you there are women sitting in this place who are married and their their affection tank is empty and they are living on fumes for months i'm telling you why their husband has violated a law and some of you wonder you know we heard the sad news for benny here this this week break my heart we gotta pray for our brother and sister but let me tell you something that tells us a lesson the anointing is not affection you have no idea what's going on in people's lives you gotta obey law the laws god put creation how to protect you your relationships are built on laws i know you don't feel like doing this but do it so this man wants sex again listen just open up the gates of glory let the king come in whatever get up it could i hear an amen somewhere hallelujah you know but i don't feel like he don't feel like getting gasoline either he didn't feel like calling you at 11 either come on let's all obey the laws clap fast before i get nervous [Applause] say praise the lord anyhow some of these men's tanks are empty why gas station closed and the station ain't on the glass ain't all the gas we just got some some bad managers of the station right now now listen it's a law it's a law ladies and gentlemen i hope you understand what i'm trying to tell you life is built on these powerful principles that you cannot violate and expect things to continue as usual write this down please law is the key to success and prosperity not hard work law you can work hard at breaking law so it's not just working that makes you successful or prosperous it's working on the laws of god i would rather maximize my time on god's laws than waste my time on man's laws because when it's over they bury you and they hire someone to replace you the same day trust in the lord with all your heart lean not to your own cultivated ideas in all your ways acknowledge his laws and he will what direct your path it says no law of god is grievous the bible says that means no law of god ever heard of society find me one law of god that is above society and i'll quit preaching find me one i'll never speak again on behalf of god you find me one of god's laws that destroys the country none of them my heart is full let me wrap this session up with the law of nations the foundation of all true nations is law true absolutely we've proven that you can't build a community without law that means that nations are built on law and they are sustained by law that also means then that the quality of life in a nation is determined by the national obedience to the law [Music] when the people obey law they protect their own country look at our nations in the caribbean look at america look at china look at african nations if you look at these nations and you study them all their problems are law related whether it's crime or corruption it's all law related the world economic collapse was a result of violation of law you cannot disobey law and protect your country all societies must adhere to law and therefore we have this strange revelation that community is created by law i end where i started this community that we have right here in this local fellowship is supposed to be a community from heaven and we supposed to all obey the same laws that heaven gave us and that's why for every week of this entire year we are going to be teaching from this podium the laws of god so you can reconnect to them and maybe even learn some ones you never knew because if you get those laws then our community is protected and keep in mind that if you you decide to become a part of a community which means you decide to obey the laws it means you also decide to accept the consequences of disobedience of those ones you can't just say i want you know i want to be about bahamian but i want to keep you know jamaican law you can't join a country and keep your own private laws [Music] i put it to you then that the goal of god was to establish this community and he always wanted to bring man as his community on earth and earth was created to be a colony to manifest that community and all nations that god created are supposed to be a prototype of his nation which is the kingdom of heaven and so laws produce the culture and the the community of the nation we're supposed to live by a culture my heart for culture and community is stronger than ever before i guess i'll be infested by those two words until i die do you know why because when you are in a culture you don't think about doing things anymore you do them because they are natural if a bahamian says to you come to my house we have a bahamian food today what comes to your mind right away isn't that amazing peace and rice top of the list why tell me why that's our culture that's our culture if you gotta think about forgiving someone it's not a culture here that's the point i'm making if you got to think about loving someone or choosing you to love in this church you are not yet in the kingdom country if you got to think about giving tithes and paying tithe giving offerings you know it's not a culture yet that's why you fight with your purse because it's not a culture whatever you got to think about is not culture yet we need a kingdom culture which says hey she's hurting we all get around and we solve it that's the culture if we gotta debate anything it's not culture yet the mind of jesus was the culture of heaven he said forgive your enemies peter says are you crazy peter said you don't know my enemy i got special enemies christ says forgive those who despitefully use you love your enemies peter says listen to me he feels okay all right all right i accept that he says he said but can i forgive him just the voice a second time in other words let's make a deal on forgiveness she says no you give them you forgive them 70 times seven seven in hebrew is a concept of wholeness that means you never stop forgiving if you gotta negotiate forgiveness you're not yet in kingdom culture you're still in religion called christianity christianity chooses who to forgive and who to like [Music] it's amazing i put it to you then that jesus had an idea matthew 4 he says repent because the country of heaven has come to earth he bought an entire culture look at matthew 4 23 he says i must preach the good news to all the towns notice when you preach the kingdom it's followed by a culture sick sick gets healed blind see lame walk miracles are not supposed to lead the gospel they supposed to be in the wake of the gospel am i making sense if you walk into a place and you see a bunch of peas and rice on the plate you know bahamian somewhere nearby in other words the culture can tell you who was here when christ came into a city everybody was sick when he left all these people healed look at that verse it says he went through galilee teaching in the synagogues preaching the good news of what the kingdom and then he healed every sick person in that city everyone who was diseased among people in other words you could say when you come there who's here how come the hospital is empty oh that guy came through here who said that another country has arrived and he left the evidence [Applause] prosperity is not supposed to be something you pray for it's supposed to be your culture this week i prophesy as your senior pastor lift your right hand right now that this week shall be the beginning of natural success receive that right now just thank god for it right now natural success you're gonna naturally begin to move into your business success family success investment success god is going to cause you to naturally progress he's going to cause you to naturally come into prosperity they won't even know how it happened because you're going to obey god's laws thank him right now you're going to submit yourself to the laws of heaven and god is going to naturally prosper the works of your hands you're going to bring into your hands things that you didn't lay before in the name of prosperity and promotion will come to you naturally because you obey the laws of god give him glory to smile give him glory hallelujah he wants you to succeed is there any parent here who enjoys their child's failure doesn't exist is any parent who celebrate their kid getting f on the test it embarrasses the parent when i got a bad

[Music] yes", "1avb163STkc": "let me know what you guys think about this look because i'm feeling it a lot [Music] hi welcome back to my channel and welcome to my channel if you are new my name is lumia and if you're not subscribed go ahead and hit that subscribe button you're here for a reason you're gonna love me at least i'm going to be trying a lot of do you guys know i just love updo if you haven't noticed by now up do me play but yes so doing something simple i don't like to make things too complicated for y'all because i'm just showing you guys style that styles that you can do at home without having to go to a stylist to get it done when i first started my luck journey my biggest problem was i know how to retweet but i don't know how to style my locs i spent couple weeks on youtube looking at different ways to start my locs and i'm like well i could do this it's not as hard as i thought so then i got the basic ideas of styling locks and so i just started adding my own you know so first i'm gonna start by moisturizing my roots because pretty dry right now and every time i start my locs you guys always see me spraying it down first because it's always dry and i like to work with moisturized hair you feel me but this is how my hair looks all dry in this natural state you can see my roots they are pretty thick you know new growth already need to re-twist badly but i'm not gonna re-twist until until april yeah middle middle of april is when i plan to retwist again so i'm just gonna go grab my spray bottle with my moisturizer and my oil and i'll be right back back guys this is the moisturizer i use i kind of switch moisturizer i don't have a set moisturizer i use so my hair is not picky so i just use a lot of natural natural sulfate free color safe feel me because color but this is a me pretty pink and green bottle my two favorite colors let me let you guys see okay and i massage it when i feel like my hair is moisturizing enough wow it feels like i'm brushing my day after when i had it out i don't miss it i don't miss the little pain when you detangling and brushing the fro i don't miss that pain but when i used to do my hair when i used to detangle i used to shower my hair in coconut oil because coconut oil was like my main moisturizer i used so before i did anything before i washed i pre-pulled with coconut before i did anything i shower my hair in coconut oil and it worked it worked for me but you see so i noticed i got um a lot of new stubbies and i just want to like give you guys a little back story on my locs okay for you guys that are new here i started my own locks two years ago september 2018 i forgot the exact date september 2018 so starting my own locks two straight twists left them alone i wash my hair every this year to be honest with you i watched it every two months and i retwist every three months so yes that's what i did but then on my sixth month when i interlocked for the first time my interlock lasted for like a whole another half a year so i left my hair alone for majority of my vlog journey basically so now we're here today two years almost three and we're flourishing and we're hitting the shoulder the collarbone period this two years later okay let's get started enough of me talking [Music] i always do the edges last so i'm just gonna braid braid this regular and not too tight because i don't know why my my scalp feels so sensitive my locs feel so sensitive [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] this is it for this video you guys i hope you all like this style i really liked it and i

get the kids from this the main place this is the main this is what about 50 mm yeah and now the other village a slum village called Hill School school is near Angus they do like again for her system because they are like big file yeah and online in the strip's you know people actually come up to stern like fighting so why do they trust what's the reason you've obviously established communication what have you given them or what we said to them that makes them trust you in the initial beginnings we welcome okay it was quite chaotic then you even come with their blue and but through that process now we started started giving them opportunity to come we can talk of London so through that obviously information spreads amongst the mother is not the child and problems we see that they are in and the kids who are otherwise here yeah or in slum soon obviously not at school slums or this kind of place or the other place and those who maybe have a guardian contact of the school they are in school in the day in distress okay the reason sometimes for not going to school can't afford beautiful intense but education is free in Kenya right well it is free but they are afraid in half by yeah after by uniform uniform we have to supplies so it's not really free but initially there used to be and how much would for example one uniform cost on average from the shoes so about 25 euros which is actually not very much and you can then help a child get into school very easily from donate 25 euros yeah that's why you know it's more I think we almost make them like this it is not like what's when they high on the glue which is what are the kids doing if their kids actually in their care what are they doing they're just sitting around yeah usually sitting around playing around in this thing the kids also start sniffing early some of them early we happy children like mothers that are sharing right but yeah it mostly there but they start very early some of them okay and you know it's very dangerous area even the Bliss of the river sure and what kind of things are in the river you have just sniffing all the time yeah yeah birds mother we have built it but she's been running away

Berg is a regenerative Pereira local Chinese we joined in tomorrow all right you", "0FNQTxX_jT4": "hey all and welcome to another build guide my name's Luke and this tutorial is all about making highly detailed trees which not only produce a fantastic branch structure but also allow for a highly detailed root system this technique works really well for old well-established trees with roots that raise above the soil so enough talking let's get started and make some trees to get started you'll need some very thin wire that's easy to bend and manipulate the wire I'm using is 28 gauge florist wire which is perfect for modeling hecho scale trees each length of wire is cut to about 13 inches 13 inches works well for a tree that's about two and a half inches tall but if you want to large a tree just cut each strand of wire a little bit longer pull up I cut 15 individual strands of wire for this tree bundle them together then fold them in half and give it a few twists to start the trunk the loop at the bottom will be used to model the roots so be sure to leave a loop of wire about this big at the bottom next it's simply a matter of splitting the wires in half then twist until you get a suitable branch length and repeat you'll gradually get fewer and fewer wires until you're left with two and don't worry if they're not perfectly split 50/50 when you finally get down to two wires you can create a loop and then twist that loop to create a finer spread of branches it takes some practice but once you get the hang of it you'll be able to do it very fast additionally you can press the loop inwards like a jellybean then twist again to get even more branches at the end of each arm once you've finished the branches I just use some pliers to cut each loop open and then trim the wires to the size I want now for the roots I basically follow the exact same method I did with the branches except the roots tend to be shorter if you're having trouble twisting you can always grab some pliers to help twist once you're done with the roots spread the roots out to be flat along the ground and finally shape the tree by bending the branches to the desired shape it's very easy to shape given the wire is such a thin gauged wire to hide all that twisted wire and give it a more prototypical look I coat the entire tree in Woodland Scenic's latex rubber the baking paper helps prevent the latex rubber from sticking to the cutting mat I apply the latex rubber quite heavy that way I won't need as many coats to completely hide the twisted wire appearance you may even get away with one coat there are a number of benefits to using the latex rubber to coat the tree one it does a great job of filling in the gaps and removing the obvious twisted wire appearance to it accepts the paint well and third due to it being a rubber substance you can always change and bend the wire armatures even after the tree has been completely finished without damaging it for this tree I ended up applying two coats however the second coat was much lighter you can speed up the drying process by placing the tree somewhere warm this next step is optional it only makes a very small difference but basically I applied two millimeter static grass to the tips of each branch to simulate much smaller branches a small amount of tacky craft glue is all that's needed and a light dab of the static grass on the chips and once done I blow away the excess static grass I went with this brown primer from rust-oleum to undercoat the tree remember to coat the bottom as well so that you get the underside of the branches next is the main tree color and in this case I'm going for an apple tree look which tends to be an earthy gray color I mix some black white and burnt umber to get this color and coated the entire tree don't worry if you miss a little spot that's why I applied the brown undercoat so it wouldn't show obvious spots that have been missed to add some highlights to the trunk are lightly dry brush some white over the top I still found the tree to be slightly shiny due to the cheap acrylic paint I used so to dull down the shine as well as blend in some of the white highlights I gave the tree a light airbrushing with some Vallejo light brown now for the big transformation the main leaf structure is woodland Scenic's medium green coarse turf i used a spray adhesive and sprayed the branches trying to avoid getting glue on the main part of the trunk I then dip the tree into the tub of course foam do your best to avoid getting the foam on the trunk and then shake off the excess continue spraying the tree and applying more coarse turf until you get the coverage and density you're after there may be areas that you'll need to press the foam in with your fingers this tree took three coats of foam before I was satisfied if you're after an apple tree you're gonna need some apples these ones here are woodland Scenic's apples they are very easy to apply simply spray the tree lightly with the spray adhesive and sparingly sprinkle on some of the apples I try to avoid placing apples directly on top because you tend to see apples on the side of the tree and hanging from underneath if you don't want an apple tree you're still going to need to spray the tree with the glue however just skip applying the apples to add some more life to the tree I use these knock leaves these ones are olive colored basically sprinkle them over the entire tree and again avoid getting them on the trunk and anyway you don't want them I even sprinkle them from underneath as well and then shake away the excess finally I place the tree upright and apply some woodland Scenic's burnt grass over the top of the tree this helps highlight the top of the tree simulating sunlight reflecting off the top of the leaves and the bottom of the tree appears darker indicating shadow it basically adds a more three-dimensional look went under layout lighting just use some tweezers to remove any leaves and bits of foam from areas they shouldn't be and if you're not happy with the coverage of apples you can easily go in and place apples while the spray adhesive still has some tackiness left or you can just as easily remove any unwanted apples with the tweezers now the tree is made we need to install it this tree julu its root structure is not as simple as other trees to install and requires a little more pre-planning to help the roots appear ingrown I lightly press them into the wet plaster and push down just enough for them to protrude from the top of the plaster to remove the obvious appearance of being pressed into position I use a very soft brush to blend the plaster in and around the roots I'll keep doing this for about five minutes or so as the plaster begins to set once the plaster starts to harden it becomes easier to remove the obvious brush strokes and now we just wait for the plaster to set overnight it's inevitable that some plaster will go over the roots so to help remove the unwanted plaster I use a stiff brush and dip it in water before brushing it over the roots but don't brush so hard that the paint peels away to easily paint the plaster without accidentally painting the roots I make a thinner earth coloured wash it will depend on the soil color you plan to have but for me I got a good dirt color by mixing two parts burnt umber with one part burnt sienna and added a moderate amount of water to thin it down I always test it on a paper towel before applying it to the scenery then it's as easy as brushing it over the scenery the wash is thin enough that it won't change the color of the roots should you brush it right over the top of them next to add soil I paint in between the roots with a very lightly watered down Mod Podge mix and make sure you avoid getting glue over the top of the roots I then sprinkle the dirt texture over the top and blow away the excess it's finally wash away the dirt powder from the tops of the roots with a wet brush now you're almost done it's just a matter of applying your usual scenery application around the tree for me I finished applying the dirt texture over the rest of the diorama and to add detail under the tree I sprinkled my leaf texture in areas that leaves would fall I then sealed everything in place by using isopropyl alcohol to pre wet the area and then use scenic glue to ensure everything got glued into position and didn't move as a final touch I added some static grass tops randomly around the base then I added a little bit of human element by adding some people and if you look really carefully you might be able to see some birds in the tree as well be sure to check out Boulder Creek Railroad comm for my latest modelling article titled the number one tips from six influential modelers which could help you learn from the experts you can also follow along with my blog to see what's coming up and what I'm working on next hope you enjoyed

we're going to be doing der from invader zone okay so first off i just have to apologize for the weird color of green i created go and because i had a blue and a yellow but i didn't realize the yellow is more of a very light orange so i ended up with this uh not a bad color but not a good color for what i'm creating it's like a army kind of army green okay as usual always the setup is your mix-up and clay and condition your clay rolling it into a ball getting rid of all your lines then afterwards going into a snake cutting it into two halves rolling those two pieces into balls making sure all the the lines are out because you don't want any unnecessary lines on your sculpture okay now you'll see there's a bit of a pad already on the eyes so i'm kind of just pressing it on the surface trying to make it like a half moon shape um and yeah just to make sure that it's nice and round like that you can you can figure that out okay you'll see as well at a later stage i kind of see that the proportions that i have for the eyes are a bit too big so afterwards i just cut it and like repeat the same process but they're nice and rounded and there's no lines on the top of the eyes the back of the the clay is flat as like the surface because that's kind of what i want i want to stick it onto the actual sculpture and next up i'm just running a bit of black for like the arms the tail and the legs because all of them are black but i kind of started mixing it and i had a bit too much baby powder on my hand so the clay kind of dried up really fast i had to use a new batch and mix that into old clay which is not a problem it's just like the baby powder is to make sure that you get rid of unnecessary lines and also so the clay doesn't get tacky on your hands okay so i put baby part on my hands again because i conditioned the clay quite a bit to kind of get what i thought would be a better looking green but the clay was fairly tacky so i have a little bit of baby powder on my hands i slapped off the excess the excess clay the excess baby powder once again repeating the same process rolling into a ball getting rid of all my fine lines and fingerprints but uh with the baby powder this is going to prevent that so kind of what you're going to do is roll it in almost like an egg egg type shape elongating on the head then with using your thumb you're going to try go just past halfway pressing it in with your thumb creating like the neck is pretty much attached like directly to the back of the head where you're just going to push in under the chin now seeing that you have the baby powder on your hands your your hands are quite um [Music] smooth and that's that's kind of what helps with the with the with the the tackiness and also the fingerprints so now i'm just sharpening the edge of the mouth pressing in on the on the little body of go smoothing out the top of the head there you can see he's got a bit of a line for the chin which is actually what you want you'll see at a later stage i actually also kind of like move if as you can see there i kind of do it at an angle because you want the front where the eyes are going to be um lower than the back of the of the jaw it just looks better like that then just smoothing it out because it's like an egg egg shaped head flattened a bit smooth out the neck and the back of the head are almost cylindrical with like a kind of a bend and there you go there you have basic body forego there you can see as i said before i realize month of my eyes are going to be way too way too big so i'm cutting them down a bit mixing them up again making sure to get rid of any lines conditioning them bringing them to a bowl and then i'll repeat the same process that i did earlier with the eyes and don't worry because of the green can i actually kind of paint it with a nicer color green just too bad the paint kind of dried dried up a little bit so you didn't have the best quality paint for the job but uh you can obviously save yourself from that kind of disaster sometimes these kind of things happen and usually they happen late at night not not when everything is open any case as you can see once again using the surface to flatten up these little cylindrical cables off cables checking to see if they kind of match up to the size of the girl body just once again checking out that i'm smoothing out the like the overall body of go with no lines as it is a small sculpture so people are gonna you know the visual part of it people are gonna look at it close up so you don't want to have all kinds of finger lines and stuff on it another reason for doing the chin so flat is because eventually i want to stick a small like little piece of plank clay representing the tongue now one thing i actually saw after making this video is i forgot like the little zipper part on the front of the of the character but that's pretty straightforward i'm sure you can figure that out i'm not going to show you how to do that it's just to get the overall shape of go and you'll actually see at the end how good the the go displays there you can see always readjust your work have a look at it see if you're happy with the overall outcome don't just do it once off and think okay yeah i'm done i'm happy with it like try and see if you can't improve it in any kind of way now there i had a bit too much baby powder on my hand so the clay kind of was a bit too dry to kind of attach to the body because if in some instances you sometimes want to attach the clay before baking it other options other times you get instances where you want to do a bunch of um pre-bakes before you do overall sculpture like sometimes you send off for instance you would do the eyes and the tongues or something else like maybe weapons or whatever the case might be beforehand bake them off and then you can just like kind of apply them to the new set of wet clay and then bake that off but seeing that it's just like a small like little demo kind of tutorial video i'm i wasn't too worried about that once again with the black clay i rolled it into a ball making sure to get rid of any lines rolling into snakes so i can split it up in equal sized um little pieces of clay now what you would do with this casing that go is almost like he's got like a costume on it kind of looks like the the feet um the legs and the arms are kind of stitch on to go just do like little lines on the side of the arms just to kind of give that like feeling and the nice thing is if it's a small piece of clay and you don't you're worried to press too hard on the body you can use the sculpting tool to kind of um hide away clay to attach on the inside of let's say for instance the shoulder or the leg or something like that oh wait that's actually the clay that dried up too much with the baby powder thought the end of the wall just means i need to mix it up with a bigger bowl of clay and there we go attaching the arm then i'll use the sculpting tool after i've placed it on there to kind of just do like the little like stitching marks on the arms and both on the legs always when making a sculpture just keep in mind is it something that people are going to see from a distance or if it's something that they're going to want to have a look up at close it all depends on your point of focus like for instance the point of focus with go seeing that it's based off a comic and you want to kind of give it that comic like look is you want to have it at a certain angle to kind of portray that kind of look within the comic or the cartoon or whatever the case might be as you can see like the one eye is almost in the center of the head where the other one is off center from the head so that the one eye overlaps the clay a bit with that bit just rolling a snake of clay flattening the corners bending them up a little bit because i'm just going to split that in two at a later stage and then attach them as ears that's the kind of ears that go ahead reason i already know this and i'm not using reference at that particular moment is because i've already done quite a few goes and sold them at markets and and stuff like that so i kind of have the shape shape down in my in the top of my head once again with the tail you don't want that sticking out because it's too bitter too small bits of clay so you kind of just want to attach it to the back to give her the overall idea of the tail otherwise that's just going to break off with some little small sculptures you can do armature in them but with this character it's pretty pretty straightforward so armature is not needed for the character next up i think i'm rolling a bit of pink see there i'm just double checking my head again seeing if i'm happy with the shape because also if you're going to leave your clay on a flat surface for too long that clay is going to start setting into that surface and it's going to take on the shape of that surface being it flat cut board wood whatever the case might be there just met uh mixing up a bit of pink clay what i did is i just made like a just cut like a little shape because it's like almost like a little rectangular shape flattened the little cable rounded it off making sure there's no lines flattened it cut it in a particular shape left it like that baked it like that and i was sorted because i'm only going to glue that on afterwards also just keep in mind do not use super glue i use super glue for the idea of the videos just making it go a lot faster you don't need to use super glue super glue is quite quite dangerous it's kind of funny how you do these things and only after you do a nice damn i need this i need this i need that i need this as i could pick up with my paint brushes as the color really started getting to me paint on it and paint okay as you can see as well i use the paperclip pen to kind kind of keep him up for the time period that it's in the oven because i don't want him to take on the shape of the foil on that baking tray there you can see that the ears are already baked off the eyes are baked off the tongues are baked off i'd literally split the two ears they've got a similar shape they've got a similar size and i just put them in two because i'm going to attach them and afterwards what you could do is maybe take like a very thin piece of metal wiring and attach it to the ears just making the more stone on the sculpture i don't do that i don't do that for the purpose of the video i'm just doing this video to kind of show you the overall idea yeah and this is when i realized i need a whole bunch of stuff to kind of replace old old gear okay uh the little white batch of clay that's now your um kids like polymer clay the air drying one sometimes i use it for different things the other time i use that for making like a little like clay base for the my little painting character other times you can use it to kind of keep stuff up directly this is not something you put in the oven it's just for like like instances like this where you want to keep something directly up because out of paint that particular paint is going to attach to the surface and then kind of like rip all the paint off as soon as i'm done with it so i want to make sure that it's nice and dry keep it directly up with the tongue it's pretty much just painting on the sides and the bottom and then just doing the little line in the middle of the tongue now something similar happens to the eyes i kind of saw i've only got one like little like fine point brush but i try to paint on lines around the eyes because you'll see on the rim of the eye there's like black lines if you would look at the comic that just makes it look a bit more cartoonish sometimes you can do that in sculpture it helps a fair bit but make sure you have brushes that actually can perform the deed that you need doing just covering it with a second coat so it doesn't look so dark smoothing it out with a little bit of water sadly that was not the same same thing for the little painted there's a little bit of the clay has already dried and i don't have products so i kind of think i should afford this forwarded this a little bit any case uh well i'm busy with that um feel free to follow me comment see what other suggestions you can make for me to make i'm going to be covering a whole bunch of different things i don't just want to focus on the comics i want to focus on gaming and you know just create a whole bunch of good cool content that you guys can enjoy so i'm very open to suggestions kind of just painting over the arms as i had to kind of paint the body more of a natural color towards go i was kind of irritated but at least the the black paint wasn't as giant as the green but you'll get the overall idea in a few seconds there i go using the black paint on the room of the eye but the brush was not good so i kind of made a few few horrible little black dots in different areas that i don't want because the the very end is split so yeah i need i need new bridges asap kind of doing the same thing with the other eye there you can see that was big mishaps but at least i could cover it with white paint now pretty much it's a let's say it's the body the two eyes the arms on the legs so it's literally three pieces of clay to kind of set this up fair bit of black small bit of white your basic green and just sorted and i mean you can get creative with it and do stuff where he's got like the open mouth with the teeth and stuff like that now just drawing a almost like a perpendicular line just aligned to the top of the head painting on the nose just making like a little diamond shape as the line has to be a bit off center then i would stick down my first eye just seeing how it looks kind of like what i want it to look like making sure that it's not too that it's on the flat surface of the clay not just placing it down anywhere you have to kind of figure out where's the flatter surface for this eye to be placing that the bottom of the eye is flat then with the other eye i'll pretty much use my sculpting tool to kind of angle it because i also want to get a flat surface and i don't want it like to be on the line just slightly off there you can see the eye is slightly off center yes this character might look good from all angles but it will look good from one angle you want it to look good at next up same thing with the tongue as i said with the ears before if you have a small little bit of metal wiring that you can stick into the tongue to stick it into the to the actual sculpt you can do that i would just give it a bit more support me i didn't do that this was just for the purposes of video i just stuck it down on the flat surface at the bottom of the head you can just see i'm also just attaching the ears and then the last thing i kind of lost the one foot so i was like whatever and pretty much the feet are going to cover that little hole so you don't have to worry about the whole being too visible if you have stuff we have to keep something like support something to not like fall flat on the surface just put it on a pen to kind of keep it up and you'll know you won't have any weird shiny surfaces thank you so much guys bye you", "SApDOEels5k": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hmmm [Music] ah [Music] oh [Music]

your eyes to quiet your mind opening our hearts as we relax into the awareness that everything around us is pure spirit we are immersed in saturated with divinity and it can be absolutely no other way for this is the truth of who and what we are as we turn within and relax into this peace i know that all is well all is calm all is perfect whole and complete there's absolutely nothing that is lacking for there is no lack in the divine so knowing this we open ourselves up to the beauty of today's service knowing that it is perfect and it is perfect simply because we are here so i give great thanks for all that is being expressed today for all that is being shared and for all the ways that we are inspired by reverend kimberly's beautiful enlightening enlivening talk i am so thankful for the shifts in consciousness that are taking place right now within this room and beyond and throughout the globe as we awaken to our divinity to our power and our presence as change makers in the world thank you thank you thank you god i simply release this into the law knowing that it is done here and now thank you amen ashay and will you help anchor this with me as we declare and so it is i'd like to talk about the spiritual practice of visioning it's something that our community is doing right now as we open ourselves up to knowing what our next greatest expression is as centers for spiritual living rogue valley and where that place is that we land visioning is based on the premise that there's an infinite intelligence with a more expansive idea of who and what we are than we could possibly have with our limited perspective and experience through the spiritual practice of visioning we create a space of deep listening reverential alertness and internal awareness in order to fully embrace the divine idea that is our greatest good our life is the life of the divine and it longs to express itself uniquely through us as us right now all that is required of us to receive its impress is a willingness to take an inward journey through the evolution of our inner self our divine nature through visioning we make ourselves available to embrace the divine idea of our lives in order that we may more completely experience and live our highest good michael bernard beckwith teaches that all spiritual growth is a hundred percent about releasing or eliminating rather than attaining something because we are already it spiritually during the visioning process in asking what must i release we open to the revelation of obstacles encumbrances and limitations in our beliefs and behaviors that impede our alignment with our vision the vision is already complete in the divine mind waiting for us to clear the way think of it as washing dirt away from a window so that we can better allow the light to shine through it is important for us to know that the release is always in consciousness first but it can also be a letting go on the physical plane as well a letting go of relationships ways of being habits actions attitudes and beliefs in releasing these things that do not serve the fulfillment of our life's vision we create a vacuum that spirit immediately moves into to occupy it is then that we become self-emptied spirit-filled it is then what that we align with and fully express the divine vision that is us namaste the medicine pipe was a big part of the glue that held pre european contact societies together in north america multi-racial multi-ethnic multi-linguistic because each person who had a pipe made a vow to the creator to treat every buddy that came into their life with respect honor and dignity we're going to do an all-pipe song from the blackfoot tradition to honor that legacy that we have and this is a pipe to strengthen the light workers in every society every country every village every town throughout the world it's a very old song pre-columbian contact song from the blackwood tradition hey [Music] hey [Music] hey [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] hey [Applause] hey [Music] hey [Music] hey [Music] hey [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey [Music] [Music] [Music] wow thank you thank you anton and laura our theme for this month is open to possibilities possibilities you know there were some heartbreaking things going on in our news this week and so i decided to start right there possibilities so we talk often in science of mind in our centers for spiritual living about a world that works for everyone and what i've realized this week more than ever is that means for one a democracy in our country that works for everyone where everyone not only has the right to vote but also has access to voting places and in light of the incidents this week in atlanta where tragically we had eight people senselessly slaughtered at three asian spas i want to speak to that um you know there's been a huge uptick in anti-asian violence over the last year during covid and it's caused a lot of trauma and fear grieving in the asian communities as well as our communities at large in centers for spiritual living we have a committee called the spiritually motivated social engagement committee they put out a statement this week in support in alliance with our asian and pacific islander communities and i want to read you a part of that this was written by a young minister named reverend masando haroka fear and trauma in the asian american pacific islander community are very present right now and as an organization that believes in oneness and holds a vision of peace and human dignity for all we stand in solidarity with the asian american pacific islander community and speak this prayer for the families that are mourning and more healing of the racism and violence that create suffering in our world we come to the present moment in a place of sadness and mourning of confusion and anger and come to know that in the midst of tragedy in the midst of these natural responses to tragedy and violence the presence of the living spirit the divine is still fully here at the center of our being providing a healing bomb and place where both grief and the healing that comes with that grief lives moves and has its being we know this same healing energy is present for the families that have been directly affected by this tragedy and we too know that the love we feel for our fellow aiaapi brothers and sisters that are experiencing the collective trauma of this incident permeates out and surrounds and unfolds their hearts and minds it is through this love and through the recognition of our oneness that we also stand and mourn in solidarity with the aapi community and the trauma they'd experienced in the past year since the pandemic began we hold a place of safety of strength and of commitment to ensuring and upholding the safety and peace of all giving special attention to our asian american pacific islander friends right now and it is from this space we extend this prayer to our country and to the world holding a place of healing from the ravages of separation racism misogyny and the mindless acts that are birthed from hate and power over one another we hold a space for the collective healing that is being called forth from each one of us in this sacred time we are sharing on the planet together allowing our hearts to build bridges of understanding of greater awareness and of the mending of all our relationships we know this work is god's work and so take refuge in remembering that this healing is being supported by a power greater than ourselves with each breath with each tear with each rush of anger or swirl of confusion we rest in the knowing that healing is happening within us and around us and as we rest into that space where grief healing and coming together can all take place at once we give thanks for the heartbreaking that eventually settles into heart opening we give thanks for the ways in which our own hearts are able to be moved and moved into an active inspiration to stand for one another with love with heartbreak with togetherness we say amen and so it is ah while these recent murders in atlanta have not been confirmed to be motivated by racism it's clear that there's they have added tremendously to the trauma in the asian communities and beyond this week our vice president kamala harris stood in solidarity with the asian community in atlanta and she said this she said none of us should ever be silent in the face of any kind of hate none of us should ever remain silent and so with that in mind i want to address one other issue this morning when we talk about open to possibilities i think about the dream that martin luther king spoke about where we can all stand together in equality holding hands and yet across our nation right now there are many many bills being introduced in state legislators to limit voter accessibility i want to preface what i'm about to say by reminding you that when i address these issues it does not come from a place of partisan politics but rather from a place of speaking to the deepestly held values we have in our spiritual community which quite frankly are values held by almost all spiritual communities throughout the world we speak from a place of moral and conviction and values so if you haven't had a chance this week to listen to the maiden speech which means the first time a new senator gets to speak on our senate floor i encourage you to tune in to the speech made by georgia's first african-american senator senator raphael warnock who by the way also happens to be pastor you probably know of ebeneezer baptist church in atlanta where you know both well it used to be the home the home church and the pulpit for martin luther king and it was also the home church for many many years of congressman john lewis so speaking on the senate floor this week reverend reverend i guess i can call him reverend and senator um raphael warnock said something that i so resonate with because i think he nailed the relationship between and i think the rightful relationship between spirituality and our political life and this is just a brief excerpt as a man of faith i believe democracy is the political enactment of a spiritual idea the sacred worth of all human beings the notion that we all have within us a spark of the divine and a right to participate in the shaping of our destiny thank you senator rafael warnock i felt inspired and uplifted hearing your words and realizing that we all hold out this possibility of a greater more just country and world by the way i will be including in this week's e-newsletter that goes out to our community resources uh for us all to take action to stand in solidarity with the asian american pacific islander communities around the world so i actually entitled my message this morning addition by subtraction addition by subtraction it kind of sounds like an oxymoron but as laura so beautifully talked about our visioning process is just that it's subtracting whatever might get in the way of our listening to divine guidance of our being able to embody the highest vision that spirit has for each of us individually for us as a nation and for us as a world you know most of us when we first come into the science of mind philosophy or any new thought teaching we usually come in with things we want to add to our lives things we want to shift maybe we want a more new relationship or a more powerful harmonious relationship maybe we want a new job or more financial flow or perhaps you know we're looking for better health and it's a wonderful wonderful journey when we learn that we don't have to be a victim michael beckwith talked about the four stages of consciousness the first one is a victim consciousness and unfortunately many of us found ourselves there when we first came to new thought and this is a consciousness where we kind of feel like life happens to me and there's not a whole lot i can do about it so we tend in that stage to blame people we blame our parents we blame our economic circumstances we grew up in we blame our boss our spouse etc and when we learn to use the spiritual principles we teach and we learn that there is a loving spirit that wants nothing but the highest and best for us that nothing stands in our way of that that this spirit responds to us we become empowered and we move into what beckwith called the manifesto consciousness the manifesto stage and this is all well and good i mean we're meant to enjoy life and to have the things we want and if you think about maslow's hierarchy of needs we really need to have the basics down before we can evolve to a higher level of consciousness but with all the adding in our lives there is a part of us that is not completely fulfilled at some point we need to move to a more cutting edge in our spiritual development and this is when we come to the part about releasing the part about subtracting in order to add value and fulfillment in our lives so in the by me phase we the ego is basically into control you know we do we have tools like visualization where we picture what we want and imagine it's happening and help bring it about we use affirmations we use affirmative prayer but the bottom line is it's our human side not our spiritual side our egoic side that has chosen those goals and when we begin to move into the next stage which instead of a manifesto stage is a channel stage we become channels for the divine energy for the divine guidance we surrender and we allow spirit to set the stage now that is not a spirit a god outside of ourselves that is the spark within us as rafael warnock reminded us it lives right within us it is who we are as well so i want you to imagine as our community is going through this visioning process for a new home that all of us can be visioning opening up and listening to guidance for our life purpose for spirit's highest and best idea of who we are and meant to be on the planet and how exciting that might be the first question and visioning process when we get into a real meditative space is what must i become in order for this spirit well it's actually the second question the first question is what is spirit's highest ideal for our new church home for my life the second question what must i become in order for that vision to manifest in our recent visioning for our new home i'm going to share just a couple things people came up with that that spirit guided them to think um and i and i share these because i think they might have relevance to your own life when you think about what do you need to embrace in order to embody spirit's highest vision of your life so people said i need to become open to possibilities i need to be open-hearted i need to be ready to follow divine guidance now the next question is what must i release in order for this vision to become manifest here's where the rubber meets the road and here's where my talk title comes in addition by subtraction here are some of the things people said this past week when laura stewart led our community visioning i need to release fear i need to release the need to control i need to release lack mentality as i read this list i'd like you to think about what your life would look like if you could truly release any one of these things i need to release impatience attachment or preconceived notions about how things should work out i need to release playing small the idea that we have to make it happen i love that you know i had a beautiful spiritual mentor and practitioner named reverend alice bandy who has made her transition not a year or so ago and i remember coming to her one day in a practitioner session when i was community leader here concerned about something i don't remember what the issue was but i was saying to her i don't know how i'm going to do this alice i don't know how i can do this and she said to me you can't and at first i kind of went what and then i realized what she meant she meant you kimberly and your egoic small human self cannot but spirit can so when we start to release our need to control our need to have preconceived ideas our attachment to what it looks like spirit moves in always to guide us to bless us so on the subject of subtraction rather than addition i'd like to read a short quote by one of our practitioners in our movement ray jordan she said all spiritual work is actually the process of subtraction the releasing of old ideas about us and false beliefs about life she goes on to explain that by releasing those things we open to the highest good we open to possibilities which of course is our theme this month so i would like to relate a little story that happened to me this week i think i might have mentioned last week that i was so excited by everything that came through in our visioning about our new church home it was just lovely and we were all feeling alive and and positive and then i went into a weekend uh session uh that csl offered called welcome back summit and i heard about all the logistics that we have to think about that we need to think about when we open our new center and finding our new center and making it safe and i and i went into a space of oh my goodness and feeling the weight of the world on my shoulders so this week in meditation i love what can happen when we open to divine guidance i was opening myself i was intending to be in that channeled state of receiving guidance and what came at first was kind of interesting it was a memory that came through this is how spirit can work sometimes so here's the memory about eight years ago i was living in a very lovely apartment in huntington beach california it had lovely grounds a swimming pool and fountains and very well landscaped but it was expensive and it worked because i shared it with a roommate or an apartment mate there were two basically master suites in this apartment my roommate at the time was moving out to move in with her boyfriend and i needed to find another roommate and it wasn't happening so i had sent out i'd you know move my feet i'd sent out on the internet ads and i'd put up posters around the beautiful big complex where i lived and one day i was swimming in the pool and i came up for air now mind you i was swimming laps and i i had finished a repeat i don't know how many laps and i got to the shallow end of the pool and lifted my cap and took off my goggles for a minute take a breath and just as i lifted my cap there were two women sitting at the shallow end of the pool and i heard one of them say my name i didn't know these women and it turns out they were looking at my ad for my apartment and i talked to them i took one of the women up to show her the apartment she was very interested in it now as it turns out she didn't end up being my roommate another whole miraculous thing happened later and it was fine but what i realized in that moment was what a normal that was what a miracle that is normal because it happens all the time these kind of synchronicities that at the very moment i took a breath at the very day and hour i was at that pool these two women were there looking at my ad and so what happened for me this week is it just changed my faith and my outlook on this whole situation that we're about to embark on which is very exciting finding new church home and also can be a little challenging but what i realized is spirit has our back that as we continue to vision and open ourselves to this vision so that spirit can help us create the intentions for what we're looking for we will be supported every step of the way i give thanks for that experience and it wouldn't have happened if i hadn't gotten quiet and gone into meditation so i share this because this can happen for any of us any of us at any moment when we're willing to be open and listen and release our ideas of how things have to be and accept help from the divine it is there it is ready and waiting for us and it can com and it can appear in the form of amazing synchronicities like my surfacing at the moment they were talking about my apartment love that story michael beckwith shared a story in his book of the month that we're studying this month it's called life visioning the subtitle is a transformative process for activating your unique gifts and highest potential so when we're talking about addition by subtraction one of the things that we need to subtract from our lives is judgment about ourselves judgment even about the way we meditate right because it doesn't always work it doesn't it doesn't always produce meaningful results but we continue it as a spiritual practice we're committed to it the other thing we need to subtract from our lives is judgment unforgiveness and so here is beckwith's story he tells in life visioning back in the 80s he had applied to be the pastor the minister at a church in huntington well it wasn't in huntington beach it was in orange county california and while the process was going on where they were looking for their new pastor rumors began to circulate and one of the rumors was that beckwith had never finished his ministerial studies that he wasn't truly a licensed science of mine minister which of course was false the other rumor that that happened was that you know if they hired a let's see how i'm going to read from the book here if an african-american were made senior minister this was some of the comments that were going around it would bring down property values and people would start parking on the lawn people went on to describe more negative things about beckwith in particular and negative things about african americans in general what he did he writes is he immediately went into his forgiveness practice he did not judge he did not fight but he really began to practice forgiveness toward those who had hurled these racial epithets about him and toward him and soon after that he received an invitation to attend a monthly ministerial meeting in orange county or in that area and as he was approaching the building where the meeting was happening he recognized a voice he says it was a highly respected minister in our movement and he zeroed in on what he heard the person saying and this is what he heard there's something troubling happening he nervously announced a young black man is a front-runner for the position a senior minister at one of our churches this is a travesty and we have to pray to prevent this from happening wow this is in the 80s that's not that long ago right so this experience coupled with what was happening with the selection committee made beckwith decide to withdraw his application now mind you he continued his forgiveness practices he got to the i'll read you this he got to the point where he was not angry at these people he said genuine forgiveness and unconditional love bubbled up in my heart enabling me to emerge from this experience free of blame to pursue the senior minister position at the let's see i'm sorry free of blame or scars on my spirit it became clear to me that i was not to pursue the senior minister job in orange county so he withdrew his application now the rest of the story you may well know after that what michael beckwith did is he went into a regular sustained visioning process weekly in his living room with a small group of people and out of that visioning was birthed agape center for spiritual living which is now called agape international it's a huge powerful church very diverse in the la area with 10 000 members talk about addition by subtraction let go let go of judgment of anger of unforgiveness let go of our need to focus on something like that pulpit in orange county and decide that's what i have to have and allow spirit to guide allow spirit to move in allow spirit's highest idea of our lives our communities our work life our relationships whatever it is to be made manifest so moving beyond stage two which is remember the manifesto stage what we need to do is release control which our ego doesn't always like to do i know that for sure we need to surrender and we're not beckwith reminds us we're not surrendering surrendering to some anthropomorphic you know dominating uh deity out there or up there we're surrendering to what lives within and we're surrendering to the next powerful stage of our own spiritual growth here's an affirmation beckwith offers i'm available to what wants to evolve and emerge through me you might say that with me i'm available to what wants to evolve and emerge through me and i'm willing to participate i'm willing to participate and embody and embody what it takes for me to do so beautiful so remember it's not our conscious mind in this whole process that sets our goals and sets the vision it is our super conscious mind it is that part of our mind that's connected with infinite mind because it is it's that part of our mind that relies on intuition that indwelling knowing within us that is spirit's voice whispering to us i want to end with a quote from michael beckwith's book which once again speaks to this idea i think of addition by subtraction if you're ready for the next stage if you're ready to move past that all that getting and ready to release and let go and surrender oh my talk about open to possibilities that's what happens this is what beckwith says much of our inner growth is accomplished by letting go of that which no longer serves us including habits points of view perceptions opinions whatever blocks the next stage of development spiritual growth is not about getting it's about letting i love that spiritual growth is not about getting it's about letting letting ourselves release whatever hinders clear seeing and right actions so that we can enthusiastically move forward into living our highest potential and so my friends i know that we can indeed experience addition by subtraction as we release and let go as we listen and as we follow our intuitive guidance let's go into prayer i'm going to invite anton to play some music underneath for us in this moment i recognize once again that infinite intelligence that love intelligence that permeates all of life that is the source of all of life that birthed me that birthed each one listening to this broadcast each one in this center where we're having a skeleton crew it birthed every single person on the planet and it imbued itself embodied itself as them so as raphael warnock reminded us we each are a spark of that divine one i know it's never far we can never be separate and i know that as we make sure that our own needs are met and the needs of everyone around the planet as we begin to make a world that works for everyone there is this opportunity to experience addition by subtraction there's this opportunity to be still and know to be still and be guided to be still and receive from that divine one life information vision of what the next incredible vision of our life can look like our spiritual magnificence that is what we help people do embrace our spiritual magnificence and so as we commit this week to visioning for our own lives to surrendering to letting go to looking at those things which no longer serve us i know that we are supported by that one mind and i know as we do this we stand in solidarity with everyone who's grieving the asian american pacific islander community are black and people of color communities around the world that are still experiencing the brunt of racism and discrimination and i truly know as raphael warnock spoke in our senate chambers this week that we can make a world that works for everyone we can have a democracy that is open to possibilities that works for everyone we can have a world that supports the divine spark that lives within each of us it is possible it is indeed possible and i just give thanks for my own experience this week of the reminder of the way it works when we're willing to let go of our egoic need to control and we're willing to surrender to that divine intelligence i give great thanks for this philosophy i give great thanks for the opportunity to speak this word i give thanks for everyone watching i release this word knowing that it is heard as all prayers it is answered and we say together and so it is amen back now to anton mizerak and laura berryhill with a song out of that agape community there was a time in my life i thought i had to do it all myself i didn't know the grace of god was sufficient and i didn't know the love of god was at hand but now i can say if you are discouraged struggling just to make it through another day you've got to let it go let it all go and this is what you have to say i release and i'll let go let the spirit run my life and my heart is open wide yes i'm only here for god no more struggle no more strife with my faith i see the light i am free in the spirit yes i'm only here for god i release and i'll let go i let the spirit run my life no more strife with my faith i see the light i am free in the spirit yes i'm only here for god i am free in the spirit yes i'm only here for god [Music] i don't know about you but we were clapping back here thank you anton and laura free in the spirit now is the time we talk about the spiritual practice of sacred giving this is when we get to be conscious and grateful for all the good that flows to us and we are willing to share a portion of that good to the

people with us to enjoy the um keynote address for the 25th annual exhibition of art by michigan prisoners my name is nora kranicki i am the director of the prison creative arts project and it's my pleasure to welcome you all here tonight to celebrate our first ever digital exhibition um and to hear from uh the exhibition co-founder and senior curator janie paul so uh first just a couple of housekeeping items i'm going to ask everyone during the lecture to please keep yourself on mute if you would like i've made live closed captioning available you should see an option at the bottom of your zoom window to enable that if you would like to after janie finishes her keynote address we will have an opportunity for some question and answer and conversation if you'd like to ask a question you can indicate that in the chat and we will facilitate a q a and welcome people to unmute themselves ask their question aloud if you are comfortable doing that um before we before i turn things over to janie i want to thank so many people who've made this exhibition possible this event possible um in what has been just the most difficult year uh for all of us i think is is fair to say um the 25th annual exhibition uh was meant to be hung in the gallery in ann arbor one year ago it was just days before the exhibition was meant to open that the united states shut down due to coronavirus we have held the art in the 25th annual exhibition for one year hoping that we might exhibit it in person this march which has not been possible but instead we are just overjoyed to be able to uh offer the first ever digital exhibition of art by michigan prisoners um so while it's been certainly disappointing not to be together in person it has been also just thrilling and so exciting to see the positive responses that we've gotten to the digital show to see people quite literally all over the country purchasing art enjoying art people all over the world enjoying the virtual show people from all over the world gathering at our virtual events like we are tonight um so i'm grateful that you know uh despite the many challenges we continue to face pcap is still really living its mission to bring people together across seemingly insurmountable distances so of course i want to thank all of our pcapp staff members vanessa mayeske mary heinen mcpherson fernanda pierce and graham hamilton who have really just risen to the challenge this year keeping pcap going um during a year of quarantine our curator group remains as creative innovative energetic as ever they curated the show that you can see online now and have kept their artistic energy going this year as well which has been really gratifying to see that group innovate be creative about their new projects even though we've had an unusual year at pcapp i have i hope that everyone has had a chance to view the digital exhibition i've included a link to it here on our welcoming slide and we will certainly also add that link to the chat after janie's lecture has concluded so with that um i it's my absolute pleasure to introduce our keynote speaker janie paul janie is first and foremost an artist she is the co-founder of the annual exhibition of art by michigan prisoners and its senior curator she is a professor emerita of the stamp school of art and design at the university of michigan where her teaching career included studio art classes classes in which she brought students into prison to facilitate art workshops and classes where she brought students to detroit through the detroit connections program during her career at the university janie received a u of m diversity award as well as an arthur f thurnow professorship her keynote address tonight is drawn from her forthcoming book that reflects on 25 years of the annual exhibition please join me in giving janie a warm welcome as she delivers her keynote address art in prison surviving mass incarceration thank you thank you norah hi everybody i'm just thrilled to have you all here um old and new friends and um to share with you what i've been thinking about for the past few decades doing this work with incarcerated artists now imagine that you go into a prison and you walk through the yard next and you see wonderful pieces of art um i'm going to show three pieces just initially so you get a feeling for for the artwork in case you haven't seen it so you walk into this room you're in a chapel or a classroom and art is lay down on the tables and you see next i'm saying next because nora is advancing the slides while i talk to you norah you can just go through these three okay um um so imagine that you you just walk in you see these incredible things wouldn't that be just really fantastic and that's what we get to do as curators we travel around all over michigan to all 28 prisons and um we meet with the artists we select their work we bring it back and we prepare it for exhibition in march of every year so this all started in 1996 when my husband buzz alexander and i decided to organize an exhibit of art by michigan prisoners and we had no idea what we were going to see but we were very impressed and moved that year there were um 77 works of art by 50 artists from 16 prisons and this year we're exhibiting over 800 pieces of art by over 600 artists from all 28 prisons so this project has impacted thousands and thousands of people has grown tremendously over these years now buzz and i came to this project um as educators who previously had both been involved in creating spaces where people could come together to find their humanity with each other to bring themselves out into the open mostly for various kinds of marginalized people in our society and so our concept of the for the exhibit was to make it a pedagogical as well as a curatorial project um so we instituted things that we still do today after we collect the art and it's all um processed and photographed there's a lot more than those just two words that go into all this word work um and we put the exhibition up we photograph every piece in the show including photographs of the opening reception and we make a video that's sent out to every prison where it's shown over closed circuit tv so everyone can see everyone around the state can see this work we also do other things to give feedback to the artists we um have a comment book that's very important so people can write write comments in the comment book and that is sent to the artist so we have various kinds of um events of contact where we stay in touch with the artists and they really feel like we're with them and i think the fact that we've shown up for 25 years and we haven't backed off one of the most important things here is that so many people who are incarcerated have had so many disappointments and have had people who didn't show up but this now has become an event that they can depend on that goes forward with them so the goals of our exhibition one is to support the artists and give them ongoing validation for their artistic and their personal growth two is to create a community that bridges the walls and three is to provide an opportunity for people for people in the public viewers to see this art and appreciate the humanity of people who are living in prison uh hopefully being a first step toward ending mass incarceration now you can go to the next slide nora i'm going to i know this looks like what are we talking about here but i'm going to um touch on some um basic dynamics that underlie um this exhibition that relate to childhood and you'll see my point in a couple of minutes so when a very young child is with its mother uh very young um there's really no differentiation between the baby and the mother and you can see here this guatemalan woman is holding her baby close while she sorts coffee beans um and um there's a progressive individuation of that little child which is a strain there's a you know it's not easy so next slide um the child um usually has i just couldn't see that image for a minute the child usually has uh that transitional object the blanket or the stuffed animal something that's so important and the psychiatrist donald winnicott called that the transitional object which is a way that the child transitions uh into the outer world and then next slide um the other dynamic that's so important is mirroring here you can see this wonderful image of the father and the baby looking at each other and um the baby is seeing himself reflected in the father's eyes and able to feel his true self as the father looks to him so obviously not all parenting is is perfect and many children grow up without this but the reason why i mention this is because in teaching art to both children and adults i realize that these concepts are very important next um when children make art and particularly three-dimensional objects if they haven't had a good background if they've been lacking in some emotional support this object als often becomes a very important kind of transitional object and some children that i worked with um ended up carrying these objects around with them and they've just become incredibly attached to them next the other thing i realized is that the whole show the whole exhibit project is kind of a way of mirroring um it's a way of people of of the artists inside being recognized we see them and they are seen they're seen as valuable people and a lot of people didn't have that mirroring experience as children and so this is a really big dose of that for people so okay let's go on now we're going to look at some images of incarceration by some of the artists and what i'm going to do is i'm going to read you some quotes for what they say about their work so this work is by brian picken an artist who's out now and um he says i created this piece to express my thoughts about transitioning into prison about the bleakness of advancing through the system about being caged deprived of the right to humanity and being restricted to a forgotten section of nothingness it's a very surreal a very traumatic experience next carmen valentine says the arrow has been shot from the back and come through the front i was abused and betrayed and so that is why the arrow was coming from the back i'm touching the arrow because the pain is my constant companion i lived with it before i came into prison and i lived with it now next alvin smith says as an incarcerated african-american male and having been on the inside for over 25 20 years it would be easy for me to be a conduit for hate and blame but those things steal not only from my ability to cope but my ability to create at all and so i composed this piece entitled evolution of inequity to point out how this incarceration system was derived from this history of black americans however this same incarceration system now affects all in the same way and can you see the image you can tell the connection between slavery and incarceration um so an interesting thing about people who go into prisons me and my colleagues and people around the country that i know who do arts work or other kind of work we're often asked why do we do this and i know that most of us feel oddly rejuvenated and good after these visits um we feel bad of course that we're leaving and the people inside are staying we feel bad about the suffering and people talking with people who are in prison for life or for 40 years but when we leave the rejuvenation comes from a few different things one is of course that we're meeting very wise intelligent people who've had a lot of time to reflect and we've had wonderful conversations and we value them but there's something else that i've realized recently that i just have been able to put into words recently and what it is is that it feels better to engage with what i see as the nexus of our core american problem than to ignore it and pretend it isn't there prison is really at the heart of our country's cruelty because the origin story of our country the dec the declaration of liberty and justice for all men actually excluded anyone who was not a white man with property over the next centuries these exclusions supported the cruelty of the indian wars slavery jim crow the exploitation of chinese workers and poorer european immigrants the japanese internments the new jim crow and now recently the migrants at the border but over this reality has been drawn available illusions that's the myth of normalcy the pursuit of happiness and the exceptionalism of our country this dominant white culture tells the history of our country without these atrocities or is a whitewashed or erroneous version our particular form of incarceration of course was formed during slavery and the black codes and jim crow so it is a system of racism but it has drawn poor people mentally ill people and various kinds of marginalized people into its net so prisoners are actually the people who understand this lie uh the best they face it every day excluded from the ability to vote to lead a healthy life and to be subjected to arbitrary and physical violence so for me it feels good to be with the people who know what this lie is and who are resisting it every day um by calling what they did being at the feeling [Music] that art is a form of longing is a form of expressing longing of all of the unmet needs that prisoners have some people say oh well you know they get fed and they get clothed and they you know have a roof over the head but the most important human needs are not being met so i'm just going to show you how i feel um incarcerated artists are resisting by embodying these needs that go unmet in prison so artists resist displacement with images of home belonging and community next resist being anonymous with images of themselves and their heritage next you see oprah with all of her forebears inside next let's resist apathy with critiques of our culture next artists resist being undervalued by becoming fully dedicated to their craft and to learning new skills this artist drew 16 hours a day from beginning from knowing nothing about drawing to producing works like this next they resist despair with images of faith next next artist resists separation with images of love and affection next they resist tedium with humor and wild imaginings next next in resistance to scarcity artists retain fond memories in great detail to nourish themselves just a note here this artist when he paints those little people in this great family reunion he paints them naked and then he puts their clothes on them and it's just a wonderful kind of process i think of the actual construction of these these people and these things that he's remembering next so let me just get my notes up again um so how does all this wonderful art come about well there are there are a few layers of reasons why people made art in prison so just so you know those of you who aren't familiar with this people are making art in prisons all over the country and perhaps the world i just don't know for sure but even without people going in to help people make art there has been a tradition of art making in prisons for generations and um there are traditions that are handed down that are taught there's a lot of learning going on in prisons and for the most part people are very generous with their learning so the first reason why people make art in prison is economic art making is one of or is the legal way to make money in prison there are a lot of illegal ways to make money in prison the problem is is that people who have jobs and most people but not all people have jobs make hardly any money for example someone who's a porter that is who cleans might make eight to ten dollars a week um the higher paying jobs like a law librarian or a clerk might make seventy or eighty dollars a month um but our with art um for example card making is one of the biggest genres going on with cards people can make cards and sell them for anywhere from two dollars to twenty dollars and if a person is really good they when holidays come around they can stock up and make you know many many cards and sell them all and make hundreds of dollars actually so and here you see eddie medrano made the card on the left which has a kind of standard uh imagery that's used in tattooing and in um card making row the rose very nicely done and then the one on the right is by an artist named rick who makes a lot of cards for his friends outside and he made this one for my husband buzz so next so next we will look at the other traditional genre which is tattooing and i don't have a slide of um i don't have an image of an arm or a back with a tattoo but this is a really marvelous example of a drawing that's done with tattoo imagery it includes the kind of celtic designs and i i feel like it has just this great energy radiating out of the heart of the christ figure next the third money-making um uh art form is portraits um people learn to make portraits and they practice their skill and like this one do them very really realistically with great shading and uh they send these portraits so the way it works is that you might have a portrait a little picture of your daughter your son or whoever it is and you bring it to me i'm the artist and i make a drawing from that portrait and then you can send it home um and i once asked one of our artists king hood why did why did he think people wanted to see a drawing rather than a photograph of a loved one and he said it's because they want to see that you see something in that person that they also see of value so i thought that was really interesting interestingly if you think about all of these three art forms they all have to do with a connection to people um cards are meant to send home to loved ones tattooing is really a way of being identified with a group of feeling like you belong um with a specific group an identification and also has uh uses symbols that have meaning and portraits are also sent home to loved ones so all of these forms are about connection to people next the other um the other oh this is another example of a photograph of a drawing from a photograph where you can see how definitely it was done from a photograph and what a happy thing it would be to receive that drawing of the family so next um the other really big thing in prison is making three-dimensional craft objects um these are also sold and sent home this is a jewelry box that opens up and has lots of little drawers um where jewels can go and there's all kinds of things there's crocheted handbags and ipad covers and uh you know teddy bears and all kinds of things and there are um what do you call the thing you put money in piggy bank piggy banks in the form of houses and it's that's a big market too um so so now you can picture that there's this very active art market going on in prisons almost every day but especially around our holidays um and because the market competition and the traditional genres of prison art is so intense individual artists are motivated to become highly skilled so they can be the ones that get the work and when i asked artist robert fitzner why there is such a high skill level among the artists this is what he said he said there's so many artists and hustlers in here all at different levels and the one distinction is their quality of work the only true currency we have in here is what we can do best whatever that may be and what we do better than others is what gives us that competitive edge and when i asked danny valentine uh why he thought the rules were sometimes bent for artists because this is true artists receive a lot of respect and prestige in prison both from inmates and from some of the guards not all of them but he said um he said in answer to my question everyone loves art the most violent gang banger the hustler the strictest guard everyone because it's a human expression they admire it and most want it okay next um i'm going to read you a quote from susan brown who does her work with beads thousands of little beads and she also makes jewelry that she sells and here she describes her financial situation and her art in prison i make and sell beaded jewelry to sustain myself in here and i work with beads in two and three dimensions to make my art if i don't want to sell jewelry to a particular person i raise the price i sell bracelets for as low as 150 though i don't like to the most expensive is about 125 dollars i have respect here and can count on my sales if i keep to my budget i can eat as i want and save my money for phone calls and beads i don't go to ciao i spend two dollars a day for food at the store a month's worth of food is 60 so i have to make that much from my jewelry to or other bead work for breakfast i have a cereal bar and coffee for lunch i have ramen noodles with cheese and beans for dinner i have mackerel if i want to splurge i don't eat for one day and i save four dollars and then i have bacon on a tortilla sheet with rice so there's a very graphic example of how how art and money are connected in prisons but now let's look at the deeper emotional uh reasons why people make art okay next um so since prehistory the arts have given shape to meaning visual artists who use pictorial subject matter exercise a very basic human need to abstract to grasp the essential qualities characteristics of things and phenomena in the world next to choose and make just the right marks that create the energy and essence of a horse a tree a sun a human jester is incredible and uniquely human next non-representational abstract images also give shape to qualities and emotions because all visual elements come from the world we live in and resonate with our experiences next now i want to talk a little bit more about this idea of shaping because all of us shape our environment and our time in ways we organize our bureaus and our side tables our bedside tables our tool chests our gardens we're always creating designs with form and we do that with time as well how we organize our our time and our rituals um john dewey wrote in in our wrote an art experience about uh an essential aspect of this he said we have an experience when we feel it run its course when it has a beginning middle and end a good conversation a good meal a good walk through the woods is remembered and me as meaningful and whole it has a shape and artist win saturday explains how this worked for him through art art was the first thing i could find in my life that upon completion an instant i had instant satisfaction when i sign the canvas i can feel satisfaction i can feel a form of journey of a journey coming to an end very few encounters in life ever gave me that but art did when activities are done mindlessly when experience or experiences are disjointed and lack specificity and texture life can go by with little satisfaction in prison time and space have no meaningful shape because order is only imposed by rules and restrictions not by personal choice but art is not only about shaping it's a sustained process of making decisions which is a kind of liberty in prison decisions one after another about materials and marks textures colors shapes and surfaces a person can choose to be slow and methodical or fast and spontaneous next slide um you get can you go to the next one okay you get sustenance from the smallest things a leaf that blows into the yard birds squirrels pet mice you see this guy with his pet mice can you see that this is a guy who actually trains mice and builds them these little cages out of foul and little toys out of found materials um you have to look inside yourself to experience uh for experiences that have shape and meaning one man told me there is no middle ground here you're either moving forward or going back and being an artist is one of the best ways of moving forward because you can create an internal space for yourself for growth and freedom next so i'm reading now from a chapter in my book um the urge to create meaning to have a sense of order and form to exert control and to discover new parts of our of oneself drives people to create a momentary yet solid world of the imagination fitting together marks forms colors stories and images offers a sense of understanding of worth and value of things being just right which of course is rare in prison artists may use carefully honed skills and techniques or they may work in a flash of intuition for all of them it is the single experience they have of being fully themselves incarcerated people make their art in small crowded rooms often with other people around they must learn to cultivate an intense relationship with their work in order to sustain the be of being the feeling of being an intimate relationship to something that matters once an artist makes the first mark or makes the first move on a piece of wood or soap or plaster she engages in an ongoing interaction with the art object responses to the physical result of these interactions can be a range of feelings such as joy anger curiosity frustration or contentment this process affords a continuing a continuous range of emotional states that are entirely private sometimes conscious sometimes unconscious flowing in and around the artist and this is intensely satisfying the art object begins as the recipient of the artist's actions and gradually takes on a separate identity that eventually says i am done this vital back and forth of action and response is a way of being in true and intimate relationship something that is rare among humans living in prison this precious process and relationship to the art object is directly opposite from the ways in which incarcerated people are treated as objects to be moved around literally held in cages when they are transferred between prisons and in innumerable other humiliating ways in the art process the artist is the creator making a precious object that is imbued with meaning next if the project of being a person is to evolve into more humanness to open up increasingly more inner resources more knowledge more experience than it is to look forward towards the future in john berger's novel a painter for our time janos the painter says there is something even more fundamental than sex or work the great universal human need to look forward take the future away from a man and you have done something worse than killing him to see only more and more of the same institutionalized life as you head into the future is agonizing this is the ultimate punishment for prisoners particularly those serving long or life sentences and so prison artists develop a practice in which one work of art leads to another pointing them towards a path of endlessly unfolding possibilities an enduring if momentary feeling of being grounded in the world next i'm going to now read you a passage um from something that oligar murko wrote to me uh oligar is the one that did this painting you're looking at and i'm going to be showing you two paintings as i read his passage i thought when i came into prison i was angry that i wasn't treated fairly because i didn't shoot the gun my friend did i was justifying myself as years went by i realized i could have stopped it but i was a prisoner of my ego i realized i was guilty but now i'm free i have nothing to prove no ego i realize the smallest conflict can result in a violent situation it takes two to escalate so you just walk away a guy got his tv stolen and got angry and wanted to get into a fight and i said just don't go after him just read a book i stay all out of all that people leave me alone i just think about art you can go to the next uh painting i've changed so much as a person i was totally hopeless drifting with no direction it's ironic that i had to make a bad decision and come to prison to change for the better i have paroleable life it really shakes you up to get that sentence i started thinking more in depth analyzing myself becoming better and when i discovered art everything opened up now i paint for three or four hours a day and don't even want to stop even if it's chow time and i don't want to go but have to go through art i started centering myself it's a real second life more than an escape and so this is me now this is something that i've seen with a variety of people over the last 25 years that i've had the opportunity to be with people for decades and i see that as meaning in their work grows and develops that also happens in their life and they can live differently in prison just as oligarch described and when they get out um now i'm going to talk about the exhibitions a little bit and we'll just stay on the same uh beautiful painting um the exhibition really extends unconditional kindness to people in prison which is in opposition to the criminal justice system which focuses on the worst part of every person and whether or not they deserve kindness is totally irrelevant to us we don't ever ask people what their crimes are we don't want to know why should you know we know that about them they don't know what the worst thing is about us and we want to make this a totally equal situation plus we want to meet face to face as humans to build on our common humanity humanity um i i do think that one of the best things that we've done as i said before i think is that we've shown up every year for 25 years and it's embedded in their lives and we can go forward with them into the future which as i've just explained is a as a very important feeling and that we um are as i described before with the concept of mirroring that we're basically mirroring back to them and saying you have value um we know you know we know we may not know really who you are but we know this part of you um and um something that goes along with it is what i think of as naming which is a really important part of the curatorial process which is really an educational thing um it's related to the mirroring idea that when i'm looking at a piece of art by somebody particularly somebody in prison i name what i'm seeing um i'll say um you know i see that you've really done a lot of shading here or that you really have used these colors in this way to say back to them what they have done but they maybe can't articulate for themselves and especially it's this is especially important for people whose work we don't take and most of those are beginners because when i say well we've decided not to take your work but i want to talk about it a little bit and i see that you've really worked hard at this you know whatever it is line shading color um and we really and i really appreciate this it just whatever reason you know i go into why we're not taking it but by the end of the conversation that you the person is usually very excited because of how i have talked to them and have reflected back who they are which turns out to be equally as important as as being in the show that year and and hopefully they'll be in the show the next year um another thing i've thought about a lot is that the exhibition is really uh two uh two cultures coming together which is a wonderful thing and also can be hard to negotiate because there's the culture of art in prison which has its own [Music] customs and traditions and values and then there's the culture of pcap and the artists who are curators and what our backgrounds are and so um we um from the beginning could see that it was a very tight you know it was a what do you call it a tightrope balancing act um we wanted to respect the traditions that were going on in prison but some of those traditions became stereotyped and not original so we tried to find ways to help people expand on those traditions but we also wanted people to open up their minds about what other kinds of art could be done and you see this negotiation of the two cultures in the selection visits for example the cure we may be looking at a person's work and um we've decided to take a piece that was done in less time than another piece and the artist will say well why are you taking this one you know i spent like 20 hours on this one and then we'll need to explain what we see of value and the one that we're taking but also explain what we see in the value of the other one and you know we're not always right sometimes you know i remember a time when this exact same scenario happened and then somebody else came over to the another curator went to that curator and said but you know that person just really has so much invested on that in that piece i think we should take it but you see what i'm saying there are different values that are coming together and the reason why it's great that we have time to talk with each other at the facilities is that so that we can talk this all through um now um i love going into these prisons and seeing the work because i'm an artist and most of what i do is drawing and painting and i can really relate uh because most of the work we're seeing is drawing and painting and i'm very interesting interested in the techniques and the formal qualities as well as the uh content of the works and so i began reflecting on the question of is there an aesthetic to prison art how or not are how do the circumstances of isolation and confinement take on special meaning uh the need to assert one's identity the urgency to create meaning to these influence the work itself how does living in prison into you know affect individual mark making brush strokes etc how are incarcerated artists both distinctive because they're living in prison and also like just like artists in the world so i've um i have a chapter in the book that's divided up into different sections about different kinds of work and i'll just talk about a few of them but the first thing is um excuse me i have to get a cough stroke um is about visual language and you can go to the next slide um so a friend a colleague of mine who's a painter and i we're looking at this uh drawing by wayne farren everything on the table and he was saying this is so poignant it's about his addiction and we agreed that the poignancy came from the not only the content but the choices that he made about how to make the drawing all of the objects on the table are not touching they're all the different symbols objects of addiction but above him is a painting that he made up of this cupcake which is so to look so delicious and is so joyous and he um in that painting all the forms are touching each other and are bumping up against each other he also developed a distinctive way of creating form if you notice every form in the piece is outlined and then colored in and that was his own way of develop one part of his visual language he also made the drawing in uh orange and blue which are the colors of prison uniforms his his uh gaze is very poignant looking at us so this artist clearly didn't spend years studying anatomy doesn't have formal training but the fact that he's developed a visual language really makes his work stand out it doesn't matter how much training somebody has the value of a piece of art is whether somebody has invested in it and developed their own kind of visual language so particularly in prison this is so important because it means i have a unique language for myself this is me i'm here i'm real uh next so here's an artist billy brown i know a couple of you have pieces by him um who developed this incredible way of drawing and his story is that he was trying to learn conventional drawing techniques from someone and he just couldn't get it and the guy said well billy you're just gonna have to you know create something of your own and so he said he prayed and he had a vision and it just came to him and he started drawing with colored paper on with colored pencils i'm sorry on construction paper and his technique which is incredibly disciplined is to make each mark to press more at the beginning of the mark that the end of the mark so that you can see the color of the construction paper coming through and it looks like embroidery this is an incredibly unique visual language that he developed with such motion and grace next another characteristic of a lot of the work done in prisons is intense labor workmanship perfection and detail this is a painting by scott fabian and he did incredibly detailed paintings of wildlife and that background color he said was made up of ten washes um laid one over another to give this incredibly sort of vibrant gray next and three-dimensional work um there's also incredible detail um these two pieces by samantha bachchinsky uh are the result of her learning how to crochet in prison she started out not knowing anything and then she um used patterns and then she went off on her own and she made this beautiful wedding dress which is very poignant because she's a lifer and she said that she will never get married or she doesn't think she will she might um so she wanted to make this wedding dress and then the motorcycle she made without knowing anything about motorcycles she researched all the parts she made each part crocheted each one and then put them together so people say a lot well people have so much time they can do this kind of thing and that is really true it's a way to take up time but it's also in a deeper sense a way to enter into a sort of deeper psychic state next um one of the most sort of amazing experiences for two-dimensional artists is to learn how to shade and you can if you think back all of the genres the card making the tattooing and the portraits all involve learning how to shade that is using tones that go from light to dark this kevin babcock piece on the left i couldn't help but compare to this lithograph by grant wood they're so similar um the thing about shading there's nothing more miraculous in a way for a beginning artist than to use charcoal or pencil and with just the the the the mark making to make something that looks real to make something that's round and that comes into being and there's nothing more miraculous than actually me bringing light into being especially in such a dark place as prison okay next um and this one kevin wietz man's best friend is a different way of creating light and dark just by these tiny little marks that he made that follow the contour of the dog's body and really brings out i think the feeling of his love for his dog next here's another comparison also i couldn't help but compare dan mullen's painting on the left with this hopper painting both of them have this feel of this kind of lonely american scene but i wanted to include this because of the importance of texture texture it's in light and shade is intimately connected connected to texture because light can only be created with the physical reality of touching the paper and texture is super important for artists in prison because there is no really inviting textures in their world in the outside world we have really valuable endearing textures all around us that have deep stories and histories but in prison it's all concrete and plastic and steel whatever but it's not there's no deep meaning to any of the textures so texture is extremely important in both two and three-dimensional work um next so the other thing i wanted to talk about is three-dimensional work which is really where you see a lot of the ingenuity coming from artists anything that can be picked up can be used for art people use um toilet paper glue cardboard bottle caps dental floss anything um and uh i'm going to show you a few examples of really wonderful 3d work but before that i just wanted to tell you my thoughts about why miniatures are so endearing to us so many people like little objects and uh the anthropologist claude levy strauss wrote in one of his books about miniaturization and said that in the real life we we perceive parts and then we perceive holes but when we look at miniatures we see the whole and then we see the parts so it's a very pleasurable way of taking something in it's a kind of and it's also a kind of cherishing and being uh with loved things and experiences um so this deer uh may not be automatically perfect but uh anatomically perfect but the artist really captured some of the animals essential features and he made it out of toilet paper glue and acrylic paint um next danny valentine was in solitary confinement and this made this four and a half foot wide mermaid out of toilet paper and glue working at night in the dark by feel when it was dry he painted it black and then dusted over it with a light coat of silver using a watercolor mop brush to give it the look of pewter he was in segregation and some of the guards didn't want him to be working on it which is why he was working on it at night and um eventually a lieutenant came along that actually appreciated it and he was able to keep working on it next um kenneth mariner makes his tank creations out of cardboard old folders thread blue tissue acrylic paint these aren't sort of his evocations of old of what he remembers from old world war ii stock footage um depicting bombed out remains so these are just three examples but they're really the the the way people use materials is incredibly ingenious okay next now i'm going to conclude with just a couple of few thoughts about why how we're connected to people in prison and why our connection is so important so the writer john berger looks in in one of his essays called meanwhile writes that he looks for a landmark with which to make sense of our particular time in history and he says the landmark i've found is that of prison nothing less across the planet we're living in a prison and what he means is that we're all under surveillance and under the domination of the of the global market forces that are now so ex-territorial that they have no connection to what's going on in the ground they're perpetually remote i never have to take into account the results of their actions and so they're free from their actions but they become because of that because they become anesthetic anesthetized so our own forces of resistance have to be local and on the ground so what we can see for one thing is that we're all people in prison and ourselves are all on a common spectrum they are at the extreme end and i and many of us here are at another end where we're pretty comfortable in our lives and yet we can feel those dominating forces in the air and in the and in our daily lives um so the danger is that we're always that we're always in danger of becoming objects in somebody else's world rather than subjects in our own world and this is where i think that we can gain insight and courage from the artists in prisons we can look to them for inspiration for strength and resourcefulness and for models of resistance and i think it's incredibly important that we include them in our forward movement and to learn from them about resilience and about this tremendous strength that art can bring to human life thank you that's it hey thank you janie that was just an incredible enlightening lecture i i know i asked everyone to mute themselves before but i'm going to ask if you want to unmute yourself and join me in giving jamie just a hearty round of applause it's well deserved thank you so much for having us it's not wonderful thank you so wonderful to see you all now great so we have time for you yeah we have time for some questions in conversation yeah i'm happy to stay as long as anybody wants to stay other people can go whenever they want so if you'd like to ask a question oh yes um if you have a comment or would like to ask a question um you can just type your name in the chat and we'll shine a light on you you're welcome to unmute yourself and and ask your question it takes a while to think of you know um michael hello can you hear me yes we can now jamie i was in i taught economics for a long time i was intrigued about what you said about the market as it were inside the prisons you said that you were talking about a woman who didn't have to eat so she could save money well she did eat but she bought from the store because she didn't like the food in the chow hall and the only time when she didn't eat was when she wanted to save up enough money so she could buy the thing that was more expensive from the store the next day so they have there is a towel if they want it oh yeah there's a chow hall where everybody eats regularly they all line up for ciao and they go in at specific times so the food isn't very good so some people choose to eat food from the store which is actually only open every two weeks and then the other question to follow up is do the materials that they use do they how do they get them do they ask their friends to bring them in no i don't know yeah i should have addressed that they have to buy their own materials nothing's provided for them they can order material the only way they can get materials is by ordering them from approved vendors like dick blick or nasco it's a good question i don't know how they pay them martin would know i don't know how it's actually paid but they have money in their accounts from whatever source they have money and they um yeah i'm not sure what the actual i'm sure there's a there's a there's a system that's worked out i don't know what it is very interesting thank you patricia would you like to ask a question hello you gotta unmute yourself i am a muted i didn't know anybody was caught i don't know what the system is but anyway janie yes i know that you have written about the ways in which artists improve their skill and how some of the more experienced artists are teaching the younger or the more of the least experienced artists could you talk a little bit about how all this skill building takes place in an otherwise pretty inhumane place yeah there is a lot of learning going on and a lot of mentoring i what i've seen is that as people gain skill themselves they often want to share those skills with people and i think it's probably because they haven't had the opportunity to do something like that before because it is very pleasurable and satisfying to be able to transfer your knowledge to someone else so people will often sort of connect with a mentor who will teach them other there have been times in some of the prisons where um a couple of the inmates have been able to start a class with the approval of the staff and they get materials from the inmate benefit fund there are groups of artists that kind of teach each other um there's a great pair that i write about in my book wins saturday and doug pinson where doug pinson's walking around with an envelope that he decorated and wins out early says oh that looks great are you making art and he said oh no i'm not and he encourages him every time he sees him and then he finally buys the materials for doug and doug starts to paint like things and draw things like he sees on the yard like the traditional roses and things and wind says oh you don't have to do that just do what's in your head so this guy is really the opposite of the tradition the traditional skill builder but he encourages doug who then does some very expressive paintings but on the skill building uh people just you know like that remember the the cell scene and pencil of the guy standing in this looking out of the cell he really taught himself um a guard actually this happens occasion very occasionally a guard came by and told him about perspective because he had taken a drawing class but otherwise it's just informal gathering in the rec room or wherever it is and literally sitting next to somebody and and having eddie medrano described how he would have somebody sit next to him and watch him draw and then he said if he saw the glint in the guy's eyes that meant he really wanted to learn and that showed him and then he would you know he would start teaching him but yeah it was something that when i started doing my research i really was impressed with is how much learning and caring there is so we've had a couple of questions in the chat about how you got started doing this work would you like to talk to that question sure um before i began doing prison work i lived in new york and i worked in a couple of situations where i i worked with um children and adult i taught at parsons school of design but i um at the brooklyn museum and in this and as an artist in residence with the studio in the school program i worked in very poor areas of new york in public schools and worked with children there and training teachers and so i also taught in various community centers to adults who were living in underserved areas so i was pretty committed to that as a general thing in my life and um then i met buzz alexander we met at the blue mountain center in in the adirondacks and he was doing this work he founded pcapp in 1990 with a theater workshop pcapp then sort of started unofficially and i moved to ann arbor to teach at the university of michigan and also to be with him and i started he was doing theater and writing workshops and prisons and i started doing an art workshop at a men's facility and then women's facility and when i moved buzz had buzz had a really deep appreciation of visual art even though he was a um english professor and when i moved he said well now you're here we can do an exhibit and so we decided to to do that i had been in south africa the year before i moved and i was very um moved by you know affected by seeing the effects of apartheid and meeting some people who had been political prisoners and when i came back i my i feel like what happened was my focus on um systemic racism was just really sharpened by that visit to south africa and i started thinking about going into prisons and then i met buzz so that was a very fortuitous thing that happened um phyllis do you have a question you can unmute yourself uh actually janie just answered it i was trying to remember whether you had taught art in the prisons and does that is that still part of pcap at this point oh yeah it's a big part of pcapp um we have lots and lots of workshops going on um and prisons in theater writing um visual art it's a whole separate thing from the exhibit pcapp has several big projects and that's one of them and this is one of them yeah i guess i had always assumed that the art exhibit came from the cl art classes but not really it doesn't really know i mean we don't have as many visual art workshops as we do in the other fields we just don't have as many people doing them um in the beginning i was teaching a class in which my students did art workshops and prisons and so uh there were a few people from those classes but no mostly not it's mostly their people are just learning on their own thanks megan would you like to ask a question thank you um thank you for that wonderful lecture and i guess i wanted to know whether there are certain subjects that are not um permitted um and then also whether there's oversight of the people when they're making visual art and then whether this can vary from facility to facility yeah okay you're gonna have to remind me of what the first question was the first part was um whether they're subjects oh yeah um we we have very uh i've never known of yeah well yes i do know i was going to say i've never known of someone being censored while they were making art but i do know one artist that was censored because he was doing a painting of how some guards put him in the hole and they didn't like that and they they destroyed the painting uh that doesn't happen all that often um in terms of our exhibit we do have to send all of the images before we have the exhibit to the michigan department of corrections and we had a meeting with them where we agreed on what kinds of subject matters would be censored one of them is showing violence or hatred of officers or staff um then the other is some sexual they're pretty lenient about um sexuality but i think we can't show like naked breasts or yeah certain things but it there they haven't been that bad out of 800 and something pieces maybe there's two or three and then we just put them in the bins rather than on the wall and we don't put them in the video um that can somehow somewhat uh vary from facility to facility you know in terms of artists work but they're not there's really not much oversight of the visual artists it's seen as a pretty safe thing for people to do and it is i mean for the most part artists don't cause trouble from a security point of view um the staff are generally happy that people are making art because they're not making trouble and they're right thank you lisa would you like to ask a question yeah i janey it was it was so wonderful too oh thank you it's incredible um um but i'm just wondering like some of the things that you said the prisoners said were so insightful and beautiful i mean do you do you know do you have sessions where you talk to them about their work or i'm i'm not going did that happen you mean where well i just you know how did you get all these quotes and do do they get together and talk about it or it's because of the writing of my book which i started several years ago in the first year that i did the book i went around and interviewed i got permission to go into prisons and interview artists and i couldn't record i just had to go in with a paper you know legal pad and pencil and scribble as fast as i could um so we had you know hour-long interviews um which were permitted and then i came back and i wrote up the notes and i you know kind of edited them and i also sent out a survey to artists to like 200 artists that i knew and they sent them back with a lot of writing and then it was sort of an iterative process and a lot of my ideas have happened really in dialogue with the artists we i corresponded quite a bit with some of the artists and i would ask them questions about what they had said in the interview or what they had said in the in the survey response and you know with some of them i just um carried on correspondence for years and um you know i would test out my ideas too i'd say what do you think of this thing i'm thinking about and they would write back interesting i feel like you've really opened a window for me because i have no experience with this population at all and it's so interesting and it's just fascinating so i really want to get your book i can't wait oh thank you i'm really glad you came yeah me too it's wonderful um shawnee you've put a few questions in the chat would you like to unmute yourself and ask your questions maybe they're not able to um leah would you like to ask a question hi janie that was that was really beautiful i i just treasured that and i'm really looking forward to it it was recorded right yes okay that's wonderful because i want to share it with other people i have a question about what happens in the prisons among the artists do they have any opportunity to share their work with each other outside of doing like getting into this exhibit or or participating in some of the training or are they just isolated from each other it depends on what level they're in so i didn't talk at all about levels but if they're in level four they can't they don't have that's a high level they don't have much access to other people in the lower levels one and two people are in the yard and in the rec room and um that's where a lot of conversation about art takes place um and i heard a story by a couple of young men they were both in um i forget what you call them but eight person cubes like eight people in four bunk beds and there was a hallway in between them and then they were in you know and they would hold up their work to each other and then they would meet sometimes um and they would go out into the yard and they they had a competition going and saying man you know you got to do this and i yeah i'm doing this and you know they come back in and they'd hold their work up but people do i've heard stories about people gathering in the yard or in the recreation room and and talking and giving um giving advice and feedback yeah that goes on quite a bit but as i say it depends on how much access you have to other people uh there's a really nice story it's not about exactly what you're talking about but one artist um like to do his work in the rec room which is you know a lot of people they're playing poker and they're playing chess and they're drawing and getting their hair cut and um he had a spot at a table and he had people that liked to be around him and watch him and he said people would make comments like if he was doing a painting of a of a farm and he'd never been on a farm some guy from a farm in michigan would say no man you know you you've got the well over here it shouldn't be there you know and you got to put the thing over here and you know it became this whole group effort and when the painting went off you know when it when it went off to the exhibition everybody be like yeah i i gave him the advice on the well you know i told him about this or that so you know there's some nice exchange go that goes on um fran had put a question in the chat about how many prisons are there how does the art get to us do you want to talk a little bit about the art selection process jamie yeah well currently in michigan i think they're 28 prisons right nora i believe so yes yeah there when we started there were 40 actually so a lot of them have been consolidated or you know just ended um so what what was the question um how the art gets to us so there's only one women's prison which is right near us half an hour away and then all the rest are men's prisons which are in both peninsulas of michigan um we go around to the all the prisons we don't each go to every prison although graham our coordinator goes to almost all of them but um we now have eight curators so we split up and we do but we do some of us go to every prison where we select the art and we physically bring it back and we have a studio space on campus where we store all the work um and um what was the other question um do you want to talk just about what a selection visit looks like perhaps oh yeah so the selection visits are really like the heart of the project and they last from two to three hours usually depending on how many people are there and so what we do is we walk in and they'll be say maybe they're 50 say they're 15 people um and the first hour is a kind of very unusual thing for prisons we get to sort of walk around look at the art and talk to each other and mingle in a way that is totally not uh doesn't happen it's like the only time that this happens in prison so it's a really great opportunity for the artist not only to talk with us but to actually walk around and see each other's work because they're only seeing the work that's in their own housing unit so they get to walk around and this is a great time for people to gather and so that first hour we try to make sure we see all the work and talk to everybody and then the second phase people go into the artists go into a different space and we as the curator group go around to every artist's work and make our selections and at this point we have so many artists that we can only take up to two pieces from each person so we make our selections and there's a lot of discussion that goes on should we take this one or that one or whatever and then um the artist what we do in the third phase is we call each artist in individually and those of us who have an art background or feel we can give the feedback to the artist do so so we might have say three conversations going on in the room i'm talking to this artist charlie's talking to that artist graham's talking to that artist and that's where we say this this is what we've chosen and then we have a conversation about the work we've already had a conversation probably in the first hour but we can continue that they can ask questions i sometimes with very experienced artists particularly we ask them to choose if we're having a hard time we also ask some of the experienced artists to join us in our curatorial process yeah that's what happens during this election visit so it's it's very intense because we only you know we're on the clock you know we have an hour for this phase and we have to make sure you know there could be 50 people in there um so that's a lot of talking um so we're at 8 30 so i wanted to invite someone to ask a final question um or you know indicate in the chat and then unmute yourself um if there's someone who'd like to to take advantage of that that opportunity [Music] dylan you must have a question no no question i just want to ask you when's the book coming out i don't know i don't have a publisher yet i gotta say i was struck tonight by the idea that a lot of your work is reflective you know the idea that that you open yourself as much as you ask others to show themselves and i was struck by that i find that beautiful and i thought yeah that's a great comment graham thank you yeah the whole thing about mirroring exactly yeah that you that you're you're as open as you ask others to be of themselves and you remain that way as you express your thoughts about their art and i i found that really beautiful yeah yeah i think that that's um something that buzz did too i think that that is the that's it's a way to really make the situation equal and to have people being able to express themselves too i think i'm going to exercise my director's prerogative to ask a final question then um janie i'm wondering if in the spirit of reflection how has doing this work for 25 years changed you what have been your most important transformations as a person as an artist yeah in a number of ways as a person when i first began this work i thought i i kept saying oh this is so much work it's so time consuming it's taking away from my own art practice um and as i got further into it and at some point i just realized that this was my work and um my art practice is my art practice and i don't do as much art as other people who only do their art practice but it stopped being a conflict for me and and partly it was because i felt like my own art practice was deeply ins affected by the work i was seeing in prisons so for example um a lot of the work is really detailed and and i found myself really drawn to very detailed drawings with lots of mark making and it reminded me that when i was young i used to do that kind of work and then i had gotten away from it so i started doing that kind of work and it changed my feeling about time i stopped feeling like i have to you know well i didn't really feel this way but i i didn't care how long it took i really got into that kind of laborious time consuming detailed work and found it very satisfying and i think i felt the connection with the artists doing that kind of work so it really and now i'm not really doing that kind of work but i still feel like overall it just brought me more and it gave me more access to my authentic self what i want to be doing in my artwork and what i want to you know be doing in my life too but in my artwork i think more of an ability to um get to that and um yeah it also widened my think my thinking about who my audience is is that these hundreds of people in prison are are partly you know the audience in my head as well as people in the art world externally and you know what i said in the beginning about you know feeling like i was seeing the missing pieces in our culture that's another way i feel like i've been affected by this work is just feeling more grounded it and i know that there's so many other people who do the same who probably feel the same kind of thing even if you're seeing a lot of suffering as a way that you feel more grounded to be having this wider vision of what our country really is well i think that's an absolutely beautiful note to end on and please everyone join me again in thanking janie for a really inspiring transformative enlightening lecture um thank you so much i'm so privileged to do thank you well done and when will you post the recording i should be able to do it tomorrow so that this the recording of this uh keynote will be on the uh digital show website and i'll also plan to send a link out to everyone who had registered for the for the address wonderful yeah great okay and if anyone wants to follow up with me you can email me or any thoughts yeah thank you all so much for being here tonight and thank you yes this time next or 7 p.m next thursday we will have a panel discussion among four pcap artists so please tune back in then um and in the meantime please do spread the word about the digital show to your friends your communities we've had such a wonderful response and i'm so grateful for everyone's comments and um and and your attendance tonight so thank you all and janie um yes shawnee uh just called me and asked a question that she had and it was about if an artist enters prison and there's any attention they might uh gather as already an artist and if you kind of have to deal with conflicts from attention sometimes like from other uh prisoners maybe frustrated in that way johnny was wondering i don't think too much i didn't mention actually that most of the artists became artists in prison they weren't artists before most of them they learned it in prison but if you're an artist and you enter prison i think most people would be interested in their work they may ultimately feel competitive as there is competition between artists in prison all the time but it is mostly a friendly kind of competition they generally are respectful of each other great so not to kind of end on the ending node thank you thank you thank you everyone thank you so much thank you have a lovely evening that's wonderful thank you all", "C3cZds3tp1k": "she's a viper [Music] she's so full of herself she does whatever she wants and doesn't mind if it hurts she's brutal

about i am going to admit it right here right now i seem to have a serious candle addiction i can't stop buying candles i just can't i need to do giveaways to give away some candles because i have too many candles i actually have a candle shelf in my hallway closet now so guess what i did i went on goose creek and bought more candles i know it's going into spring but i really like these smells and you know what i'm a sucker for a sale i got these sweet pine and snowflakes gentle foaming hand soap i love the smell so i get the hand wash you may or may not know i am in love with the small marshmallow snow cream and it's a little marshmallow snowman so i got the room spray oh wait i have a candle lit it's not stirred on fire okay when i don't feel like lighting my marshmallow snow cream candle this it's like you're in a candy factory i'm not kidding the only bad thing is it makes me want to eat like a whole bunch of candy obviously these are winter things they had a sale going because they're kind of clearing out the winter stuff they brought in the spring stuff last month i took advantage of the sale and got some things remember how i said love take me to my igloo yeah i might have got another one i think this is number three or four and oh look it's take me to my igloo again yes i do have four of these now in my defense i love this i love the picture on it the little igloo but this is the color of my kitchen so i always want to keep this candle in my kitchen especially at the holidays i probably want one on i have shelves matching shelves on either side of my dining room so i would like these to be on either side and i just love the smell it's really good so yeah i caved and i bought two of those this one i was really interested it's called cupid's cocktail it's like berries and champagne and it definitely has a bubbly sparkly smell to it that i love so i can't wait to try that one this is just a quick little unboxing gummy bears gummy bears gummy bear candle gummy bear candle oh my god i can't wait to see what this smells like when it's lit because just i think it's just gonna stay open on my desk and make the room smell like gummy bears but i saw this and if you know i talked about their cereal flavored cereal flavored like we're gonna eat them cereal scented candles the froot loops smelling one and they have like a tricks although you can't say fruit loops and tricks because they don't make those they change the names a little bit but they can call gummy bears gummy bears so i guess gummy bears is just like a general title anybody can use you can't say fruit loops you could say fruity loops or loopy fruits but you can say gummy bears obviously the cereal names are trademarked but gummy bears is not interesting see the more you know last one this isn't the biggest order but i wanted to get this one it's pinwheel cookies i guess it's christmassy but i like cookies year-round it smells like berries and cookie dough this one i am probably going to keep put away until holidays this year this is going to be a really good i mean this sounds weird thinking this far ahead but i think this is going to be a good thanksgiving candle like around after thanksgiving i love the color this kind of really rich very burgundy red just a little order this time only five candles i'm doing better it's a much smaller box this time only five candles and a soap and a room freshener and i am very happy with this little order i especially love gummy bears gummy bears go get this one for sure love that and the cupid's cocktail is nice too so yeah that's my quick little goose creek unboxing and review not a lot this time but you know i'm a little toning it down with my candles i'm spacing it out trying to burn a lot of them so i can buy more the more you burn the more you can buy plus i love these containers i'm going to be reusing the heck out of these things they're probably all going to be in my kitchen with like little snacks and i'm all stacked up at some point oh so good if you have not tried goose creek i highly recommend it i very much like them i did a whole video on goose creek before make sure you go check that out i will put a little card up here make sure you check that video out i talk a lot more in depth about goose creek about the company and why i like them so much their candles don't have fake overly perfume smells but they are really strong they fill up entire rooms and they're made in the usa that's always a good thing if you order a hundred dollars worth you get free shipping which is why i usually tend to order a lot they have sales get on their email list you get all the sales and get the stuff in the off season too i mean i know it sounds weird like get the christmas stuff put it away i'm a big fan of that especially with stuff this good thanks again for stopping by seeing my little goose creek unboxing go check them out i'll put a link to their website lots of

chapter of americans united i'm delighted to welcome you all to the second of what we hope will be a series of collaborative programs in which this limits of distance time and temperature that separate au chapters are wiped away by the magic of zooming this allows us to make use of the rich resources of experts and opinion leaders who work together to defend the wall of separation between church and state and give them the opportunity to share their wisdom with a broader audience than would be available by their communicating separately with individual chapters we'll say more about this later tonight houston texas rochester new york and nashville tennessee chapters joined together to welcome a national leader dr neil jones who will be introduced in a moment by nancy friedman president of the houston chapter and a member of the american united board of trustees but first a brief order welcome from the nashville chapter charles sumner thomas jefferson thought it was great to put a wall between church and state i'm charles sumner president emeritus of the nashville chapter approaching its 20th year in may we are watching 31 bills in the nashville legislature almost all of which are offensive to us we are in a coalition of about 20 organizations called the nashville peace and justice center we are also in a coalition with educational groups about 25 of them the tennessee public education coalition and we're working also with the tennessee equality project which works against the hate of slate from the legislature on lgbt to cue persons so welcome to all and let's go on to the next one nancy hi everybody i'm nancy friedman president of the houston chapter we're so glad to have you all from all over the country and most of all we're glad to have neil jones

the board around five years ago recently neil started a practice of psychology psychology practice in his home state of north carolina after having served in various states throughout the country as a unitarian minister neil has some of the most important qualities of both professions communication skills people skills patience and i think most of all sense of humor those skills also make him a successful leader of our volunteer board it's been a treat to serve with and under kneel as board chair it's always a treat to hear him speak so all of us are in for a treat tonight neil well my goodness thank you nancy be sure to remind me to ask you to preach my eulogy when that day comes i uh i appreciate those kind words and good to see you again charles uh from nashville and and got bob good to meet you from rochester and and thank you all of you all of our guests that we have with us tonight i'm glad that you could join us from around the country i guess that is one uh silver lining around this cloud of uh of a pandemic is that we can join together at times like this in this way uh my talk tonight is uh entitled religious liberty a sword or shield and it's going to be part history lesson and part political analysis we uh want to remind ourselves that um that the seeds of uh religious liberty were planted on these shores by the framers of the constitution in article six and in the first amendment to be exact article six you may remember forbids a religious test as a requirement for holding public office at any level of government and the first amendment establishes a wall of separation between government and religion now in the first amendment the establishment clause congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion it protects government from religious meddling it keeps religion from using the force of law to impose religious beliefs and practices on people which is why it's unconstitutional for public schools to force children to pray or to teach religious beliefs in science classes the free exercise clause congress shall make no law prohibiting the free exercise thereof it protects religion from political meddling it keeps the government from instructing preachers what to preach believers what to believe and worshipers how to worship which is why it's now unconstitutional for heresy to be a crime as it once was during colonial days and generally speaking for religious organizations to receive public tax money the wall of separation has ch as chuck reminded us was jefferson's metaphor for the first amendment which maintains the integrity of both government and religion so tonight i want to take a few moments to look at one side of that wall the side of religious liberty because the noble concept of religious liberty is being used for ignoble purposes these days by the religious right some fundamentalist protestants and ultra orthodox catholics have twisted the definition of religious liberty to mean their right to discriminate against others based on religious grounds they claim that the civil rights of those they oppose impinge upon their religious rights and that they therefore do not have to honor laws protecting everyone's rights the right to religious liberty was intended as a shield to protect all citizens but the religious right has wielded it as a sword to attack those they regard as second-class citizens now this is an old tactic it was originally used by religious conservatives to defend jim crow laws in the segregated south in which i was born and raised it was common for racists to invoke the bible to buttress their position god they insisted intended for the races to remain separate then as now the religious right turn anti-discrimination arguments on their heads instead of african-american students being discriminated against by segregated christian universities for example the all-white christian universities were being discriminated against but not being allowed to exclude them instead of african-american customers being discriminated against by white-owned restaurants hotels and other businesses it was the white business owners who were being discriminated against for not being allowed to turn them away now this hit close to home for me back in columbia south carolina where i used to live maurice bessinger owned a chain of barbecue restaurants called piggy parks back in the sixties he refused to serve african-americans because he said to do so contravenes the will of god messenger was an avowed segregationist who argued that he had a religious right to violate the civil rights act his case went all the way to the supreme court in 1968 and in newman versus piggy park the high court ruled that it was unconstitutional to deny service to african americans on the basis of religion the court called bessinger's argument quote patently frivolous now when i left columbia a few years ago the piggy park restaurants were serving black customers though few cared to eat there and for good reason bessinger's restaurants sold in addition to pork barbecue books and videos honoring the confederacy and supporting segregation and even slavery and they flew the confederate flag prominently out front many of us whites refuse to eat there as well the new jim crow today primarily targets gay lesbian bisexual and transgender americans women who would like access to contraception abortion and family planning information muslims and other religious minorities and non-believers once again religious conservatives are arguing that they shouldn't have to serve those people in their stores restaurants hotels pharmacies hospitals and universities because of their right to religious liberty and they're claiming this right even in the face of anti-discrimination laws that require public accommodations to serve all the public now the religious right has been emboldened by two supreme court decisions in particular the first one was the 2014 burwell versus hobby lobby decision now who would have guessed that a chain of stores which sell glue guns and glitter could threaten the wall of separation the affordable care act as you may remember had gone into effect and in addition to covering pre-existing conditions and preventative health care it also mandated that employers must provide coverage for contraceptives for their employees however the owner of hobby lobby david green an evangelical well known for his full page ads and national newspapers promoting his brand of christianity he objected to the use of certain contraceptives based on his religious beliefs and he sought to be exempt from this requirement and the supreme court sided with mr green rendering a a very narrow decision the court ruled that closely held corporations do not have to abide by this mandate because it's not the least restrictive method of implementing the government's interests in essence the court narrowly opened the door to two dangerous precedents first that for-profit corporations have the same religious rights as people and second that the religious beliefs of a business owner trump the right of employees to health care benefits they are entitled to by law now this ruling has been especially burdensome to low-income women who must work hourly wage jobs and who struggle to make ends meet in effect the court's decision set the precedent for granting business owners the legal right to impose their religious dogma on their employees and the second supreme court decision which has encouraged the religious right to press for religious exemptions from anti-discrimination laws is masterpiece cake shop versus colorado civil rights commission which was decided in 2019 again who would have guessed that wedding cakes could have constitutional consequences jack phillips was a baker in denver who refused to bake a wedding cake for a gay couple claiming that same-sex marriage violated his religious beliefs he refused despite the fact that the state of colorado has laws that ban discrimination against people because of their sexual orientation well the court sided with mr phillips but again it was a very narrow and i would say even very confusing ruling the court ruled on an administrative procedure it stated that mr phillips did not have to bake his cake because he had not been treated fairly by the colorado civil rights commission and so on the surface it appears that mr phillips victory is a victory for new jim cl the new jim crow practice of using religious liberty as a sword of discrimination but justice anthony kennedy who wrote the majority opinion before retiring from the court he asserted that business owners are not permitted under the constitution to use religion to discriminate against protected classes of individuals such as lgbtq citizens of colorado justice kennedy warned of the slippery slope which would be created if religious discrimination were legalized owners of various businesses might refuse service not only to lgbtq people but to anyone whose way of life offends the owner's sensibilities non-believers members of other faiths single moms cohabitating couples the list is as varied and endless as people's religious prohibitions this is not the exercise of religious liberty it's the exercise of legalized bigotry now these supreme court rulings may have been narrowly defined victories for the religious right but they are victories nonetheless and the court's rulings in its last session have only added to these victories one case trump versus pennsylvania drastically expands the hobby lobby decision again under the affordable care act most insurance companies must cover contraception now from the beginning houses of worship were giving an exemption religiously affiliated non-profits and some closely held for-profit corporations were provided with an accommodation to the coverage requirement they simply had to notify the government or their insurance provider of their objection so that contraceptive care could be provided to their employees through other means now the trump administration issued rules that dramatically expanded these exemptions and this accommodation process by first of all extending the religious accommodation to any entity that wanted it including large publicly traded corporations and two making the notification process optional so that entities that object to providing coverage need not even notify the government or their insurance company of their refusal thereby disrupting the ability to provide coverage through other means so the states of pennsylvania and new jersey sued the trump administration and the supreme court cited in its favor ruling that the trump administration did have the authority to issue rules that would exempt employee employers and universities from contraceptive coverage requirement now the practical ramification of this ruling is that employees students and their families will be stripped of their insurance coverage for birth control for many especially students losing their insurance coverage means that they will not be able to afford birth control so the poor the court's ruling effectively undermines both religious freedom and reproductive freedom now two cases from the court's last session involved to involve uh private religious schools a few years ago the state of montana created a private school voucher program but because montana state constitution includes a no aid clause that prohibits any public aid to a school controlled by a church sec or denomination the montana department of revenue limited the program to secular schools now parents who wanted to use the vouchers to send their children to religious schools sued the state and in espinoza versus montana the conservative majority on the supreme court sided with them overturning decades of precedent the court ruled that if a state creates a private school voucher program it must fund religious schools along with private secular schools now 37 other states in addition to montana have no aid clauses in their state constitution which uphold a fundamental principle of church state separation that no citizen or taxpayer should be compelled to fund a religion to which they do not subscribe espinoza versus montana undermines that principle and the second case is an anti-discrimination case well actually our lady of guadalupe school versus morsi burwell consolidates two anti-discrimination cases both of which involved two fifth grade teachers at religious schools near los angeles one was fired after she was diagnosed with breast cancer and the other was fired after she turned 64. these cases asked whether the schools could count these two teachers as ministers thus placing them within the scope of the ministerial exemption now let me explain what that means another fundamental principle of the separation of church and state is that houses of worship get to decide how to preach practice and disseminate their religious beliefs and how to organize their own governing structure without interference from the government the ministerial exemption was created by the courts to ensure that houses of worship maintain control over their religious doctrine by having complete freedom to hire and fire employees who hold important religious positions this right to religious autonomy overrides all anti-discrimination protections so for example a baptist church has the right to discriminate against methodist catholics and jews when they seek to hire a minister well the morsi berud decision extended the ministry of exemption to these two teachers because some religious instruction was included in their duties as teachers so as a result these religious schools were granted the right to ignore federal laws against employment discrimination on the basis of disability and age and as a result thousands of teachers at religious schools stand to lose important legal protections against any and all kinds of discrimination once again the supreme court is redefining religious liberty to mean the right to discriminate converting what is meant to be a shield that protects us all into a sword that harms others now in addition to these decisions the religious right has also been emboldened by a president who rewarded their political support by aggressively pushing their agenda most significantly by packing the federal courts including the supreme court with conservative judges who share their distorted conception of religious liberty as the right to discriminate these appointments have delivered to them a solid conservative majority for the next generation unless we forget eight out of ten evangelicals voted for mr trump and still support him despite the fact that his words and actions contradict almost everything they say they believe in fact in one interview one of trump's staunchest evangelical supporters jerry falwell jr was asked if there is anything the former president could do that would endanger his support from him and other evangelical leaders mr follower answered simply no with friends in high places the religious right is on a crusade to turn the united states into a christian theocracy ironically much like the muslim theocracies in the middle east which they eagerly condemn in which the government promotes a religion they supported the former administration's epa which apparently forgot its purpose to protect the environment it aggressively rolled back requirements to preserve clean water and air and granted oil companies unparalleled permission to endanger the health of our planet the religious rights supported these measures because the scientific facts of climate change do not fit their dogma if they succeed the clock will run out on our ability to reverse our march to the cliff of extinction the religious rights supported the agenda of secretary of education betsy devos who apparently forgot the purpose of her job to foster public education she aggressively promoted the diversion of public funds to private schools through vouchers tuition tax credits and education savings plans and remember the overwhelming majority of private schools are religious which means that your tax dollars may be used to finance the teaching of a religion whether you belong to that religion or not if they succeed not only will they turn back the clock to pre-constitutional days when the government sponsored religion but they will decimate our public schools at the very time when many of them are already on life support and the last thing our society needs are less educated citizens they supported the former administration's anti-immigration policies such as the ban on immigrants from seven muslim-majority countries and the ludicrous proposal to build a wall across our southern border and to take children from their parents and put them in literal cages as i say that out loud i still cannot believe that my government was imitating the behavior of fascists and communist governments and i find it even more incredible that people who say they follow the teachings of jesus endorse this kind of behavior if they succeed there will be an increase in hate crimes toward ethnic and religious minorities in this country indeed there already has been and america will lose its moral credibility in the eyes of the rest of the world if we haven't already i understand aggression including political aggression as an expression of fear it's as basic as biology the fight-or-flight mechanism which is activated when we feel that we are in danger the religious rights hostility toward others who are different from them is motivated by fear they rightly perceive that american society is changing america is becoming more diverse and their narrow definitions of morality and what it means to be an american are becoming the minority point of view what they perceive as an attack on religion is in fact an attack on bigotry what they perceive as their persecution is the equal treatment of all now earlier in our history they were in a position of dominance but they are losing their perch of privilege and their attempt to force their dogmatic views into law is their desperate attempt to regain what has been lost now the religious right asserts that such laws are necessary to protect their religious liberty but we already have such a law it's called the constitution of the united states if your religion cannot tolerate lgbtq people women who have abortion or couples who cohabitate people of other faiths or people of no faith the first amendment protects the right of your church to admit or refuse membership to whomever it pleases the right of your church to marry whomever it pleases and the right of your minister to preach and teach whatever he or she pleases but your religious religious freedom does not give you the right to legalize your intolerance with discrimination in the public sphere if you're opposed to same-sex marriage then don't marry someone of the same sex but your religious freedom does not give you the right to deny that right to others if you're opposed to abortions then don't have one but your religious freedom does not give you the right to deny that right to others if you believe that the earth is flat and was created in six days and that evolution is a myth you are free to believe that and to send your children to private schools that teach that but your religious freedom does not give you the right to deny a sound scientific education to students in our public schools and if you pray you are free to pray anytime anywhere including a public school but your religious freedom does not give you the right to force others to pray religious liberty is a shield not a sword thank you thank you very much neil everybody if you've got questions please type them in the q a box we'll start with a couple um not everyone on this most of the people on this call are members of americans united but there are some who aren't so could you tell a little about what americans united the organization is doing to address the problem that you've talked to us about tonight sure um well there are a couple of exciting things several exciting things are happening now that we have a new administration uh in washington um and another political party uh in the majority in congress um americans united has uh supported uh the do no harm act and the do no harm act is doing exactly what i'm talking about it does not prohibit people from using uh religion as a to do to do harm it will protect your religious freedom but will prevent you from using it as an excuse to discriminate against others uh another exciting piece of legislation that's moving through congress is the no ban act you may remember that president trump as i mentioned uh banned muslim majority immigrants from muslim majority countries from entering our country the no ban act will reverse that and then there's the equality act which just recently passed the house of representatives and now is going to the senate the equality uh act um expands and reinforces the civil rights act of 1964 by expanding protections to lgbtq lgbtq persons and and people of diverse agenders as well as we know the uh the civil rights act already protects uh people based on uh prevents discrimination based on race uh religion color uh national origin sex and disability it will add these categories and strengthen those other categories as well so americans united supports all three of those uh bills and you can help support those bills by calling your congressional representatives and your senators and urge them to support them as well yeah and i would also say at one more thing since i think uh starting in january americans united has started uh something called the action network you go on our website and you can sign up and you will periodically receive emails instructing you how you can help advance the agenda for separation of church and state by attending workshops by contacting your representatives because as we know politics is is mostly local and the action network will identify not just national federal legislation but things that are going on on the state level as well in your state and as you know representatives listen to their constituents constituents before they listen to someone from another state so those are several ways right there and i want to encourage all of you to respond when americans united ask you to contact your representative don't assume just because your representative is a liberal or a democrat that they will be a co-sponsor of this legislation to give an example the uh do no harm act that neil just mentioned has been reintroduced in this congress it had been introduced in the previous session it almost had the number of representatives required to pass the u.s house so i looked at my representative lizzie pannell fletcher to see if she had co-sponsored it in the last session i found that she hadn't so uh they are starting over this year on the do no harm act it's trying to gather sponsors now co-sponsors to pass the house first but i urge you to go ahead and check see if your congressman your representative has sponsored this act or any other accident neil talked about and then ask them if they haven't asked them to co-sponsored and if they have thank them for co-sponsoring it because as neil just said we all have to act this is supposed to be a democracy and even if our representatives are uh of a a different party that might uh not uh support the act you never know what might appeal to to a particular person you never know if your personal story might convince your representative so let's go back to questions um you mentioned uh the uh the piggies the piggy uh restaurant and first of all one of the i want to ask you a question about that but somebody asked if you would please repeat the name of that case about the restaurant that uh lost their discrimination case but supports the confederacy the case was called newman versus piggy park because the name of the restaurant chains were uh were piggy parks 1968 the owner i believe he's passed away now maurice bessinger was his name yeah yeah and it is incredible but when i lived in columbia south carolina six years ago i went by i was i was curious i didn't i didn't really want to um finance his business but i was just curious to know what the what do they have on display and i'm not exaggerating they had books and videos not only still defending segregation but defending slavery and of course there was that confederate flag waving proudly out front so um it's pretty incredible but i think we've all been reminded this past year that uh that the the racism is not dead and the confederacy is also still very much alive well is it your sense that those members of the religious right who use religion as a justification to discriminate against for example lgbtq people see that segment of our population different than people of color or do you think that they feel well the issue's already been settled with people of color i can't openly discriminate against them legally well i i'll not pretend to read the mind of anybody especially someone on the religious right based on your experiences though being in the south and being a person of faith uh i just was curious to know if you have talked to people about that and um you know like i said got in a sense about whether the supreme court changed hearts and minds regard to the race issue what 50 years ago um or not well i mean there's no question i mean in my lifetime which pretty much spans that decision in my lifetime yes i have seen changes occur and i think supreme court decisions like that have changed hearts and minds but i also know there's still a lot of racism is still alive and well and and that uh people who call themselves religious are racist as well as being anti um gay and lesbian yeah with the new education secretary possibly overturning policies of betsy devos what are the chances of them prevailing given the espinoza ruling well since since the espinoza ruling was a supreme court ruling it can only be overturned by the supreme court so there's actually very little that the administration can do about that unfortunately and again that may be that may be the most damaging part of trump's legacy is his turning the supreme court into a solidly conservative supreme court that shares that kind of view of religious liberty yeah i'm afraid we'll be living with that for a long time one of our audience members says that one of the toughest nuts to crack is the drive to argue that abortion is murder by forcing a definition of life's beginning as increasingly early not at birth but at the presence of heartbeat or even at conception how do we oppose that well that's the thing one thing we have to realize is that individuals and religion religions themselves uh have different uh views of when life begins and and so when the government sides with one particular view it's siding with with one particular religion and that's that's just blatantly wrong uh the he's got this kind of decision it's probably one of the most personal decisions that an individual can make that a woman can make and i can't think of a a greater instance of government overreach and for the government to tell a woman what to do with her body what to do about the future of her family and of her own self it's just an ultimate ultimately a very private matter and the government has no business uh trampling on that ground i don't think one person asked how do we counter the arguments against the expansion of the original civil rights act that claim it gives special rights and privileges to transgender and other lgbtq subsets uh i'm really not sure what that means when they say special rights the whole purpose of the law is to ensure that everyone is treated equally in the public sphere it's a matter of being of having equal rights i don't know if i don't know if anyone having special rights by law i don't really understand that question honestly i think this person is suggesting or or repeating arguments that are frequently made often when whether it's congress or city council wants to pass legislation to give lgbtq people the rights that others have for example the right not to be fired because one is lesbian often when uh as i said a legislative body proposes something such as that the opponents say oh that gives special rights and privileges to the lesbian to people who are in that group so i think that's what this questioner is saying how do we counter an argument such as that well as i said earlier i mean when people have been i mean let's face when i was growing up we didn't even talk about homosexuality as though it was some kind of shameful topic not even talked about and so in my lifetime here again gay and lesbian and transgender people have quote come out of the closet and and and so yeah if you uh if you view them as being second-class citizens as something less than human then for them to be treated equally may feel like special rights to some people but it's just a matter of of equal treatment for everyone it's a matter of treating them the same as everyone else one of our audience members asks at some temporal point will not the beliefs of islamists come into direct conflict with the constitution and federal law considering the islamist attitude toward theocracy and women well that is possible we don't have to wait for islamists to do that we've got christian nationalists right now in our country by by a large number who uh who who feel that we are a christian it could be by law and by design uh and who would enforce christian doctrine as the law so we don't need to wait for another group of religious groups to come into the country and um challenge the constitution the constitution's already being challenged right now uh homegrown americans yeah and that's the irony of this as i said that these christian nationalists are acting just like the islamist theocrats in the middle east that they criticize they will the same thing they want their government to promote their religion it's just they just have to be different religions um one person has a very practical and excellent question do you have the house bill number for the do no harm act i believe because i noticed that uh that wasn't present in some of the information i'd seen and i believe uh the bill is h.r 1378. wow you got a much better memory than i do listen no that's not memory that's looking it up uh i don't have it here in front of me i'm googling it i'm a multitasker i am a female after all and i do i have something that says it's h.r 1378. so hopefully that's it um but but but the questioner is right it's good to know something like that uh not just to be able to cite it when you contact your representative but also in case you do want to look up who's co-sponsored and that sort of thing so so that's a great answer i mean a great question again i want to encourage people if you have questions to go ahead and put them uh in the chat box um eddie tabash another uh member of the national board of trustees talked to us last month about the supreme court it was a rather sobering talk and he talked about um what you said something uh about the uh the religious rights influence on the supreme court which is unfortunate majority will affect things for a generation um so with that in mind what is a you doing in the courts is a refocusing now prioritizing legislative action over judicial action uh do you have a sense whether au is going to continue filing lawsuits uh challenging some of these policies is there hope ah yes well i i i i do know that we're the au is continuing to um to be uh friends of the court on cases in cases that that affects separation tricks for instance there's a case from our state uh former state south carolina uh we have a plaintiff named amy madonna his case was going to the supreme court miss madonna uh grew up in a family that adopted foster children and so now she's now a mother a special needs children and she would also like to provide a home to foster children in her home here in south carolina so she goes to her foster care agency now south carolina like a lot of states farms out as foster care work to uh private agencies that receive public funds so she goes and she's approved be a foster parent until they ask her where do you go to church and she tells them she goes to a catholic church then they disqualify her because in their view catholics are not christian so here is a case of where both state tax money and federal tax money is being used your money is being used to to finance discrimination against someone because of their religion and so au is bringing a suit against the state of south carolina and the federal government for um for financing uh this this this discriminatory agency so that's one example of a supreme court case that we're advocating for we're going to continue doing that i again i can say there's a lot more hope these days with a new administration and a new um majority in congress that uh rather than now rather than just simply opposing all these pieces of legislation and all these executive orders that violate your separation we now have a opportunity to reverse a lot of those actions and to advance the cause of equality as with the quality act and as with the do no harm act but there's a lot more optimism these days that we can actually move ahead rather than going in reverse can you speak as a faith leader although i know you're now you're practicing psychologists but but having been a faith leader for so long can you speak as a faith leader about how challenging it may be to espouse some of the views that you've espoused tonight i mean we can all understand that faith leaders have challenges uh in terms of having a diverse congregation fundraising and that sort of thing and not wanting to offend part of their uh congregants um but if faith later if a faith leader feels the way that that you have is troubled by some of the positions espoused by some people of using their religion as an excuse to discriminate can you talk a little bit about how a faith leader might grapple with that well i think i think faith leaders have in some cases have the same kind of dilemma that secular leaders politicians have that is what do you do when your conscience causes you to oppose some of your constituents what do you do um i've been a faith leader most of my life i do believe that i do believe that all religions i think almost without exception all religions stand for kindness and compassion and justice and empathy and equality and human dignity these are these are human values that they that they all espouse and so i think as a faith leader we have to remind our congregations at times of what we stand for and that these are not just values that we just sing about or preach about in our houses of worship but these are values that should be enacted into law uh i love i love cornell west's definition of of justice he said justice is what love looks like in public and all religions stand for love and if we want love to be embodied in our society we have to be willing to enact love into law and one way to do that is to treat people equally not on the basis of their color or their gender or their sexual orientation but based on their merits based on their dignity as human beings all religions can get behind them so i think in that sense i think to be a successful faith leader and really lead from conscience means to be a fundamentalist and by that i mean return to the fundamentals of your faith and preach that and uh i think we can find a lot of common ground when we do that um one person asks a fairly specific question so i'm not sure if you'll be able to answer this but um they talked about the uh a free thought caucus oops let me see free thought caucus i'm sorry i'm trying to get back to it is a you working with the free thought caucus on legislation regarding church state separation or to expand the membership of the caucus or in any other fashion do any of its current members speak on the floor to this issue i can't say for for certain that we do i wouldn't be surprised if we did i do know that americans united is is a very unusual organization these days you know with all the polarization we've had in our country over the last two decades au still strives to be an organization that brings together religious people of all faiths and non-believers for the cause of separation church and state because whether you are religious or not you want to be free to follow the dictates of your conscience and separation of church and state or i should i should modernize that language and say the separation of government and religion allows all of us whether you're religious or not religious to do that so i do know for instance the americans does join forces with uh various secular and atheists and other um non-believing organizations to further the cause of separation i know we do that particular one i'm not sure i'm not sure one of our guests asks can some of the problems of church state separation be clarified by a federal definition of religion or would such legislation meet with the landslide of litigation [Laughter] probably the latter i mean those of us who are uh those of us who are uh ministers and involved in our very various congregations we ourselves have a hard enough time defining our own religion much less religion for others i mean here's an example here's an example uh i'm a unitarian unitary universalist many of us uh do not believe in god uh there are many people in this country who say we're not religious well we think we're a religion we gather together in community we have rituals we have traditions we have uh practices and beliefs um we're trying to become better people and we're trying to make society a better place to live so we think we're a religion there's some who say we're not so no i would not um i would not want to rely on the government to define what religion is and this may be the last question because we're almost at the top of the hour i get it will be the last question that is isn't the real goal of the evangelical community money and power using discriminatory acts as a front well i will say that is certainly my suspicion of a lot of my evangelical brothers and sisters that's my suspicion that it certainly has that appearance in many cases i will say this however i grew up i grew up as an evangelical i no longer longer can consider myself an evangelical but i grew up as an evangelical and i do know that not all evangelicals fit fit that bill i do know that among evangelicals that they are some of the kindest uh most compassionate uh respectful people that i know so like any broad category um you find those who are power-hungry and put self-interest before the common good and you find others who are quite altruistic so um like all labels we have to be careful how we throw labels around we have to be careful people are people and i know the temptation is to simplify life and simplify reality by making people fit in neat boxes but people and life are too messy for that and so i think we just need to be careful about that well i'd like to thank you very much dr neal jones for this evening thank you to everybody who came tonight uh i was going to try to share my screen but i'm not sure if i'm going to be able to do that so here we go if you can see this uh bob goldstein alluded at the beginning of this to our attempts to collaborate have chapters collaborate

smaller mailing lists of paid up members so let's get with it i always recommend au.org as the place to which uh questions about membership can be addressed and we hope you will and neil i want to thank you for a very clear exposition of what we're facing uh i think it's important to understand that the understanding of what our situation is is the first step towards taking action so thank you very much thank you it's been a privilege to be with you thank you nancy charles bob thank all of you thank you so much for having me good night everyone thank you all right thank you again her body what to do about the future of of her family and of her own self um just an ultimate ultimately a very private matter and the government has no business uh trampling on that ground i don't think one person asked how do we counter the arguments against the expansion of the original civil rights act that claim it gives special rights and privileges to transgender and other lgbtq subsets uh i'm really not sure what that means when they say special rights the whole purpose of the law is to ensure that everyone is treated equally in the public sphere it's a matter of being of having equal rights i don't know if i don't know if anyone having special rights by law i don't really understand that question honestly i think this person is suggesting or or repeating arguments that are frequently made often when whether it's congress or city council wants to pass legislation to give lgbtq people the rights that others have for example uh the right not to be fired because one is lesbian often when uh as i said a legislative body proposes something such as that the opponents say oh that gives special rights and privileges to the lesbian to people who are in that group so i think that's what this questioner is saying how do we counter an argument such as that well as i said earlier i mean when people have been i mean let's face when i was growing up we didn't even talk about homosexuality as though it was some kind of shameful topic not even talked about and so in my lifetime here again gay and lesbian and transgender people have quote come out of the closet and and and so yeah if you uh if you view them as being second-class citizens as something less than human then for them to be treated equally may feel like special rights to some people but it's just a matter of of equal treatment for everyone it's a matter of treating them the same as everyone else one of our audience members asks at some temporal point will not the beliefs of islamists come into direct conflict with the constitution and federal law considering the islamist attitude toward theocracy and women well that is possible but we we don't have to wait for islamists to do that we've got christian nationalists right now in our country by by a large number who uh who who who feel that we are a christian it could be by law and by design uh and who would enforce christian doctrine as the law so we don't need to wait for another group religious groups come into the country and um challenge the constitution the constitution's already being challenged right now uh homegrown americans yeah and that's the irony of this as i said that these christian nationalists are acting just like the islamist theocrats in the middle east that they criticize they will the same thing they want their government to promote their religion it's just they just have to be different religions um one person has a very practical and excellent question do you have the house bill number for the do no harm act i believe because i noticed that uh that wasn't present in some of the information i'd seen and i believe uh the bill is h.r 1378. wow you've got a much better memory than i do no that's not memory that's looking it up uh i don't have it here in front of me i'm googling it i'm a multitasker i am a female after all and i do uh i have something that says it's h.r 1378. so hopefully that's it um but but but the questioner is right it's good to know something like that uh not just to be able to decide it is when you contact your representative but also in case you do want to look up who's co-sponsored and that sort of thing so so that's a great answer i mean a great question again i want to encourage people if you have questions to go ahead and put them uh in the chat box um eddie tabash another uh member of the national board of trustees talked to us last month about the supreme court it was a rather sobering talk and he talked about um what you said something about the uh the religious rights influence on the supreme court which is unfortunate majority will affect things for a generation um so with that in mind what is a you doing in the courts is a refocusing now prioritizing legislative action over judicial action uh do you have a sense whether au is going to continue filing lawsuits uh challenging some of these policies is there hope ah yes well i i i i do know that we're the au is continuing to um to be uh friends of the court on cases in cases that the effects separation triggers for instance there's a case from our state uh former state south carolina uh we have a plaintiff named amy madonna his case was going to the supreme court miss madonna grew up in a family that adopted foster children and so now she's now a mother a special needs children and she would also like to provide a home to foster children in her home here in south carolina so she goes to her foster care agency now south carolina like a lot of states farms out as foster care work to private agencies that receive public funds so she goes and she's approved be a foster parent until they ask her where do you go to church and she tells them she goes to a catholic church then they disqualify her because in their view catholics are not christian so here is a case of where both state tax money and federal tax money is being used your money is being used to to finance discrimination against someone because of their religion and so au is bringing a suit against the state of south carolina and the federal government for um for financing uh this this this discriminatory agency so that's one example of a supreme court case that we're advocating for we're going to continue doing that i again i can say there's a lot more hope these days with a new administration and a majority in congress that uh rather than now rather than just simply opposing all these pieces of legislation and all these executive orders that violate church separation we now have a opportunity to reverse a lot of those actions and to advance the cause of equality as with the equality act and as with the do no harm act but there's a lot more optimism these days that we can actually move ahead rather than going in reverse can you speak as a faith leader although i know you're now you're practicing psychologists but but having been a faith leader for so long can you speak as a faith leader about how challenging it may be to espouse some of the views that you've espoused tonight i mean we can all understand that faith leaders have challenges uh in terms of having a diverse congregation fundraising and that sort of thing and not wanting to offend part of their uh congregants um but if faith later if faith leader feels the way that that you have is troubled by some of the positions espoused by some people of using their religion as an excuse to discriminate can you talk a little bit about how a faith leader might grapple with that well i think i think faith leaders have in some cases have the same kind of dilemma that secular leaders politicians have that is what do you do when your conscience causes you to oppose some of your constituents what do you do um have you been a faith leader most of my life uh i do believe that i do believe that all religions i think almost without exception all religions stand for kindness and compassion and justice and empathy and equality and human dignity these are these are human values that they they all espouse and so i think as a faith leader we have to remind our congregations at times of what we stand for and that these are not just values that we just sing about or preach about in our houses of worship but these are values that should be enacted into law i love i love cornell west's definition of of justice he said justice is what love looks like in public and uh all religions stand for love and if we want love to be embodied in our society we have to be willing to enact love into law and one way to do that is to treat people equally not on the basis of their color or their gender or their sexual orientation but based on their merits based on their dignity as human beings all religions can get behind them so i think um in that sense i think to be a successful faith leader and really lead from conscience means to be a fundamentalist and by that i mean return to the fundamentals of your faith and preach that and i think we can find a lot of common ground when we do that um one person asks a fairly specific question so i'm not sure if you'll be able to answer this but um they talked about the uh a free thought caucus oops let me see free thought caucus i'm sorry i'm trying to get back to it is a you working with the free thought caucus on legislation regarding church state separation or to expand the membership of the caucus or in any other fashion do any of its current members speak on the floor to this issue i can't say for for certain that we do i wouldn't be surprised if we did i do know that americans united is is a very unusual organization these days you know with all the polarization we've had in our country over the last two decades au still strives to be an organization that brings together religious people of all faiths and non-believers for the cause of separation church and state because whether you are religious or not you want to be free to follow the dictates of your conscience and separation of church and state or i should i should modernize that language and say the separation of government and religion allows all of us whether you're religious or not religious to do that so i do know for instance the united does join forces with uh various secular and atheist and other um non-believing organizations to further the cause of separation i know we do that particular one i'm not sure i'm not sure one of our guests asks can some of the problems of church state separation be clarified by a federal definition of religion or would such legislation meet with the landslide of litigation [Laughter] probably the latter i mean those of us who are uh those of us who are uh ministers and involved in our very very congregations we ourselves have a hard enough time defining our own religion much less religion for others here's an example here's an example uh i'm a unitarian unitary universalist many of us uh do not believe in god uh there are many people in this country who say we're not religious well we think we're a religion we gather together in community we have rituals we have traditions we have uh practices and beliefs um we're trying to become better per people and we're trying to make society a better place to live so we think we're a religion there's some who say we're not so no i would not um i would not want to rely on the government to define what religion is and this may be the last question because we're almost at the top of the hour i get it will be the last question that is isn't the real goal of the evangelical community money and power using discriminatory acts as a front well i will say that is certainly my suspicion of a lot of my evangelical brothers and sisters that's my suspicion

how we throw labels around we have to be careful people are people and i know the temptation is to simplify life and simplify reality by making people fit in neat boxes but people and life are too messy for that and so i think we just need to be careful about that well i'd like to thank you very much dr neal jones for this evening thank you to everybody who came tonight uh i was going to try to

you", "oZtPCZxLdos": "[Music] hey y'all is to be slayed by Jordan and the company I'll be working with today's I see hair from aliexpress not ice-t hair beauty I'm working with I see hair Aliexpress today they sting me over some 613 body wave hair three bundles of 24-inch in one twenty inch enclosure now I'm showing you just on what comes in the package this closure does come free plugs with transparent lace I did love that about it it did shed some but that's to be expected with six thirteen here but just keep in mind that the hair does now I'm just showing you on what the bundles look like and we're about to proceed to color this hair today I plan to do this slab green color so keep watching and you'll see exactly how I did it today we'll be using my favorite color for the slammer green color which is like kids they're a temptation line it is the kids limelight I used a total of two and a half bottles but I put them in gradually as I needed it so um you'd everyone put on your gloves you don't want to spend your hands and you just want to use the hottest water you can from the faucet put the water in the bucket you know mix it around but make sure you mix all the guy into the water because if you don't you'll have on splotchy parts on the hair and or closure and you don't want that now I know a lot of people telling their hair before they are color it green just to get the best color payout but today I didn't feel like toning the hair I just wanted to get the hair right in there see what Kelly returned and it turned the same way it would turn if I didn't own it so I mean the turning process may work but maybe better but we didn't use it today so as you can see I'm literally just dipping the hair back and forth until it's giving the shade of green that I want if you want a lighter shade use the less color in more water or if you want a on richer shade use it less water and more color I just want a normal green not too too green and I wanted to too green today [Music] and this is the color we got after coloring and so now what I do with our watercolor um sometimes I don't shampoo or conditioner hair afterwards I just literally color it and I squeeze out all the excess water and I let it air dry so now this is my cousin Raven we wouldn't hit it home right on her down she's getting a closure sewing today but we're going to install it like a frontal so what we did we just braided her down and um we um put her cap on and now I like to place the closure on top of the cap and Mark where I wanted to stop that way I know exactly where to sell the closure down it and I know exactly where to UM and here the closer to her skin with free spray exactly and so that's why I make those two markings I used their eyeliner pencil or a concealer and then just um it makes a neater process [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and as usual we're going in with that makeup on the caps a better metric skin and then we're gonna cut the cap off and clean her skin and then we're gonna put that same makeup on the closure as well and then we're gonna free spray that closures just to make sure the closure is it too oily from the makeup and then if you keep watching you'll see today how I used a new clue and I'll tell you whether I like or not and you know how it works and that I can better the boho or whatever so just keep watching [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so today I'll be using the latest grip I'll be using their and he said and their skin predicted what a make sure whatever glue you use you definitely use the skin protector that comes with it because these glues can be very harsh to the skin and you just want to keep everything protected so I don't know that it's placing the skipper take the arm all her skin is exactly where I want to place the glue I want to let that dry I'm gonna dry actually with cool air on my blow dryer then we're gonna sell that closure down and then we're gonna apply our glue and start sewing in her tracks today I use four layers of the glue and as you as you watch you will see exactly what I did [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] after sown in the first bundle and letting that fourth layer of blue driver gonna go ahead and proceed to learn the closure down what I definitely can say about last group last group definitely dries very very quick I would not recommend legs good for beginners because this glue dries are really quick and you have to move fast I thought oh ho active dress quick you know LASIK you guys really really quick so let me go ahead and give you my thoughts on I grew up in right now just blows right the hair on cool air and then after I do that we're gonna proceed to cut it off I'm using eyebrow razor the back central a script like script definitely is a thinner glue so it melts really good like I could definitely say comparing it's a boho active it definitely melts away better well I would say way better it definitely much better than the ball active like it really melts that lace in but being that it is thin landscape doesn't have it as a strong whole as Moho active and so in the end that was a major factor for me of course I love a good melt down but I need that whole to be strong so yeah nice group definitely melts it down but when it comes to the whole boho active is killing them so active holds like really good I have had clients tell me that their legs didn't live and they kept it on for four weeks like really but I know with ladies group I'm not gonna get that same home and I definitely want to try it out that's why I didn't upload this video it's quickly as I wanted to I wanted to test this Louie I also tested it out on another client a friend to see how it works and yeah it definitely melts the lace but that hole is not strong enough yeah I'm not sure if I should use more layers or not but it's just not what I'm used to but it just that doesn't mean it's a bad glue it's definitely not I would definitely use latex grip before like an HD lace when I'm not gonna do baby hair it's gonna be perfect and that's also a nother thing when I did the mousse baby hair is that on this client on this video on to my other friend then I slipped it right on up but with the boho where I did the mousse like delicious to live like at all so that was a major factor for me too because I don't like to use the gel for baby hair as I like to do the moves baby hairs but I don't need my laser hitting up because there's just a lot torque around that so in the end what I recommend lace girl I definitely would you just have to understand that certain glues are good for certain things last group is definitely good when you want that very melted down look like that you know undetectable look I love it for that but for holding wise which is rarely but I try to give my clients because I want I like my clans to have longevity you can't borrow home definitely win so I'm sticking to my boho active y'all but I still have another glue the tryout I'm not gonna tell you out ways but I'm never gonna try it out but yes for now stick it to my boho active so that relate that lace down I was talking so much I sprayed free spray over it and I chatted I used to the last debate they'll just give you an even better belt now I learned that hip from beautiful so here on YouTube y'all should definitely subscribe to my girl page because my girl my girl be really out here doing her dying I own some real stuff oh yeah go hear her up so now I'm just gonna finish toning those tracks and they you'll just see how I stop the hair from here [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and let me pop back in so I can give y'all a quick tip on how to get rid of like those humpy edges like when you're folding over the tracks when you get done just take a hot comb at the you know we get out the phone you're gonna take a hot comb you're gonna run it over the hair get that um get that wealth like really hot to where it's like bendable and it's gonna be in for you and then what you're gonna do is after you get it hot you're gonna take your pink hair clips I'm gonna clip it you're gonna hold it down flat and clip it into place and then spray free spray on it and when it dries I'm lay flat like a really really flat so it's just a little trick I learned from you know just like trying stuff you know at the shop just to UM make sure all your tracks are laying down because you know you do not want the tracks especially around the closure or the edges to be like humpy and lumpy because that'll just make your installed not look as good as it could John just will drive the hair I'm about to give it to style today we're gonna do some soft crimp so um but first we need to drive the hair and today I'm gonna use um got to be glued for her baby hairs I want to try something new for ya we're not trying to the new just show you out that there are other ways to do the baby hairs besides just mousse so I would make all of school use got to be glued so yeah we're just gonna do her some soft crimps today I just want to let y'all watch I don't want to do too much talking I feel like I ought to mention my videos so I want to just talk a little bit Lester but you know if y'all that's

goodbye", "s7Tjuki3RGM": "[Music] [Applause] hey hey hey it's kia here if you're new welcome if you're not then you already know back with another video you would like to see how i got this look then continue watching this video i want to come and do this video for y'all because i feel like i always look crazy on these videos and i made one video on here before but i feel like i should tell y'all how i do my makeup because i am not a makeup artist at all but i look cute and my face be slayed so i feel like i should show y'all how i do that and help y'all because maybe y'all don't do makeup either but y'all want to be cute or y'all want to get into makeup it's going to be easier to me if it's coming for somebody who else don't do makeup and you don't know how to do makeup you know i'm saying you can understand me more than someone who does makeup for real and they know what they're doing they're naming all this stuff and you just like wait like i don't understand so you know i'm gonna help y'all out i'm gonna show y'all what i did to start getting into makeup okay we're gonna go ahead and get started so first i am going to start off with priming my face you really should not forget to do this step the primer i'm using is this la girl pro prep um primer you don't know what your experience is going to be so i recommend just using cheap makeup just to start so you can kind of get the idea of what you're doing you know what i'm saying when you pay a high dollar it's going to be more quality but you're just starting so you ain't even there yet so like me i'm just now trying to add different things in that a little more expensive as i'm learning different stuff with makeup and learning different stuff that i want to come out of my makeup you know like what kind of quality i want to have i say just stay with the basics to start and then once you start to progress and keep on doing and get better better that's when you move forward and get better makeup but you know what i'm saying it's up to you it is your preference whatever you want to do so i'm just going to put it all over my face and then i'm just going to rub it in because i haven't tried other primers i'm not sure exactly how it's supposed to feel but for this one it kind of feels like it's just like nothing there like i can't really tell that it's on my face but i know it's on my face because i put it on there well first things first what i do is my eyebrows so i'm just going to take this little spoolie i like to just brush mines up and then kind of angle i hope you can see kind of angle it little hairs that may stick out down and just kind of get the basis of it before i start filling it in i actually got this pencil from the hair store and it's just it's la colors brow pencil in black i definitely recommend you get the pencil that's going to match your eyebrows like if your eyebrows and hair is more of a brown color get brown oh be mindful of that because you do not want your eyebrows too dark and you look funny i'm just going to start by oh my gosh i really hope y'all can see i'm going to outline some people start from the bottom and some people start from the top but i usually do the top you want to be light don't don't go hard like do it real light so i'm gonna draw real light and i'm kind of just tracing my eyebrow because i already like the shape i have naturally arched eyebrows so i usually can just do that now if you don't have eyebrows like some people have really thin eyebrows or they don't have the arch you can always draw out the shape but make sure you're doing it like a sketch because you don't want it to be harsh and look crazy you just want to kind of sketch it out so make sure you're doing it in the way that you want your um eyebrows to look and it does not have to be perfect because we will be cleaning it up with concealer that's what the concealer is for but you don't want to go like crazy but you you it's not going to be like a big big deal if you mess it up so i'm going to do this side and then i'm going to go ahead and do the bottom i hope this mirror being right here doesn't bother y'all that's another thing like you kind of want to get good at your eyebrows because if they're messed up you can just fix it so usually if mines are too thin because i like mines thick i'll just fill them in and fix them and that's why i used to not worry so much about my eyebrows that they messed them up i mean you still be upset but not that upset if you can fix it okay and so then i like to go in now and i'm gonna go up and down right here to make it look like hairs instead of so harsh just to kind of fill it in and then you can go in and fill in your brow if it's like thin make it a little darker my spoolie is like my best friend when it comes to my eyebrows okay i will spoolie the heck out of my eyebrows i just feel like it's like a way to blend them so i'll just kind of brush my hairs again making sure i'm kill still keeping everything smooth but kind of brush them out to make them like blend in and just make it smooth especially here where you did those up and down because you want it to blend you don't want it to look harsh so just blend up and then kind of square it off at the top okay so now you can take your concealer and the one i use is la girl pro concealer i seen so many people use this stuff whether they were like super good at makeup or they weren't and i got this at the hair storage local beauty supply when you are getting your concealer your concealer is going to be lighter than you you don't want it way way lighter than you but just like a couple shades lighter than your actual skin color or the foundation that you're going to get because this is like to brighten it up and stuff like that now i know some people use different concealer color for their eyebrow versus like the rest of their face but me personally i use the same one so when you first get your eyebrows now you know you see it's like a little lighter around and stuff like that so basically to me this is what concealer does it makes it look like you just got your eyebrows done they fresh they knew and it also acts as like a eraser to clean up the mistakes that you may have made or you know fix areas in your eyebrows that you don't like like if it's not done if your eyebrows aren't fresh you can cover them little hairs that's trying to go back and you won't be able to notice now some people will use the little brush on here and do it and just you know fill it out but to me that's a little i don't wanna say it's difficult but like if it's too much squirt it out then it's gonna make a mess it's gonna be a whole bunch on there so i like to use this little brush let me show y'all i don't know what brushes are called y'all i don't i really really don't know but i'm still trying to show you all these brushes and also i forgot to talk about brushes you can use elf brushes because you can get those from walmart walgreens you know beauty supply so you can go on amazon they have brushes and just get a bunch of brushes i recommend a pack because then it has all the ones that you need in there that you may not even know you need it it is already in there to me i don't really know quality brushes i don't know how that works but i want a good brush that feels good not too soft not too firm just right in the middle and it's going to work good i hope that makes sense y'all know i'm trying to explain stuff sometimes i feel like it don't make sense but i hope that makes sense okay so i'm squeeze some out like that just a little bit and then i'm going to just take it on my brush so what i do is go right underneath and i don't go all the way to the beginning just a little bit and i'm cleaning up if i feel like my eyebrows are too thick add some more we're gonna do this eyebrow see how when it's a lot it's so much thicker so what i'm going to do is i'm going to keep spreading but i might go to the top and i'm just going to kind of spread it out because it's too much oh i'm going to show you all my mistakes too i'm not going to delete it and edit it out i'm going to show you guys how i fix things spread it out and we're just gonna use it on the other brow because you really don't want to use much a little bit goes a long way okay so i'm still grabbing some and spreading it out so i can take it and put it up top so i'm going to look and make sure i like my eyebrows make sure they're all good i'm just going to take this same brush and i'm just going to blend it out so how i like to blend it is i go down you just want to blend it out keep going until you see it's blended out you're going to blend up two you just want to blend it till it's all blended in and be patient you don't have to rush when i get it pretty blended out as i can with the brush i personally go in with my pinky and i'm just gonna blend it out okay and so then also i'm gonna go like this and blend right here in the front of my eyebrow just because i don't like it to be all harsh right here i like it to be real blend like look like hairs so i try to do the best i can with that and that comes with practice like you're just gonna learn as you go and again i'm taking my spoolie again and i'm just gonna blend it out making sure the lines not so harsh and remember eyebrows are they're not gonna be twins they sisters not twins okay now that we have finished the brows and this is what they look like we are going to eye shadow now i am still trying to learn how to do eyeshadows and try different things but i'm just going to do something real real simple i'm gonna prime my eyelids i feel like everyone should but definitely if you are darker and you want your colors to show up because it's a like a smooth base the color will pop up more like it's going to pop it's going to show like you want that color that eyeshadow just pop out on my lids that's what i like to do now this may be the only reason i do try a different concealer because i don't necessarily feel like it primes my lids the best i feel like i get something better to prime my lids but i'm just taking that same brush i'm pretty sure you're probably supposed to use a different brush but i just take the same one okay like this i'm being real with y'all i feel like this is what y'all need because y'all probably like i ain't got this so i'll be realistic y'all need all that stuff make your work what you got so this would be the brush i'm gonna use for this part too and you know use my finger to blend okay so you see like it did it did something but i didn't do too much and i mean maybe i probably could have put more but i don't want to just pack a whole bunch of my eyes so that's something i still have to work on myself it's on there all blended out so next let's talk about eyeshadow palettes now i am very thankful to have people in my life who usually support whatever i'm doing so for instance these juvia place palettes sorry it's upside down they a little pricey i believe but my best friend got them for me for christmas you know so i didn't always have these i didn't start off with these i had some that i got from the hair store and i still use it honestly but it's real broken get up please don't judge me this is nick aka nika nika yeah nick aka i don't know it's a new york i don't know nine new palette now it's broke that's why i got a rubber band on here don't even judge me i know it's real ghetto but don't look past that at the point that's the point and it has all these like neutral shades in there and so let me see if i can take it off for y'all without destroying it y'all it is really bad okay so it's all broken stuff um i think this was like a brown shade i don't remember but you guys get the concept okay like you don't have to go crazy with using crazy palettes like they have nice decent palettes in there and i say go for neutral shades when you're first starting you don't want to get something with a bunch of crazy colors because you're just starting so you want to just do natural looks and get the concept down then you can step outside your box and get crazy with the colors um i would use that palette but it's all broken don't have all the stuff in it but that's basically what i'm showing you okay you can use that palette but even with my julius place palette my best friend already knew so she got me like a neutral palette like what to start i can show you guys the other palette just for the heck of it that she's got me because she got them together so i'm gonna show you guys that one too it's more neutral too but it has a little more shimmer glam pop colors as you can see okay so i am going to use this palette actually i'm going to use this palette because i need a color that is like more of the concealer color kind of lighter because i'm kind of going to set that concealer that primer in place i'm going to do is take this shade right here and i'm just taking this um type of brush it is an elf brush it's an elf eye shadow brush so some of the brushes says the names but again y'all i don't i don't be knowing so i'm gonna take this brush to me it's like more like a pack brush you can pack it in i'm gonna just dab it and then i'm just going to pack it in backpack all right so i don't know if you can see the difference and i feel like my lighting is weird but yeah you're just setting it basically the way you set your contour you're going to set your eyes since this is a beginner friendly we're just going to do one shadow well i mean i guess that's kind of two because i said with a shadow but we're just going to do one now i'm taking this one is a bh cosmetic brush and like i said my mom and stuff they give me things so my mom had bought me some brushes and i really do like these brushes it's just like a fluffy brush looks like this and i'm just gonna take that in a brown color because i just want to do like a neutral color look like you can do whatever color you want but i recommend just because you're just starting use like a brown or something something kind of neutral gonna brush it in all over in circles you want to go in circles i have noticed if lid is a deeper crease in i do recommend going up higher so that way when your eyes are open you can see that color because if you have the type of eyes when you open your eyes you can't really see your lid then you're not going to see the color so what you want to do is kind of go higher a circular motion up to the top and just keep adding it like because this color is kind of lighter and like i said i don't have a good base that much you kind of can't see the color you can see it but i wish you could see it more which is why i want to invest in a concealer that's going to give me a base that will make this pop more but as you can see it's coming up and if you want it deeper like you want more depth in it add more okay boom you see that look at his eye look at it yeah so now we're just gonna do the other and make sure that you are blending in circle motions really well because you want it to be blended you do not want any harsh lines so i wouldn't add any more product necessary for this but you want to just kind of blend it out again in circular motions just to make sure it's soft and blended if you don't like it again add another color on top of it but always be mindful the lashes is going gonna make the look speaking of lashes before we get to lashes you also can do eyeliner you can stop here pop your lashes on i'm gonna show y'all because y'all might want to do liner and let me show let me show y'all so what i do i'm trying to get in close i like to pull my eye like this because it is really hard to get a good winged liner y'all will be here all day trying to get it so i'm going to show y'all my hacks that i do so i pull my eye like this and then i'm going to kind of just sketch like to me makeup is an art okay so i'm gonna sketch it like this what i do i like to sketch things kind of start from here and go inwards because i usually make it too bumpy if i don't do it like that and go small so i just kind of brush it and then make it longer as i go you can make it thicker too as you go but always start smaller because you can always make it bigger but making it smaller that's a hold of the ball game okay so that's how i do i don't like to do a whole bunch a whole lot of it and i also do this kind of eyeliner i don't know if it'll be easier to do a pencil or a marker kind i think i want to try the actual like the little pin kind but right now this is what i use i use this little wet one it's difficult i ain't gonna lie to y'all but you know all you can do is practice and you're just gonna keep on going slow so then i let go and that's when i start to do my wing so i do the bottom first and i'm just going to draw it out okay going kind of up then i'm going to take that top line and make the rest of it right okay make sure it is how i want it and then i'm going to fill it in i'm gonna add a little more i'm so scared to do a big dramatic y'all so i don't go too big it's definitely on my bucket list but i just ain't did it yet because you gotta get perfect you gotta perfect the um winged liner okay they have different things to help you make a winged liner but i haven't tried anything like that this is just what i do and it's it works for me and that's what it looked like also what i'll do is if i mess up too much i'll take that shadow and just cover it up you know you can't even tell so i'm gonna go ahead and do this other eye now we're about to pop on them lashes i get this from my local beauty supply and it is the missed lashes okay and they don't have whatever length that they are right there on the side but this is what it looks like it's in a gold little thing and these are like my favorite brand of lashes i really don't use any other kind they're not super expensive and they last you a long time now i they have used the 99 cent ones of dollar ones these can be like 299 399 and it depends on which length you get i've actually recently gone up to longer lashes so i usually get the ones they're like 3.99 but they last you for a long time so to me it's worth it try whatever lashes you like but i definitely recommend these ones now listen listen be your own person but i'ma be honest i use hair glue i probably shouldn't use hair glue but i use hair glue for lashes now if you want to go get you some real lash glue do you because that is i mean that's really what you're supposed to do so you know do you but me i ain't doing it i'm sorry i just can't i just can't it don't work for me i try to use it it come off and it just lasts me hanging flapping i just can't do it so i usually do i ain't gonna lie to you y'all can judge me talk about me bash me whatever but i use haircut okay that's just what it is and honestly i've seen some people who do lashes use hair glue too but i'm on my business putting individuals on with hair glue gonna take the lash and i'm just gonna squeeze it just a little bit you don't want too much and you want to just line it but be very very careful you don't want to get a lot that's another thing i do use hair glue but i don't use a lot like i don't go crazy don't go crazy with the glue now that's probably why people lashes falling out you can use tweezers or you can use your fingers fingers is kind of pro i don't know where my tweezers are to show y'all how to do it but basically if you're using tweezers you're going to clamp it in the middle of the lash and what you're going to do is you're going to angle it up you're going to look down well you're going to look down but you're kind of going to bring your head up because i mean i'm looking in the mirror and you're going to place it on top in the middle okay and then you're gonna fix the sides and boom that's how i put on my lashes i know some of y'all in this video so y'all watching this video y'all be wanting to know how i put my lashes on so fast baby that's how i do it okay that's how i do it because some of y'all be telling me like how you put your lashes on so far baby that right there boom and it's on also i forgot uh like a major major thing um measure your lashes to your eyes my lashes i mean my eye is slanted so with this brand i usually don't have to cut the lash like i don't really experience that i don't feel like they look funny look bad or nothing on me but i have put on some lashes for people where i need to cut it so measure to your eye it's okay to cut the lash to fit your eye like you ain't out here trying to look crazy so now we're just gonna do the other one just a little bit oh and i fan it a little bit to let it kind of dry so it'll stick and clamp it to your lash line if it's like not close enough so we are going to in the middle and get the corners and press against making sure you get those corners if your corners are lifting always go in and um add more and uh get the corners this is what it looking like big blinks period but again you don't have to do big blinks like that's not what you like don't go for big blinks okay so let's move to the next thing because uh this video is way longer than i expected it to be so listen my beauty blender has already been used i need to clean it i haven't cleaned it yet but don't judge me don't talk about me get you a fresh beauty blender that is not dirty you know you are going to get your foundation and i want to say i got these from walmart i heard these two were good but i didn't know which one i wanted to get which one i wanted to use so i ended up getting both and i ended up mixing both so this one is the dewy smooth fit me maybelline fit me and it is for normal to dry skin you also want to make sure that you pay attention to your skin i have dry skin so that i use stuff that is going to work for that but if you have oily skin you kind of want to recommend makeup for that foundation for that so yeah and this is in the color 360 mocha and then i have the dream this one's maybelline as well but it's the dream liquid mousse and it's an airbrushed finish and this color is in the 130 coco coca coca coco and it just looks like this and it's a pumper so what i do is i like to wet my uh beauty blender you don't want to drench it and i squeeze some of the water out a little bit because i don't want to be super wet i'm going to do is i'm going to take the fit me dump some out it's gonna be about like this much and then i'm going to use a little bit of a squirt like just one pump okay so it looks like this and then what i'm gonna do is just place it on my face in these areas i don't know how to explain it now i'm just gonna do that and then next i'm just gonna start blending it in and make sure you get your nose and looking up to make sure you get under there i don't like to use a lot so that's how much i use the first time now if i need more i'll add more but it just kind of depends on what kind of look you're going for making sure you get in by your ears just everywhere because you want it to be blended you don't want to miss any spots and then you look crazy and you blend into that hairline too because it will be a harsh line i like to blend try to blend this eyebrow out some more with it so i'll like dab it in there because i just don't like harsh lines like we'll blend it some more too but this right here is the blender i like to use a more natural look so i don't use a lot of foundation but that's just my preference now it's usually kind of gone by then so i'll dab just a little bit more not too much like that and add a little more again and um you're going to make sure you get your under your chin in your neck blend down to your neck please blend down to your neck because you're gonna look so funny if you don't make sure you got it everywhere next we're going back in with that la girl concealer and you're gonna squeeze some more out you can squeeze more out this time and what we're gonna do is we're gonna go right under the eye and i like to make this like a little triangle branch thing do the other side we're going to go down the middle down my nose i like to put a little right here got a mustache you know you can cover it up right here on the chin oh and then i like to make a tree in the middle and then i go down the side of my face sometimes not too much then we are going to go in with another concealer and this shade is going to be darker than your foundation i didn't want to go too dark with this and it's la girl uh pro concealer as well i didn't even tell you guys the shades of these this lighter one is coffee the lighter one and this one is dark cocoa so what i do is i kind of go around basically what i just did so i'm going to go right here a little bit i don't really go too crazy with the nose contour i like how my nose looks but i just want a little bit of dimensions because when you put that foundation it takes away the depth of your face so you want to just add it back in so we're going to go and do this side and then we're going to add a little bit right here and again this is just how i do it and then sometimes i add a little bit about my hairline i feel like it doesn't really do anything but i added around my face here as well i'm gonna do now is again this should still be wet and i'm gonna take the top of the beauty blender and i am just going to blend it out and you just want to keep blending until it's all blended out again this is where i was talking about the eyebrows yeah i said that right y'all know i can't talk and i've been missing my words thank y'all for not judging me and talking about me in the comments and we're just blending everything out okay so here's a contour brush this is a elf brush and it says contouring brush so we're just gonna blend this out the dark contour you just want to make sure you're getting all of it anywhere that you missed like where you can see it and it's not blended in you'll go back and keep blending this is not a rash you just want to keep blending you can go back and forth maybe you missed something with the light concealer okay i like to take this la colors make makeup contour palette that i got from the beauty supply as well i'm definitely going to try something different but this is again what i did to start out with and they had a whole bunch of colors but clearly as you can see i've been using them and what i'm going to do is i'm going to take this lighter color for my contour on the other side of this beauty blender and i'm just going to kind of bake because i am dark skinned i don't do a lot of bacon and because i don't know what i'm doing and so i don't want to mess it up i'm not a professional makeup artist when i first did this i used way too much because i'm like okay i see people baking they'd be sitting there you know be sitting on there and stuff like that i was like yeah let me not do that because i look like a ghost i took a picture because i knew i was going to be going out and i took a picture y'all i looked a mess and this honestly is kind of too light for my face but as you can see i'm running out of color so and i would use this one but i feel like it comes out a little bit too orange but i might try today and double it up for y'all yeah let me double it up let me try this color on there and see what happens look at me i look at the gloves right so now i'm going to take this total face brush it's the elf brush as well and i go in with a brown shade and i just go like this and i just brush all that off it's not going to take away the um contour that i just did i'm gonna brush until it's off because i definitely put too much on there like i said i'm not taking out any of my mistakes because i want y'all to see in case i make them too and i just add myself back and see let's do this side so you guys can see the difference see how this side i'm back and this side i'm still ghosty yeah so that's what this is what i learned when i messed up that time so i just keep doing this i think once i try different products maybe i'll do it differently but as of now with what i have because i feel like you should just work with what you have this is what i do still be cute and getting the compliments oh real cute people still be asking me do they make up and i don't even do makeup that's good enough to me just keep blending if it's any harsh lines like i always say so that is that you would think we done but baby now we gotta do a little cute stuff when i first started what i would do is i would use this eyeshadow palette that i had and i would just use this and make it as a highlight because i didn't have the actual highlight again make it do what you have you know you don't have to go crazy buying things for your makeup because i use eyeshadow as a highlight a lot but you can also buy highlight like this one was given to me it's a jordana glowing glow and go creamy strobing stick so when i first used this it was kind of hard for me and i didn't really know what i was doing but i've been trying to get into it lately i forgot the hack what i'm gonna do is spray my face and right now i'm using this mario badescu badescu care space but i don't know y'all one of my sisters used this and it was really good i liked it but you can get setting spray from anywhere you can get any kind of setting spray if you're at the hair store walmart already just traveling them elf is really good nyx is good all that just try anything but part is the hack okay so i'm going to spray my face we're going to let it dry a little bit not all the way and then go on before it's all the way dry we're gonna go in with this highlight okay this is how i do mine and i like to do my lip a little bit my nose i love a good nose i don't know why and then i like to do my uh brow bone right there and what i'm gonna do i like to blend with my fingers that's my preference you definitely don't have to use your fingers you can go in with a brush maybe like a eyeshadow brush or something and you can just put it in but i personally like the finger i feel like you get a really good blend with your finger and so you can kind of see that you see that i don't know if you can see on this side because the way the lighting is but oh you can kind of see it yeah and then you can just add more if you want more i think i'm actually gonna go ahead and add this eyeshadow one just to show you guys so i'm going to take my finger and again just rub it a little bit on the nose up and down then take it on the brow bone and i like to blend with the finger that doesn't have all that on there and honestly i kind of put a lot y'all i'm just gonna dab here see with this it's not gonna be as harsh because you're already dabbing with your finger and really just you can add it anywhere you like those are just the places i go for my highlight but you can put it anywhere i look like a highlighter after that i like to go in and i use a mascara you can use any mascara for real y'all but right now i've been using this la colors dramata lash defining mascara and i use let me open it show y'all a small brush like this because i feel like it gets those bottom lashes better and we're just gonna go in and you can do a couple uh layers i feel like the more layers the more they stick out but i don't want to go crazy with it and now we're going to go in for the final time is spray and we just got fanny baby now for the lip i feel like you don't have to go crazy with the lips like i just really don't get you a lip liner i this actually is a brow pencil but it was brown and i couldn't find a brown one where i was at i was at dollar tree so i just got this and i use it as a lip liner and basically i like it because it has like the pencil sharpener on there so you're just gonna line your lip you go in with a lip gloss y'all any kind of lip gloss you want i use lip oil you know what i'm saying i actually did get this get gloss victoria secret from a little goodie bag from a bridal shower that i have went to but i mean you can use any lip gloss y'all and y'all know beast but i got so much lip gloss like just get any kind and you're gonna put this on top this one's kind of a pink color but you can use clear or you can use the shade whatever you want and honey did you see that easy lip combo i mean you can do lipstick and you know try different lip combos but this is such a simple lip combo and it comes out so cute like y'all look at this makeup and i don't know what i'm doing i'm not a makeup artist i just try stuff and this is drugstore products most of them anyway you can get this liquid drugstore products baby baby like oh you looking like she's real cute pretty i feel neat look good yogi all right like i said i really don't know all the techniques special things

what make you happy okay what makes you feel good and maybe i feel fabulous okay so i really hope you guys like this video make sure you like you share you subscribe and you comment and i will see you guys in my next video bye [Music]", "nDOaAetXRBQ": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] this is like the most crowded market I've ever been to this parts okay but a lot of it is very crowded we're in the more Indaba markets and then just sent us down here there's like a woman under the table selling a wild pretty quran yeah just it looks like a kidney bean this I would like a couple bucks is that is covered in flies so this is called canal did and it was 100 ariani how much is that one right 200 oh I doubt he's big couple that for one big for one big up that's how much I love it about 11 cents well I'm fairly sure this love child Phoenix species for the same genus as maple sweet great we found something cool that's why it's important to look for the vendors that are under the tables everywhere you go their vendors above the table and under the table I've never seen that before but it's kind of amazing I mean it made sense you know you get twice as much twice as much product for the same amount of booth space so they probably paying for the space and then you know he's renting out the bottom half to their friend so that's pretty cool yeah it's very tiny like jelly bean shaved date and so small my camera won't focus on it there we go it looks like the size of a kidney bean it's kind of adorable and yeah it was kind of interesting getting this at the market people sell stuff on top of the table and they sell stuff below the table it actually scared the out of me when I saw it because I was like walking through and then I see the hands coming out from underneath and it's good like yeah like people are trying to maximize their shop space I think people there are separate things being sold so I think maybe whoever selling it on the top they rents out the bottom to somebody else maybe to save money on the shops I've never seen that but never seen that in the world I mean if I was in Santa Monica and I sub rented out my the space underneath my tables you should totally like super creepy can I rent the bottom of your table just to freak people out and like grab people's ankles that would not make me the most loved farmer yeah very very surprising and someone was selling it and it's like this market was rough dude like these were covered with just a ton of flies yeah so many flies and I didn't want to eat them I was thinking like maybe I just like awkward situation because there's like rare fruit I haven't had but covered in flies and terrifying I just know it's gonna make me sick but then outside there was a woman selling them and she handed out like four of these little jelly beans to me and tried to like rip me off I got like one big bag from the lady under the table for 12 cents which is nothing but for fruit that's normal and this lady had like four of them that she was trying to give me for the same amount and then she didn't give me my change back there's this like she like had like this little like like smile on her face I'm like if you're gonna rip me off like do a better job you know like don't give me four of these but anyway I digress let's eat it so here you take one really would feel comfortable like washing this first but I didn't and I'm gonna take my chances yeah these these ones are from the woman's pocket not from the fly covered ones they might have had flies on it before but yeah they look a little bit better they're not super sticky the ones that comes and flies were sticky yeah hmm big seed mm-hmm that is just about the size of a normal date seed here's the fruit and the seed next to each other there's like no edible pulp they're very very low the sweet what this got sweetness is quite high up there with like a date flavors good mmm thank you really tasty hmm tastes like um not like a typical date just like dulce de leche okay do you have any anything to add there even it tastes almost identical to the fruit of the Canary Island date palm which is another species from the the date palm genus which is called Phoenix okay so there's like six different species in the genus mm-hm and this is this is one of them we saw trees growing around that looked like date palms with both the same leaf and everything else so this might be Phoenix reticula nada okay but it is definitely a Phoenix species and it's an endemic one and people do harvest it and collect it yeah we saw it for sale by a couple people not not a ton of people had it for sale at the market I think it's something that people just like take and eat but yeah it's actually super tasty like that's by date like so variable there's so many different varieties out there but as far as this one goes like that's super taste that's like up there with like my favorite kind of dates only thing is that there's like so this is like almost no flesh there's like such a little amount that you're not getting a lot of fruit when you eat it but it's a fun snack like that would be a fun thing to pick up at the market just grab something like like to have like a candy you know yeah so yeah that's about it so see you next time well I really hope you enjoyed that video guys if you did you may want to check out the video that

birthday to Pierre today I'm gonna make him a birthday cake and I'm sure a lot of you have seen that recipe that's featured or over Pinterest the cake with the Smarties and like the chocolate covered biscuits surrounding it I am going to make something like that but with my own spin and we're going to add a twist we're going to have the Smarties box pouring down onto the cake so I am a very very brave lady because I've never made that feature before so we're going to do it today on camera so please don't be angry if it doesn't work out we're going to try it together and we'll see if it is as easy as it looks okay I have already precooked my cakes yesterday I made two citrus of them orange and lemon cakes because Pia loves citrus so you can really use whatever you want chocolate vanilla strawberry whatever I've done orange lemon and I made a cream cheese butter frosting because I think that will taste quite good with the citrus cakes he also loves white chocolate so I have decided to go with white Kit Kats to surround the cake you can also buy little chocolate-covered biscuits and put those all around the outside or you could do dark KitKat or milk chocolate Kit Kats whatever your favorite preferences you can also make it with M&Ms as well I'm going with Smarties because these were my favourite as a child so let's go through what you will need to make this recipe you will need two sponge cakes some frosting of your choice chocolate to melt sweets such as M&Ms or Smarties and chocolate to surround the cake I am using Kit Kat you will also need a length of ribbon a straw preferably with a pliable end and a wooden dial set aside your other ingredients and start by frosting your cake remember to frost the sides as well what I love about this cake is that it does not have to be frosted perfectly as long as it has frosting over it so we can attach the sweets it's very forgiving your cake does not have to be iced well at all because you're going to be covering it with the chocolate like this that's what I like about this cake is that a lot of these cakes that you see on the Internet they look so easy but you really need to be a professional to ice them this on the other hand does not require a professional hand the chocolate hides everything so start by attaching your chocolate all around the cake now you're going to use your straw and reinforce it with a wooden dial reserve your smarty box or your Eminem's packet and what we're going to do awesome all right you're stuck in the right point I should just make this a little bit short perfect then this is going to bend and this is what the effect is going to be we are going to put our Smarties Fox into our straw and it is going to look as such into the cake pouring down so now the next step is to cover the straw in candy Smarties this is about the hardest step of all in this process start covering your straw in candy I've used melted chocolate but waiting for it to harden a little bit so it's quite pasty and chunky otherwise the sweets just keep sliding off insert your straw into the cake quite deep ensuring that all your sweets are hardened to the straw that the chocolate has had time to harden using one of your reserved smarty boxes you are then going to place it at an angle to make it look like the candy is pouring in I'm going to use the strands to try tidy up the areas where the chocolate is showing the hardest part of this is definitely getting the sweets to attach to the straw and it's quite hard to hide the chocolate as well so that you just need to have patience with patience and allow to drive very well before you continue with the next step so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to add my Smarties in almost like the pouring effect is that they're all running out the box onto the cake ooh there's a fiery he loves it when I do that type of little I can I need to see and you can add as much as you want obviously you can cover the whole top of the cake in this model if you want I'm gonna do a portion I know what the whole cake is I really want to go for the poor in kind of a thick and then I'm going to attach some here jay-z's just smile is everywhere this is when you mean children to run around and just be eating them up that's what I would be doing putting the road school okay how's that looking hmm okay so the finishing touch which is optional is to put a little ribbon around the front and I'm going to tie a little bud since it is a birthday cake so you can also use an ask bright color wonderful put it on the place what can looks better Yallah connection around the base I'm wondering if I should do a bow or if I should just leave let me try a bow and I'll decide however now that the bow is all tied my cake is finished and I'm very happy with the overall appearance it's not perfect but the hardest part is definitely attaching the sweets I'm pretty excited to try this cake it had everything that I loved Smarties chocolate so PRP was going to be impressed with this birthday cake our hope and guys for the skips they'll be pasted down below and remember to like and subscribe", "uqDDevN-a5Y": "I want to give a great, wonderful,\nthank you to Gina, for introduction, for introducing me and giving me\nthis opportunity to share with you all how to do my cut paper design.\nIt really is a pleasure. It's a really detailed\ntype of process to do. So I'm hoping that at least I'll\nget you started with doing one, and then if you don't finish, then\nyou can finish it on your own, but before I go into\nthat, as you know, this, given that workshop is called\n\"Mathematically Artistic And Then Some,\" but the reason why I call it ...\"And\nThen Some,\" is because math and art, they just simply go hand in hand, and the\n\"And Then Some,\" is the creativity element that we bring to it. So I'm going to ask you all just to simply\nlet your spirits be free to go ahead and create whatever comes to your mind. I'm going to kind of walk\nyou through some things, but you can use your own little essence\nto add to it at the same time. Before I get started with that, I wanted to show you also where you\ncan also find art in different things. For instance, this particular structural sculpture I found at one of\nour little local Hobby Lobby stores, and this gives you a\nlot of geometry in here. You have your circle in the\nmiddle, you have your cylinder, and at the same time\nyou got all the other, it looks to be like kind of\nrectangular shapes and so forth. But this is just letting you know that\nthere's tons and tons of art around about you. Another example would be in these. I know that some of you see all the time\nwhen you go out different designs and things, that is your art, also as a part of mathematics. As we scan over here, I wanted to\nshow you some other things here. We looked at our materials\nthat we wear all the time, but we don't oftentimes think about them\nhaving geometry as a part of them. This happens to be an example of\nthe mud cloth- mud cloth hat that I was able to purchase\nseveral years ago. And then also we have this\ngiven woven kente cloth. Also we have a woven and also\nit is, it's embroidered on here, lots of unique\ndesigns as well, using mathematics, you'll see the triangle or, triangular design as a part of it\nand the circular design as well. Other examples of kente cloth,\nbeautiful elaborate designs. Just a couple more here. And then this one I just quite love\nbecause it's really, really intricate. And as I said, I love\nto go to Hobby Lobby. This happens to simply be a\ncharger and on the front of it, it was that fabric of, kind of like a burlap cloth, and what I simply did was I used this\ngiven item to make the geometric designs on it. You have your circles, you have your triangles and it had\nbeen rounded out, your diamond shapes. That's another example. And another thing I love to do is to\ngo to estate sales or just any antique shows. This is a very great, nice piece\nthat we were able to pick up recently. It has of course, a square top.\nThere's your mathematics in it. It has circles and squares embedded.\nIt has little hearts. It has diamonds. It has all of that. So here's another\nexample of using art and math together. Since it's Black History Month, I don't want to forget to note down the\nfact that we are celebrating that for the month. And as you know, or maybe you don't know, the history of\nthe African slaves as they were trying to escape into freedom. This particular one here is\nreferred to as The North Star. This is a cut paper\npattern. Believe it or not, but it also was used in the quilts. And then we have this one, too.\u00a0 It's\ncalled The Flying Geese, denoting that head North. Because when you go North\nto Canada, that's where you're going to get your freedom. Aside from that, too.\nI've got a couple of more designs here. I just want to give you a feel so you can\nsee that art and mathematics really do go hand-in-hand. We don't think about it.\nWe just simply see it. And we like it. And then we, well we end up buying it. Here's some other examples of Kente\ncloth here. Another example, too, that's done with marker.\nAnd another example here. That's just to give you an idea\nabout how you can begin to view art. When you buy something, when you purchase\nsomething, when you consider making it. There's like I said, lots of angles,\nlots of linear parallels, intersecting lines, all of that. We can't\nescape it. So without any further ado, I want to go ahead and get us started.\nJust a quick review on the materials. You should have something like cardstock paper, your black tag board, also. A ruler, your eraser, your pencil, your scissors, and also, I cannot live without\nthis. This is so important. This is the double stick tape, because you don't want to glue\neverything down immediately. We want to go ahead and tag\nit in place, tack it in place, and then maybe go back and remove it or\nput it back or whatever the case may be. This is invaluable. Remember that. Okay, Some of the other artists that\nhave influenced me with getting my creativity going. One of my favorite artists\nhappens to be Wassily Kandinksy. He does a lot of abstract art.\nAnother really, really great one. I just recently discovered him\nand I've liked his work forever. His name is Victor Vasarely\nand his work is very green. He's known as a grandfather\nof optical illusions. And also there's M.C. Escher that has his beautiful work that's out\nthere, too. So some of these artists, you may be familiar\nwith, some you may not, but I would like to really encourage\nyou to look up Victor Vasarely, Wassily Kandinsky and also please\nlook up M.C. Escher for some of their work. Now let's go ahead and get started\nbecause time is going to get away from us, but let's have some fun with\nit. So what I've done here, maybe kind of hard to see it- it's either- You can't quite see some-\nLet me move on to another one. Here's a piece here\nthat I started to do, just to let you know that this is the\nsame black tag board that you're going to be using to create your work\non, but when you're doing it, I normally don't do the lines\nthis dark. Like I said, you could not even see these lines\nbefore. I would like to encourage you, don't make the lines too deep and dark\nbecause when it comes to erasing those lines off, it tends to leave a little\nbit of whiteness on your board. But I wanted to show you that these are\ndifferent designs and so forth, that can be created. I did the circular shape.\nThere's your mathematics, once again. These are actually triangles, not triangles, but rectangles. Irregular rectangles. And if\nyou look at the nose part, it's made up of triangles, also.\nEarrings and circles and whatever else, but whenever I'm creating something, I really don't think about it being\ncreated in terms of shapes and circles. I just create it because it looks\npretty and it goes together. Okay. Some other examples, would be\nthis given one here. Yeah. That's just a design\nwith a lot of flair to it. Look at all the geometric design,\nyour rectangles, triangles, whatever the case may be. There's lots of things happening there\nand lots of energy flowing from it. And then I've got one more\non this side. Initially, I thought, \"I would love\nfor these guys to do this.\" If you like this given piece quite\na bit, I've got patterns for it. So I can go ahead and have Gina put it\ntogether for you and then maybe email it out to you or whatever the case.\nBut this is really, really neat, but it's kind of intricate, so I decided\nnot to do this given one. Instead, we're going to do something\nthat looks like these. Okay. And in the very, very off-center part you see a cross that goes down here\nand then there's my lines that are darkened in a little bit so we can go back in and put the\ndifferent shapes that go along with it. And this one: nothing's glued down yet\nbecause I'm still playing around with it. But you'll see that the lines there,\nthe wider colored lines, those are- we're going to take your paper and\nthen you cut it and put it into place. Okay. So let's go ahead and grab our paper,\nthe black paper, as I clear my desk here. Grab your ruler and your pencil. GINA: Lisa, can I ask you something?\nSo your artwork, it reminds me\nof stained glass a lot. How did you start working with paper? And can you talk a little\nbit about that history? LISA: I would love to. I first started dabbling with just\nsimply using the black paper. You know, it was something different and unique\nbecause I used to only use white paper to color or not to color, but white paper to\ndraw. And I said, well, let me try this. And so I went ahead and used the pattern\nnotion for my stained glass to start doing it on this given paper. And\nthen it ended up being something neat. I had my father-in-law say, \"why\ndon't you, why don't you do this more, but on a bigger scale?\" So that's what got me doing it much\nlarger than the smaller versions of it. Okay. Yes. Here we go. With your paper\nplease in hand, hold it vertically. And what I want for you to do is take\nyour ruler, place it horizontally on your page. And you're going to\nmeasure over, three inches. At the very top of the paper,\nmake a three inch mark. Go down and make\nanother three inch mark. You're going to do three of these marks. It's hard to see it. And also I should have told you at the\nsame time to make three and three quarter mark as well. So you have a three inch\nmark and a three and three quarter mark. That's going to be your vertical line\nthat you're going to use for your cross. Please go ahead, turn your paper and line up\nthose marks and connect them. Once again, don't make it too heavily dark because\notherwise it's going to be hard to erase it later on. Okay, so when you look at it, you should have a line that\nlooks like this on your page. Continuing on, now take your\npaper, turn it horizontally. This time, what you're going to do is measure\napproximately three and a half inches and four and one fourth. Once again, it's three and a half inches\nand four and one fourth. You're going to do three of those. The reason why I like to do three of\nthose, because it really lines it up. If you do two, sometimes one is a little bit askew\nand it doesn't end up coming out to be straight. Okay, once again, connect those dots or lines\nof the marks that you need. So now you have a structure\nthat looks like this. You have a cross on your page,\nokay? Now taking your paper. Whenever I work with the paper,\nI tend to use a lot of colors. The reason why is because I\nwant that contrast. I want the lights, I want the darks. I want the nuances\nbetween my greens and my yellows. And you'll see what I'm talking about here. So these are papers that I've already\nbeen cutting on and I'm notorious for not throwing scrap paper away because you're going\nto find that you're going to need that paper, that little baby strip or that\nlittle corner. So don't throw away any scrap paper because\nactually you can put it into your, your artwork and it makes it\nlook really kind of neat. Okay. I'm going to start off first by working\non the vertical line that you see here. Okay? And, If you look at the colors\nthat I've selected, when I talked about\nthe difference in that, the greens and the\nblues and whatever else, I like to have that variation\nof color, because like I said, it adds a certain richness.\nAnd even with my blues here, like a little darker blue,\nit's not much different, but whenever you put it together and side\nby side, it makes your whole image pop a little bit more. And I also, I love- my favorite colors happen to be-\nYou'll see, in most of my artwork, I love teal. This color, I just can't\nget away from it. And my yellows, I love yellows and oranges\nand reds, anything bright. So I'm going to use these colors. So since we're doing the\nvertical side of our design, and I do know that it measures\napproximately, let me go back. I think it's about three fourths. Yes.\nIt measures about three fourths wide. So I like to tell people to take\nthe straight edge of your paper. You should have a straight\nedge cutting anything out. So go ahead and measure\nthree fourths on that one. And by the way, I normally have\nmy music going very loud. And I'm normally not talking, but I solve a lot of world problems whenever\nI'm doing this kind of paper design. It's a lot of thing. Okay? So if you\nhave any, any quandaries out there, just send them my way. I\ncan tell you the answer. I'm just kidding.\u00a0 Ok, now with your\npaper and your scissors, your famous scissors. I have two different types of\nscissors, by the way, that I use. I love these little teeny scissors here.\nI don't know if you kind of see them, but the- the tip of it's very,\nvery fine. And these I like, because I can do broader cuts with\nit. We're going to use these right now. So I'm going to go ahead and cut this. And I normally do a lot of\neyeing of things whenever I'm cutting. So you're going to see right now that\nit basically fits that given vertical line, but I'm not going to keep it like that\nbecause you're going to see it's so much funner if you can add a little bit of\ndesign in with it as you're creating it. Like if you notice on this one, I\ndecided to put an angle in there. And on this one, I put a sort\nof a partial circle in with it. So once again, using your creativity and the colors\nthat you want to put together, you can create whatever\nyou want to create. But right now I'm going to take\nthis and use this pencil here and just simply do a\nbit of an arc with it. I'm going to cut it. GINA: Hi, Lisa, Lisa, we have a\nrequest. LISA: Yes. GINA: To go slower. Oh, okay. I'm notorious for doing that.\nAnd I am so sorry about it. GINA: We, we only have so much time, but. LISA: Yes, I wish I were in person with you. That way I would go slower and\nit would be walking around. So thank you for that. I will slow down. Okay. Using this special\ntape, double stick tape. I'm going to go ahead- And I normally put the tape in\nthe mid section of it because I sometimes slide paper underneath it\nwhenever I'm putting other pieces with it. So I just simply tape\nit in place like that. Now, what I want to do is add\na little bit of red with it. I'm trying to slow down. I'm sorry that was going fast because I know\nthat I'm kind of crunched on time here. Okay. You're going to see that I simply placed the red\npaper underneath and I went ahead and marked it off. Okay. I marked it off and now because it doesn't\nfit perfectly, excuse me, I'm going to take my pencil and the curvature part there,\nI've drawn the pencil mark there. It's kind of hard to see it, but\nI made a pencil mark on it. I don't know if you can see it or not. And now what I'm going to do is\ncut that. When I do my cut paper design, the same thing with stained glass, notice\nhow it always had that lead part, that lead part delineates one piece from\nthe other part. Well, with cut paper, the black is acting as though\nit's actually the lead. So I'm going to go ahead\nand use my tape again. GINA: Ah, that's really interesting.\nThe papers acting as the lead. LISA: Yes, yes. GINA: I had someone here, Maria Lana Queen. LISA: Yes. GINA: She says she works with your sister\nPamela, and she's really inspired.\nLISA: OH! Hi there! it's good that you're joining us! GINA: She's asking if you can clarify, if you can maintain the revert- the tape as opposed to\nusing glue. So I guess, can you use just the tape or\ndo you also need to use glue? the tape is right now just to adhere\nthings to the page, and the glue is very important because later on, it just\nkeeps everything in place. I've known this to kind of flip\nup. If you see, it just flips up, so you don't want that happening. You\nwant it to be all the way, you know, stuck down and adhere to the paper. GINA: So we're just kind of designing\nright now and sticking and, Thank you. LISA: Okay. As you can see, we have this going at the very top of it\nand because I want the red to have more of an essence and pop\nto it, I'm going to now taking the straight edge of my paper. And then on the horizontal\npart that goes across here, I'm just going to look at and\nlay it down. And once again, it's three quarters of an inch. And I want that to be my\ncentral focus on the cross. So I'm simply to go ahead and cut that.\nAnd I'm going to put a little- a little curvature to this one as well. You're going to see that as you do\nthe different cuts in your paper, it makes it, it kind\nof makes it sing and hum to you. Like case in point, back\nhere, when I was doing some of these initially, you'll see that the\ndesigns like they're straight lines, but then I kind of put other rectangles\nand linear lines in with it or a circle. And then on top of\nit, I put something else. Or with these linear lines I\nput a curvature with it. You don't have to feel stuck into\njust making your line straight. As I said, the curves kind of give it\na bit of life in it and move into the actual design itself. Okay. Using\nthis one that I just cut right now, I'm going to put it down. And\nlike I said, I want it to move. So I'm going to put another little-\nand it's going to be a thinner. And that's like, kind of, you're\ngoing to see what I'm talking about. Okay, Do you see what's happening there? Not that\nI'm going to get rid of this part, I'll use it elsewhere in my design, but I just simply cut it away\nand it gives it a different feel. And because, as I said, I want\nthe red to be the focal part. I'm now going to go here and\nhave it overlap the midsection and the piece that I just cut off, I now want to use it\nfurther down in my design. So now you have something like\nthis going. And like I said, if I don't like that shape, which right\nnow, I'm not really feeling it a lot. I know I'm going to come and cut that\npart because it's just not talking to me. A lot of my designs as I\ndo them. I normally do it, I put the tape on it,\nand I step away from it. Sometimes I don't return to it for like\nmaybe a day or two, because like, I mean, it's overwhelming because you see so\nmuch that you want to create with that. But you know, it's just not\nsaying what you want it to say. So I step away from it. I think\nmost artists tend to do that. Now it has a different\nmessage going with it. And I'm going to come alongside here,\nwith maybe something orange and then maybe not exactly red next to it. Maybe a little bit of orange there and\nthen some more red and then some yellow. Does anybody have any questions? GINA: Lisa, we have one of\nour instructors asking. So the choice for paper, as opposed\nto the stained glass, is it, was it because the equipment to do\nthe actual stained glass is prohibitive? LISA: No. I stopped doing stained\nglass when I became pregnant. That was some years ago. And the\nreason why is because the lead, at that given time I was using lead, and\nthat lead is not good for your unborn child. And so I stopped\ndoing the stained glass. I still have a lot of glass left and\nI still want to get back into it. It is probably a little bit more costly\nbecause you have your copper and then your grinding wheel, and then you got all these things that\ngo into it. You got to have your nails, your board. There's a lot of things. And\nplus you have to have it framed out. I've got a piece actually back behind\nme. If I could just show you real fast, it was my first\npiece. Believe it or not. This piece here. GINA: A little hard\nto see. LISA: It's hard to see it. Well, it's, it's actually two love doves. And I knew that I had the\nartistic ability to do it, but I didn't want to pay somebody\nall that money to do it, so I took a class for $50 and I ended up getting the skill. And for years and years\nfor Christmas presents, I would give away stained glass pieces\nor whatever the case may be. It's just a lot of fun to create\nlike that, but I mainly do- I mainly gave it up because of\nthe lead reason. I do paper because it's quick and it's easy. Well I shouldn't say it's quick and it's\neasy, it's quicker and it's easier than doing the- doing the stained\nglass. It's just safer. It's for safety. And I have to admit there was,\nthere was a point in time, I was rushing to get a piece done\nand I didn't have my goggles on. And I was just kind of, I'm\ngoing to do a quick little grind, just get the edge down and a little fleck\nof glass, kind of like landed right in the corner of my eye. And so I was like, I better wear my goggles from now on. So that's the main reason also,\naside from it being the lead. GINA: There's a second part to the\nquestion, if your- it's, so I guess it wasn't the cost\nreally that was prohibitive, but I guess if it was for somebody, would it be something like a home ceramic\nstudio where people pool their resources or like a school\nor community center? I guess they're asking, \"how can people kind of do this\non a budget?\" LISA: The stained glass on a budget? GINA: Like by pulling, getting\ntogether with each other or... LISA: That's quite doable. I do know that\nthere's a shop over where I live. It's called \"Hand of Man.\" I don't\nknow if she gives classes or not, but I actually took a class with someone\nfrom a studio that was called, \"Glassica.\"\u00a0 They were in Mission. GINA: Oh!\nLISA: Do you know him? GINA: I knew people who worked there. LISA: Yes. But you know what, actually,\nI was always in the studio so much, they thought I worked there. I was answering the telephones\nand doing all sorts of things\njust so I could get some studio time, but they didn't mind\nit. It was so helpful. I learned so much from them because\nthey knew how to do it. GINA: Right. LISA: Yeah, but it's not really as expensive as\nmuch- as most people think it may be. You know, it's, I mean, I don't know\nwhat you consider to be expensive. Any hobby- GINA: A lot of art is- a lot of art is, it comes\nwith the territory, right?\nLISA: Yes it does! GINA: I guess a last part of\nthe question is, you kind of mentioned\nwith Glassica, where did you do stained\nglass and for how long? LISA: I did stained glass from 1985 to 1990. And then I did a little\nbit more there after cause I would make some pieces for\npeople after my baby was born. I did it maybe until like 1993, 94, something like that. Now mind you I was\nalso working as a teacher. So art is always done on the\nside, especially over here. GINA: That's what I was thinking. The paper seems a little more immediate\nand doable when you're teaching full-time and- LISA: Oh, I'll tell you, yes. Gina: Okay. I'll stop interrupting you for a second. LISA: Oh, its no problem.\nI really like you asking questions. GINA: We do have a question, if the larger\nframe behind you is for sale. LISA: It actually is for sale.\nIf he wants to visit my website,\nyou're more than welcome to. It's Lisa Irby Art.\nand it is for sale. Check it out!\nIt'll look beautiful in your home. I really had the privilege\nas of late to- to- to gift my sisters with some\nof my artwork. And I, you know, I've always given them things because I\njust love them so much and everything. But these, these sisters\nare so dear to me. So I gave them one was\ncalled the Essence of Beauty. It's actually on the website\nand the other one is, oh gosh, the name is slipping me right now. I can't remember right now. Do you\nremember the name of it? Anyway, I gave those to them because\nthey- it, it spoke to them. One of them actually looks like one of\nthe art pieces. That's why she got it. And the other one, it was because it\nwas- it was her time for retirement. And this was kind of symbolic\nof her next steps. You know, when she's going be journeying.\nGINA: Very nice. LISA: Here's what I've done so far, we can see where it's kind of taking up\nand picking up a little bit of energy. And I still feel like I want to put other-\nsomething in here as well, in this red part of it. Like I said, I put the stickiness on the back\nof it because if I don't like it, I can always go back and cut it\nout and change it up, okay. So let me go ahead and move forward to\na couple that are almost done. Okay. Let's look at this one.\nThis one's almost done. So what I want to show you right now is\nhow I block in the larger pieces of it. Okay. And as you can see,\nit has multiple colors, I think at least seven or eight colors\nthat I have going here. So I'm going to, I'm examining it to see, like, what\ncolor do I want to speak to me? And I think I need\nsomething green and vibrant. So I'm going to choose this\npiece. And when I do it, because it has the straight\nedges all already in place, I'm going to go ahead and just\nline it up with that edge. And I do, like I said, a lot of eyeing. GINA: When you sent the images\nthrough email: gorgeous, but I had no idea how beautiful\nthey were until we were hanging them. And there's\njust so much texture to them, and I can't even explain\nit, but they're beautiful. And then some of the, I remember\nyou telling me that some of your acrylic\npaintings, they start as just abstract expressions\nand then slowly they form into these ideas, and, and then I saw you took some of those\nand incorporated them into the cut paper designs. So that was like, even a step further.\u00a0 So beautiful. I, I really enjoy creating things. A lot of my inspiration comes from my\nbelief as a Christian. My- like this, the inspiration behind this one that\nwe have, I have behind me. It's, there's a cross in it. And you'll see, there's a lot of\nsymbolism with my artwork, because I feel like there's this\nmessage that I need to share, because it's so much a part of\nwho I am. I know this day and age, a lot of people are like, \"Oh, they'll\ntalk about-\" Well, it's who I am. This is really who I am. And my art\nspeaks to the heart of who I am, which is, I love Jesus Christ. And so\nthis particular piece, as you see here, when I started doing it, it was\nsupposed to be these quadrants. There was a quadrant here, a\nquadrant there, and there, and there. So it's going to be four across, another\nfour, another four, and another four. And I had to step away\nfrom it because it was, it was overwhelming to me because\nthis, I just can't do this thing. I don't want to do it. So\nwhen I came back to it, I began to all of a sudden put in\nthe Sun. And then from there, here comes this person that's\ncoming out from who knows where, and this is actually Jesus\nhere. If you focus in down here, you see there's a person, and this\nperson has their arms out like this. And there's another person they share\nthe same heads. So this person's head, that's actually a ministry. It's also helping to care for someone\nwho's kind of seated like this. And so he's wrapping his arms around\nhim saying like, \"I'm right here with you. You're not in this by yourself. We\ncan walk through this together.\" Well, as a Christian, what happens with me and those others\nthat are believers, Christ lives within us. So we can't help, but help other\npeople. We're his hands, we're his feet, we're his mouthpiece.\nWe're meant to share him. And so all these little round circles, that's like the Holy spirit is moving\naround and about. And then you see here, there are these lights, these candles, and then this is a hill and it's symbolic, basically of us being lights in the hill, putting\nour message out there to the world, shining brightly. This particular one\nis called Son, which is Jesus Christ, The son. Son to Sun, because as you know, the Sun gives us light and\nlife. Well, Jesus Christ for me, gives me light in my spirit. He gives\nme life, and there's a cross right here, which was not intentional, but\nit ended up coming out as well. So a lot of my work when I'm creating it, I don't really know how it's going\nto turn out. It just sort of evolves and it becomes this thing and it\njust happens. So like with these, these just happen. GINA: It's really neat. I love the intuitiveness of it. And, a message kind of working\nthrough you too. I don't think that can be taught, right? LISA: I think all of us have it in us, but\nare we listening? I think we can do it. We just have to kind of step\nback and get away from ourselves long enough just to see what's, what's going\nto come out of this? We've got a voice, but what does that voice saying to\nus? Is it giving positive stuff? Negative stuff? I choose to believe\nthat, I want that positive voice. I've got a lot to share and my artwork\nis when we- that I go back sharing it. By the way, speaking of being a little\nbit too close, it's kind of hard to see, but here it's too close. You can't\neven see the delineation and I want it- I want it to show up. So I'm going\nto now go back in and trim it off. And you're going to see how it pops a\nlittle bit more because I'm trimming it. I don't know if you can see\nit or not. Can you see that? Alright. I can do this forever and ever. So if you have any questions or if you\nwant to know anything, I mean, I'm, I'm an open book right now and I'm\nfeeling happy that you guys have joined me here today to learn how I this. I would actually love to sit with you\nall and show you how we can create these things, because there's something about\nbeing around other artists, you know? You're just kind of letting it flow and\nyou're talking or you're not talking, or you're listening to music and it just\nsort of happens, and it comes alive. GINA: You have a question from Danielle. She says, \"What do you like most\nabout being an artist?\" I like the freedom. I like the\nfreedom because like sometimes I'm fortunate to have a space in my\nhouse where I can go and I can work. And sometimes it hits me at like two\no'clock in the morning or three o'clock in the morning, like I wake up and I'm\nlike, yeah, my mind's going- You know what? I can't sleep. So I come up and I can\ndo art whenever. Whenever I was teaching, because you have to really\nbe present and awake and energized to handle the students\nand the day ahead of you, then you, you can't wake up at two and\nthree in the morning and do that. So I like the freedom of being retired. And then just to be able to create\nwhatever I want to create. I'm always doodling. I got this one book-\nI can't find- this book here. Anything that has a surface on\nit, I'm going to draw on. I don't know if you can see that or not, but anything with a\nsurface and blank pages, I'm going to be drawing and\ndoodling. And as you can see, this is probably going to end up being\nanother one of my cut paper designs in the near future. Yeah. So my thing is work-\nwork when you can work, but when it's time to retire- like me\nretire, and do your passion because life is not over just because\nyou're retired. I'm a grandma, too.\nI love being a grandma! It's like one of my favorite things. My grandson loves to come to the\nart room and he's always up here. And when we were preparing to do this,\nhe sat over here. He goes, \"okay,\" I said, \"Rowan, what are we going to tell em?\"\nHe goes, \"Okay. Everybody, you're going to need your, your scissors. And you're going to need\nyour, your color paper and your glue. And we're going to do today cut\npaper designs.\" And I was like, \"look at- how cute!\" He's three years old. I would\nlove to show you his design, but I don't have it at my\nfingertips, but he just, I love it. And I'm able to pass that onto\nthem, that love of creating, because everybody has that\nability to create. Thank you. Here's what he did. I mean,\nthis is he's only three. GINA: Oh, that's adorable. LISA: and he's cutting paper. And he\nknows it. He would always say, \"well, are we going to paint\ntoday? Or is it cut paper? Which one are we going to do today?\"\nAnd so if a three year old can do it, anybody can do it. Thank you. I wonder how their\ndesigns are coming along. Has anybody give me any feedback? Are they trying to\ncreate something too? GINA: I think of- some\nof the people are\nLISA: So tell me how's it going GINA: So, from Taylor, they are asking, \"How do you,\" I think you mentioned this\nin the beginning, but they missed it. \"How do you plan out your cut paper\ndesign specifically? How do you start? I missed the first few\nminutes of your presentation.\" LISA: No problem. I'll be glad to\ngo ahead and share that. I just take the black paper and\nthen I sketch out very lightly, a little bit of a design,\nlike on this one here. This is much darker\nthan I normally would do, but I just sketch something very lightly. And then I go ahead and\nI create from there. Let me find you another one or two. GINA: Do these designs come\nfrom sketches or do you-\nLISA: Just out of my c- imagination. But like this one, it's kind of\nmaybe hard to see it. Can you see it? It's a young girl. That's sort of\nthat she's kind of playing around. There's a sun in there, always the\nsunshine, I believe in that light. And she's got her big hands out. Like\nI'm here to help you. I love you.\nI don't know if you can see it or not. And then here's another one, too,\nthat I did, but it's not done yet. It's kind of hard to see it. Like I\nsaid, I love this, this black paper. I've got another couple in here, too. This one may be harder to see. I don't\nknow. Can you see that one? This one I'm pretty sure I'm going to end up doing, because I can see where I could put\na lot of detail with it. Overlaying the colors\none on top of the other. And here's one more I wanted to show. This is a heart. I think it's currently on display\nright now. If I'm not mistaken, can you see the heart? And then all\nthe different little designs around it. And the real beautiful thing is I\nincorporated this without really thinking about it. I incorporated it into\none of my other cut paper designs. It's called \"The Heart of\nHumanity Begins At The Cross.\" And that is really kind of neat because\nit always has people's faces and heads. So in the corners, I got four different\nethnic groups and then there's a, there's a cross with, it's very\nmulticolored similar to this one, but the design is a little\nbit different on it. And then in the very central part\nof it, it has this, this heart, not this one, but one that's\nvery similar to this one. And it's made up of reds and rings and\nso forth. But like I said, when I do it, I don't aim to make it look\na certain way. Just sort of, kind of flows out and becomes this image\nthat I want to share out with people. How are we doing? GINA: Good. I think we have about 15 minutes. LISA: Okay. Super. So we're going to keep on creating some\nof these because I want to show us how we can begin to glue\ndown some of this too. Let me just finish this last piece. GINA: There's another question. Did you\nstudy art or are you self taught? Your work and where you find\ninspiration is incredible. LISA: Thank you. I did actually, I've- from\nthe time I was in kinder, I got a really long story with that.\nI want to share it with you, but I had a kindergarten\nteacher and I think really, she was one of the reasons that got me\nstarted with education also because she knew, and she understood that\nthis busy little mind of mine, which was just turning and\nturning, even in kinder, she could see that. We had nap time.\nWe were supposed to go to sleep. I couldn't go to sleep. And so she was\nlike, you know, \"Hey Lisa, could you, do you want to draw?\" I'm\nlike, \"Oh my gosh, yes!\" She gave me five sheets of paper,\ncolored markers, sat me at the big, huge, giant teacher desk. I mean,\nthey don't have those anymore, those wooden big desks. And she\nsays, \"as long as you don't talk, you can go ahead and create\nwhatever you want to.\" And so I covered every single white paper\nlike, this covered every single one. It's just, Oh my gosh, this little\ngirl. No wonder. So when you say, am I self-taught, I think that God's given me this\ngift to create and to make things. And so I've always done it. I've done it ever since kinder all the\nway through high school. In junior high and high school I did art. In my\nhigh school, we could actually major. So I majored in Spanish\nand I also majored in art. Once I graduated from high school, I went to the Art Institute of Fort\nLauderdale and I studied photography. Talk about an expensive hobby. That's what's expensive, because we had\ndeveloping paper and we have the chemicals. And then of course the\nfilm that was super expensive, I couldn't afford it. So I returned back to my home\nstate and I went ahead and I did the studies, got my degree,\nended up teaching, you know, doing counseling and then, but\nthe art was always tugging at me. I need to do my art. So,\nthat's where I got my art from. My training was minimal in terms of\nme going to school to be an artist. I think it's a God gift that he's given to me. All right. We're going to start gluing down some\nof this because I want to see how we modge podge it. Even though it's not\ncomplete, it's something for us, at least, pretty to see the\nprocess of what is all completed. And I'm really don't like these\nbig, chunky things here. It feels like it needs something to be\noverlaid on it. But because as I said, time is kind of getting away from us. I went to all to see how\nthe process actually goes. So moving this out of the way.\nThe glue we're going to use, and you gotta be careful\nwith your glue. I'm, I'm making a discovery as of late\nthat the type of glue that you use. I use this because if you put\nit down, we can peel it back up. Some glue you put it down, then\nthe paper sticks to the paper, but this one tends to, if I\nput it down, I don't like it, I can take a little X-acto knife,\nkind of scrape it and lift it up, and then I can that I can go ahead and,\nand, and replace it with something else. Okay. So when I do this, yes, please, whatever you do, remove this tape. Okay, I'm going to put it on this. And with your glue, you don't want to put too much glue\nbecause sometimes it oozes out. So what I've done is I've\nstuck some glue onto it. I don't know if you can\nsee that very well or not. And I'm going to go ahead\nand put it in its place. And I press it down. Some of the glue may\nooze out from the side, but that's okay. You don't want too much of it oozing\nbecause it's going to get real messy if you let that happen. And then sometimes whenever you\ncollect your- your paper, the tape might stick to it. No problem. Just peel that up. GINA: What kind of glue are you using? LISA: This is Elmer's no wrinkle glue. And I've had to actually order this\nonline because, unfortunately, hobby stores here, they don't carry it. So\nyou get a better deal, actually, if you order it online, too.\nAnd I normally get it in bulk, sometimes four tubes\nor six tubes, they sell like in the little case\nlike that for me, but I don't know why they've not\nbeen carrying this glue, but I, I really like this glue a lot. GINA: It doesn't wrinkle the\npaper? Is that why? LISA: Exactly. GINA: Another question, after doing- about stained glass, after doing\nstained glass designs on paper, which do you enjoy more stained glass\nor the stained glass effect on paper? I really like doing stained glass\nbecause you have to cut the glass. You have to break the glass, you have\nto shape the glass and you've got to, you have to grind, but then you have\nto foil it. Then you have to place it. And then if it doesn't fit, then you've got to go back and grind\nit a little bit more. That process, it feels like I'm, I'm putting\nmore of me into it. I mean, I am doing it with this as well, but then you can put up that piece to\nthe window and the light shines through it. There I go. And with my light,\nthe light shines through it. And it has these beautiful, reflective tones that are hitting the\ncarpet or the ceiling or whatever the case may be. And it just has, it\nspeaks to you. So I like them both, but I like this one because it's cheaper.\nIt's paper! I wish I could see you all. GINA: Also the, it being on paper somehow, like with stained glass,\nbecause I know we've thought about having\nlike a stain glass exhibit, but you have to have a light\nbox and you have to- but for some reason the paper, it\nseems to like kind of emanate light. I don't know if that makes sense.\nLISA: Well, I would agree with you because once\nyou put the modge podge on it, it it's kind of, it makes the\ncolors more vibrant. I mean, I don't know if you can see the difference between\nthis without the modge podge. GINA: Right. LISA: It just makes it more rich. And, I dunno, it just kind of speaks to you. You can see like little angles and\nlittle flecks. Another thing, too, with my paper, it's not all smooth\npaper. Some of it is texturized. So you get like little bumps and\ngrooves and whatever else with it. GINA: Yeah. That was one of the nice\nthings about seeing it in person, all the texture and grooves. LISA: I'm used to not working so fast. GINA:\u00a0 I have one person, Richard. He says \"I didn't have black papers.\nSo I made it with dark blue. I making a purple, pink, and yellow cross.\" LISA: Oh, that sounds lovely. Hey Richard, can you submit\nit to Gina so I can see? GINA: Yeah!\nLISA: Yes! whatever you guys are working on, it would be so nice if I\ncould see your work. I mean, because remember it doesn't have\nto look exactly like mine. Richard, I like that. I've never used blue paper.\nSo you might've given me an idea. How much do I owe you? That's a good idea. I just use black because black\nis rich, you know? Is it, and you said it's a Navy? A dark blue?\nGINA: Dark blue, yes. And, just a request. If you could repeat\ndrawing the, I guess the, the lines and the spaces outside of the\ncross, how you went about doing that. And then also, since\nyou're creating as you go, how do you know when\nthe piece is finished? LISA: \"Lisa?!\"\u00a0 No, I'm just kidding! You know that it's done because remember I said, I look at the piece, and\nthen I step away from it, and then I go downstairs and\nmaybe I come back a day later, and I look at it, I'm like,\nOh, like it needs something. And then it's almost like the piece\ntalks to you and it tells you, like, \"I'm done.\" This is- this is- you don't want to do any more\nbecause any more is gonna- you're gonna mess up the message. And so, I just let the piece talk\nto me like this one right here, this is not done because I'm used\nto having more layers with it. Like in the yellows, it needs\nsomething more like, I don't know if you can see this one or\nnot. I put some little flecks in here of like a purplish color and then\nthere's another purplish color. But I think it still needs a little bit\nmore and I even want to bring it down into this space. So that's one thing you've got to think\nabout, with- that you can do with paper that you can't do with stained glass, because\nyou can actually cross over lines. I don't have anything that's like,\nlike bubbled up or anything like that, but it crosses over and it's adhered to it,\nbut it makes it pop a little bit more. So that's kind of fine with\nit. Okay. What I'm going to do, because I think that\ntime is almost- Yes, it gives it more dimension is\nwhat I'm talking about. I hope that helped out a little bit,\nbut they wanted to know how'd I do the lines. Okay, down here, I just made chunky lines. And I did it based upon the overall of the- it's like it has a couple of designs\nwithin itself. It has the sun, and then it has the cross. And I decided to just to make\nthe lines based upon those two given dimensions put together. And what I do is, it just\nflows out from that main source. It's like a puzzle\npiece that's being put together. And it's going to talk to you,\nlike I've been telling you, it's, it's kind of weird when I say\nthis is going to talk to you, but it says, \"Hm, that fits,\"\nor \"no, that doesn't work.\" And if it doesn't work, because you're\nusing your eraser, a light type of pencil, when you can erase it, you can simply\nerase it. And with the piece of cut paper, if you don't like that\nshape, you can recut it. Okay? But I just simply just put the lines in\nto give me the energy that I wanted to have. And I keep talking\nabout this yellow. Let me show you what I'm talking about, how it's going to\ntransform that given shape. Okay. I don't know if you notice. I\njust simply sketched out something. I didn't even put a\nmeasurement with it, at all. And it's to try and give her shape. Okay, I'm going to focus in on this\none, this particular ray that's coming out from the sun, and I'm\ngoing to put a bit of red with it. And like I said, it just gives\nit more depth and more dimension. And if I feel like it, I can even go ahead and put like\na little strand of orange with it. And do you see how it makes it pop a\nlittle bit more? And to give it some more essence, maybe I don't even\nwant it to be that thick. Maybe I just simply want it\nto have like a little bit. You're not tying into\nany particular size. You, you put down on the paper,\nwhatever you want it to feel like. GINA: A question. Do you ever listen\nto music while you work? And if so, what are your favorite jams? LISA: Okay, Christian music. I love that.\nAnd I like jazz. I love to hear jazz. And then sometimes\nI hear like real- like country music. Whatever I'm in the mood for that day. I have a- I'm pretty eclectic when it\ncomes to the music that I listen to, I don't do heavy metal and stuff\nbecause I just- I'm not a headbanger. It just makes my head hurt.\nYou know, my kids laugh at me. Guitar music's too loud: \"Turn\nit down, please.\" Yeah. Look at the difference of this\nand the other. You can do that. You can do that design with\nit or that design with it. It's just depends on\nwhat you want it to say. And you can do it on all of those and\nthen maybe come back in with another thicker piece on it as well.\nOkay. Like I said, what I do want to do, because I don't\nknow how much time we have going here, I want to show you how\nto modge podge it. Okay. I like the modge podge because it's- it's a, the one that\nI'm using is the gloss luster. This- there's another one too is a\nyellow one, but I like this one. It's a bit thicker. And it also just makes the pieces like\nreally, it tacks them in place really nicely. And like I said, for\nthose of you that want this, I've got the pattern for this one.\nThis is what we were going to do, but you'll see a lot of symmetry\nwith that one. It's really fun. So, but like I said, the modge podge makes everything stick in place and plus\nit, hardens it and makes it more durable. Okay. Moving this aside, and\nit's not all the way dry yet. I normally wait till everything's\ncompletely dry because as you know, if you put glue down and it's not\nall the way dry, and then you put another glue on top of that, chances are, you're gonna get some air pockets and\nit's going to be kind of warped and things like that. So I normally wait til everything's completely\ndry. And when I say wait, I'm talking about maybe\nat least two days. I mean, I just want to make sure because\nsometimes they layer one piece on top of another piece, on top of another piece. And if I don't have it all the way dry,\nthen what's going to happen is it's going to either buckle up and peel\nup and it's gonna look really bad. That was another thing I wanted to share\nwith you all. When you do your pieces, if you use really broad pieces\nand your paper is very thin, even though this says non wrinkle,\nif your paper's not real thick, it's going to kind of, it's\ngoing to buckle a little bit. So I would encourage you to\nminimize how wide you cut your pieces of paper, because if\nthey're too wide, it's gonna, it's gonna mess up your whole design.\nIt's gonna be kind of rippled in there. Okay. All right. When\nI use my paint brushes, these are my acrylic paint brushes. I\njust wash them out really, really well. And I like the broad flat brushes.\nI just like the feel of these. They're not the thick ones. They're\nnot the real bristly type ones. They're just very silky type of brushes. And the reason why I like these brushes\nis because whenever you paint on the modge podge stuff, it- it\njust goes on very smoothly. And I normally kind of go in one direction\nwith it, or if it's a circular thing, I go in a circle with. It depends on\nhow the design, because once again, like you said, Gina, \"it looks like\nit's kind of coming at you.\" Well, that's because of how the modge podge\nis also laid down. Okay. I said either one of these, I'm going to\nuse a smaller one because the design is not that big. I hope everybody's enjoying this. I am! GINA: I am!\u00a0\nLISA: I'm having a really good time. I was, I was like, I don't know how to do this because I'm\nused to talking to students and walking around and moving around\nand doing stuff with them,\nbut this is kind of nice, I like it. Okay. Put just a little bit of glue, modgey podgey stuff onto it.\nAnd it has a certain aroma. So if you're, if you're\nreally sensitive to smells, make sure you have your fan going,\nit's not toxic or anything like that, but if you have a sensitivity to odors, make sure that you have a window\nopen or you have your fan going. This has never given me a headache like\nsomethings do. So, when I apply it, I just simply- with the cross,\nbecause I want it to go down, I'm going to apply it straight down. And I'm not going to do the full thing\nbecause I'm not finished gluing everything in place. And maybe by the time we're done, I'm going across because\nthen I'm going to go back around it. And make sure that you get\nin-between where the black is. I don't know if you can see that\nor not. Can you see it everyone? Cause I have a bit of a light here. Okay. And I'm going to lay it down so I can really\nmake sure I have it all covered the way it needs to be covered.\nI know I just need the green, so I'm going to do this. And if you put this on too thick, you're going to see a 3d effect with it. So you don't want it to\nbe too terribly thick. I don't know if you can see that or not.\nCan you? And then you're going to let it dry. And then it becomes something that\nlooks like one of these that you see here. When it comes to circles- GINA: Beautiful.\nLISA: Yes? GINA: Oh, I just said beautiful. LISA: Thank you. When it comes to circles,\nmy circles aren't perfect, but I, I like to do circles.\nThis one young lady that I'm working on creating here. There she is. It's a necklace type thing. And I'm going to go ahead and\ncontinue that pattern of the necklace. And it just feels like it needs to have- I'm going to go ahead and do a yellow\nto continue somewhat of a pattern, but it's not going to\nbe your full pattern cause I'm going to put something else\non top of these, and it might be a circle that's kind of off to the\nside. So when I do my circle, I just kind of eye it, take my paper, create the circle more or less the\nsize I think it should be. I don't know if you can see that or not. GINA: Lisa, a technical question. Can\nyou use spray modge podge? LISA: I've never used spray modge podge. I think it's like, with\nanything that you spray on, make sure that it's not too thick and\ngunky. Like whenever you spray paint on certain things, it kind of\nstarts to drip. So I've never, I've never used spray\nmodge podge.\u00a0 They sell that? GINA: Maybe she's asking, Like maybe you can make it?\nLISA: Like a varnish or something?\nGINA: Yeah. DIY modge podge. I have a question, or- We are almost out of time, but you talk. LISA: I'm just trimming this down.\nLike I said, it's not perfect. And just go around the\ncircle and I can always like\nfix it up a little bit later on and I'm going to put\nit right in place there. Huh. And that's how I end\nup getting my circles. It's not stuck in place, but that's how\nI get my circles. By just simply eyeing it. They're not perfect circles. GINA: I wanted to ask as a, since you've been an educator\nhere, working in the school since the late eighties, we're going through a lot\nof changes currently. Have you noticed any changes\nsince that time when you started until the current times, and also, are there any things\nlike looking forward? Any kind of changes that you're\nanticipating or how we should- how you feel, I guess,\nin this current moment. To answer the first\npart of the question, there have been so many changes\nwith education. When I was teaching, when I first started, we had so\nmuch more freedom. We still testing, but we weren't so constricted by the\ntesting. My classes that I taught, they were GT students\nand special ed students. Everybody was in there and I treated all\nmy kids the same and I would teach to the middle and higher. By that. I mean,\nI didn't dumb down the curriculum. Yes, you might've struggled. But that meant\nit was up to me to sit with you more, to make sure I get you to be at\nthe level that you need to be at. So I think that that's kind\nof changed because our really, really bright students, they're not necessarily being\nfed academically the way\nthat they need to be fed. They're, they're covering\ncontent, they're doing activities, but is the education\nmeaningful and relevant? And when I used to do my presentations, I would say it's so important that\nwhen we teach like mathematics, don't just teach fractions,\nbut actually teach them how to, to measure out something.\nBake with them, I mean, truly bring in the materials to bake\nwith and you bake. You measure things out. If you're going to build\nsomething, make a blueprint, okay. Measure it out and then\ndo a little mock up of it. That's where the kids really learn it. That's where it's meaningful and\nrelevant. When you do your science, okay? Take them outside and do the science;\nTie in your mathematics, your science. Whenever I was going through\nbeing taught as an educator, we did the whole language approach. And that's the only way\nthat I know how to teach. I think everything needs to be connected. I think nowadays kids are just covering\ncontent and they're not really able to connect that knowledge the way that\nwe want them to. And so, yes, it's changed quite a bit. I\nmean, especially with COVID\nthat's going on right now. There's a lot of kids that just- they're not getting the\neducation and they need, they need a teacher to be there with\nthem, to guide them, to encourage them. So that's changed a lot too. And I'm hoping that testing will not\nbe as emphasized as it is.\u00a0 Yeah, test, but don't make it the main thing. Make sure that our kids know something\nby the time that they leave from school. That's, what's, what's very important. And also that they're loved by somebody\nother than their family. So yeah, it's changed a lot. GINA: Interesting. Yeah, I\nagree wholeheartedly. I guess I will- Start my video. And\nso we can say goodbye. Is there- I\nguess one final question, is there any advice you have\nfor students or new artists who are barely\ncoming to the trade? Any advice for them? I think for anyone it's so\nimportant to pursue your passion. Art's always been my passion and it's\nalways been incorporated in my classroom. You can't- don't give up on it. It may not yield what you want it to\nyield, but after all artists- yeah, we like to make money. Don't get me wrong. But I think we really enjoy when people\nlook at the work and they're like, \"gosh, that's really neat,\" because\nyou've connected with them, and that's the main thing that I want\nmy art to do, is to connect with people. And in my given case, pointing to Jesus,\nthat's what I want my artwork to do. And I think a lot of people\nwhen they see it they're like, \"wow, gosh,\" and they just stand there and they\nlook at it and that's what I want. Pursue your passion. Don't give up on\nyour passion. If it's art, do your art. So. GINA: Some things are worth\nmore than money, right? But we still need money\nto survive. Okay, well, thank you everybody for\ncoming and attending the\nevent and I hope you can come see the exhibit. It's\nreally beautiful in person. It'll be on display through March\n23rd. It's at the Pecan Campus Library Art Gallery, the second floor. All right. LISA: Thank you everybody for joining\nus today. It's been a real pleasure. I hope I get to meet you so we can \"cut some paper!\"", "hRBV4xC5tjo": "broadcast is now starting all attendees are in listen only mode all right well good afternoon everybody we're going to wait a couple seconds as people are joining the webinar and then we'll get started okay we still have people joining us so give us another few seconds all right well good good afternoon everyone um welcome to today's seminar or webinar and thank you for joining us my name is sandra vandenberg and i'm a professor at the ut health school of public health i'm also the associate director for the michael incision health center for healthy living and today's webinar is hosted by the dell center for healthy living and before we get started i would just like to make some housekeeping announcements um first of all the webinar is being recorded and will be archived along with the presentation slides at our website which is msdcenter.org and if you have any questions during the presentations um please just enter in the chat box we have a series of speakers today so i think it's easier and more time efficient if we respond to all the questions at the end of the presentation and so in today's webinar we have um five different speakers who are presenting on different aspects of the fresh awesome study which is a study that was funded by the foundation of food and um they have i mean as a collaborating organization we have worked very closely and throughout the last couple years on this and so the fresh study is a community-based study focused on evaluating a citywide initiative the fresh for less initiative which provides more access to healthy food in low-income communities and the data that is being collected through this evaluation component of the study is guiding the development of an agent-based model which will be able to simulate different food access scenarios and their impact of healthy food purchasing and consumption in austin texas and so what we're presenting today this is an ongoing study so this is not the final data but we do have some really great data that we collected during covet 19 and aida will talk we'll be talking a little bit about how we had to switch our um our study and really our whole study design um as covet started and but so for today's speakers we first have katie johnda who's a postdoctoral fellow at the ut school of public health and she's a nci cancer control research training program fellow she will be presenting some of our rationale for doing study and some backgrounds on food insecurity we have um aida nielsen who is our project director and she will be talking a little bit about the original fresh study and then our pivot to the study design during copic 19. then we have yuzi and fury who are both doctoral students in our program who are going to be presenting some of the qualitative data and then lastly we have dev salvo who used to be at ut school of public health but now as an assistant professor at washington u in saint louis so at this point i don't want to take up any more time but i'll hand it over to katie to start our presentation great thank you um good afternoon for those of you in eastern and central time zones um as dr vandenberg just said i'm going to be kind of providing a little bit of background on food insecurity food access disparities and kind of set the stage for the importance of the work that the fresh study is doing next slide so to get all on the same page a basic definition of food insecurity is a limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways next slide so to kind of deconstruct what that means food insecurity typically is defined as having four major components and constructs availability so like being able to actually um have food within the community access which kind of is so broken down into geographically access and economic food access so think about it as are there retail options um near where you live or work uh where you can purchase food as well as economic food access meaning is that food actually affordable are you able to afford to be able to buy that and buy those items utilization which is a kind of a fancy word for consumption as well as stability over time meaning that you have consistent access and consistent availability and consistent utilization of food across time and there's not like cycles and trends that kind of vary next slide so within food insecurity and food access there are several noted disparities within the literature race ethnicity income urban rural status employment and transportation so what this means is that in the literature and this is what we've been finding in the literature before covet as well as during covet um you can see that there are differences by these different factors so people of color are often at greater risk of being food insecure and there have a higher prevalence of food insecurity than non-hispanic whites within the u.s for income those who have lower income are more likely to be food insecure than those who have higher income for employment if you have inconsistent employment or are unemployed you're more likely to be food insecure than those who have stable full-time employment and for transportation if you have access to a car you have greater odds of being food secure while those who do not have regular access to a car or have greater odds of being food insecure so these all of these pieces kind of can aff affect the food insecurities success so if i as being black or hispanic specifically you often have um you're more likely to have limited food access than non-hispanic whites and that's kind of where you get those terminologies of like food deserts and things that you think of with food deserts of not having consistent access or available access to healthy foods is really what we think about too with food access disparities next slide so to put some data and numbers behind all of these trends um before the kovid 19 pandemic uh 11.8 percent of american households were food insecure in 2017 and you can see that within texas it was above the national average meaning that 14 of families in texas identified as food insecure from 2015 to 2017. and to drill down into austin since that's where this study is really conducted over 15 percent of families in austin experienced food insecurity in 2016. so you can see that the state of texas is above the national average for food insecurity and then within austin it's above the state and national average so there's definitely a need um for this type of work within this community also for those of you who are not as familiar with the austin travis county area it's a very diverse area um just under half of the population identifies as white over a third hispanic or latinx i'm about eight percent black and about seven percent asian and residents of the eastern crescent of austin which we'll talk about in a map momentarily are more likely to have experienced limited geographic food access and food insecurity and we'll talk a little bit more about that in a second and these are all very important public health issues since various health conditions and unhealthy dietary behaviors are associated with food insecurity and limited food access these includes greater likelihood of obesity cardiovascular disease diabetes mental health problems and other factors next slide so here is a map that demonstrates and depicts some of the 2018 american community survey data so this is travis county and areas that are kind of dotted have a poverty rate over 15 percent um the diagonal slash area zip code areas are predominantly non-white zip codes meaning that it's predominantly people of color and then for income if the median income was over seventy thousand dollars it's in white if it's under seventy thousand dollars it's in blue and um the gray areas are for um they're also white and blue depending but what you can see within this map is that the eastern that eastern sea essentially of a county has higher poverty rates lower median income and they're more likely to be have majority non-white populations so you can kind of see these disparities exist since that eastern crescent of austin and travis county that i mentioned earlier are more likely to have limited food access and experience food insecurity so you can see all of these disparities kind of coalescing within this geographic area next slide so what does this look like during covid um we've heard anecdotally about the long lines at the food pantries and food banks need for school feeding programs etc and this was really all over the news last spring and early summer and continues to be a huge topic of discussion and what we've found is that feeding america projects that 17.1 million more americans could become food insecure due to covet 19. and at its peak um there were over 700 000 more texans that were eligible and on snap during the pandemic than pre-pandemic and this peak occurred around september and then because of some of the changes in pandemic ebt and different eligibilities kind of the um the numbers are declining a little bit but they're still higher than what they were in january and february 2020. additionally census pulse service data survey data estimates that food insecurity prevalence in texas has more than doubled from 2019 to november 2020. i'm going from 14 in 2019 to um just under 28 in november 2020 and that these um food insecurity prevalences are even higher among households with children as well as black and latino households nationally as well as within the state and as we've kind of we've heard these anecdotes that there's been a lot of issues with food insecurity due to store level closures lines at food banks individual level factors such as age pre-existing conditions and concerns about being able to go to the stores etc as well as issues with transportation among other factors next slide great so all of this information is really demonstrated that there's quite a few gaps in the literature um little has been known about the experience of residents in central texas from their own perspective about food insecurity and food access during the pandemics specifically since oftentimes data about food insecurity is not even available for many until several years after uh it is measured which is why i was referring to that 2015-2017 data at the beginning of the presentation additionally the majority of literature that looks at food insecurity and food access looks solely access to supermarkets and grocery stores or one type of food retail let it be only corner stores or only farmers markets rather than multiple aspects of the food environment which we know is very complex so this is really the starting point and i think helps sets the stage for what aid is going to present about the importance and the relevancy of the work that fresh is doing that we've done with fresh and how we have pivoted during the pandemic so aida next slide great good uh afternoon everybody i'm aiden nielsen the project director of the fresh austin study so i'm going to really briefly talk about the overall the study um before kind of diving into the sub study around the covid um data next slide gate so as dr janda mentioned food insecurity is a huge problem nationally it's state level and definitely also at the local level and to address that the city of austin in 2016 passed a food policy that allocated almost half a million dollars in annual funding to implement a comprehensive multi-sector healthy food access initiative the goals of the initiative were to increase both the geographic and the economic access to healthy foods with the strong emphasis on fresh fruits and vegetables via three non-profit organizations sustainable food center farm share in gaba sfc was going to do work around farm stands which sold local organic fresh fruits and vegetables at a low cost farm shows doing mobile markets that sold fresh fruits vegetables organic low-cost but they also had some staple food items like eggs honey peanut butter pasta and gabo is going to do work around healthy corn of stores next slide please uh so how we came to be as sfc received a grant from the foundation for food and agricultural research and we were subcontracted to do an evaluation of the freshwater initiative and really we hypothesized that the geographical proximity to the multiple markets and farm stands would result in higher purchasing of fresh fruits vegetables and therefore higher consumption and another thing that we are going to do are doing is somewhat of a novel approach with this asian based model and it was really to and it's going to be a tool for policymakers to test different strategies under expansion scenarios and these strategies being the food mobile markets and the farm stands and we're also going to see if we can kind of predict healthy food purchasing and consumption and the agent-based model is going to use the data that we're collecting and so in 2018 when the study started we recruited 400 participants to be in a three-year study and we're going to survey them once a year for three years starting november 2018. so the first year the baseline year ended in march of 2019 and the second year they took the survey was november 2019 through march of 2020 next slide please so we just wrapped up like the very beginning of march when things are still kind of um what is taurus kobe 2 like is it gonna be big is that a two-week thing like what's happening so we just finished and when we finished few days later the city of boston passed a ordinance saying that 250 persons or more should not gather a few days later that came down to 10 schools closed not we've available finished serving for the second time around so we went to ssc we went to our funder ffar uh created a whole surveyor on covent which got approved end of may and as soon as it got approved we started serving participants um for kobe 2 and we were going to do one covet survey kind of like in the earlier pandemic and rb also approved another survey for later in the pandemic and so this later the epidemic is kind of what i will be discussing uh next slide bluescape and so the cohort participants were contacted they took the survey kind of june and july of 2020 it was 367 people whoever took the survey received a 20 gift card to amazon or walmart all the surveys were obviously online um the cohort participants were there was also a section in the survey that said if you can refer someone to take the survey please do so they were going to get a five dollar gift card if the refer referee referral person took the survey and and so we wrapped up those that data collection in july and then about five months later we started the second round of coded surveys in december 2020 and we finished in 2021 and our total end was 304 participants next slide please um i just wanted to discuss demographics briefly with this uh who was our cohort who took our covet surveys right um our youngest person was 18 our oldest was 84 the mean age was 43. um most survey takers were female about 83 um 57 were identified as hispanic 28 percent identified as white also wanted to share with you um the annual household growth income in 2019 and as you can see just a little over half of our population respondents um made forty five thousand dollars or less and so forty five thousand dollars doesn't go very far in austin and especially if you have more than one person living with you and 84 or 80 of our respondents are living with somebody they have one or more children in their household i think around um only 37 individuals out of these 300 said that they lived alone next slide please to go back to food and security we asked sort of six questions with the two item screener which was we worried whether our food would run out before we got money to buy more you know agree disagree neutral whatever neutral are um we also asked the food that we bought just did not lost and we didn't have money to get more and these two questions were practiced with think back before the pandemic these two statements and then think back at the sort of pandemic these two statements think back last month these two statements and as you can see 34 of the respondents um were classified as food insecure so sometimes they're often food insecure and at the start of kobet that kind of shot up 11 more identified were food insecure and then at the last month um the numbers went down to 37 but never really made it to the pre-pandemic levels so as dr gender said um this is kind of the trend it's also seen nationally so it's not unique to austin by any means and to point out the ethnic differences in food insecurity as we've seen also in our population 60 percent of hispanics were reported being food insecure at the start of covid compared to 24 white and just said differently hispanic respondents said 4.6 times the odds of being food insecure compared to white respondents next slide please um we also asked about food assistance and how they were able to get food um most people went to a grocery store in person that's how they were able to get food there were some indian carbsite pickups some were doing delivery um as far as free food people around like 50 respondents said that they went to school were able to get meals they went to food bank um they use their friends as a as a way of getting some food and again there was a difference in race ethnicity um as to who used those services right with out of 50 respondents who selected school 44 identified as hispanic out of 64 who went to a food bank 54 identified as hispanic and we had only about 39 people who selected friends and 19 were hispanic 11 were white and uh compared to the first three months of covid we asked how often has uh have you used a food pantry or food bank 16 have actually increased the usage from the start of pandemic um which is quite a bit and so you can see that we have quite a bit like 30 27 30 percent of our respondents have used a food bank um it kind of goes to show you that it's valuable in the times of pandemic and before the food banks are very much needed and very much utilized next slide please okay thank you um so with the second coveted survey we were able to see how people's food and security status changed from the start of the pandemic and we had about 58 questions on this survey so we were also able to see some other really great um information and kind of allowed us to expand our subsidy even more by doing some qualitative interviews and um which is actually what our my colleagues will speak to next and but the first thing will be uzi who will discuss some other concerns that we were able to um capture with our survey so thank you and i'm going to pass it on to you you see thank you all right thank you aida um so good afternoon everyone my name is yuzi i'm the research assistant and doctoral student in ut health school public health so i'm going to talk about concerns about central texas residents during the current pandemic from the kobe 19 sub studies from fresh next slides please all right so um in both the survey so we have the one last question for the cove survey we asked participants to please share your greatest concern at this time or any other thoughts you would like to let us know so in the survey one which was conducted between june 2020 and july 2020 we have 282 people out of 367 people who took the time to answer the qualitative questions so which gave us a 77 percentage of the response rates in the survey 2 which was conducted between december 2020 and january 2021 we received 182 response for this one out of 303 people the response rate was 60 so just a reminder for both survey we have like 58 multiple choice questions before the last open-ended question so we would really appreciate that our participant took the time to answer this last open any question even after this quite long survey so what were the greatest concerns about central texas residents during coordinating pandemics so let's take a look at our results next slides please all right so in this figure we have all responses from the participant and were coded and categorized into certain concerns that you can see that shown in the excesses so we have copy 19 health normality financial employment child care social interaction or isolation food related concerns transportation education national stability alloy care and veterinary care so the blue bar indicates the cover story 1 the orange bar indicates the code is survey 2. so you can see the differences in the percentage for each concern for the survey conducted in two time points so the top five concern in the kovic summary one we can see that 56.5 percent mentioned code nineteen and twenty five point seven percent mentioned financial twenty point five uh twenty four point four percent mentioned health twenty two point five percent mentioned child care nineteen point nine percent mentioned employment in the survey one the top five concern in the survey 2 we can see that 41.2 percent mentioned covered 19 19.8 mentioned health 13.7 mentioned normality to point percent mentioned financial and twelve point one percent mentioned employment so most of the study concern had a high higher percentage on the cover story bond than coin survey two because you can see that uh most of the blue bars are higher than the orange bar but the greater percentage for normality was mentioned in the survey too and you can see elderly care and veterinary care was not mentioned at all in the summary one so the top one concern was kelvin knight in general for both survey so that's why we further break down the covet 19 category into several subcategories next slides please so in this figure we can see the concerns regarding the code 19 and we have seven subcategories in the graph getting sick family safety spreading the disease lack of collective actions vaccine depth and availability of testing so again the blue bar indicates the curvature one and orange bar indicates the complete review family safety were consistently being the most cited concern regarding the covet in two survey but the percentage were both decreased in the kovic survey two um spreading disease and lack of collective actions was less cited in code survey 2. vaccine was getting higher attention in the survey 2. you can see that 7.1 percent mentioned in the survey 2 compared to only 2.5 mentioned in the survey one um while the testing of ability we're not mentioning at all in the kobe survey too so from the first three months of the coven 19 for the six months after the pandemic the texans resident concern had changed but getting sick and family member safety were always the greatest concern throughout the six months next slides please um so here i'm gonna share some of the quotes we have from the survey so the first participant could it work with me when i see people wearing masks with their nose not covered or gapping openings on the sides i'm also concerned that a lot of people will voluntarily get a co-igniting vaccine when it becomes available so it indicates the lack of collective actions and the concerns about vaccines and the second participant said that my child isn't getting enough normal social interactions and i'm not getting social instigation to exercise data one step meeting friends or exercise but um we also have something different in the response they're more like a positive side of how people dealing with the daily life change due to the pandemics and this is what participants put here we are all in this together and it sucks and yes spending time with my loved one and having time to cook more have been the most positive side i have doing the positive part of all of this i've learned to bake sourdough bread and take online cooking classes i have also baked more cookies and cakes related before and don't eat bread or glue them before but i started swimming and i think i get more slip because no commute my weight has stayed the same so i'm feeling good about it mostly so moving on to our conclusions next slides please so coming 19 was the most cited concern three months and six months into the pandemic vaccine was cited more on six months into the pandemic and um and we noticed that people are trying to adapt to a new daily routine stay healthy and positive so um my colleague very will next discuss more details about the food related behavior change during covenanting from our qualitative interview so i will literally take over and thank you thank you uc good afternoon everyone my name is vidi diana i'm a graduate research assistant for the fresh austin study and a doctoral student i will be discussing the qualitative interviews that were conducted post-survey for the cover 19 sub-study next slide please in addition to the surveys we conducted qualitative interviews to get more in-depth information about food access eating shopping and food purchasing behaviors during the cover 19 pandemic the goal was to collect 85 qualitative interviews from december 2020 to date we have conducted 64 qualitative interviews via telephone in spanish and english however as of today we have conduct we have analyzed 54 interviews from the 54 interviewees 47 participants were female and 7 male 2 identified as asian 35 31 as white and 67 as hispanic of these 54 interviewees 31 classified as food secure before coping 19 32 as food secure and 37 as newly food insecure next slide thank you of the 16 participants who reported to make more than 65 000 or greater 13 classified as food secure majority of the participants who reported to make between 45 000 to 65 000 were under the food insecure before coven 19 category of the 16 participants who reported to make between 25 000 to 45 000 majority were under the newly food insecure and for those who reported to make 15 000 to 25 000 they were equally in the newly food secure newly food insecure and food insecure before cover 19 category next slide please among those interviewed 17 participants were newly food insecure some of the participants experienced financial hardships which resulted in some using food banks decreasing their grocery budget because items in the market were too expensive or due to the decrease of hours at work majority it's then before covid participants reported to buying fruit for frozen fruits and vegetables beans rice lentils because they were scared that the market would run out of food and because these items were more um would last longer than fresh produce while majority of the participants continued to purchase in-person um shopping some reported to use curbside pickup as a coven 19 precaution and here is a quote that one of the participants shared during the interview we spend less money on food than before i avoid buying needs because they are very expensive and working hours decrease next slide please among those interviewed 17 participants were food insecure before coven 19. participants in this category expressed experiencing financial hardships resulting in late payment counseling services seeking help from low income programs and more likely to use food banks when compared to the newly food insecure and food and secure and food secure category participants were late were likely to continue doing in-person shopping use curbside pickup as a covenanting precaution and go to smaller stores to avoid exposure to a lot of people when compared to the other two food categories cooking more at home and fruit and vegetable consumption was the highest among this group because they reported cooking with healthier ingredients and to also help improve their immune system a participant during the interview shared that now i have to cook more healthy food because my children at our home and all all the meals i prepare are from scratch with healthy ingredients next slide please among those interviewed 20 participants were food secured when compared to the other two food categories participants under the food secure category were less likely to experience financial hardships and this could be as majority of the participants in this category made more than 65 000 they were also less likely to use food banks increase the amount of groceries they purchased were more likely to press to purchase fresh produce than non-perishable goods when compared to the other food categories a participant expressed this during their interview my husband works fewer hours than before the pandemic now we do not go out to restaurants walk in parks or visit relatives we were very stressed because we could not visit a relative who died in mexico but they didn't die from covet next slide please whether categorized as food secure newly food insecure or food insecure before coping 19 interviewees had had similar behavior changes many many of them expressed cooking more at home because they were more people at home either doing virtual learning or working remotely their eating habits also changed more as more people were having fresh cooked meals as opposed to takeout many increase their fruit and vegetable consumption to improve their immune system among participants under the food secure category there were more likely to buy and book when compared to the other food the other two categories and that concludes my presentation now i'll be passing it on to my colleague i think katie will be presenting on behalf of deb yes thank you unfortunately dr salvo had a small emergency come up so dr vandenberg and i will be presenting some of her information so something that's really important and different i guess you could say about the fresh study is that is the utilization of novel methods to understand the spatial dynamics of food access before and during covid19 next slide so to kind of rewind back to the beginning i talked about the various constructs that are included in food insecurity with food access being one of them so food access has five different dimensions they have are five different components within three different dimensions the five different components are affordability availability accessibility accommodation and acceptability conveniently all a's what a great alliteration and those three components are economic or three dimensions are economic dimensions spatial or geographic dimensions as well as sociocultural dimensions and i think that often both researchers and policy makers try to simplify and put food access in a box so to speak to its spatial or geographic dimension often um thinking only about availability of food stores as the key action um and thing that needs to be changed in order to improve food access however this study employs a wide array of methods that we've heard a lot about our quantitative methods qualitative interview methods described by the last three colleagues and in order to understand how food access influential influences food purchasing and intake among residents of the eastern crescent off austin that i highlighted within that map earlier and in the next few slides i'll be describing some of the additional methodologies utilizing gps data and then dr vandenberg will continue with some of the agent-based modeling methodologies employed by our study to further deconstruct and understand the way in which multiple dimensions of access influence food purchasing and intake patterns and how the food access access system was disrupted during covet 19. next slide please so first we're going to talk about utilizing and using gps and gis data to understand spatial food availability and accessibility patterns so for those of you who are not as familiar with gis it's geographic information systems and this methodology is pretty important in terms of and helpful in characterizing the spatial distribution of food outlets and if used alone it can be used to generate static participant-centric spatial indicators of access and it is also often assumed that spatial and geographic access to food is only determined by a participant's home location so you may see this in the literature utilizing buffers either those concentric circles of distance a certain prescriptive distance let's say a quarter mile a half mile a mile of um a circle around an individual's home to see what kind of lies within that circle or utilizing network buffers which accounts traveling by street sidewalk etc those same distances and seeing what types of food retail specifically often supermarkets reside within each of those buffers then for on the alternative side this geographic positioning systems or gps monitors can collect spatially and time-stamped data and if used in conjunction with gis data it can allow for the characterization of complex spatio-temporal patterns of food access it does not assume that geographic access is only relative to the home location and can kind of consider the full activity spaces so not just those distance constrained areas from where you live but also kind of sees how you interact with your overall community which is incredibly important when thinking about food access and purchasing behaviors next slide so using gps and gis data to understand spatial food availability and accessibility patterns we have this image um from percho at all from health and place in 2013 which uses examples of you can kind of see based upon the size of the circles and within this network kind of diagram the time spent by the individual at home at work at the various different types of locations whether it be a restaurant a bakery physical activity spaces like swimming pools um tennis etc and you can kind of see these these nodes and how they exist between work and home specifically that supermarket um which i think does a great job of kind of demonstrating and depicting all the different places that you interact with in a week per se um so with this specific analysis we geo-coded meaning that we mapped the specific locations and all the different types of food stores and restaurants in austin texas utilizing city of austin food environment analysis data and we also geocoded and mapped participants home addresses at baseline the sub simple subsample of participants wore time-matched accelerometers so physical activity measurement devices as well as gps monitors for seven days gps accelerometry and gis data were integrated and analyzed to do a variety of things including identifying number and duration of confirmed visits to various food access points within the community as well as determine if trips to and from these food access points were from home or to home locations and what was found was that the majority of visits to food access stores do not originate from home but most end there so that's really important to think about how this is a different from what we are conceptualizing food access within the literature so now i think that dr vandenberg is going to handle the next slide next couple seconds and discuss more specifics about our agent-based modeling yes thank you um so in the next two slides uh i'm going to discuss the two agent-based models that we're creating using the data that we're collecting that we have collected via our quantitative surveys and then also our interviews and at this point i want to just acknowledge um the person who's actually doing all this modeling for us and his name is pablo des moines he's actually lives in colombia and um has been working with us since we got this funding to um first of all teachers about agent-based modeling for me personally something i've never done before um and um but he's been very very instrumental in how we have developed our surveys to make sure he gets the data that he needs to develop these models um and it's really really an iterative process and it has been so there are three steps in um in creating an agents-based model um so we have first of all we have model developments then we do model calibration and then scenario testing in terms of the model development i first have to develop the environment which would be like the food environments which is really since we are doing austin texas it's the food in my environment austin texas and then secondly and and we did it pre and post covet so we created two different environments um because we also will be creating two different models then secondly once you have the environment developed you populate that environment with agents and agents in this case are the simulated people that live in austin and thirdly you develop the rules of the behavior so we currently have really focused on pre-purchasing and food consumption patterns and behaviors so what are the rules and i'm going to just give you a little bit of example of that in the next slide but what are the rules how do people behave when they purchase food how do they behave how do they decide what they're going to eat um so that this is that's must be based on again are some of our data that we collected ourselves but also data that's already available so once you've done created the model then you have to calibrate it and really this is the question as to how well does the model predict the current food purchasing patterns in food consumption patterns um again it does it fits does it fit the data that we're collecting and this is a very learned very time consuming process and it's very iterative iterative um you keep on doing it by changing different different small agents you find the environment a little bit better you've created different rules to make it fit better it makes more sense but this is an iterative process until a close representation of the reality is achieved and at that point we can do the cool part which is scenario testing and which is the whole purpose of creating these agent-based models so what we want to do is look how different food access policies affect how people purchase their food and ultimately how do they consume food so for example since we're working for fresh or less which again is a city of austin-based initiative um a big part of that now is having mobile food trucks that go to different places in austin low-income communities these are run by farm share and we have several of them um that move throughout the week well what if we doubled those um what how would that affect how people in those communities that live around these new food assets how do they purchase their foods does it change how they eat so you can really start um predicting potential impacts of scenarios which you normally could not do using traditional epidemiological approaches so it's a really cool way of looking at the potential success of different policies or just different changes in the environment and and then you know try to select the best ones that are going to be most successful so next slide please so in terms of our pre-code model we had a set of four rules which include um that agents want to shop close to home agents want to save money they just want to save time and then the cultural background influences food preferences and so that for example we are really finding and it's also in the literature that hispanics in general tend to consume more fresh fruits and vegetables than other and ethnic groups once we started working our cover 19 model an additional model an additional rule that we also included is that agents want to avoid coping 19 risk so there's potential for more [Music] home deliveries um um curbside pickup and things like that also what we have found is people are making fewer trips to the store so they may still buy the same amounts but they just they want to be exposed less so go do have fewer trips so our um initial results the calibration phase and the second phase as i mentioned in the previous slide and i just want to say here we have done about six different versions now and again these take a lot of time to run so this has been a very very iterative process like i mentioned earlier but the currently our model is predicting vegetable purchasing and intake relatively well um we did find that the model is underestimating the use of supermarkets and overestimating the use of convenience stores to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables it's so we are having to make a change in that and um we are also we'll be including new rule which is that agents want to shop at places that offer a high variety of food and non-food items and and that they also have non-food items and services available so really what we're finding is that most people prefer to purchase foods at supermarkets because there are a variety of services in addition to just buying a high variety of food so we are currently running another version of our model and hopefully um this will come closer to you know what we're seeing in reality so um ultimately again um the reason why we're creating these models is that we really hope that this these simulation results can help informal local policies and programs to improve improve food access and reduce food insecurity among austin residents and then of course particularly among those residents who reside in the areas where our study takes place which is low income predominantly minority areas such as the eastern crescent in austin so next slide it's supposed to be last slides and so we want to thank y'all for attending this webinar and if there are any questions please again feel free to put them in the chat box and we can start looking at those right now i think we have about um five to ten minutes left okay yes guys i'm intro too but i think you're gonna read the question in the chat box i am going to read this question thank you um how were interviewers chosen for the phone interviews to collect the qualitative data represented i noticed a lack of representation for black individuals or individuals that won't fall under other and i'm happy to take this but please sandra and katie chime on in um so we actually categorize people as food secure food insecure before covet and newly food insecure and then we randomly chose participants that fell in one of those three categories now we collected about 60 we interviewed about 68 individuals but only analyzed data for about 54 i think vidi said or 53. um so there may be black individuals in there that we just haven't analyzed but because our entire sample was 18 individuals so like six percent of our cohort was black i think that would relate to about two two individuals that were black and so i we probably have that in the data that were not analyzed um but the fact that we have more hispanic and white it's just reflective of the makeup of the county yeah and i just want to add to that so what i say is that our qualitative the people we chose for our qualitative interviews were people that also participated in our cohort um and the original cohort um we it went through a very um let's say complicated design to to be to collect or to recruit people that as randomly as possible um so yes we have fewer african-americans in our sample and i think that is started with our very very first recruitment um phase in which there were fewer african americans living in the areas that we were recruiting from so it's not by design it's just again we tried to do this as randomly as possible and that has just had you know kind of like implications for all the other data collections we've done since our very first data collection in 2018. just to quickly add though i believe it's very close to what the um composition is for the county so i think that we have between six and seven percent of our overall cohort sample identifies as black or african-american and it's between seven and eight percent um for the county so it seems underrepresented but it's um rather representative for the county demographics and um composition currently thank you okay um next question i see i am just wondering well hold on i just lost it let me get back up i'm just wondering why are those individuals of color so food insecure do you foresee that this will change for individuals of color um this is a great question katie i'm gonna let you start out entering you know look at that um i think it's really important when we think about food insecurity to understand that issues of food insecurity also coalesce and congregate around with other issues associated with poverty um so differences in financial inequalities um housing issues rent assistance all of these things and i think that there are some really interesting perspectives that are considering food insecurity as a ramification of structural violence and racism and that is why one of the ramifications of structural violence and racism and that's why food insecurity prevalence is higher among communities of color within this country and i think that that notion has some really um strong preliminary evidence behind it and i think that it's something that when we as a society have a better understanding of the work that we need to do for racial reconciliation and to address some of these underlying disparities and socioeconomic differences that are legacies of past policies um whether that be redlining or other um issues that kind of first geographically geographically congregated communities and colors and restricted them to live in certain areas of cities and that those areas also happen to be food deserts and that that is associated with higher prevalence of food insecurity i think the more that we think of these as structural fact the more hope that we have at reducing those disparities um so i've seen some really empowering and hopeful literature coming out of trying to design very culturally appropriate interventions that are trying to get at some of these underlying issues but i hope that with a wider social safety net on some of these disparities from a policy level that some of these disparities could also be mitigated a great question it's very complicated yes yes we could do a whole series of seminars on that question and one if you asked if we can share our survey we are very happy to share our survey um you can either email us at one of the emails that are listed here or it's maybe possible to send out the survey um on the website or something like that but yes we are definitely very happy to share our survey um another question do you believe that the study could be adapted in areas with higher rates of minorities and poverties like the rio grande valley in south texas um i'm not sure if the if the question is specifically the data collection or to the modeling but i would say the answer is yes to either one and if you are referring to the modeling asp components of the study um that is specific to a certain area a region but the same um methodology can be used we would just have to create an environment based on you know the rio grande valley and which is going to be different than austin right we have a different food environment here than you would have down there so that is something that would be different the agents would have to be different but the whole methodology certainly can be adapted to any area in the united states or anywhere for that matter let me see i'm seeing some specific questions about if these types of studies are occurring in houston or dallas or other specific regional areas um i think that there are some that are trying to improve food success and food and security definitely within both of those communities but i'm not entirely certain of what also utilizes agent-based modeling approaches um as well as like with geospatial with qualitative with quantitative so i can't guarantee that um but sandra do you have any ideas um no i'm saying i i do know there's there's does seem to be quite a few places where we are where people are collecting data um in terms of food insecurity especially after cobit has happened um and in general we see the same trends as we're seeing in our studies um there are other cities where some of the agent-based modeling is being done um but not necessarily in tech i don't know any other places in texas where they're doing that yes also a quick question that i know we can answer quickly because we're running out of time is about whether this data and information will be shared with grocers convenience stores to improve access issues identified between this research team and other research initiatives that various members of this webinar are on um we have really strong relationships with the city of austin and the um austin travis county food policy board as well as some of their various initiatives such as the healthy cornerstone store program and potential collaborators within grocery store communities and business enterprises so we have a pretty strong dissemination plan within that to make sure that our findings are being shared widely within the community i think for um we have reached our one hour time limit i know there are some other really good questions and we are happy to answer those um normally what we do is we collect all these questions write up the answers and then send them to people so we will do that for this webinar as well so just want to thank everybody for joining us and have a great rest of your day great rest of your week", "ZdbK9OCIjPo": "[Music] yes hi friends welcome welcome back to my channel my name is akela if you are new if you are new how are you doing how have you been so i have this wig in store right here we haven't gone blown in a minute a very hot minute we have this beautiful blonde wig with these brown roots from julia hair everything will be linked in the description box thank you to them for sponsoring this video so if you want to see how it is that i got this hair looking like this keep on watching so this wig is from julia hair we're going to install we're going to see how this ends up coming out hopefully by the end of this we enjoy it so we're going to use that to be spray got to be gel i apologize if my mood is a bit low i'm just going through it everything that could be going wrong in my life just having a horrible 20 21. [Music] so [Music] i am going to tie this up with my elastic all right so i'm gonna go um and do my makeup look presentable and then we're gonna come back and we're going to style this hair kind of my makeup looks horrible but whatever so this is what we're working with right now i thought i plucked this wig very well but i guess i didn't pluck it as good as i thought we're gonna do some baby hairs i haven't done edges on a blown wig in a minute so we'll see how well good would it be [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm gonna just take a little bit off first i don't know if i want to cut it we're gonna cut off make it blunt all right all right i'm gonna leave it like this i'm gonna turn on my straightener we're going to straighten it out and then we'll see if we want to cut any shorter we'll see if you see that like there are some silvery purplish pieces i'm going to tell you i um put it in some purple shampoo to wash it so i put the water in the sink put the shampoo in swished it around and then put the wig in but for some reason it still ended up with some spots just getting a lot of shampoo on them and then it just turned this color so that's what it is um this actually looks really nice i was very concerned about the roots being this color i don't have a problem with having straight blue on her i've had it before it looks good on me i look really nice with a just straight blown wig but i'm really enjoying these roots um i really want to maybe like next week or so go and buy some hair dye to get it in like a nice ash you know that that ash blonde what the girls get like this is just more of a just a purple shampoo blonde you know what i'm saying like it's still got a little bit of hint of yellow on it like but i think this and a nice ash like a proper ash blind would hit i'm so stressed all right let's put a bit of this stuff in here this is some shine oil put that in the hair all right and then we're gonna straighten her out [Music] oh [Music] let me see [Music] that's also this is the finished look i would love to bring you into the sun [Music] so you can see can you see that anyway um the sun is getting ready to not set but it's it's going away so i can't really um do that but this is the final look again it is a bit purple you know it's giving silver highlights that wasn't the intention but that's just what it's giving and that's just what it's going to give but we have some blonde hair i haven't been blown in literally probably like two and a half years and i am really feeling this i'm loving these brown roots really loving these brown roots and yeah so that is the end of this video thank you again to julia here for sending me this wig and sponsoring this video everything will be linked in the description box so you can purchase this wig this is off this is for all skin tones this is hidden i'm not like this is this is really nice um so yeah let me know how you think about this hair like what your thoughts is did i pull it off do i look good do i look not good like tell me in the comments down below and um yeah so don't forget to subscribe to my channel because you know you're gonna be living with me turn

goodness isn't that true rainbows do disappear you see them after it rains and it has rained hopefully you have seen that rainbow before you would see them in the sky like this and then all of a sudden it's gone oh my goodness let's do that one more time ready see the rain go way up high up high spreading colors in the sky red and orange and yellow too green and purple hug some blue watch it quickly it won't last rainbows can't disappear fast wow it disappeared [Applause] i love to see rainbows oh yes it is so much fun in the sky when you see it you know it's amazing and it's i think rainbows are a sign a sign of hope i think so in this awesome book and i'm going to be um so it's it's story time and now we are done with songs i'm going to put that in all done after story we have art okay so first is story so go ahead i'm gonna go ahead and pull forward a little bit because this one has fun pictures and these are like pencil you know the color pencil drawings that you probably can do it at home too so that's what this illustrations are yes and it's so pretty but it's not as bright as other paintings right so this one is called there is a rainbow do you see the rainbow tupes right there espanol the author of this book is theresa trinder that's the author the person who wrote the story and the pictures are by grant snyder and that's the person who what who did the artwork the pictures he illustrated through the pictures and i am reading this with permission from chronicle books thank you for allowing us to share this book during these uncertain times thank you it's the publisher that we like to think there is a rainbow i esta arco edis let's begin do you see the rainbow do you yes it's so beautiful a story has a beginning and and ends [Music] not isn't that true huh when you do a story it has the beginning and then it has the ends like the rainbow beginning and the end there is a here and there is a there are you an aki for sure look so i want you to play uh pay close attention to the illustrations so i see a neighborhood right and i see children and the chill i see a little rainbow that they drew on the sidewalk there's birds oh there's the little girl and there is something in between so i already entremedio dude look at that so pretty she's sitting on the street oh now she's inside on the other side of the screen on the other side of the screen she's on her laptop on the other side of the screen and elotronado de la fanta there is a school how many of you have done school through zoom yes there is a school so this is currently it's what's happening currently she is doing schoolwork isn't that cool on the other side of a window and lo trollado they love intana and look what what he's doing he's painting something it's on the other side of the window there is a neighbor you see that they are walking taking their daily walk with their our neighbors on the other side yes oh look at him on the other side of the street and the lo trollado de la dela there he is what does he have he has a letter or a card maybe he drew something maybe he's thinking of someone and he made a little note let's see there is help on the other side of the street there is help look at the little boy he's mailing the card or the letter that he did and so who's gonna help the mailman he's gonna pick up the mail and then what's gonna happen let's see on the other side of town [Music] there is a voice hello i do you see what happened here that's probably grandma and grandma opened the letter the envelope and in the letter there was a little rainbow how sweet is that the little boy drew that for grandma he's thinking of her on the other side of the river there is light there is light i you see the yellow that is light yes on the other side of a mountain and lo trolato de la montana it looks like they're hiking do you see that oh i love hiking with family and friends there is a path i uncamino you see the path are they having fun yes they are they're exercising they're looking at nature butterflies plans on the other side of sadness oh why is she sad and a lot of love she's sad because she's missing her friends porque estranja sus amigos on the other side of sadness there are hugs oh i muchos abrasos mommy hugs her when she's sad on the other side of a storm have you seen a storm raining lots lots of lots on the other side of the storm and the lotus lado de la tormenta what do you think there is a rainbow it looks like it's upside down because it's a reflection it's not reflection this is a puddle of water but where is the rainbow down or up up oh they're happy aren't they they're seeing the rainbow up close on the other side of today so there's the rainbow the other side of today there is tomorrow and what's happening tomorrow you know later on children are going back to school yes [Music] isn't that cool and it says here stay safe thank you heroes and stay strong and hope that means we'd like to thank everyone you know yes so cool i love this new book it's new book about what's going on now and but there is a tomorrow yes awesome i hope you enjoyed this so we are going to be making our own rainbow yes our own rainbow of hope inspired by an artist so if you can follow me we're gonna go slowly over here the back i also have the instructions they're right here and there's paint so paint the this time we are using tempura paint okay so it is washable so if it gets on your on your clothes you know you can wash it off it gets on your hands just wash it off with a water and soap it's just some pearl paint and then i also included a paint brush so you have a paint brush and i also included a little circle but this is just in case you didn't have any circle or if you want to use this one it's good if not you could use something else this art is inspired by alma alma woodsy thomas alma was a painter african-american painter that actually started she was a art teacher first but then it says here she was born in columbus georgia she debuted her abstract work in an exhibition at howard university in 1966. the age of 75 years old wow amazing alma woodsy thomas was the first african-american woman to have a solo exhibition at that new york's um whitney museum of american arts wow that's impressive very impressive i i saw this and it was also inspired so by alma woodsy thomas and i got the idea from deep space sparkle okay for those of you that would like to get more ideas deep space sparkle is another great uh site that you can go these are some samples of her artwork as you can see they are little um like dashes of paint and then she has different blues and greens and pinks and orange and yellow right so it's like a mountain so pretty but she also did these um circular like a mandela kinda but a circular and this is what we're going to try to do today or you could also do it in lines like this or you could just do a rainbow of your choice like an an arch a rainbow if you would like to do it that way but it depends on you how you would like to do it this one is lines okay and this one is a little circle i put my circle over here towards the uh the top corner and then i went around and around and around and i actually chose the rainbow colors you see that rainbow colors but you could choose either different lots of just you know colors or a few colors and then i want to show you another one that i have over here one of our top colleagues his name is sam he actually made one also inspired by alma but he made it a little different and that's that's the thing with abstract painting it is your artwork so it's your creative juices that really come out when you're doing art so he decided he wanted to make not little dashes but little squiggles see that so cool and i could see the white the spaces and that's what's so neat about her artwork alma she left little white spaces and that's what really adds to the whole artwork and then sam also did little squiggly lines up like that like rays and he decided to add like it inspired him like to see like a clock see he also added some numbers like a clock and he also added some little creatures what are those little snakes so this is your artwork so you can decide how you would like it to look okay so that's why and he even signed his his um his signature there his name because this is his unique artwork that he did isn't that amazing so hopefully you guys can do similar like that this other one has the circle in the middle of the paper you see that if you want it in the middle that's probably how it's going to look different um type but this one i added it towards the side so you decide how you want to do it so it's a little harder to do it um a circle like that but you can do it for the younger ones i do recommend the line ones okay because it's just little dashes and for the older ones that are more challenging you could just use your circle or you could actually kind of get something else and then just draw the circle and then you could go from there okay but i'm going to use my red circle the little cutout and i'm just going to go ahead and glue it um yeah i think right here just put a little bit of glue and so see this one i put it up more higher this one is a little lower and i'm gonna start there it gives me a good guideline so i'll get my paints which are here maybe you can have one of your adults open up your paints because it's a little harder for little fingers okay so i'm just going to open them all up and then the colors of the paints are kind of like rainbow colors red orange yellow green blue and purple so i'm gonna go ahead and open them up have it ready i need on my paintbrush and i also need a paper towel so if you have paper towels it is a good idea to have one handy because after i use one color i'm going to be use wiping it down just like that and then using another color since my dot is red i am going to use red okay so i'm going to dip it in the red and then i'm going to just make little dashes and i'm going to skip you know what i'm going to do i'm going to use my tray like this so you could watch so i'm going to um do little dashes wow you see that so i'm picking up my paintbrush and it's i need some more so just a little bit like that and i'm gonna go over because i really want it to pop so the first time it didn't go through all of it then right here i need a little bit okay see see how i'm leaving white i'm not just doing the circle i am picking up my my paintbrush so i'm just gonna go dash dash dash and then do it the other way i'm just picking it up and going over and one more that's how she would do it alma would do it like that okay and then i think i'm gonna do um orange next just like garlic she did she did hers with blue she started with green and then she did blue blue blue and then red red red and then orange orange and yellow yellow so you decide what colors you want to use because this is your masterpiece so i'm done with my red i'm going to get my paper towel kind of wipe off the paint brush and then the i don't have two sizes they said it's recommended to use two sizes of the um paint brush but i don't have two sizes so i'm gonna go ahead and dip it in my orange and if i want thinner i'm just gonna go you know slide it but not the white part just like this see like a line let's do that okay yeah see how how that adds a little more it's thinner the lines are thinner they're not as wide so it will add really a nice um look see that and then i can actually get more and then go back to my thicker lines thick and and thin okay so i'm gonna do thicker now like that and keep adding it all around maybe i need more add more paint to just have fun okay this is very relaxing if you put on some music uh it'll help a lot if there's music playing background it really helps a lot and i think i'm going to do another thin line with the same orange and then i'm going to switch to yellow but see how i'm doing it just around following around around like a mandela so relaxing wow am i ready for yellow you think so i'm going to try yellow now and then the other tip that i want to give you is um if you're doing it on your table if it's hard for your hand to go around guess what look what i'm going to do with the yellow i'm going to actually move my paper instead of my my hands okay watch so i'm gonna do yellow i don't know if you can see it and i'm moving my paper and not my my hand but maybe it's easier for you to do it that way okay and it's a lot faster because you're just doing like that but if it's easy for you to move your hand why not just keep doing how how you were doing it okay so now take a look at i'm just gonna retouch the yellow the yellow is a little light so i'm kind of retouching it but i am i'm not making the circle i am what i am leaving spaces white spaces see and she left a little bit of that white and that's the idea of leaving white but the more you do it the easier it gets okay well this is my little paper i'm gonna go ahead and change yellow to my green okay let's do this again so you can see this is how i'm doing it if you come to the library i made a rainbow on the um a bulletin board and that one i made with a bigger brush and it's huge it's big so i would like for you to look at it if you like i just thought rainbows and spring next week is gonna be spring so i said hey why not and it's been raining and why not make rainbows it's a rainbow of hope that's what i'm calling it because since you know the lockdown everybody's been missing friends and family i said hey we should just make rainbows and you could even give this save it for your your relative grandma would love to see your rainbow parents grandparents aunts uncles yeah you see that isn't that awesome let's see how am i doing on time oh not bad actually okay so we're done with green and i'm using my paper towel to kind of wipe my brush i'm not using water because i don't want to dilute my uh paint because i like bright colors and and if you use water to wash it off and you don't dry it then it's going to dilute your um your bra your paint okay now we're uh blue and as you can see there's not much um space on the side but i'm still going to be going around around and around or you could also just make um a rainbow like just an arch but because of her inspiration i just said hey let's just do this this way and see how that goes so blue it gets you thinking of all the colors that you can use and then i'm going to so that's the narrow that's the side of my brush now i'm going to do the thicker side okay uh how wide that's a pretty blue so nice i hope you guys are having fun [Music] it'll be up later and youtube um by maybe probably by monday i'm gonna make another blue i really like blue so another line of blue okay just keep adding and you could actually put it closer together i'm kind of leaving a little bit of the white but if you have time because i'm doing it fast which you shouldn't do fast when you're doing art actually i need one more here just like that should we do the purple now yes okay let me wipe my paint off the paintbrush and now we're going to go for purple the purple is the last color of the rainbow huh yeah purple let's do purple okay should i do thin lines go more or like sam did he did squiggles so you decide how you want it okay it's your artwork you could add little creatures like he did you could he was inspired and he added uh numbers because maybe he died about the clocks or the time change you know how the time changed also so maybe that something inspired him to also like add the snakes so it's your inspiration that's what's fun about art and if you really like it you could also send us a picture or tag us unopposed at escondido library we would love to see what you came up with all art is unique it sure is a little bit there you go that was lighter i love purple that's my favorite color what's your favorite color maybe you could use that favorite color more huh oops and you just keep going going going until you cover the whole paper there we go okay i don't want to take too much of your time but i'm just having a lot of fun with this and then if you're doing like the um the the lines the lines you just start you just start on the very top or bottom however you want to do it and the same thing dash that stash and then small small small small and then you know thick thick thick and you just go on like that like you're writing okay the circle is a little harder so i'm not going to finish it right now because i don't want to take up all your knit or your time but after like purple i can start again with now red right if i wanted to make like a pattern so i could start again finish up with red and then what's after red orange and then yellow and it'll be all covered up and then i can display it at my house to really give me that you know the hope yes yes or i would give it to someone that that i am missing uh-huh so i hope you like this project next time because as you remember inclusive art club is every first and third friday of the month uh next time that we're on we're probably gonna work on a sculpture so you know keep um go on our website you know find out when the kids are the kids are available the first week of the month and uh what third week of the month on a monday so the fridays when we do the program they're available on the monday before the program okay so i hope you enjoyed our our little art yeah so have fun making your your art painting your rainbow okay thanks for joining all right we will see you next time bye", "UqqCvfxRgSg": "this down here good morning welcome to med 210 anatomy and physiology 2 the sequel it is the first day week 1 wednesday march 17. if you had me before for anatomy and physiology one it's the same exact format and um i will put the uh dates for the laboratories and it's in may so the dates are just right off the top of my head is may 5 and may 12. so that's wednesday may 5 and may 12 9 a.m fourth floor health lab one alexandria campus and if you can't make it please email me uh this week uh or as soon as possible um so that we can uh talk about um you know alternative things that we can do for your grade and the final examination is on wednesday it'll be in the same format online wednesday nine a.m uh may may 19th that's your final and your midterm is wednesday 9 a.m april 14 and again all of these will be announced um here in your announcements but i just want to get it verbally out there so you can start looking at your schedules and planning ahead let's go over the syllabus and like i said same exact format um as your anatomy and physiology one and it's just a a continuation with a and every week is uh 10 including the midterm and the final and those of you who had me before some of you had really bad grades on your midterm and final but you still got an a how is that possible because if you get like a 72 uh on 10 of your grade and you did everything else uh so that 72 is let's say you did like um 90 throughout the uh throughout the whole term now that 72 percent uh adds uh seven more points so you end up with a 97 so that's still an a so uh many of you uh uh had that um but i believe uh last term anatomy physiology one you guys did pretty good so um not a lot of people fell into that category and you'll see everyone who got a's are people who consistently do their work every week okay so again we have zoom sessions wednesday mornings 9 a.m my zoom sessions i try not to go over an hour and a half because you have work to do and um the work is weekly a task and a discussion and um and a case study that's located in the lesson and if you watch the video i always will point out where the case study is so you know exactly what to click on so we'll be focusing on this term um uh immunology that's like the first two weeks um both the uh non-specific or innate means uh you know your immunologic system that you're born with and then of course the um uh next week we'll be talking about specific immunity and this is all apropos to go uh regarding what's going on uh on in this world and um and and a lot of it's really important on how you speak to your patient uh on these things because even after a year of all this stuff there's so much misconception about how your immune system works and how this virus works and how i believe i believe people now are more confused than they were a year ago let me see if somebody i got a message it might be a student oh okay student in another class now of course our textbook is going to be the online textbook and every week 10 discussion task lesson unless i say otherwise and typically in week 4 uh i won't let you do the case study because you should be studying for your um uh for your midterm and probably week nine i won't let you do the lesson because you should be studying for your final for week 10. the discussion same format as for those of you who are in my anatomy and physiology 1 anywhere from 200 to 250 words um and i'm not too um there's only like four or five of you in this class so only answer one person and when either your primary discussion post and the answer that you have to somebody you should have evidence at least one seventh edition apa format citation and uh if you still don't know how to do that i i don't know what else i could do for you uh but you guys are pros you should you should be able to ace these discussions but if you're still having trouble give me a call and then or you can speak to laura deleon which is our universal university librarian another thing you could also do is here if you look at your moodle you go up here on the top and you go into library apa uh sources it's really important that um that you be aware of what plagiarism looks like because your future professors will just give you zero and then you do it again your future professors will then send you an email cc our campus president and then you'll be in danger of failing the course uh four people failed courses one person was removed last year so please don't be that person and um nine times out of ten it's usually unintentional plagiarism but whether intentional or unintentional if you are utilizing a source that you are not citing in education it's a big big no-no those of you who are nursing must maintain a b minus or better but when you look at it come on 80 percent of the material do you want a doctor or nurse working on your children who only knows eighty percent of the material so you know really strive to really get that um uh retention going and a lot of it is um time management and repetition so if you're one of these people who who cram everything and try to get rid of everything done wednesday early morning or tuesday night before things are due because things are due typically wednesday morning at 9 00 a.m so task one discussion one and uh lesson one is due of course next week and next week is uh today is i believe the 17th so next week is the 24th so 24th 9 a.m uh late um what do you call that late protocol stand meaning to say is for every day that you do not post it's uh one grade off and in three days you're already down to 70 or 60 so you know but at least partial credit is better than no credit um this is a different way to look at it your tasks are 33 um your lesson in your labs 33 and your discussions but essentially if you look at it my way every week is 10 so every week you have an opportunity to build your grade so that you know by week five you kind of know that whether you're passing the class or or failing or not but of course i'll tell you if you're in trouble here on your syllabus it uh it goes through everything that you're going to be covering every week and um it's mirrored also here on your uh on your moodle course shell and if during week 8 week 9 week 10 inclement weather policy you guys have my contact information it's in announcements um so or if you have rave alert r-a-v-e if you don't have that um contact myself so i can get you in touch with kathy vargas student uh services manager to get you hooked up to rave alerts rave alerts tell you when the uh when the campus is closed and i'll usually when it's closed or not i'll usually call it uh the night before uh personally for for for my class so always look at your announcements daily uh when we're on campus campus security that also includes uh kovid and those of you who have been to my labs before know that we glove in we mask in we stay gloved we stay masked and we try to um we try to not bring too many personal items to school and even if you do we sequester them in the back of the room separate from everybody else so no one should be touching anybody um and our laboratories those of you who have attended it i try to make it fast an hour hour and a half tops so that um you know so we can so we can uh you know get to what we need to get to and uh decrease the level of exposure um honor code that's another thing if you want to cheat be my guest if i catch you i catch you i don't i don't but i i make the same speech every term um you'll get caught in the real world and in the real world they'll prosecute with the uh with the maximum extent of the law and it will not be pretty so it won't be just losing your job you'll get you'll get charges um and you'll get uh lawsuits that kind of thing because this is healthcare we touch we touch people's health and uh that's a really really that's a really really important thing so with that with that said again it's good that i recorded it because sometimes i talk a little bit fast and um please look on the chat um let me get them okay good i'm just making sure i got the right attendance introduction to the course so and again i record everything you guys know that and then i put it here in the announcements so um and of course any questions i try to monitor the chat um uh but since it's such a small class uh you can unmute yourself and just uh call out and say hey excuse me i got a question of course here's your textbook uh i don't know what this is learning links uh you could try it out later um this is new this term uh what's not new for this term uh was new last service tutor.com try that out um if you as an adult what do we always do we try to handle things on our own uh don't do that always call out for help a true professional calls out for help early calls out for help help off often um don't just sit there at home in misery or or at work wherever you do your work and don't sit there in misery and hope things will change always get help seventh apa seventh edition resources that here is uh so as well so you have seventh edition apa right here you have also this library so there's no excuse um to not do these discussions so task one what's the task uh don loan sign and upload the lab safety contract just like last term and i forgot where the safety contract is let me let's check real quick i think it's here in course introduction yeah course introduction important documents and and you click on this little button here and there's a lab contract right here okay so you you take that you print it uh you sign it and then take a picture of it or scan it if you have a scanner at home uh and then of course put that in there and that's task one and we need that for the lab so but do that do that today um discussion one let's look at it cdc issued alert for zika i know it's a little bit dated but it's the same thing right it's you how's this replace zika with corona right because uh again like i said there's a lot of misconceptions and try to link it to you're in a 200 level class now try to link it to today's lecture try to link it to what's going on in today and if you're gonna talk about corona i need 2021 data okay 2020 uh is a little bit old 2021 data we're we're well um well well uh into the first quarter there's a lot of things now that are changing so try to get 2021 data when you're talking about um uh healthcare science and all that jazz and if you've had me before i was a little bit i was not a little bit i was a lot lenient i was accepting stuff from 2015 2016. nah you're a 200 level class now so hit up 2021 data um it'll be best for you um to get the no what's the latest and lesson let's just point out where the lesson is before we hop on to the lecture the lesson is right here click on that that's of course due next week by 9 a.m lost in the desert um answer this final set of case questions uh one through seven put it in a microsoft word document and and uh ladies and gentlemen please on your um on your document put your name date you know the whole formal thing name date uh with you guys it's easy there's not many of you there's only five or six of you but when you have your other professors who have multiple uh multiple classes they could have up to a hundred of you um you know uh and all taking the same class and uh they won't know you from adam so make sure you have your name your date and what class and and if you want to know the specific class when you look up here this is called a popcorn popcorn trail when you look up here when you want to go back to your main page the class here in question is med 210 le means lecture la means lab six means wednesdays so it goes four five six seven eight nine for mondays through saturdays d means day or morning a means afternoon or 1 pm and n means evening or 6 pm ax is the camp is the home campus of the professor so if it's lela lecture and lab here alexandria campus wednesdays nine a.m so now that we know all that got that we got all the uh uh the pertinents out of the way let's jump right in and let's see what we're talking about we're talking today about the integumentary system and we're also going to be talking about um um the innate um immune system meaning the non-specific stuff you were born with stuff that didn't get developed right right out of the gate which are your body defenses and protections and let's open up oh i forgot to see what chapter it was you know you'd think by now i'd memorize all the chapters chapter five so chapter five in your textbook so we go here go into your course textbook table of contents scroll all the way down to five and we're here okay so when you look at skin it's not just a covering it's way more than that and it plays several different roles it has several different layers it also has accessory structures that uh relate to its role so skin is not just a covering right it has a whole bunch of functions and we're going to talk about it in a moment and because this class is anatomy and physiology so how does uh what are the parts and how does it work so right off the bat this is a beautiful shot right here lovely first question on a midterm because can i erase all of these and just ask you to identify everything that's a hair that's a muscle called your erectile pill eye muscle it is associated with hair shaft and your hair follicle right so when you get cold or scared your hair on your skin stands up well there's a muscle associated with that and that's your erectile pill eye muscle so you could see now that the skin it's in layers epidermis dermis and hypodermis the hypodermis is also known as subcutaneous tissue and you can see here it's a living breathing thing because it has see this red tube that's an artery it takes oxygen to the skin here's a vein this blue and they're not really red and blue in real life you guys already know that we use these conventions um to to identify structures in a diagram so if i pointed this this is a vein and that takes oxy that takes carbon dioxide away from the system here because the system requires energy in the form of oxygen then the energy gets spent away and then what are we carrying away carbon dioxide you could see that just like a shielding it comes in layers and to protect you okay uh what else sebaceous gland sebum s-e-b-u-m is oil and it keeps this hair soft and supple when you get older you have less oil you have less water the hair gets what brittle okay and of course hair follicle you could see why it hurts if i pull your hair because look what it's all associated with see these little uh wires here those are nerves here you got another set of nerves here too that control the erector uh erector pili so if these nerves here you have your uh pacinian corpuscle and you also have uh meissner's which is another set pacinian is for deep meissner is for um is is more up here like this nerve like here it's more of a soft touch here when you sense that you're cold what happens your brain sends a signal to this uh sensory nerve fiber here right well this is um this one they say this is a sensory but this one's motor this is mislabeled your pacinian is a sensory but this one's motor and how do i know it's connected right to a muscle so if your pacinian corpuscle starts um identifying that you're cold it'll send a message ascending track up to your brain your brain says oh you know what the erector pill i should start pulling on these muscles to get to get uh you know to cut the wind you know uh the wind and the cold in my in my skin so it'll send a message from the brain to this motor nerve fiber right into this uh muscle and the muscle is going to pull that hair straight up and that also happens when you're scared or when you know you know when you get the chills when you think there's a ghost in the room or something like that i don't know don't get me started on ghosts i have a whole lecture on that so the layers epidermis dermis and hypodermis the epidermis right is epi your prefix meaning superficial on the top dermis that's the main and the hypodermis do you notice on the epidermis there are no nerves and there are no arteries and veins that's why when me and my sister were kids you could stick you know pins and needles through this layer and would you have blood nope would you feel anything nope and uh you know five-year-old nelson thought that was hilarious but what happens when you play the game and then you dig too deep and hit one of these nerves then you will feel the pain and that's that starts at the level of the dermis now the level of the hypodermis also known as your subcutaneous tissue what does it have fat fat here is not only for storage of glucose it provides a nice insulation to your body into your skin and it also has a nice cushioning effect on your skin here's an echoing sweat gland so that's another function of your skin thermal regulation now with your sweat do you guys ever notice even if you don't drink or smoke you go to a bar right and then uh right before when you go home right let's say you were having dinner at this bar you go home you smell yourself doesn't it smell like smoke and smoke and alcohol because you got exposed to that so what did the skin do it formed as a filter and one of the ways that we can get rid of uh you know poisonous things or things that may be foreign to the human body like smoke and you know the smell of alcohol you could sweat it out those of you who know that i've been a dj for 30 years and every time i come home i smell like the entire bar and my wife always gets annoyed she's like she says to me like oh my god were you smoking weed and i'm like no i'm not smoking weed medical professional i don't smoke weed right but you get exposed to that smoke it gets soaked up in the skin the skin uh utilizes it uh all that um uh all that smoke um and then what will happen it it's considered a toxin and your sweat will sweat it out that's why even if you have just a single beer uh your clothes will reek it'll it'll smell smell like a brewery so let's let's let's have a quick overview overview on what functions that we talked so far so there's an immunologic function the skin when it's intact keeps all the bad things all out here because you want all the pathogens anywhere near any of these nerves arteries or veins because what happens when um like for example there's a whole bunch of staphylococcus aureus um bacteria all over your skin that's why we disinfect your skin anytime we do surgery or venipuncture you know when we take your blood because if any of the stuff on the outside gets in here don't you think it can go right here and then go into my systemic blood then you're gonna get sepsis that's why those of you who had my class before know that i do not i i'm not a fan of the department of surgery because when you do surgery i'm cutting into this protective function another function that we already knew is what hair and the sebaceous gland keeps your hair and your skin uh soft and smooth right because of its oil the sebum right and it also has thermal regulation when you get hot what happens you have sweat glands and then last but not least the sweat glands also uh provide like a filtration uh uh service uh to any noxious fumes or um you know any particulate matter that comes into contact with the skin so right now just in this last 10 minutes you'll now see how complex the skin is and how it's more than just a covering it's a living breathing thing with layers and what can i do can i have this picture and then just erase all this and a b c d e f g yup it's easy isn't it now another thing that the um uh that the skin has you have thick skin and you have thin skin now your thick skin has one more layer than your thin skin and i want you to know that thick skin there are certain places on your body where the skin has to be thicker than uh than everywhere else like your palms of your hands and the soles of your feet now the palms in your hands and the sole of your feet have in their epidermis and we're going to go over the layers an extra layer and that's the lucid layer or the clear layer known as the stratum lucidium now the stratum lucidum is thick skin that's a this this is a common anatomy and physiology question like what's the difference between thick and thin skin it's an extra fifth layer in the epidermis called your stratum lucidum another thing about your um the basal layer or the first layer of your epidermis is it has these cells called keratinocytes keratinocytes make this protein called keratin and that's what makes your skin tough if you recall the anatomy and physiology lab remember uh when we were uh messing around with the piggies we tried to rip the skin with our with our gloved hands it wasn't easy it's not easy because in the basal layers or the stratum basale in your epidermis there are keratinocytes that make keratin and that keratin that's what gives your hair your nails um not only water resistant properties but it gives it that hardness so doesn't that look like a beautiful both a and b question i think so and right here is a lovely diagram of your epidermis now do you think i could also erase all of this abcdefg yep so we just talked about the basal layers or the stratum basale right what did it have it had a lot of keratinocytes right keratin where's the uh here right so that's what gives it tough now the thing about this is the more the the deeper you get the younger the cell and the more superficial you get when you get up to the stratum corneum and this how i remember it it looks like corn flakes right and these cells are dead that's why you that's why you know when you scratch your skin you get all ashy right well this is it this is your ashiness source because these are dead skin cells that just flake off and all day right especially if uh you know you uh you shower and and and you know uh you know wash regularly right this this layer get will keep on getting replaced by these other layers and remember the stratum sedum is your fifth extra layer for thick skin you have your stratum granulosum that has all these granule granules in it in their cells and what else is also important in your basal stratum basale you have melanocytes melanocytes uh release a chemical called melanin the function of melanin again is the protection of the skin against uv radiation that's why we are all of different colors because genetically uh if you're lighter skinned and blue eyes your genetics are from uh you know the poles uh you know a more colder place and that those colder places on the uh on our planet they're not exposed to uv radiation not as much as people who have genetics from locations closer to the equator so if you're closer to the equator you're or your your your family history and your family genetics you'll have more melanocytes and people who have more color in their skin have more melanocytes and they have better protection against uv radiation now not to say that if you're you have dark skin that you won't like if you're in the sun enough you won't be predisposed to stuff like basal cell carcinoma or skin cancer but you'll have a less chance because who gets basal cell carcinoma who gets skin cancer more often is people who have less melanocytes or people who have fairer skin so again epidermal layer it's on the top the very very top letter the stratum corneum that's where you have dead skin cells that's when they flake off lucidum that's the extra fifth layer for the thick skin uh the stratum basale has two very important cells melanocytes and keratinocytes and know what they know what they do now you see this this is a sensory neuron and this is called the merkle cell so this is um remember we talked about um there was um the pacinian corpuscle was deep well merkel cells and this sensory neuron is what superficial but you can see it's all the way in the basal layer so i could stick a needle through all of this and i won't feel anything but if the needle gets deep and i and i touch this you're going to feel it um what else is important we also have um langerhans cell that's a macrophage so it eats up bacteria foreign particles because remember the skin is exposed to a lot of nasty things especially the epidermis so we have these things called langerhans cells and they're macrophage um they're they're not smart langerhans cells macrophages aren't smart uh they they attack just things that don't look right so they have to identify if it identifies the cell as not being part of your skin it'll just totally eat it up um hence the term macrophage macro means large fodge means eating so the langerhans cell and that is in uh your epidermis and specifically where here in your stratum spinosum but you know i won't go that uh i won't ask you where where exactly is it uh but i will ask you what is the function of langerhans cell and you'll tell me immunologic it's a macrophage it eats up a foreign body and bacteria now we already talked about keratinocytes and keratin right and what does it do makes things like your nails and your skin hard slash waterproof okay uh let's now go a little bit deeper the deeper the dermis that's like the main part of the skin right and the epidermis is the very very top part and the dermis is the middle part now what's so important about the middle part well middle part is the it's the glue it holds everything together and what what does it have you can see here there's a papillary layer papilla means um fingers so if you see how it goes like this and forms these fingers so it will like act as a glue to keep the epidermis the top part right this part see look familiar right and the middle part which is the dermis uh together it also has elastin and elastic fibers we also kind of saw that when we were in dissection when we were playing around with the skin now the hypodermis also known as subcutaneous tissue that's where you have lipid the function of lipid or fat is to store glucose but it also has wonderful properties like um it it acts like a shock absorber it also acts like a um an insulator okay so to keep yourself warm but again too much of a good thing becomes a bad thing too little of lipid is a bad thing everything should be where in the middle here's just an example of melanocytes okay right here's different moles moles are typically benign um uh benign cancers but again if you look at the skin pigmentation of these patients they're more on the light they're more light-skinned and have less melanocytes and if you look at their history as well they're people who have jobs or people who love to be outdoors so that's why when you look at you know those workers who work on a highway a good friend of mine my my boy philly b uh my boy phil is an engineer and he uh he works you know he's with those highway people who survey um even on the hottest day they wear gloves um they were reflective gear they were goggles and they have a mask covering their face because they're there exposed to the sun and uv radiation can go through clouds so even on today like today it's a cloudy day um uh you could still get exposed um this is an example of people who have um they have a genetic problem where uh their melanin or the melanocytes uh don't produce an equal amount of melanin so you can see here this is called vitiligo that's why when michael jackson was live and he said he had vitiligo i'm like that's not vitiligo you got your skin bleached vitiligo is this it's like this it's patchy um he did it for a whole bunch of reasons we're not going to get into but he made thriller you got to like it got to love him he had a chimpanzee nice to know we already uh um saw this picture uh hair growth nice just know that hair is a protein it's actually like a a whole bunch of super coiled proteins so exposing your hair to anything that breaks down proteins like extreme heat it tends to mess with it or any of the chemicals that that everyone puts um in their hair to make it look cool or make it look like a wonderful color it's gonna do ridiculous amounts of damage um your nails remember we talked about keratin now what's important about the nails is is that this nail bed here it's important because it protects your fingers because your fingers bang bang against a whole bunch of things if anyone any of you ever had your like fingers ripped out um uh if any of you ever saw my live lecture uh me without gloves um three of my fingers on my left are all mangled because uh a humvee fell on it when i was a kid and it ripped all of this out and uh it took a while for the nail to grow back it took like i think a year and uh it made my my fingers hyper sensitive and it hurt to to to bang into things and touch things so the nail and the nail bed is really important and you can also see the importance of cutting your nails in a clinical setting you shouldn't have this white zone here right here because you could see how it's easily a point source for uh infection right let's say you scratch yourself you have all that staphylococcus aureus bacteria all over where you're scratched and it could get underneath here which is not good and also you got long nails it's gonna puncture your glove that's never good sweat glands sebaceous glands we already talked about that and the sweat the sweat when it comes out is sterile but like all things if you put water and let it hang out in a warm dark place with a lot of bacteria which is your armpits and which is your uh you know uh your groin area or behind your knees it's gonna smell right so um you know if your patient uh either is uh doesn't have access to uh uh to hygiene or they're in a um what do you call that mental disease or defect uh and they don't they don't bathe they don't wash that's why they smell because again when you sweat right that water is sterile but after a while that water uh will get um we'll mix with the bacteria it's in a dark warm area that means it's going to grow things other things other than uh just staphylococcus aureus and then it'll smell and it's also the same thing with remember we talked about how our sweat glands act as a filter it also the things you eat right uh you eat a lot of garlic you're gonna smell like garlic you eat a lot of uh spicy foods let's say you go to your uh your your favorite uh pakistani restaurant right or a favorite indian restaurant where they have a lot of spices what are you gonna smell like when you get home or later because even even you you take your clothes and take a shower it's gonna you're gonna smell like uh like what you just ate protection sensory we were talked about sensory and the sensory we already showed you the uh pacinian uh corpuscle right which was deep and the meissner's which is tactile which is closer to the top so that's light touch so you have deep touch right which is vibration and pressure sense and what do i mean by pressure sense you ever play that game where you know with your siblings or with you know maybe somebody in uh somebody in your class when when you were kids where you're like i'm not touching you i'm not touching you but you can feel them um that's also part of what they call galvanic skin response because your your nerve your nervous system can sense can sense different pressures and you guys know that when you go when you go outside right about right before it rains don't you feel like the air is heavy and your passinian corpuscles uh help you figure that out but light touch that's your meisner's okay so meisner's think light passinian deep i the way i remember it is uh pacinian it's a p i turn that p upside down looks like a d d for deep yet another thing that the skin does is vitamin d synthesis now remember i told you it also protects you against uv radiation but the funny thing about skin is it needs a little bit uv radiation to um uh to synthesize vitamin d now you can you can try to drink vitamin d in a pill form or liquid form all day every day but the majority of it is going to end up in the toilet but you have to expose yourself to a little bit of uv radiation um all my children have vitamin d deficiencies because of the pandemic because all of them um our base of operations is here in the basement that's where my uh router is that's where my server is and that's where all the computers are so just imagine you're in school all day um well my daughter in medical middle school is now at school two days a week but now we all now um have we all now have breakfast um especially if it's a little bit warmer out on near the window upstairs because they need a little bit of sunlight a little bit of uv radiation to increase their vitamin d because if you don't uh we know that vitamin d is closely related to um uh your bones and if you're if you don't get enough vitamin d your bones will start will uh start decreasing in calcium and then you will start the uh developing softening of the bones also known as osteomalacia okay rickets osteomalacia vitamin d this vitamin d deficiency so the best way to solve that um anywhere from the hours from 10 a.m to 12 noon uh 30 minutes just outside or if we're in neonatal icu we got heat lamps that will expose baby to uv radiation you know those little bassinets that they have now diseases and we're not gonna go over the diseases so i think we're good because this is not a pathology class this is anatomy and physiology so right off the bat let's look here and at home you can look at all these uh these are nice i i love these these videos uh they're really nice so let's let's look at did we talk about uh sweat glands did we talk about thermoregulation yes we did did we talk about all the layers and other functions yes we did um and now we gotta talk about the aging process so let's take a moment and watch this video this video will help you understand why your skin ages what you can do to slow down the process and how to reduce the signs of aging you may already have one of the primary reasons we age so differently is due to genetic factors just as jeans from our parents determine our hair and eye color they also determine how we age your genes control several natural processes that cause your skin to age let us take a closer look at some of these different factors your skin is constantly renewing itself by shedding the old and damaged outer cells of the epidermis and replacing them with newer cells this process keeps our skin looking fresh and revitalized the lower layer of skin or dermis contains collagen and elastin fibers that also provides the skin with structure support and elasticity beginning in your mid-20s the skin cell renewal process slows down and your skin becomes thinner and more prone to damage from external elements like the sun harsh weather and pollution producing a dull rough or uneven texture to the skin also um you'll notice that uh that when you get older um um any cuts or bruises they don't heal as fast when i you know when i was a uh in grade school you know you get a scrape or a cut by the next day it was already resolving um i got a couple of cuts on my arms that um uh that aren't healing too well and also if you also have a overlying pathology like diabetes that thin skin is not uh is more prone to infection and and also trauma and that's why when um you know diabetic patient we're always doing foot patrol we're always looking at their feet seeing if they have any aberrant cuts or or wounds that aren't healing uh it's because not only because when you get older thin skin also if you have um a comorbidity such as diabetes it's going to make things make things worse also not they mention genetics that can also um um you know speed up the aging because maybe you know um there are there are certain people on this planet you guys that you guys know i have some classmates that they haven't aged a day in the last 21 years and and me in the last four years i i my face and my skin have changed drastically right again that's not only genetics has to do it also has to do with your levels of stress in your life right and also um how much how much exposure to trauma how much exposure to the elements you have in addition the collagen and elastin fibers within the dermis begin to break down and diminish so fine lines and wrinkles appear and the skin starts to sag lastly the lipids or natural fat that protect the skin surface against water loss breakdown in response to changing hormone levels the skin's natural moisture barrier therefore becomes leaky and allows water to escape which is why your skin may become drier with age environmental factors can accelerate the normal aging process repeated long-term sun exposure is the primary cause of premature aging ultraviolet light from the sun causes melanocytes to produce too much pigment or color which results in the formation of freckles and age spots damage from sunlight also accelerates the breakdown of collagen and elastin in the dermis this is why people who spend a significant amount of time outdoors without proper protection usually experience deeper lines and wrinkles and greater skin laxity mechanical factors also contribute to skin aging and include gravity and repetitive muscle movements this is why people who have very expressive faces tend to have more lines around their eyes mouth and on their forehead if you have maintained a good skin care routine and avoided substantial sun exposure your skin should look and feel beautiful in your 20s and your 30s using a daily moisturizer with sunscreen and continuing to exfoliate will help keep your skin looking radiant signs of aging become increasingly apparent in your 40s and 50s although your skin can still look healthy and vibrant the effects of long-term sun exposure repetitive facial expressions and the normal aging process start to accumulate the fine lines around your eyes deepen and forehead lines and globular lines may begin to appear age spots and other pigmentation irregularities generally start to appear in sun exposed areas if you would like to reduce the appearance of facial lines and wrinkles non-surgical treatments like hyaluronic acid fillers may work well for you before you decide on any medical treatment consult your medical aesthetic practitioner now do you notice that they didn't say rub keratin or collagen all over your face no they didn't say that did they say hey maybe i should uh stick these chemicals like botox to decrease these lines because remember there's muscle underneath the skin and that's what's tightening all this stuff up uh and they didn't say that and no no physician in their right mind will will say that but they they kept on saying decrease exposure to the sun um um and also uh the one thing they also failed to mention is it's like decreased stress because if it goes if you're scowling or or you're super expressive all day or angry all day what's gonna happen you know you know that thing what they said when when you were a kid maybe your parents said this or your friend said this to you like um stop making that face because it will you know uh it might be permanent you know uh remember that um that wives tale where like if if you're making a funny face and someone slapped you on your back you'd um you your face would be stuck that way well it goes you know they're wives tales but many wives tales and many things like that have have some background in truth and the truth is that skin just like the rest of your body have to take care of it and uh did they say use the high-end moisturizer no just hydrate and that's that's also another thing uh hydration most um a lovely report about 10 years ago and i don't believe it's changed much and i could i could research it for you if you'd like about 10 15 years ago there was a report talking about the dehydration of americans because most americans like they don't drink water right um and they don't drink enough of it and um the american college of sports medicine was uh was you know was asking for some ridiculous number like two gallons a day or something like that but when i really think about it how many glasses a day of water do i drink not that much and juices are diluted uh soda's not good that because it's a diuretic coffee is not good that's also a diuretic and a diuretic will tend to dehydrate you but basic uh care of your skin and monitoring of your skin and all uh and and all the stuff that we're we're talking about here uh will help decrease the aging uh aging process and surgery is not the thing because every time i cut into my skin what will you create you'll create scars the scars may not be apparent here on your top layers but they're definitely in your subcutaneous layers every time you cut into the skin that's why i get real nervous when my patient has multiple surgeries and surgery wants to do yet another surgery in the same area i get a little bit nervous because remember um i was uh internist i was uh part of the department of internal medicine and the way that things work in the hospital is the internal the department of internal medicine does the pre-admission testing the surgeons do the surgery and then um uh when they go in the post-op medicine takes care of them so i see the before and after effects um of what surgery does and it's not always pretty and just a little side note if a surgeon tells you you have two weeks to recover double it um or or if it's like like something serious like back like back or spine surgery um call it a day you ain't going anywhere anytime soon heck call it at six months and also you'll have another six months of [Music] physical therapy on top of all of that so invasion by pathogens now we're in lesson one and we're gonna look at uh look at some of these videos actually we kind of went over this uh don't go over the bacterial identification lab we went over a lot of bacterial stuff in anatomy physiology one and here's where your application assignment is um clotting nice to know you can watch that video video on your own but let's look at this video here to close up today's lecture it's this middle one regarding mucous membranes cilia and tears remember we talked about right when we started this lecture that skin is not the only uh innate immunologic barrier that we have you have cilia tears mucosal lining right your mucus and those also contribute to your immune system so let's play this but germs can enter in other ways with each breath for example pathogens can enter our bodies through the nose and mouth but there is a second line of defense mucous membranes in the nose throat and bronchial tubes can trap pathogens before they reach the lungs and hair like cilia in the bronchial tubes and trachea can sweep them upwards so that we can then cough them out tears also provide a defense by flooding and washing away pathogens that get in our eyes and now before we leave tears tears also have enzymes it's not just water or saline because remember uh the fluid in our bodies is uh normal saline or nss normal saline solution which is 0.9 sodium chloride solution that's why your tears taste salty but also in those tears are uh enzymes which um uh which kill off any bacteria uh in any foreign body that floats around in your eyeball have you ever looked at the sun and then close your eyes real quick like you maybe you're at the beach and um there's you see these little like bacteria like things floating around well that's that's what's floating around in your tears and your tears have enzymes to go deal with those guys or guys or um potential pathogens should eat something contaminated with bacteria gastric juice a powerful acid in the stomach can kill them and and no matter how well you clean your food or how well you brush your teeth uh there's a lot of bacteria there's nastiness here in the oral cavity that's why the gastric juice in your stomach is a ph like like 1.1 1.2 on the ph scale which is very very acidic meaning to say is because it will react and uh with hydrogen ions with everything and uh make sure that you know that bad street taco you just ate all the bacteria in it or all the bacteria here from your oral cavity gets taken care of okay here's this lovely picture here you see the mucosal lining here it's thin it's not thick if it's thick then we're gonna have a hard time breathing because this is our trach okay or uh part of our bra our bronchus so you have these little cilia so foreign body viruses even viruses no matter how small they are viruses still get trapped in here so the cilia then move all of this stuff back up right and then so our patient can either you know spit it out or cough it out or sneeze it out that's why if you cough or sneeze into your tissue paper you make sure you dispose dispose of it and also for future reference when you're in the let's say you're you're throwing away garbage or something like that at work uh or sanitation didn't sanitation or um what they call environmental environmental services every hospital has a different name for it uh the people who clean up the rooms if they don't get there right make sure you glove up mask up because um this mucus when it dries it sometimes floats around airborne up to almost 48 hours so it's never a good thing so now you could see how the mucous membranes cilia which are those little finger-like projections that push all the mucus up and tears are also your first line of defense along with your skin for non-specific innate immunity like there's no it doesn't think it just it just acts like a good barrier okay with that said it is at this time of the show where i stopped", "MZep6RTv7Wk": "hey everybody how are you guys doing i'm eric garlock and this is another talk on philosophy french structuralism and post-structuralism and specifically fou co michel foucault not michael but michelle foucault is a guy from france who lived from 1926 to 1984. oddly enough because he has the panopticon the tower that watches everybody the fact that he died in 84 which is when i was alive in fact uh was actually unlike the teenagers is uh kind of appropriate given 1984 and orwell foucault is today a very centrally celebrated and popular thinker particularly in academics and also some left-wing circles he is considered sort of a post-marxist thinker which means he is a french thinker who is plenty has gone through plenty of marxism and then isn't not into it but thinks that new different usually multivalent like gramsci multiple plurality has to happen more rather than monolithic one particular system or thing he is cited thus a lot across political uh social and also academic circles he's a popular name there was a i'm not sure if it still exists but there was a brooklyn hipster bookstore called mother fuco uh in brooklyn ha ha so i saw a photo of that years ago i'm not sure again uh what the status of the bookstore is today but that is very hipster academic funny the he is a study thinker in philosophy as well as history sociology and political theory a lot of these french thinkers are anthropological and all about the social and how we're all very tribal including the structuralists at the structuralist lunch party which does include foucault he is one of the thinkers who's often lumped together with both the structuralists and the post-structuralists and honestly that is because a lot of levy strauss's structuralism quickly gave way to things are more flexible than that and so structuralism post-structuralism is actually overlapping very much at the lunch party levy strauss is strictly a structuralist and he remains so i i in terms and then the other three at the lunch party we have covered bart we covered lacon and we are now covering foucault bart and foucault are the ones who most go nietzsche wise well it's not really a clear set system or structure and so both bart and foucault wander from the structuralist lunch party a bit away into being post structuralists which are technically not post-modernist but very close and pre-runners just like existentialism leads to structuralism post-structuralism post-modernism post-structuralism is leading away from structuralism which was anti-existentialism to something more existential like post-modernism which is in a certain sense balancing a bit of existentialism you are completely free and this is all quite meaningless and absurd and we're free to create meaning and then structuralism well the system is already determined and set before you get there so you're largely the meanings that you can do counter-culturally are set in stone and at hot topic or what have you so with all of that and i like to say you know if you want to be really countercultural you can buy rei gear and hike up a very well defined trail we'll talk more about that example and things as i like to say hiking in the berkeley town i do own a bit of rei gear um it's a it's a sporting uh clothing outlet that's hip the uh and for hikers and campers especially and from the bay i used to play as a tiny kid in berkeley in the tents in the rei store uh as a kid again a bit of hide and seek in the tents um back in the day that was after lunch uh and that's what i knew i didn't know there was a university in this town i knew there was an rei and i could have uh hide in the tents i did not know what philosophy entirely was at that time nor berkeley but you uh foucault actually taught um at berkeley he taught psychology philosophy and history of thought i actually am a bit indebted to foucault he is not my favorite favorite thinker i do think he is a pretty decent heavyweight french nichean who is worth consideration in study certainly i very highly recommend and i've had more than one student say they really want to learn foucault and i tell them make sure and get a bit of nietzsche and heidegger and then you can have your foucault and yeah they definitely appreciate that advice and i highly recommend having the basics of nietzsche and heidegger the germans before you understand foucault because foucault did say that he was essentially a niche and a high tagarian in fact he did confess rarely apparently at least once or twice that he is essentially a heideggerian which means he's a niche and who is looking at uh things as psychology he uh which is more kind of heidegger ish as i already talked about and misspoke with so foucault taught history of thought and i really like the term history of thought and i do borrow that it's interchangeable with philosophy for me to be broad about history of religion science philosophy thought history of thought sometimes it's called intellectual history in history departments although here thought is a nicer broader uh word than intellectual which kind of implies a higher caste in class which already happens enough in intellectual matters so matters of thought makes it a bit broader and cultural incorporating more people in a culture so history of thought and he taught that in france tunisia which is north africa which uh like derrida grew up in north africa and was jewish and white that some of these folks are spending time in north africa which is another vietnam era kind of area right across the med from france where younger folks who are counter-cultural do not like what france is doing i just covered bart and the african boy saluting the flag that would be actually not north north africa probably more southern africa and the boy is then is uh or possibly algerian anyway the point being is that again whether it's north or southern africa again or what have you on the continent the uh foucault bart and foucault are critical of what france is doing in africa and with african nations and states so as colonial practice so his uh foucault's books are critical historical studies of social institutions and practices such as prisons psychiatric hospitals science and famously sexuality foucault argues that we tend to privilege what is labeled as good while marginalizing and dominating what is labeled as evil and this has become far more pervasive throughout our lives in modern scientific times so very much a nichean as we'll talk about here when we crack into foucault's life story very briefly here foucault read and loved nietzsche he was already a psychiatrist i believe and he read nietzsche and he fell very much in love with nietzsche's thought and so what foucault does as a french nichean like batai is an early french niche and who takes nietzsche in interesting different ways because as nietzsche says he doesn't want people to just be a nichean he needs you to do your own thinking and take it in different ways what foucault does as a a very analytic minded uh psychiatrist is he does what he calls archaeology of knowledge he goes and he picks through the records to find rare cases that are telling as outer lying examples that kind of prove the rule and he says look at how weird this is and how that shows you that power is shifting as far as what people think is good or bad in life and then we can watch the shift nietzsche was very concerned as i already talked about with bataille and foucault is one of the thinkers who's who's more famous than bataille who is very into batai who is carrying battai's thought himself forward as a french knee chain that what is happening is for i did mention with bataille children used to play in the shadow of the cathedral now they play in the shadow of the smokestack there is a very big anthropological social emphasis in nietzsche and french nicheans on ancient times are shifting to modern times this isn't good or bad but it's a lot more i often tell people it's not good it's not bad as i said with the nietzsche title but wait there's more it's not good modern times are not good or bad they're more of what humanity has done so when people say oh we've ditched ancient times or religion that's good no we're going to be even more like polytheism monotheism than ever before in the name of secular rationalism and then modern times is what nietzsche very much says in many ways thinkers who like nietzsche tend to say that like bataille which is the smokestack uh after the cathedral for the children who sort of grow up in a sci-fi way playing in horror knowing these are the giant institutions in our lives that tower above us so even if we switch religion out in our lives for pure science or what have you even if we did or we went hardcore communist or something like that it would still be monolithic human piles that are doing power and agriculture and war so effectively you don't really trade out what what foucault is thus doing with nietzsche's thought is he is showing how religious france shifted over to more modern scientific france and as a psychiatrist who was also uh gay but at a time when you could not be so open entirely legally about that either in america when he was teaching in berkeley town or in france and i don't know the specifics of the law but i do know that enough in 84 it certainly was a different thing to be gay in berkeley etc that's with all of that foucault thinks that we are going from ancient crazy to more modern crazy and wow get a load of this and that's very nietzsche i like that attitude as a person from hippie land who's not entirely a hippie i like that attitude that everything is human and that science is human all too human and so was religion so what foucault does is he cr he writes books that are somewhat hard to read but if you know ahead of time that what he's doing is showing how modern times have turned humanity into a new very all all-too-human strange bunch of shifting around what he's doing is not moralizing or prescribing as much as he's just describing it doesn't make him like vickenstein although they write very differently where we can sign says the job of philosophy is not to be prescriptive it's to be descriptive you're just telling people how culture is and how we use language and how we use thought and feel about things you're not telling them they should feel these ways you're like people clearly do i like that as well you will necessarily be forcing your interpretation with all of these thinkers on things somewhat but at least you are simply showing people the lay of the land and letting them make their choices and do and not doing their thinking for them as vickenstein says so foucault is saying wow look at the weird ways france shifted into modern scientific times doesn't that make us all weirdly fascists in a new way unlike the catholic church during the inquisition nobody expects the spanish inquisition yes is that with the especially not the french because it's spanish and it's over already for several hundred years so heck the uh sadly so's monty python you know but with all of that foucault is showing how one of the famous moments of pun uh discipline and punishment is he says and it's a very brilliant thing to think and it's a very good idea for introducing foucault foucault in one of his first major works discipline and punishment describes in painful detail how a guy who attempted to kill the king attempted regicide as i i always love the simpsons joke where bart simpson picks up the phone and says you have reached the police emergency hotline if you know the name of the felony being committed press one to select from a list of felonies stay on the line and he mashes the buttons frantically because there's a crime you know happening and says you have selected regicide if you know the name of the king or queen being murdered press one and of course yeah and he hangs up in frustration like dang it so the guy who attempted to commit regicide which is killing the king they tarred and feathered and tortured him in front of everybody and they strung him up you know and did horrible things to him to be like don't be this guy and foucault does a very good and interesting job one of the central thoughts of foucault is that they turned tar and feathering to locking people down sedating them keeping them out of the public eye this is the they of heidegger it's just all of us and our cultures yes it's not a conspiracy that knows simply what it's doing it's open and close to its own understandings of itself as people and as reality as our mind life etc so you see a moment it's very interesting where people used to be held up the more older way of doing things is hold up an example brutally do violence to them and say let's not do that kids and all the kids would watch you know and and everybody would you know yeah and with all of that that happened very often in many societies including european ones where there's no pretending here one's a decent culture in some part of the world and not or not so simply that we turned it into now serial killers get sort of sedated they get put on trial in an orange suit they don't get to talk much they don't let you rant and rave about your purposes with the devil you know the and they probably wouldn't let you or gag you you know in back in the day so you didn't spout you know devil worship at people but notice the difference in power and control strategies what foucault is trying to say is not that it's good or bad and in fact something in nietzsche definitely is like why don't we start punching people more in the face and battali says the aztecs are the most honest civilization because they haul one person at a time up the pyramid so they they're honest about death and experiencing death more than most of us and he says it is a positive thing whether or not we like that at all or bataille that essentially we used to in france he goes through a painful description of in like the late 16 early 1700s i forget the date exactly i probably have it in these notes this particular guy had these things done to him isn't that crazy and everybody watched and now isn't it so different in the 70s is what he writes and he's right and it's very nietzsche because what he is saying is modern times are kind of neutering and taming all of us such that we're glad it's not moralizing it's not being prescriptive because he's not saying let's go back to tarring and feathering and torturing people up in front of people that's horrifying america has a long tortured history with public lynchings and punishments in public you know all of that in order to horrify people set examples yeah it takes us into all kinds of issues with colonialism racism and other things but isn't it interesting that we all definitely in being human beings have urges to make a public example of this or that fool you know in good ways at best and then also we lie we want to lock okay let's just have the crazy people be quiet we never really see them foucault does another uh one of the parallel moments of this in his history of madness um he basic which he says madness defines what isn't reason you know so then you get to be reasonable because you're not crazy which is what he is saying here if you are the evil then you get punished and therefore i'm legal and i'm good because that's the evil over there very much like bart says the wrestlers get to display good and evil for everyone we put the criminal on trial we say there's the evil over there scarface families famously scarface my quick impression of an italian doing an impression of a cuban you need me you know you need me to be the bad guy as ice cube long ago on a tape i owned as a teen said say goodnight to the bad guy as i said i say hi to the bad guy because basically that's a scene from scarface right like say goodnight to the bad guy to the whole restaurant in miami it's like you need me because someone is going to be me you know you are a liars and like yeah it's again quick impression italian cuban what have you not sure the all of that of course jokingly is bathed very post-modern actually uh of a film um scarface it's and the rehashing of the plot very agamemnon etc with the tragic uh tragic pride and fall thus is that scarface definitely is a more public old school like no you make a public right in the street of somebody and that's in the modern no but we do it we handle with lawyers you know our pr like that's a very different modern world and foucault is not moralizing as much as he's saying well who's the real monster who's the real savage and of course the question is left open and not conclusively answered but that's awesome that's what he is specifically doing we are shifting in the ways we're human that's not good or bad it's in a sense i like to say now he doesn't say but i like to say it's more because it's not neither good nor bad and in fact there is a bunch snowballing and accelerating although not so simply or completely but in all of that there's a lot more as we develop it's not that civilization is simply after the catholic church become good or bad here again the catholic church wasn't trying to simply be good or bad in the middle ages for everyone and they didn't simply do good or bad in the middle ages to everyone in france so given after the french revolution they removed the ten percent of france that was catholic property of the catholic church gave that back to the people i guess and unless there's well i guess they're setting uber's on fire or not but with all of that of course essentially foucault is saying that uh there used to be in history in his history of madness i got off track he says that there used to be the ship of fools or the mad house bedlam i think was is the lower class british way of pronouncing bethlehem hospital is bedlam you may have heard bedlam as inc insanity it's a way of pronouncing bethlehem bethlehem um in a lower class a british accent i believe a londoner because i think it was one of the horrifying insane asylums for lower class people public of uh i think it well it's britain i'm not sure if it's the london area but historically of course all that's changed uh plenty i hope because they let people just wander in especially rich people and look at the crazy people and kind of gawk like it was a zoo what foucault says is they used to let people everybody gawk at the village idiot and everything and it was a zoo now it's all taken care of and quiet and again what it's definitely suggested here although it's not moralizing like nietzsche foucault suggests we're cowards we're kind of cowards covering things up not that we should go back to setting people on fire in public or anything but that we're kind of cowards who would prefer to sedate the criminal and just not pay much attention to it he is suggesting it's not good or bad but that's the way that we're shifting around in society that is very interesting food for thought that is one of the reasons why foucault is very hip that actually covers sort of the central points of some of his of his history of punishment and history of insanity and he is very famous for both of those works he is also very famous for his later work on three-part work which was never fully completed his liking of his uh history of sexuality was in progress when he died probably of hiv aids i would imagine i hope i'm not slandering any anyone or anybody or any or him but definitely as a bay aryan again bay aryan nation uh not the area nate now that's totally different is that with the bay out here and with foucault and the folks you know in castro and oakland and all the folk out here and much love to everyone it does seem like foucault was a indeed a gay man he did think sado masochism and people playing with punishment and discipline and violence is sexually was an interesting way of being adults and screwing around and he seemed to be a bit partial to it but we don't know how much he ever did that he possibly also grew uh in a window box garden when he was teaching at berkeley uh but he most and a lot of french folks want to come out to california or did in the 70s and 80s and be out here and see what's going on did anyway plenty the hipper later french thinkers derry daw and others taught in the uc system out here in the universities of california so actually again i'm a bit of a proud alum of the uc system and so yes foucault was probably a gay man who did possibly contract hiv aids and then died of the complications of that in 84 which actually 82 83 84 was the unfortunate time when a lot of that was going on and people have been discussing you know aids reagan other things in the wake of what's going on today and let's leave all the politics right there so let's get the foucault here i have been a ransom and that's easy with foucault and nietzsche because they're both very uh interesting and uh rant-enabled thinkers foucault's father was a brilliant but domineering surgeon who once took his frightened son to watch a human leg amputation think about later how he's talking about public humiliation of the criminal versus private we're just keeping i i i do mention often some the uh the japanese uh guy who claimed to be jesus and and the amida buddha come at the end of times and did the tokyo subway attack the japanese don't the japanese are super fuco because they don't tell you when they execute people i learned this weirdly because i looked up in a source about that guy the library where i also work as sources that has books by that guy and he's actually like only jesus would declare himself to be jesus i am jesus like wow dude well he not only grow his hair out a i'm hoping i'm not like him he not only after trying to kill people then they it was said a couple of years ago it's like he's probably dead it's like what do you mean probably dead and it's like oh the japanese when you're on death row don't tell you when they get rid like they don't tell the public unlike america like and they sometimes have people sit there or not you know or what have you is in different states but in japan they don't tell you because they don't want to glorify it it's like the parking lot you know where the bunker where hitler shot himself is it's like they don't want to set a gravestone you know they don't want anybody sort of glorifying it at all or imitating anything or something so they're trying to strike it you know what i mean a little bit from history almost so that's super fuco not only do you not publicly torture the person you lock them down sedate them just plenty of sort of passive torture what have you but then you don't tell anybody when you off them if you choose to off them rather than lock them down forever out of public sight logging them forever out of public sight would actually be even more in a certain sense foucault because you don't even kill them then you just keep them forever completely disabled in a certain sense very modern very clinical very much a more modern sterilized scientific perspective which is sort of life-killing disinfectant for nietzsche and you can see foucault who's a psychiatrist who knows being gay is insanity officially in his day in the 80s as he's experimenting in san francisco in the scene and teaching out in berkeley in the bay out here which is why he's also super popular in this town and his thinking lends himself to that but with all of that yeah foucault well yes he had an interesting life and career with all of that so to get back to his life here and i'm getting off track again uh he studied and taught psychiatry before he got into philosophy he didn't come out here to teach psychiatry essentially he came out to teach uh his niechean philosophy i'm pretty sure um and as he studied and taught psychiatry he had an epiphany in 1953 watching beckett's play waiting for godot some call it existential the play is very existential becca did famously reject the label existentialism but the work does deal with things that are quite existential and we could call ourselves camus or absurdus or whatever later that year uh foucault went on vacation in italy and he famously brought nietzsche's untimely meditations that is sadly the book in which i'm pretty sure nietzsche does go off misogynistically when asked so here's some he says there is no objective truth objective truth is silly by the way here's some of my objective truth and then he rants terrible things about women for a while which darey dobb praises as an amazing performance and in bearing his heart for all of us unfortunately you know and it's tragic and that's beautiful for uh dairy duh and other french people so bringing that a german would bear their heart again like the aztecs no we're going to experience death you get to die so nietzsche's untimely meditations foucault brought that with him and he apparently spent the whole vacation uh in the hotel room reading nietzsche because he started reading it and he just could not stop is famously what happened he was already a grown man a grown man and a psychiatrist and he said i need to get into this and he effectively became he remained a psychiatrist as a closeted gay guy when as a gay is insane and he is thinking about what is good or bad or legal or illegal in a culture in the most clinical and scientific of things even you know and human desire and prejudice and all of the different ways we are all overlappingly and sloppy in a niche and ape-like way but he spent his vacation which does the work untimely meditations begins with the uh it's four essays i believe and it begins with the essay schopenhauer as educator already had the schopenhauer foucault spent most of his vacation reading nietzsche on the beach and in the hotel room even though some french intellectuals still can teach her considered nietzsche to be a proto-nazi and thus they were avoiding him even then at the time foucault said he no longer felt mentally trapped after these experiences and in his first major work madness and civilization in 1961 getting closer again to modern times uh progressively here in the modern philosophers he said he would quote conduct all of these inquiries under the sun of the great nichian quest end quote which is sort of to document how the times change with us and we change and don't change with the times and just freely do that lovingly and crazily foucault became fascinated with the complexity of the history of good and evil now knows beyond good and evil of nietzsche would set us in that direction although he read untimely meditations first the sane and insane according to psychiatry again homosexuality is insanity or insanity who can tell you entirely and why and what counts as it being natural or not in in the history of psychiatry normal and perverse in the history of sexuality what gets to be normal sexuality for the greeks who had well uh unfortunately if you want to you can check out my talks on this uh plato symposium as well as the theaters which is yeesh time as far as greek sexuality but all of that um for us anyway the uh legal and criminal who gets to be legal and who gets to be criminal if everybody is if different classes are stealing and certain classes are prosecuted and others aren't let's say then who gets to be legal and who's a criminal in the history of justice in prison arguing that truth is a struggle and again for nietzsche everything the coldest and of scientific truth is a darwinian ape struggle and passionate that truth is a struggle between competing forces institutions and interpretations so what this is clearly saying is science is secular science is somewhat eclipsing religion and again it's not good and not bad it's just more humanity would be the niche and foucault's simple answer here and i do actually sincerely somewhat believe that i think you can qualify things that this they are that but i do and argue that human beings have been human beings consistently for possibly well over a hundred thousand years my in many ways and i can just generally leave that loose and say thus yes it is very interesting that then as institutions rise in our lives religion separates what's the holy or the profane from each other and then science is well this is wrong or bad or unnatural and then we have the 50s rolling into the 60s rolling into foucault's work etc so like bart foucault argued that truth is complex and historical i learned a lot from han sluga in this town he knew foucault in this town i believe hung out with him and with all of that uh he always says that truth is uh historical and psychological and i think that vuco would also say complex historical and certainly a psychiatrist would say psychological uh but ideology attempts to mask this by presenting clear exclusive divisions between opposites we as an ape want clear divisions like bart says with the wrestlers they're all hanging out barton foucault with levy strauss at the lunch party of the structuralists so with the four-person lunch party group which we've been talking through human beings want clear good and bad sane and insane so they want to go to bedlam or they want at least psychiatrists to have locked down the crazy person and fully say this is a category that applies to them and then all of that is somewhat in rotation and in progress institutions must support now this is again a very central interesting idea of foucault he takes nietzsche and this is very much what nietzsche thinks already but he is phrasing it in new french ways institutions must support binary divisions to maintain power and pronounce themselves objective holders of genuine knowledge and truth that means that unless we fake it to make it a bit and over generalize the insane those are the criminals either by locking them down and sedating them in japan never telling you when they kill anybody or burning them on at the stake and as a witch he's a witch who are you so wise in the ways of ancient sciences and with all of this if you do not create those binary divisions you cannot maintain power now one of the upshots of this without getting into it i am constantly asking people to be critical of simple declarations of objectivity and i am a pragmatist which means i like the science is fine but i don't think that people should be making declarations of one culture as opposed to another having objective truth as much as you and i can reject or accept any beliefs of any culture we like and we judge them without talking about it quite automatically so without feeling the need to accept any beliefs it is definitely worrisome for nietzsche foucault and others and i share this worry that people are very quick to forget that religion created well they're not quick to forget the religion created divisions in people but people are all too quick to accept that they're secular rational scientific people in the 1800s 1900s and onwards yes and then somehow that's supposed to get us over problems we never get over that we remain the same ape and then when secular science kind of kicks religion sideways a little bit and to the side nothing really simply improves yes with the complexity of that statement being what i know you know it is nothing in humanity really simply turned from good to evil or evil to good and we didn't simply lose more gain morality with religion and we didn't simply gain or lose logic with science that's very much what foucault and nietzsche are playing with and foucault is definitely as a psychiatrist who has no problem doing very detailed analysis of he wants to do detailed history of science in order to show how human it is that he certainly doesn't have any problem studying science but he definitely says when what is gay or what is straight and normal is an interpretation that does depend on things in the world but is a power struggle if truth is a niche and power struggle then you can't just have the good scientific model hooray it's done that's not how human truth or science works and that would be another way of being afraid and being cautious about religion science or politics telling you it is the objective truth why because whenever they would do something like that and no i'm not an anti-vaxxer with conspiracy theories whenever any institutions do something like that they are maintaining power they are trying to hold on to power and we like and dislike that we like and dislike that but that's the good and the bad and the complexity of it if america makes a big deal out of who's legally here and who's not which is a thing going on right now that is in a certain sense and i won't go off on a tangent into the into the details of that and i like you know talking somewhat about that that's not my primary what i know the most about so i will keep quiet about immigration issues somewhat but given that i have very uh well views about that etc i won't get all into right now if people are creating in and out divisions this is very coral schmidt as well an uh german thinker of i believe is i think he was before this in the 50s also at this time well around the time writing this at the same time as foucault in germany i believe after the in the wake of the nazis if there's usually in out distinctions that are very bivalent that are very black and white those are used for better or worse to maintain power we have things in our lives like religion science and politics those are institutions they need to maintain power in order to support themselves they are living organisms in order to do that they are going to oversimplify things and declare their to be the scientific or religious or political thing or not they have to it's a good thing to keep just cynically keep that a little in mind and you don't have to hate anyone you don't have to hate science or religion at all i'm not suggesting you do or don't believe in science or religion completely or not what i am suggesting is human forms of power set up black and white all or none divisions a little too generally because otherwise they cannot maintain power amongst a bunch of apes and people that is what foucault is saying which is why being gay is declared by psychiatry to be bad sexuality bad and then it's like well you know because that is one of the ways foucault is clearly critical in the wings of his work without saying it directly at the time entirely but it's pretty much there to find isn't it that this is why fuco is popular as well because this fits into a lot of issues in people's lives that are certainly of issue right now have been since 84 and only gotten more public and personal on the both ways on the uh so the what happens is and this is very nietzsche institutions must support binary holders of genuine knowledge and truth say the experts do know they know so and then you get to grad school and in every field it's like they know pretty much here are the best views and it's like but before that in the textbook they do you know it's very much more they do know as undergrad grad school now we're kind of figuring this out this is the interesting stuff is what we don't know always but most important in a field so which is how the paradigm shifts happen and are needed institutions must support binary divisions to maintain power and pronounce themselves objective holders of genuine knowledge and truth that's shamans that scientists that's priest that's everyone this ben's rv that's egyptian priests it's very plato's model of the scientific expert this bends our view of reality who gets to tell history and how such that the dominant system religion science politics anything schools of art identify themselves with truth they get to wordlessly just be that as existing and being what continues and the messy historical process and evolution of systems of thought is obscured which is why foucault does his work of outer lying examples to unearth an art do archaeology of knowledge and unearth weird counter examples that show us context nuance over generalization the shades of gray between the blacks and white that really shows you history on one side giving an institution the right to distinguish the same from the insane is quite sane and sober foucault is not saying let's ban he is anarchistic and i'm also an anarchistic person usually people would not label themselves full-on box what-have-yous but being more anarchistic and foucault certainly is and i do like to say that i am that decently in that you are resisting well let's not have necessarily the fully fixed now we all have to do it system after in which is very popular with post marxist thought which is an anti-marxist but is so now let's do something a little different from marxism but along something like those things or anything given stalin and especially in others that it's seen to have decently the same and the insane divided somewhat for us all to have experts to consult and know if we're okay but on the other hand when one looks at the complex history of uses and abuses of these categories you can find much that is outright insanity my one of my favorite is dracula dead and loving it is a terrible horrible forgive me mel brooks joke where he has a log they've locked down the igor and i know that it's not uh frankenstein apparently doesn't always have an igor at all but that's actually also mel brooks apparently and young frankenstein but in dead and loving at the igor ish character is uh he is saying is that he is locked down and he's eating bugs and he's dracula's familiar as a guy so he's twisted and insane and the doctor's like give him an enema and he's like no not another and he's like yes another in another until you come to your senses i do love mill brooks movies as if that unfortunately sorry to give you the image would make you sane you know if you just went through that process repeating it would probably make you it's highly abusive and terrible the of course uh and uh yeah that essentially on the one hand that's a good abuse of insect they're clearly making fun of actually sort of the kellogg thing in that movie and somewhat like old uh practices of sanity and health that are somewhat old-timey 1800s horrifying in the movie on purpose so are the institutions sane or insane just or unjust how can we know so simply again lisa says bedad to homer simpson but if you're the police when he forms a vigilante group but who's going to police the police and homer's like ah coast guard how can we know so simply when these institutions determine their own sanity their own ability to be good or embody justice and truth for foucault knowledge is always involved with power i grew up watching a little bit of schoolhouse rock which is hold over from the 70s for me in the 80s and it was knowledge is power and of course it's like with foucault it's a bit more sinister knowledge is power be careful i have a dilbert comic which i can quote from back in the day dogbert dilbert's pet is talking to dilbert's co-worker and friend i believe wally he says remember knowledge is power so never tell people anything because they might use it to crush you do you understand and while he's like i'm not saying this is of course knowledge is power meaning it's good it's bad it's everything it's for for code knowledge is not only enabling freedom it's not making everyone free to be a doctor or anybody it is at the same time domination and control not everybody gets to get through med school or pass a contradict which as i like to mention right here i often times will explain to the students i'm a very lefty anarchistic person do i want to go into a waiting room and have the doctor say hey who thinks this guy's a strep throat democracy we all want a bit of authoritarianism in our lives and foucault famously said we hire how we have to fight the fascist in all of us which is why he is sitting around and or not watching people in clubs in san francisco that are highly questionable even for me where people are dominating each other in ways uh straight and gay etc because that would be playing with human fascism and power hungry apes etc playing with what they are very much of course whether or not you think that's a smart or a crazy idea to do which i'm not going to shame or judge or whatever is it's not my thing again as the polish expression goes not my monkey's not my circus but you can see why foucault would be interested in how people are play-acting pain and suffering and domination because that's part of what the apr is as the darker side of the ape the darker side of the moon and the ape with the monolith yet yes it all fits together again as their being with french heideggerianism so truth is not outside power it is a thing of the world that is why institutions are quick to say this is scientific and objective or this is holy and religious or this is politically illegal not just because it's useful but because it is something where you have to make ape displays to get all the apes in a line it is just part of what we are we rely on gestures of division to separate the good from the bad like the wrestlers of bart specifically such as presenting college graduates with formal diplomas but these divisions create zones of transgression now the transgression is very batail speak there are gray areas where the fertile soil and thinking happens that are not exactly in the box which is history and the messiness and the psychology and the historical view there are ways that laws and practices can be violated in revolt he is thinking counterculture and those clubs foucault was fascinated by the work of dasad and batai two fellow frenchmen who were obsessed with sexual and violent transgressions as limit experiences as they are called modern protocols governing discourse are used to exercise dangers much as priests or priests once exercised demons foucault very much says psy the psychoanalyst is very much the catholic confessor he makes that comparison very explicitly where as we used to go to church let's say as french people if we're catholic or french or not and go in there confess okay now you're back integrated into society psych freudian psychoanalysis allows middle and upper class uh folks to work out their problems and then go back into the terrible pit of you know all of the horror because it allows them to adjust and rework allah confession allah catholic confession so foucault here we not only have bedlam becomes the lockdown out of sight insane asylum this is a bit like that movie unsane in fact which i did like that movie is very much you get locked down nobody gets to talk to you when you're insane kind of nausea days dangerously illegally in plenty of states it's very much suddenly you disappear when you go insane as opposed to you're publicly exposed to people in bedlam you also thus have here the zones of transgression and limit experiences um like with the guy being tortured in public the regicide attempter um and then you also have this with wrestling and we want things to separate this and notice how wrestling is itself a very entertaining limit experience of a bunch of glorified violence etc so in a 1971 interview foucault's later interviews are a lot of the place to get some of his best explaining of his long books and thought because he really crystallizes it and there's a book or two of his interviews which are really good of his later interviews in the 80s but this is an interview actually from 71 earlier he says we must free ourselves from cultural conservativism that is definitely moralizing and sounds it as well as from political conservativism we are must that definitely tells you what side of politics is on we must see our rituals for what they are completely arbitrary things completely arbitrary things quote end quote which doesn't mean they're right or wrong they just sort of are the forms of life it becomes very viconsinian they're just the forms of life we happen to be living maybe we find better maybe we don't it is good and it that is the real theater a bit of arto the surrealist uh theater director to transcend them in the manner of play by means of games and irony that would be vic sign as well it is good to be dirty and bearded to have long hair to look like a girl when one is a boy this is hippie time and vice versa so he's talking about of course butch lesbian women and judith butler is of course a one who says gender is performance and knows very thoroughly her foucault one must put in play he puts in quote show up transform and reverse the systems which quietly order us about as far as i am concerned that is what i try to do in my work is what he says well what is counterculture not doing here you know so in discipline and punishment foucault contrasts the pre-modern spectacle i've already mentioned this bit of the public execution with the modern prison the first openly displaying power and passion theatrically and the second concealing it clinically think about how much is concealed clinically or a good pair of words in modern society and you'll understand modern mythology as bart says we have clinical steroid one of the things i like to point out here apparently and don't freak out over hospitals please or not go you know if you need to hopefully you can but if you sterilize a hospital floor you have to keep doing that because a sterilized floor is apparently the wild west for germs and they just love it and they cover it so actually funny enough you'd think sterilizing a floor completely cleans it for a good long time actually if you sterile if you well maybe you could have a hippie hospital with a dirt floor and it's like no we just let the bacteria go man you know i'm thinking i'm too much from this town is that with all of that and it's the hipster hospital what have you is you know with natural by uh i'm guessing you know and yes uh biotic cultures etc in the soil and you take off your shoes that with all of this and however we're culturing ourselves of course we're being certain things are clinically concealed you know and we're making things modernly mythological via science and the power of gears and computers and entertainment and propaganda through tv channels etc and the internet um that is very modern mythology that comes about scientifically and mechanically and so thus we are very mythological apes and in secular scientific times as we as the french were in catholic times and as people were in monotheistic polytheistic and tribal animistic times this very anthropological view going on i happen to like that view considerably i think it's humbling and i think no matter who we are i think it helps um but that's me and that may not be you so nietzsche and freud both argued that passions cannot be displayed outwardly in action uh that act passions it's a very fluid dynamic model that cannot be displayed outwardly turn inward on ourselves ninja says the man who despises himself still has respected himself enough to despise himself in one of his quips we turn on ourselves if we can't turn outward on somebody else at our worst in all of his work foucault argues that our modern cultures of government and science continuously tried to impose apollonian order on top of our underlying dionesian longings you have the reason versus emotion nietzsche earliest work here we have longings for passion and meaning but we're constantly trying to hem that in back and forth balance with order and so d'assad and other artists if dasad was an artist indeed show us what kant and eagle leave unmentioned in their studies of reason nietzsche says there's been great philosophers who are german and others talked a lot about reason they don't talk about friendship or sex what's these guys problem with knowing actual life that's a very foucault thing to observe science in the state impose belief in order but art and philosophy can inspire doubt and transformation now obviously and i do want to say science can get people to reason and doubt i can believe in doubt art can get people to believe in doubt it really isn't so one versus the other is belief or doubt science is something like the solid practices we can most uh observe that have to do with this or that particular practices of hume of humanity and then and observation instruments etc which then work together with us to create the forms of knowledge that we have for foucault and then we also have things like art which are more speculative and we could do them several different ways differently more so than we might be able to arrange gear systems as best we can think but with all of this science and religion and art give us belief and doubt very heideggerian give us belief and take belief away by providing doubt and things are open and closed symbiotically as self and world that remains with the transition from religion to modern science and actually what we definitely see is religion is not dying in the world actually all of these people definitely did assume religion was somewhat going the way of the dodo and it actually because poverty is not in the world actually religion is thriving unfortunately that does seem to be the case i don't mean because i don't like religion i mean i don't want poverty to thrive but religion may help out the impoverished more in ways than modern sciences in ways and again i leave that to your discretion to understand but of course understand i do not mean science has been evil versus good that's just simply not the case for foucault nor myself or nietzsche things are way hairier than all of that and human so science and the state impose belief in order but we can then with art philosophy or even more science or anything inspired doubt and transformation that would be paradigm shift for thomas kuhn in the sciences and and philosophy and history of science foucault repeatedly referred to the institution of subjugated knowledge the ins i'm sorry that would be different the insurrection not institution of subjugated knowledges and the will not to be governed which is anarchistic now knowledge is in the plural i found some philosophy folk or somebody made the uh in a meme-ish image not in standard high impact font in the mimi type and it says and it's a clearly a self-help line kind of comic that somebody has replaced the text with and it says is someone you care about getting involved with post-structuralism which would almost always be foucault pretty primarily others that we've talked about but very much studying foucault and it says and it shows a woman on the phone with concern it says my son has recently been using the term knowledge in the plural should i be worried it's not just knowledge it's knowledges that don't all like cohere into one think shamans have ways of doing things and then the corporation will go to argentina take their thing chemically analyze it and then sometimes try to patent it and keep the shamans from doing you know the things that they've patented i've heard but with all of that of course it's a different sort of knowledge when it's situated in the tribe let's say or a different practice than the corporate practice and experience and knowledge so you could have knowledges in the plural because there's a way of understanding it for the shaman that isn't the modern chemist if you understand my drift so she's like my son has been saying knowledge is what the heck should i be worried and the woman in front of the old school computer monitor who has the call thing in her ear says unfortunately this might be a symptom of reading foucault refer to quote human nature end quote in your conversation and observe your son's reaction because of course as you might already figure here if you said human nature singular to foucault who's worried about science prescribing uh proscribing outside of legal sex gay you know being gay clearly human nature set in stone as just one thing is a social concert there this is exactly the same sort of folks who created the batman slapping robin meme which was so popular and it says but objective real and robin is saying either but objective reality or but human nature and batman's like social construct and he smacks robin across the face please don't smack people too much we all need a good smack but again hopefully that's consensual don't go to the wrong clubs you know for any of that that's all i'll say so foucault very famously again uh perhaps your son as uh the sun would obviously react and be like human nature singular dang it you know mom you're being all square man not like uh bald philosophy man foucault i am amazed i actually took me this long to say this foucault is occasionally referred to on the internet because he is so popular as an actual philosopher in intellectual circles believe it or not he is occasionally referred to with his image with sometimes fake quotes that aren't him obviously as bold philosophy man like and be he is bald philosophy man in glasses so yes that is foucault you can identify him on the street by sight or you could it was the 70s so foucault famously uses fame uh the image of bentham's panopticon bentham is actually a philosopher i haven't particularly covered just yet in my videos but the panopticon is an idea that bentham the british thinker had where he said there's a prison with a tower in the middle designed so that prisoners are always under surveillance by the tower which apparently has like double paned window uh glass so you can't see who's in the tower or it's positioned so you can't see the guards but the guards could and everybody can see that the guards can see everyone else and everyone can see everyone else arranged around the tower in their cells that the prisoners are always under surveillance but the guards are invisible and suggests our modern cultures are similarly engaged in panopticism is what foucault says our ability to know and order things more than before has created a situation where some things are on display for all to see while other things are completely concealed i did actually mention you know it's actually worth bringing up please don't think me a conspiracy theorist i mentioned to a friend or two one did think me a conspiracy theorist during the capital thing that happened in america again politics aside without getting political did you see now not and when i said this people like no the crowd didn't have guns yes they they actually did stop the whole crowd from ever from having any guns um because they that dc is a very anti-gun town apparently and some guy actually tried to get guns across the potomac supposedly according to the fbi not important right now but the crowd didn't have guns but did you see the government actually have any long guns by long guns i mean anything other than pistols there were a couple of usockable pistols drawn in the footage unfortunately but the there is probably a line beyond which there is very serious security we didn't even see it that's like what the the african boy soldier child soldier is saluting off camera in bart in that in the last talk you don't even see like any of the of the very serious occurrence obviously all levels of security are serious but beyond a certain point it would be top secret and that would include you never seeing any actual long guns now those are probably there we don't see them which makes them sort of more almost power we don't know what it is that is a kind of almost it's a that's just a bit of panopticism and i'm not saying let's do or not do that i figure that would be how security would work in a congressional building pretty much in many countries but in a parliament building but panopticism would very much the uh the british are famous for putting security cameras everywhere nowadays what's up buddy oh he dropped the statue well actually the super glue held i was super gluing that statue and had it tied i guess he knocked that off well that's okay again panopticism i can watch my cats can they see me yes they can it fails so major fail how you doing buddy dagger hey pal yes anywhose the uh so panopticism the british are famous for having security cameras everywhere and people have said the cops now somewhat sit back and watch security cameras remotely and then they can send in folks in britain somebody apparently an artist made a giant walking alien puppet and like sent it through a neighborhood and the cops came because of course everybody could kind of see and you can see in the public cameras the public can apparently watch some of the security cameras publicly on the internet in britain teenagers are upset that there's security cameras everywhere in britain and public government security cameras and an artist actually uh apparently in britain because of this responded by taking a bunch of fake security cameras just like the shells of the security cameras and put them a bunch on a wall with a bunch of them pointed downwards altogether absurd amount of security cameras on a brick wall but some of them up at the top are just kind of pointed randomly in all sorts of directions so it sort of looks like there's a crowd of security cameras on a wall many of them are all focused downward all concentrated and some of them are just kind of randomly looking all counter-culturally up with the stars or randomly at a bird or something which is a funny use of human perspective symbolized as la cucaracha and yes again can i see la cucuracha no but laku garages sees you yes needs a hug the with all of that um and my strange jokings basically it would be in the police's advantage and this is not simply good or evil to be watching people and not to be watched let's leave all the politics there right there so current legal issues with police filming everything but being opposed to being filmed themselves as freud argued we internalize our parents as the super ego us moderns and foucault is decently freudian us moderns have decently post freudian into freud but not entirely uh us moderns as latur would call our tribe the secular modern tribe of our mythological beliefs and this and that have internalized the voices of government and science brush your teeth accepting their helpful surveillance within our own minds and lives again this isn't simply good or bad similarly we have all accepted the universal truth quote of scientific studies as superior to the personal struggle of the individual and of course we do in ways many of us let's hope yeesh but notice the problems all too human that causes is simply the case i do constantly point out that science is simply not used for the public good and that if we stop and look at how it is used we won't say it is simply anything other than all too human but that is not trying to force people to believe or disbelieve in objective truth rather giving them the philosophical positions on that i have here a fuko meme there is a famous uh mangled uh japanese subtitles of a japanese video game in which the evil villain cackles and says all your base are belong to us or something along those lines and there's a picture of bald philosophy man foucault staring at the camera and it says all your subjectivities are belong to discursive regimes of power and of is spelled uv because it's silly meemish type being playful and childlike foucault is concerned discursive regimes of power would be forms of power that are back and forth and moving even though they are stable foucault is concerned with showing the structures of power at the capillary level the way and with all of that um in fact i'm going to cut this short because i actually do have another three paragraphs here about foucault i've already got an hour so i'm gonna cut this and then i will give another follow-up talk of foucault because there's actually some stuff that i would like to take my time talking about about foucault wilhelm reich and the hippies and how necessarily sex is not simply repressed or unrepressed which i do like to go on about because it's very interesting and i come from hippie land so sex not just being a good or bad thing but being very human is an interesting topic that's good for adults and older children to talk about you know and be honest about decently there also is in 1971 again like that interview there is a famous debate with noam chomsky which is worth talking about so given that let's cut this talk off here i thought i may very well have more than one talk on foucault so with the panopticon and all of that and all your subjective discursive regimes of power with your subjectivities and character let's talk about the capillary level and we will go on next time with more foucault so much love much happiness many a cat darting around and i will as always uh well i hope you're good and you're bad or else you are possibly dead and i will see you if i do indeed ever see you", "43ogF495Vd0": "[Laughter] i'm being really high up on my face [Music] what's up guys welcome back to my youtube channel my name is naninga koi for those of you who don't know me so today we are going to talk about how you can reduce the signs of aging using makeup how you can look youthful how you can slash ears off your look just by using makeup and hair tricks and a couple of tricks so let's just get into the video i rarely do makeup tutorials that i'm explaining um i stopped doing that however i feel like this makeup tutorial can help somebody so if you're over 35 years and you've started showing the signs of aging like wrinkles around your eyes wrinkles when you smile and other similar things your eyes are drooping watch on yes because i am going to show you exactly how you can reduce the signs of aging using makeup and how you can look youthful using makeup yes not all makeup makes somebody look youthful sometimes there's makeup that ages somebody like glitter eyeshadow that it is somebody but let's just get into the video let me stop rambling yeah welcome to my channel don't forget to subscribe make sure you hit the subscribe button before you leave this video because uh there's plenty more that i normally offer i normally post three times a week so make sure that you hit the subscribe button in case you don't want to miss a video yes so let's get into how to reduce years of your face using makeup and using these simple tips and trying to lay a couple of edges although this is a synthetic wig but the first tip that i'm going to give you is that you should tie up your hair in a tight ponytail i'll give you an example using a pick of how what i mean by a ponytail and i don't mean a low ponytail i mean a high ponytail and that's exactly what i'm going to do i'm going to tie this wig into a tight ponytail this is the reason that ariana grande is not aging it's because she's only staying her hair in a tight ponytail it doesn't mean that it will stop the signs of aging but it will definitely reduce years off your look and that's why she always looks young and youthful and like a teenager that's her little secret so make sure that you tie your hair up and that's what exactly okay we are done with the hair this is as good as that synthetic wig is going to get and this is the kind of style i'm talking about you can pull your hair back specifically your natural hair and if you don't have like really long natural hair you can just add an extension a hair extension nowadays they're all over the place so there's even afro hair extensions for as long as you pull your hair back you're pulling your hair back it's going to help you look more youthful because it's going to like pull your face back especially if your face has started showing drooping because of gravity so make sure that you have such a hairstyle you pull your hair back and all that yeah so next i'm going to show you the next trick that you're supposed to do so that you can look more youthful by the end of this video you won't even recognize my age you might think i'm a teenager so watch to the end the next thing that you definitely want to do in order for you to look more youthful is actually to make your eyebrows face up or basically not arc them really high like create a high arc on your eyebrows that is going to make you look more youthful because it will make your face look as if it's pulled up like this so let's just try and create a uh high arc that's what i'm trying to explain and then you'll see what i'm talking about by the end of this video i'm telling you you will look like a teenager even if you're 35 years or 40 or 50 years of age it is possible so without doing any surgery or something of the sort let's just create a high arc on our eyebrows now because i have practically no eyebrows i'm just going to drain some eyebrows and in the process of doing them in i'm going to create a really high arc for them that's high that's what i'm talking about as you can see the act is really really high on this brows and as you can see i'm already looking younger yes i know the brows are not the best brows because i've just used a pencil and they can slide off in a minute but i'll make sure that i shape them more with the concealer so let me just make sure to conceal them because they're fit um okay still thick but good okay yes the concealer is really really light but that's the one i have so bear with me um eyebrows are done i know they are really really thick i had no intention of them being this big i only had the intention of them being really high up on my face almost touching my hairline because that looks more youthful next tip that i'm going to tell you is that you are going to minimize on the makeup so basically what we are only going to use is foundation concealer and a setting powder yes that's what we are going to use no eyeshadows no extremely bright eyeshadow and if you are to use eyeshadow make sure that you are using one color and preferably like a powder eyeshadow yes so we are basically going to do that we will use eyeshadow but we'll use one shade of eyeshadow to apply all over the eyes we are not going to use multiple shades of eyeshadow yes so i'm just going to go in with my foundation now and i'm just using the maybelline fit me foundation in the shade warm coconut which i still realize this is not my head i don't know when i'm ever going to get a maybelline shade i think african skin sincerely there'll never be enough shades by the way because i've tried like three shades now of this maybelline shades that were promising that i've seen people similar to my skin tone use and i still feel that it doesn't blend in completely okay this one is not so bad but still it usually feels like it does not match my skin tone fully i don't know i i'm not really used to doing makeup with like akitamba or this thing it feels really awkward how do people normally manage do they just like put makeup on top of that the clothes what do they normally do okay but we'll sort that out later because especially okay let me just try and fold it up yeah you see what i'm talking about i was going to create a horrible lane horrible horrible horrible just pull it back so that at least it can like as you can see that is definitely not my skin tone you see but anyway we'll just have to work with it okay here we've done like a foundation now we're going to do concealer and then we'll do our eyeshadow and i'm going to use a monochrome powder eyeshadow basically not glitter the opposite of glitter is what matte yes i'm going to use a matte eyeshadow so avoid glitter eyeshadow at all cost glitter eyeshadow is aging for those of you who don't know if you're a teenager and all under 20 something else that's fine because i mean even if you look slightly older you won't look that old but definitely if you're in your 30s your 40s or 50s avoid glitter eyeshadows so make sure that you're using a matte eyeshadow which i'm going to use today and make sure that you use it in one color one shade don't like apply like red blue and apply our concealer i think concealer you're just applying the normal way okay i'm looking for the concealer where has it gone haha that's what you should happen to me like sit on things okay where are you now i've only gotten up for a microsecond and the concealer has disappeared okay here it is so i'm basically using this revlon photoready concealer in the shade medium and i believe medium is not my shade i should have taken a dip if there was a dip which there was none so i'm just going to apply concealer the normal way like from here just be it i should have done my eyeshadow first but it's fine okay so let me just apply a little i'll do the eyeshadow as this concealer big so let me apply the concealer first hey so let me just bake the concealer then do a little like shadow as you can see i'm already looking youthful so um i'm going to use this sacha buttercup setting powder i'm just going to like apply it where i've applied the concealer it to set okay then we are going to do our eyeshadow and i'm just going to pick a matte eyeshadow any matte eyeshadow can do and i'm just going to take a little very little so i'm just going to take this orange one bright colors neon colors are not really encouraged but um i'm just going to dab like and just make it you know i'm not even going to apply it like in any order or in any way just a little like that very very little avoid neon colors if you want to look younger so that's it yeah and i'm not even going to bother with doing a winged eyeliner but you can do a winged eyeliner it does look youthful it does make your face um more youthful basically so you can do a winged eyeliner definitely do the lower mascara and you can put on some lashes lashes uh the big lashes make you look older but i'll still use them but definitely use smaller lashes if you have them it's just that i don't have any smaller lashes my now okay to tell you if you're going to do winged eyeliner i think i'm just going to do winged eyeliner because it does make a difference is that you want to start your wing from the inner corner of your eye so you start from here are you saying you'd want your wing to look like that from the inner corner of your eye you don't want to see how low pads or cheetahs normally look that's how you'd want your wing to look so that's that and i think i'll just leave it like this i'm not going to fill it in with the black you can opt to fill it in with the black but i think i'll just leave it like that i'll just make the line slightly bolder basically we are going to um what's next yeah the lip makeup because yes lips are a very important part of how you look definitely avoid reds blues bright colors like greens or basically anything that has color apart from brown and neutral colors so what i'm going to do is that i'm just going to apply the same black pencil that i used to draw my all over my lips so blacks browns and neutral colors is okay and i don't mean black like a goth black lipstick these are just ideas of how you can make yourself look more young for whatever reason you want to look younger for and i'm just going to like because it's really harsh i'm just going to like smear it all over my lips not all over but like you know yeah create somewhat of an ombre effect and then i'm going to take this um matte uh maybelline that was not my best choice of a lipstick but i'll just try and highlight only at the center of my lips and before it dries down i'm just going to try and like blend it in with the other one yeah like just before it drains down because it dries down really really much this is not fully blended but it's really hard to do this how do people normally do this and i see so many tick tocks girls are just like and then it's like wow bam it's blended maybe i should have used a brown a dark brown instead of a black i guess that's the reason but hey okay now that that is done i'm not going to blend it anymore honestly it may look a bit crazy but i'm just going to manually blend it already the lipstick has dried down and then what i'm going to do is that i'm going to this is something i saw on tik tok and you know tiktok has a lot of children so this is something that i'm going to oh god i never really i don't want to just apply it uh i'm just going to um this is trick i saw on tick tock so just apply like the lip gloss only around your lips not in the center of your lips oh god it's come off with like the pink lipstick who make it look so easy way does it look so easy and when i try it it's like or maybe it's this tube gloss so there is like okay i guess it's done something yes so next we're just going to remove the rest of the powder and apply our final setting powder now we have to do our nose sorry we have to do our nose so what i'm going to do is that i'm going to take a brush and just like try and contour this nose as best as i can so i'm just going to end for contouring the nose i normally start from up up completely i think i did a whole video on that on how i contour my nose i actually did do a whole video on how i normally contour my nose simple that is it i'm done i'm done and i'm actually already through i think that one will actually do i don't really need a harsh contour so i start from my brows yeah and i'm done with the nose so next we're just going to do um the setting powder as i was saying and basically this is the main part of looking youthful like we are basically done with the most important parts like the which was basically the hair you have to pull your hair up and tight and uh also the what is it called a simple eyeshadow look no fancy eyeshadow and also a simple lip look no like reds greens blues purples and whatever and i've talked too much because right now we have to like remove the what is the sacha buttercup and also apply the other setting powder and do a little bit of um thing because i need to like make sure that it's very blended and not uh weird like with lines and all that and as i say this is a synthetic wig so i've just tried to lay it like i've really forced the laying you know and you can even see like i didn't even have weak glue to stick it down but you'll just have to forgive me for that because the main purpose of the video was actually to make sure that you're looking youthful the tips and tricks that are going to make you look youthful so we are going to remove this sacha buttercup and then we are going to apply the maybelline setting powder which is this one the fit me i normally use caramel although i don't know whether that is also my shade but it has been working well so uh i haven't i don't really live in a place where i can test this product and the app that they're using for testing on jumia is just i don't know those apps they really help because i've tried using it and it's not really successful because everything looks like it's blending in you can tell me if your canon in the comment section if you've ever used the maybelline app the one on jumia to like look for your shade did it work for you because me i've tried and all those shades just look good on that app god i have like uh it's getting colder whether the climate is changing where i stay so i'm starting to get the sniffles i need like um what is it called to buy a large medication and stuff and you really want to keep it simple no harsh lines and all that yeah so as you can see guys it actually does make you look youthful it does those tricks i've told you they oh my god that is disgusting hope you didn't hear that but the tricks i've shown you they actually make you look more youthful they make you look young and yeah so let's do some highlight because i have not and is this yeah let's do some highlight and i'm also using the maybelline highlight which is the master chrome hi highlighter and i'm just going to like go home honestly with the highlighter cool yes and i'm using the wrong brushes for these things but okay yeah okay that is done and i think that's also done so guys basically and when you want to look more youthful you use things like hoops and all that so i'm just going to use but these are tiny you know they use i really love huge things so definitely i'd go with this size slightly yeah yay looking like a teenager fresh from high school wow oh my god that's how we lie to ourselves but uh huh so there of course a teenager would not wear such a pendant this is like an evening pendant but basically that is how you would look and i think i've done a pretty good job

angelique on the pod and i have fam in the building today i have miss marcy mars marcy mars [Laughter] um yeah you know we have a really strong friendship and if you know me you just know that because you've seen marcy you've been around her um whether it's in orlando or not or shout out to those people [Laughter] and yeah i don't know i'ma let you give yourself a little introduction because you know i feel like i suck at doing that to people i get all hyped up and then i give a horrible intro on them so i mean really what else can i say it's it's just me marcy and i just feel like this will be a very interesting conversation because you and i are just so jovial and you know we balance very well with one another so i know that yeah but don't forget to hype yourself up and your brand and what you got you know i have a lot of things i feel like right now i'm trying to figure out as far as like creatively where i want to go i've always obviously been an advocate for like sustainability and you know shopping secondhand and thrifting and things of that nature but you know right now i've just kind of been venturing down the intimate and loungewear sector yeah yeah i'm so excited for it um you know i've really been kind of just working on that for a while and just trying to figure out like what my direction is with that and and what i'm really trying to focus on um and so you know with that being said like that's just where i'm at right now so i'm excited for that you know all things come you know when it's their time circle and absolutely um so yeah you know that's great focusing on happiness and better life and yes i love it you know you're okay so i guess maybe i'll put it out there for you for me you know you're a scholar you know you're a student of your craft you know you do your work yeah you know you're a business owner which is very powerful especially being a brown you know a brown woman in these days um you're doing your part and just i don't know putting your your impact on the world which is a really nice touch you know because not a lot of people appreciate secondhand and like the beauty of thrifting and just items in general like just seeing the value in things right and also you know i kind of do want to just chime back to that you know when you do purchase secondhand like think of the people that that business is employing and perhaps the rehabilitation process that they're going through you know working there yeah um so you know you're not just purchasing you know clothing for the low it's true you're actually you know you're impacting somebody's life you're impacting the environment so i definitely want to you know reiterate that yeah and also because coming from orlando you know kissimmee where you go to these thrift shops or these little pop shops and there's these hick-ass [ __ ] in there you know and you're just like oh gosh and you're like why are they here like what you know is this their family's shop or are they here because of this you know program or like what is it you wonder what how they found themselves working there right yeah cause you know sometimes or it's a little cute little boutique and this is old lady and she's had this nice shop for years and she has antiques and thrifts and yeah quality that's so funny it's okay so quick story because you brought it up not too long ago and i think it's a great story okay this is a great story because it could have went either way it was it was a story about us it is usually good i don't think good but you know wow wild anyways so first time we hung out one on one first time we hung out one on one yeah after we met the day after we met i just wanna put that out there see that's details that you know i smoked too much to remember we met each other and we exchanged numbers the same day that was daryl's birthday we had a blast we got daryl [ __ ] up yes yes not daryl black okay we gotta say black out here what up with it you know we're friends because of this man right there this amazing yes guy um and yeah so then the next day we link up she yeah basically to go thrifting for your brand right i was shopping for find 12 and you came and scooped me with a nice cool full of modellos nice cooler of modellos and we went thrift hopping all day and we were in stanford sanford and sanford great great times great time so i don't know is we we connected on that thrift part you know because i was really venturing starting my venture in the thrift world okay and you know it was great to have somebody like that was on it i was like yes i can [ __ ] with somebody that loves it yeah not that just you know you know what you're doing yeah because because a lot of people are they you study this and i mean i've been in thrift stores and i'll hear somebody like it stinks in here it pisses me off because i'm like when you're doing it you know what i mean why are you here but i mean i feel them so it's not it's not for everybody it's just really interesting true because all these strange people's clothing in one room it is it's yeah because after an hour like i'm getting crazy allergies right sometimes it doesn't smell crazy but hey it's like that whatever it goes away after like five minutes but yeah i just think it's cool that you're you know a student of that because you take that [ __ ] seriously you know like you just some people either you have a knife for fashion or you don't right and it's like a different type of fashion that you aspire so it's you know it's greatness it's greatness so it's so great to have you on here [Music] yes queen yes very 2021. [Laughter] let's get into this little topic here because i feel like you're the perfect and the only person that i should have this conversation with even though i would love to have v on here all this conversation i know she has her input you know um especially as somebody who grew up here in new york i think we have a southern perspective on it and growing up in florida um and so i can only imagine you know just topics and things that i feel like i'm going to touch bases on i can only imagine what she also um went through right right right now because i want to touch on that so yeah all right let's get into it yes so today's topic we're going to get into how because this i don't even think is a question either how toxic is latino culture because and i and i feel like i depend i defend the culture a lot and i don't even think about how really toxic it is i don't know i feel like there's a lot of demeaning things in our culture and um i don't know i don't know i of course it stems from the household but you already know like things like afro latinos and the hair and the skin tone not acknowledging like that's a major thing that and that's a thing that's everywhere but it's different when it comes i for me i feel like it's different when it comes to my culture right because it's not just americans accepting african americans those are two different cultures latino culture when we have antigen right you know like why are we discriminating on our own people shouldn't we be embracing our people like i don't know it's i don't know and you have darker people in your family definitely yeah more than i do yeah and to me and you know their like what indigenous dominicans would look like right because you're repping dr correct of course like you know both of my parents just a little backstory into that both of my parents were born in dominican republic my mother was born in santo domingo and my father was born in santiago yeah um you know and i think that if you are you know first generation here um you know you have parents that probably have a fake birthday um so you know you really have to i mean and and when you pose the question um you know is like latin culture toxic um you know of course i'm only speaking from my perspective and you know uh behaviors you know because when you ask the question i had to think to myself um you know what's pernicious you know um a personality or you know behaviors that i also exhibit as a result of you know my upbringing even the things that obviously your parents shelter you from and then you know when you go back to so you know when you ask me that question that's what i thought we were going to hone in on was like music and dancing and stuff like that well we can get no and i definitely want to but when you from your perspective and you saying you know when it comes to just features and you know uh skin color you know what's crazy i think it's the whole it's not it's all crazy yeah the way dads are with their girls you know why is it that we feel like we have to lock our daughters up why does it feel like oh we have to ask to go sleep over right right right the protection you know the protection we put on our on our women mm-hmm and you have to think why is it what what is it that we needed to be need to be protected from and why is that being you know the activity is kind of being protected because at a point you know now it's like people are being more outspoken about their experiences um but then it was kind of like you were protecting the abuser rather than the child and there's a lot of obviously people that you know still remains in households and in families you know because they were trying to protect an image rather than you know protecting the victim right that happens a lot in our culture a lot a lot of within the family uncles or family friends like all that and that's why you're not allowed to stay in casa henna that's why they don't want you they get playing outside you know because let me tell you when i was when i was growing up and obviously like i said i can only speak from experiences yes my grandmother was very traditional and i wanted to be outside play oh my gosh you're speaking to me you're speaking right now because again we grew up in very traditional hispanic households and yeah regardless of whether you're from colombia mexico puerto rico dominican republic whatever hispanic you know we have a lot of the same foundations and values and things of that nature so yeah you know you just were absolutely forbidden to not forbidden but it wasn't it was frowned upon because my grandmother was not happy when i wanted to be outside playing with the boys oh yeah yeah i only had got boy neighbors you know what i mean so i just wanted to you know and it wasn't like i was trying to be africa but then that was that's another thing is this like image being imposed on you when it's like you still have such an innocent mind and you don't you don't even necessarily see you know obviously because you're very naive you know and you're like damn why can't i yeah do it i mean my brother would disappear yeah oh wow and when he would show up it would be like a there he is they didn't see me for 20 minutes and you know it's a whole different story with you where have you been where'd you go who was there what's their parents name what's their address give me their telephone number they got brothers who lives there right all of that but you know and i do want to say thank god that my parents were did that that protective of me because god knows what they were sheltering me from when they were you know doing it exactly because who knows what was out there and you know i think that's another thing that's different than other cultures that and especially our generation and older that our parents were like that and did parent us in that way don't take no [ __ ] i'm the parent you're the child you're staying home because i said so i don't want you going to their house that's it why because i said no because i said no that's it that's it right and i remember you even saying like maybe if you kept asking you might have gotten a little leeway yes it was like yo you ask again and you're gonna be in trouble don't eat us i already told you no no is no and that's it right right i know and there's even people that if you if you even asked like did you just ask me to sleep over like oh [ __ ] i just you know damn well i was saying no but if you were lucky and i was you know i did have that one friend nancy that i could stay the night at her yeah my mom obviously had my mom i have dad you know gave her a little analysis or whatever run down of a parent yeah they passed and i was allowed to stay the night at their house right right that's beautiful that's so funny yeah it's great but i don't know the the way we are with the girls is it's it i don't know it could be it's a good message it is yeah especially if you're saying you strictly cannot do x y and z because of the fact that you're a female yeah and i i i've also been subjected to that as well where i've asked why can't i yeah because you're a girl and that was the answer yeah and wow and it kind of not for nothing and you know i don't know if i'm gonna ruffle any feathers here but i genuinely feel like kind of growing up you're kind of almost almost ashamed to be a female because it's not a shame to be but you kind of feel bad you know what i'm saying because it's like if you're being told that you can't do something because of the fact that you're a girl yeah yeah you know what i'm like i've been where's my happiness where's my happiness in being a girl if i'm told that i can't do things because of the fact that i'm a girl i've never thought of that and i've been told that a few times i never never really i don't know how it makes me feel right you know i haven't been told that much but i was told that a few times so i think that's crazy but it is it is a thing it's very misogynistic you know um and i i want to go back to the colorism thing because i just think it's crazy and you know because it is it is and it's crazy and you know i love my family so much and it's not like to shame anybody no no no of course not it's to have this to be honest it's to be honest we're here to be honest correct and my grandmother she's my best friend you know she loves me i love her we have an understanding it's something that she grew from right and she knows and we talk about her growth from the moment but like when i was younger i would remember like going outside and it would be either play with the boys or play with the black girls right you know what i mean but these were black girls in my grade black girls in my classes you know and my grandmother would have an extra eye just because of that just because of that or i wouldn't be able to go to their houses real quick for a snack or for a moment don't no oh like why right i said no and in the back of my head i'm like why are you being like that like i go to other people's houses like right what's the difference yeah or knowing that there's no difference knowing that there's no difference do you have darker skinned family members in your um members in your family like blood apparently from my grandfather's side but i've never met him or i don't know the real you know i know them yeah um but you know my uncle which is an in-law you know he's dark-skinned and i think he hm yeah he's he's i want to say the one of the representatives of our family we are we're all a little brown right brown there's yeah you know because i used to be more darker but that's when i lived in florida right of course all those outside activities but this glue glow this new york glow is not really for me i'm hating it because i really want to go back to be blonde i want to be blocked again but yeah i don't know um you want to talk about music though because girl think about it i think that we should give some like two seconds to ponder what is music we were listening to growing up at those parties that you are with your friends in the sixth grade i was in high school and that's okay oh my bad my bad see oh my bad that's what i was listening to in middle school it was still yeah still the same thing it was just like early early we sing like yeah yeah right because you really yo your love for reggaeton is like through and through it drives from colonial high school i can't it really does you know wrapping grenades [Laughter] um when i think about the way the music is going it gets me a little sentimental okay why is that because it's i feel like this era of latino culture latino music is taking away from our roots because this stems well even though haregiton and all that you know has caribbean influence but you know we're going to give all of this trap rap all this latino trap to the rap okay you know what i mean that's american yeah you know like and the pop and the pop yeah you know all these things and i don't hear any new salsa music coming out i don't know yeah real like hitmen right and when we were it was like prince voice and that was when i was in high school and now that was a long time ago and now it's like what's where's our music going like we have no that the old ones can dance to even though the old you know generation they'd be trying to learn [Laughter] one in the party they were oh right right and then they you know i hope to keep that spirit forever keep that arch in your back seriously because it kind of hurts now is not the same um at the gym so i can keep up this you know and so you when you're you're talking about like the direction that hispanic music has is going into and i think that this is just um just an example of the opposite side of capricorn that we are okay uh because we obviously have had this you know this topic of discussion is latin culture toxic yeah and you know how you thought the question and how you were gonna proceed in answering it was kind of like the opposite spectrum of how i was gonna proceed yeah and it's the same thing with the music because you're talking about the direction and i was talking about the lyrics and the dancing behind it and how sexual this is and that's why i say that takes away from our culture because that takes all of that the wrap the baby it takes away from our salsa our beautiful salsa like our salsa don't be like like no it's not gonna i think it's gotten a lot raunchier as far as like the lyrics like whatever but now is it you know like i don't know what he said in that sapphire song at the end it's like you know he pushed his buttons because yeah anybody and everybody was like yo did he just yeah right yeah right right that you had to turn it rewind it and listen again to be like oh no i was just like listening already yo yo and then our parents were making them listen to this so we can see their reaction i would get smacked i wouldn't even try like you saw those compilations of you know showing the biggest reaction i cried i tried to do it but now yeah exactly they couldn't hear they're like huh i was tight i'm like i didn't work for me i really wanted that one it's funny though but yeah now that sounds crazy and i don't know you know when you used to go out to the clubs in orlando did you do that nights you know i did well you know i spent a few birthdays at hanging on sunday what was the beach show yes but i'm always going to call that taboo for whatever oh that's oh that's super throwback i don't even think i was able to go there when it was called taboo but you know i'm still gonna call it yeah and i used to go to the beach somewhere on sunday nights it was like one side was like that yeah the main room was and then the other one which was the social world right the bachata oh it was so good it was but when i first started going out you know i would go to the latin clubs and it's funny because i can't even think of the places anymore because they're so old but there's this one spot on 50 and roxy i don't know i don't think i don't know i don't know i'm not even going to try the name it's more about the fashion square that's why that like taco bell [Music] okay okay right it was like a standalone building with a big-ass parking lot it had like different floors a lot of rooms actually was fire that place was fire shout out roxy then i remember you go in there be like a disco immediately like where are we at what are we drinking what are we doing what room are we going to because there's multiple rooms yeah yeah you know and that's the thing i miss a lot too it's like the different rooms and just like having that room where is that me too and that's what i miss about it because it's not about dancing anymore it's about going out being flashy figure out what and i always say this because it's not the same anymore to go out but i feel like it kind of always has been that way and i feel like our you know my cousins that are a little older they're like in their 40s that their generation is the last of the actually going out and partying partying and just like dancing all night listen if i'm out with a bunch of people that i don't know with listening to music that i might not like i'm not gonna stand on the wall all night like i definitely need to you know at least try to to enjoy myself and that's dancing but i just like especially like i cannot be in a spanish setting and just like be standing there like nah like okay us you know let's do this i wore comfy shoes yeah right right there's a thing is too a lot of people are not teaching their kids the culture right so not only we're talking about not speaking spanish that's one thing that's one way we haven't gotten there yet you know but we will we will but also not teaching them to dance and that's what i think it goes back to what i say that is so beautiful about our culture when parents parent the kids that they used to make us dance when we were kids oh oh yeah bone show my cousin and i like all holidays new year's christmas thanksgiving i'm like yo come dance with me because growing up in pa we were you know basement parties with your family and you were dancing my father told me how to dance and i grew up but i think that's what it is it's like now when you're at family get-togethers you're listening to all types of different music where when i was growing up i had zero say in what we were listening my cousin's kids kind of run the show now you know what i'm saying like they put you know they're listening to like future and young whoever oh that's true right and so growing up all we listened to was bachata and merengue and like you know whatever you know like song was it exactly yeah and that was it there was no english anything like i my love of like luffy and all that from just like my father really growing up in new york at a young age yeah but in the households at family get-togethers it was bachata and nothing else but that that's that was it yeah there wasn't oh we're gonna order a pizza or somebody was making a big thing of rice exactly for the family right you know so i that might be what's going on is that we have more hispanics being birthed here and not necessarily coming from you know our islands and you know and keeping that here exactly yes they're not really keeping the roots alive they're not watering our plants it's a melting pot yes but at the same time like you still want to preserve your heritage and your traditions and things like that exactly and that's something that i feel very responsible for with you know like as a woman and you know as being like one of the young adults in my family being a female right because that's what you're the woman you're right yeah there's always like and you know in families that one person that has to be like the mover of the family yeah the spirit of growing yeah and i just feel like i want to i guess take it on right because it has to we have to keep a legacy keep these recipes and get these stories keep you know you know for thanksgiving like that or something yes yes yeah exactly knowing how to like keep up with a gandula plant right a gandula tree yeah you know our orange trees green thumbs you know these are things that are correct but i mean you know our family members kind of were blessed because they came from nothing you know and what we have now is contributed to you know their their labor yeah and so they have those skills because they absolutely needed them yeah but yo we can just go to the corner store and get a packet of salsa there's no need to make a sofrito there's no need there's really no need for any of that if you really think about it yeah if you're gonna carry on the traditions by by all means i think that that's amazing but truthfully you don't have to because there are there are other options now yeah so that's really something that i feel like you have to have a passion for and an absolute love for and that you don't want to let go of the old ways yeah you're you know you're continuously like just trying to preserve that because and i think it's very important yeah it is especially because when you were saying you have all these hispanic children that are dominican and their parents are you know puerto rican or colombian or whatever cuban but they don't speak any spanish and that would be me i my first language was speaking spanish absolutely in my household but i mean at that time by the time i came around my parents already spoke english and so it was very rare that we spoke spanish in the house because they spoke english now i have cousins where you know they came very early in the game and their parents all they knew was spanish so that's that was their first and second language was spanish and so they're you know obviously very fluent and speaking it and they're very comfortable reading and writing and whatever yeah yeah and you know when they even speak to their parents now it's always in spanish and when i it's funny because but i'm speaking to a lot of my aunts they're speaking to me in spanish but i'm responding to them in english yeah and they understand me and i understand them right but there's still that light you know like yeah it's still that barrier and that comfortability of obviously my aunts are much they're comfortable speaking spanish so that's how you know you're going to understand me because they're not going to speak to me in english i think it's crazy too because they go out and they always say like you know hablo engle pero yome den you know like i don't speak english but i defend obviously but yeah like what are you what are you really even saying here i know that like basically yeah i understand the gist of what you're saying right i still [ __ ] you up right basically that's what it is no i'm just kidding and you know you worded it perfectly you really just took all the words out of my mouth on that i was like you know but it i think it's so important and i i think this new generation of latino culture which i don't want to discriminate and neglect our culture but you know the latinx latino culture is really different in 2021 because we have this generation of latinos and latinx people that are american yeah you know and i'm on that as well you know i do speak spanish i hate to say it so like i really do yeah i'm sorry we're all we're all that you know um and i just read write you know all all of the above in spanish and i don't know i just i it makes me kind of feel bad when i see other people just not able to communicate for a simple i don't know what the reason is you know and it's not just simple as i wasn't shown you know there's a lot more behind that like how come we didn't right teach our kid or how come you know like i remember my grandmother only speaking to me in spanish she would you know try to do the best that she can but i would understand everywhere she said right yeah you know just because when i when i was born and whatnot um when i started speaking it was in spanish and my grandmother was like whoa i know you're speaking spanish but you got to go to school right so you got to learn english of course so that you weren't like being put in seoul so you exactly because i'm not a [ __ ] because i speak spanish you know no let me tell you that's some what it is yeah a lot of the cases these kids are being put that's such a crazy topic a lot of these kids are being put so i think they have a disabil they just haven't transitioned from speaking their native language into and they put them in special classes they put me in eso i'm telling you okay yeah spanish was my first language but that was up until like the first grade not even okay like kindergarten okay so like why was i being put in esau in the fourth grade i hardly even spoke spanish so it was like i don't i don't know what they were my mom was like this yeah that lasted all but a week yeah because yeah that was not one what's the point of that you know i was i was lagging in school but it had nothing to do oh yeah no yeah no there was no language barrier right i understood my teacher i just didn't want to do my markers and i'm telling you you see yeah different problem behind it and they put you in east all right and so like chinese i'm sorry no no oh they're not learning oh they're not you know retaining right you don't even know what the hell is going on all right saying that they're behind no maybe i needed some tutoring or something i think that would have been the better solution but it was only a child i couldn't i couldn't express that at the time and you know just how you were saying like why is it that in certain circumstances like you know um they're not being taught like traditional ways or how to speak spanish or how to dance and things like that and i think like there was like two ends of the spectrum where you had certain you know hispanics that that came here and were like we're never letting go of our original roots just because we live here that doesn't make us american we are where you know we are our ancestors right yes and then you also had people that came here and it was obviously extremely difficult for immigrants from any country that you know came to the united states and it was like they just wanted their family members to blend in yeah as much as possible because of the prejudice that they were experiencing i mean if you've seen my side's story yeah that is a great depiction of what it was you know what i'm saying and so you know saying with that being said it's not just you know how you were speaking what language you were speaking but how your hair was done you know you don't go to an interview with that that crazy crazy hair you don't want those women to think that you'll go up and they're stealing all their men or why is it that when we go to fancy events that we have to straighten our hair right right why do we have to do that and london is this american culture it's just a lot of you know oppression and you know it has a lot to do with vanity and again that travels back to colorism that trans back to you know having a fake birthday and not you know like all of this identity yeah that we have that little by little has been shut out is being you know cast it's cast in a bad light or you know the sun is being taken out of it and making you feel like you should feel guilty for having this old and you know being proud of all this stuff and you know listen we all have that if you're hispanic uh you have an aunt that is extremely verbose she's loud she's in your face you know what i'm saying she's like yo when she sees you she's like kissing you all over the place and giving you all this love and stuff like that and and that is how all hispanic are kind of portrayed as you know very touchy very feely you know what i'm saying she's in the workplace she could take your man because she's not even trying to be sexy but she just said dudes yes sex yes i yes i have latin roots yeah i have savage roots absolutely know because when you hear like that traditional you know afro beat when it's very like the tambourine and very like yes you just you know and yeah and it's very like you know moving this thing it's kind of like that's just how you walk around all day and it's just like and you know go back to the paciando right because i was watching some uh clip the other day of this young girl she moves to america from africa and because you know that's a part of our roots too yeah there's not yes we don't have that feeling for nothing right yeah correct exactly let's not deny that yeah yeah and young lady she comes to america and they have a show a show-and-tell kind of showcase and she wants to do an african traditional dance right they're telling her oh maybe you should take out the the hips the bottom half because it's too provocative and she was just kind of confused because she's like what are you telling me right like that's kind of like stupid and yes very pretty disrespectful to show somebody that their culture somebody something that we do naturally is provocative right because your culture is so different correct so different you don't even know where your culture comes from but when we do it because it's natural to us it's natural that my hips need that movement it's part of you uncomfortable exactly because maybe it turns you on or right it's the sexualization right you don't know where it comes from so you're intimidated right it looks good yes you're not marketing off of it because you don't have that exactly you don't have that hair you don't have the hips you don't have to move that rhythm i doing this right it's not your best it's your butt non-existent uh that's pretty sweet so that was my stuff that was messed up some people got hips it's just you know um obviously my dominican people are very god-fearing people yeah and i just think that christianity has kind of put the the cuffs on a lot of things and how things are perceived especially especially something like you know a traditional dance where because of the fact that it's very hippie and yeah you know moving the hips when i say that yeah um and very you know just like kind of like trancing erotic and putting you into a trance yes for whatever you know whatever it is whether it's you know something maybe for like a harvest or you know something that is just like maybe like a welcome ceremony or something right yeah you know it it really kind of makes you laugh because you know just that sexual perversion that just again like you were saying just because that's how you perceive it that doesn't even mean that that's what the original you know um goal or you know that's what we're trying to convey right that's not even the meaning behind the dance the dances comes from our ancestors rituals these are things that are passed down yeah it's beautiful right this is a part of my culture and how dare you try to sit here and tell me to dim the light on it yeah and if i was her i would say i'll take it out and i would have went even harder [Laughter] don't don't do it right just don't do it like i but you know something that i feel like i've seen lately is i don't know if it's i don't really know how to you know perceive it but there's just i feel like a little more educational about things and acceptance and stuff like that and understanding i'm i could be wrong because obviously there's a lot going on right now like yeah that's a fact um but i also see that there's a lot more acceptance in with certain things okay as you know when i was you know i grew up in the 90s that was more than 88 um and certain things that maybe you either have to be ashamed of or you know you kind of had to again dim that and not like personality all of it you know you're feminist yes you're proud to be a woman exactly yeah you know i think these are all things that are men painting their nails wearing pearls right right wearing the bag all of it where it's like now it's like not do that yeah and before it was again and we're and i wish we had a guy in here to defend themselves [Music] i know a really cool 14 year old that could sit here why do these latino men have this you know what i mean this pride this like manly thing about them where they have to i guess dominate or really just be the patriarch of the head honcho the alpha you know i think that's very great in her oh absolutely and you know for men and for women yeah where you know at a very young age you are taught to be an alpha and that being a beta is no good right yeah because i mean maybe that stems from you know are people having to defend themselves oh absolutely you know and just having to survive and maybe it comes from and i think that comes from the beginning of time and i don't know why it's still ingrained in our people that it's like that you know or even to take it a step further how women i like that i like for a man to be like that yeah most certainly yeah being a beta with me is no good because i'm an alpha and i most latinas are alpha no yes because you have we're taught that from a young age you have to be you can't be a beta and a family full of alphas you will be destroyed and in our families we have to make sure our kids have thick skin and you better take that joke and play roughly right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you know it's almost to create this shell for you so that nothing can hurt you when you're out in the world out from under your family's protection because how our people were treated correct and not only that but it's like listen your family could say all the harsh and awful things to you and that you have to accept accounts so what our people have been through so take that little brother ass weapon and it would be like [ __ ] yeah exactly like ah why are you crying and it's like because it hurts i was hurt and again it's like again if you're you know when you're out from their eye and their protection it's like they want you to to be good and i think that that sometimes kind of backfires because then you have a generation of young men and women that do not express themselves that don't know how to yeah they refuse to refuse their refusal oh i feel is so aggravating you know and it's funny because one thing i've really been trying to do is of course better my life but like certain things i tried to reflect on and i've been reflecting on the men that i've dated and encountered and really just been like you know we always got to talk about that [ __ ] but like i always go for these guys that are closed off and don't express themselves and are hard and are like you know these are natural man and i love because i love that yeah but at the end of the day i also love a man who can sit there and talk to me for hours right yeah and talk that [ __ ] with me and get deep and tell me a little something about himself because he has experience correct and he knows how to open up and knows how to get down like yeah right so and i think and you know and like in relationships when you're not able to convey your feelings correctly or express yourself in a neutral territory where you're not scared of the backlash of what you're gonna say yes you know like when you have that that understanding that is only going to help civilization and build our communities correct you know how much violence isn't well i know you know how much violence is in our culture yeah in our communities and it's so sad to see it especially domestically yes you know the things that kids see i'm so blessed that i haven't had to you know witness anything crazy but like you know or those fights or the way that we talk to each other yeah i mean our kids you see people in the subways talking about some shut up shut up but shut the [ __ ] up listen i am no better than anybody but i would never speak to a child that way i just can't even imagine the it has right right because my mom didn't tell me to shut the [ __ ] up please be quiet but it was not you know it was never like talking to me like yeah and then you got those little kids in the street talking to people crazy like yeah it's like it's such an awful awful cycle girl yeah oh my gosh yeah it is i don't know it's it's a lot of things and it's really sad and i don't know and it's funny because like the sports of the latinos is boxing the most violent of baseball too okay oh okay so the most violent is boxing well i think you know and it's violent we love that [ __ ] yeah right i don't know i don't get it but that's just i like boxing yeah well i don't know it's just there's so many different flaws in our culture [Music] and but there's so okay i don't even want to say that our culture sucks because whenever you know like very proud to be a dominican young woman i'm gonna put that out there very proud everything that we've just mentioned i like my relationship with my culture i put all that in the back and i accept it and then know like the way it is like with the men trying to be the alpha of the family i love that [ __ ] i love the way our culture has come across because it's from the grain of the pain of the roots of what we've been through that has built this beautiful culture where we flourish with you know dance and our arts the creative arts yeah our threads yeah you know everything are cooking like we have the top-notch culture right i agree and i think that you know since we have this discussion we're having this discussion and yeah you know i'm kind of going a little hard on you know growing up latina yeah um we in you know just from like the negative perspective and things that i've endured i think that we definitely need to re-uh you know re-address this conversation but you know like in the positive aspect and like the pride that we clearly feel you know for being young latin women like i i would not i don't want to be anything else i'm so proud to be dominican when i'm cleaning and i'm listening to bachata and i'm cooking and i can make a slam and ass meal because my parents made me start cooking at 17 and that's late for a lot of people they've been cooking since they were like yeah my cousin and his wife they have such a beautiful household it's one of my favorite homes to go to shout out to tony in kenya i know you guys be watching and i love that [ __ ] i know the kids watch too so but the way they brought up their kids is just so beautiful to me it's just like you know they make sure the girls do their chores you know yeah and and not even just the girls the boy too right that everybody contributes so maybe the girls know how to start cooking from a young age you know how to make rice better than me i'm sorry i know it's like a two-step process but it's just exactly it takes so it tastes like all right it does it is and when you eat our white rice just know it comes from god and love from our god and our lacrosse we know god because it doesn't happen for everybody it's really god saying today i'm gonna i'm gonna make this confess cause [ __ ] one day be like yes the next day wow that [ __ ] that's right [Music] yeah so i would definitely like i wanna you know come back around right and and come with a more positive right um you know cause i again like i was saying i have my my last name chad like don sanchez very very very proud to be a latin young woman and you know i think that there's a lot of pride that just comes you know with with everything else you know it's pride it's happiness and again like our parties are the best like oh bring listen if you're if you are not of hispanic descent and you go to a friend of yours who is hispanic you go to their family feel blessed tell me hopefully and i and i hope that i'm you know not sticking my foot in my mouth when i say this but tell me that's not some of the best hospitality that you've ever experienced i know that i've bought brought friends to my house or a family get-together and my family accepted them as if they have known them since the beginning of time yes and you have to come back and you have to come back and like and you have to eat food and you have to take food you have to eat because if you don't eat it's like yo you're not gonna serve your friend right you get looked at like you know what yeah right it's like they're not hungry so i'm running away you know my cousins right now you know they can't be like they're terrible anyway because like i'm like but they're not hungry it's like nah you have to eat you have to break bread with us because at the end of the day where we might lack in riches and all this excessive things talk on it we will feed you we will take care of you we'll take care of it you know woman will take care of you she'll hurt you and your friends yeah everybody yo and let me get you a cold yep yeah very high listen it's because who wants to be it's always been right exactly yo you good you got i got you you know what i'm saying like sit down i got you i'll throw that off for you cleaning up around you you know what i like when we went to um basements uh get together birthday uh-huh yes how his little sister was on and who wants drinks right she got it yeah this is a very latino family exactly because again you know she was raised why is it that we send our kids to go get the alcoholic drinks why right yeah i don't ask the little ones but their parents gonna go get me up here oh my gosh so it's a beautiful thing it really is and you know again like with all cultures i feel like of course you have your pros and your cons yeah and you have things that you know have real like truly contributed to who you are as an individual like my roots and my ancestral heritage has absolutely attributed to the young woman that i am today yeah i i you know and i don't i couldn't picture myself was that anything else yeah i am so happy that i learned how to cook at 17. yeah and you know it really is something that you know when i'm able to cook with for my friends when we're able to have thanksgiving you know friends giving like yo i loved it yeah nothing else makes me happier than to do that right then to them to take care of its people it's certain absolutely like if nothing else makes me happier than to like serve and and to you know like make sure that you're good like again yeah i can't give you money but i can cook for you we can go have a good time yes you know you what you want peanut butter [Laughter] i think we just have the best of the best and you're right you know the things that we do [ __ ] up on yeah we make it up 10 15 a bajillion times more with how we are and what we bring to the table mm-hmm like we we we leaving everybody in life but that guy be cool right absolutely we throw in that [ __ ] i love it we do absolutely we leave that on the table like i that was good right yeah yeah absolutely it is ah i love it and i do chuckle at that meme where it's like you know a drawing of god making latinas like mad spice because i've been told yo you're so spicy and i'm like oh what did i say i don't know what i'm saying right i've been holding that and i threw it so you know and i just like again i think that it would be cool to you know bring other people and just like hear what their perspective is because again it was just like there's so much more that needs to be said oh man so so many more and we could even went in depth in all of these little pockets that we went into right right further ends up than those things you know i could talk about colorism for the whole 15 honestly like in a whole day i can just keep on talking mm-hmm until i got that which i mean i don't know if that's good or bad because you know if you've had or you've seen you know certain things or heard certain things you know from people and just like the ignorance that is you know colorism that is the you know dark skin dominicans not liking black people [ __ ] is crazy to me and i really um i got a better understanding of it when it was in dr and at that time there were a lot of patients living in the migraine public because you know there was a lot going on in haiti um and just the struggle that they were having yeah um which was really sad to see because again this was this is like a color on color type [ __ ] you know um and it's ignorance it really just stems from ignorance and that european standard of you know of beauty yeah um and i think that it's gonna take a minute for things to transition out of the negativity that they're in now yeah but i think that if you know obviously like enough people are having these conversations and that's why i'm just so happy that you know we're here today talking about this because whereas it's so easy for us to talk because we're peers these same conversations need to be had with the adults in our families and you know the people that you can talk to because i understand that we do come from some of us from very traditional family members you know families and you're not able to speak as openly or as deeply as you'd like to because people's fathers get ruffled very quickly yeah especially if you know we're very defensive people so if you're right you know they're gonna feel on the defense right away yeah but you know if if the conversations are able to be had yeah you know i really think that

weeks since I posted video if you don't know I came back from Legos just like yesterday but I really missed you guys that internet source multi-home the best anyway I'm gonna show you guys how I made this my wig that he doesn't see me wear a lot first things first where'd I get this hair from I got it from her giving hair this is one of my favorite techniques that I've made I mean I've only made like two I love it because it comes very nicely packaged and if you look at it like you see how it also has this information brochure which I love because honestly when you're making a week think about it how many times have you been in the - bit confused like okay what am I gonna do now so if you look at it now it says like daily maintenance washing and everything so basically I followed all the directions and this was very awesome this is the closure the closure was 16 inches and I still had to put some concealer on it just for it to blend into my natural skin tone aside from the packaging what I really liked also about her given here is they send you a couple of samples to try so that way if you're looking to buy other hair you know what other hair they have that was really helpful to me just making sure that the hair is nice and cleft because it suggests they should wash it first before you install it and I actually found out that this ship internationally when I went to Nigeria a lot of people asking me where I got my hair they actually ship internationally so you guys can order from them if you're in Nigeria I'm just showing you making sure you see that hair texture and just read the directions before you start because those directions are going to really help the air stay longer so I'm just washing it first I'm just going to rinse it that's can see shedding - bit so it doesn't shed too much but this is regular shedding you know it's just normal hair and I'm going to use the Herbal Essence hello hydration conditioner this is one of my favorite conditioners I even leave it on their own natural hair so I'm also going to use it on the West I'm not taking it apart yet I'm just it tangling and my fingers press on to make sure there's no tangles I want to make sure that the air feels really good so I'll fancy I'm just detangling if there's really important for it to detangle the hair before you put it honest with me you know just so it's very nice and it looks nice feels great I'll just mince in all the conditioner off want to meet your audience like well actually left a little in there just to make the hair soft because when it dries it dries very thick act exactly like your own natural hair that's right so I made sure that I conditioned all the bundles Wow my elbows are super ashy and yeah and then I condition all the bundles make sure that the hair the fleetingness detangle before I point on so let it dry for these tfd that's very important so now I'm making the lead first of all you're gonna need a good cut I just need a spandex film with cap you can use any big cap you like it just depends on what your preference that I use to hold you in place this is very important because you don't want any to shift leader on thread which is also very important cause that's what we're going to use to make it me so now I'm not going to show you the whole process because though it's very difficult for me to record but I'll explain it as best as I can if you have any comments or questions about how I meet the week just let me know in the comment section below and I will answer that for you so if you can see I already just put 80 pins and tell diffusion please always hold the aim please before you start sewing because if you start swinging about holding in place as your serie is going to move and shift so the closure is actually what I've showed on first as well see a bodysuit see a human in there just sort of regularly like an irregular and I just left some because this party isn't cut inside so it doesn't really matter how you sew it on just make sure that it's tight on it's on there because you don't want to close your move enough so then I'm just going to start with the ball each other deeply cut my little big head I'm going to just sew it on now what I do is I start please shut up on this first and working that we have to learn about having these heads maybe realize that actually should have started if I'm stressed then work my way to the back or put our stuff in the back there's no acknowledge a point it kind of made in good shape so it's really dependent and kind of movements but it's me that's how you sew it on much concealer said it's already me this is very very fun and I wanted a very fun because I got three packs okay so if you want to throw that just make sure that cute that's okay and you know that's really what I did and this is really the final you sort out the way to looks when I put it on I have definitely blended it in the truth better than pleistocene concealer but I love this end and right now they're actually doing this sale on the information is down below so check it out I hope you guys really enjoy this video and check out my other video is fine also my Legos and vlog / the tiny little video is coming for you guys soon so stay tuned for that thanks for watching bye guys kisses", "_ZY_t7aEz2k": "good morning everyone we're just about

um welcome to our our monthly meeting of march of this year my name is jane spruill and i am the president of the league of women voters for the pensacola bay area we are a non-partisan political organization which means we do not support or oppose particular candidates or parties as many of you know we worked very hard last year in 2020 with the election being a big part of what we did we registered voters and we help to educate eligible voters through our candidate forums publications and speaking to community groups but the work doesn't stop after the election we continue on and currently we are focused on what's happening in the state legislature which went into session earlier this month and i have a feeling our speakers for today are very interested in what's happening in tallahassee as well we are involved by writing letters making phone calls and soon we will be distributing a brochure twelve thousand copies of a brochure that we print every two years that lists the elected officials at the local level the state level and uh the national level that gives complete contact information for those individuals so if you are involved in an issue that um an elected official might be the person you need to contact you will have that information handy and ready to use i want to also invite you to a meeting that we are hosting this week sometimes we have a topic come up and it's not part of our our regular routine and we call that a hot topic session and on wednesday march 24th at 1 pm central time we will be able to enjoy the and get involved with a meeting about the restoration of rights it's very important to the league that's a project that we have been actively doing over the past year to encourage former felons returning citizens to vote and to help them along that way this meeting our speaker will be cecile schoon who is the first vice president of the league of women voters at the state level she has had uh she has a wealth of experience in her career she's worked with the aclu and the florida legal community to develop programs and establish incentives to help these returning citizens uh meet the challenges that they have and and eventually hope that that we will be able to include them in our voters all right um at this time i'd like to introduce you to uh who we have here this morning as part of our meeting this year we started a new program called partnerships and we are integrating a national league policy on diversity equity and inclusion into our work and we saw an opportunity if we could develop partnerships with other non-profit organizations and that's what we've been doing is teaming up with groups that share common goals and are willing to provide expertise and experience that will benefit both organizations for example in the during the general election time the amer african-american heritage society and the kappa alpha kappa alpha sorority joined us in hosting and moderating some of our forums for the candidates that were running for office so uh if there is anyone in the community that would like to know more about our partnership program please feel free to contact us if you're interested and today it's my honor to welcome ruthie christie the executive director of ecare which stands for every child a reader in a scandia she will be here to share some information about us with us about her program ecare is many roles in the community and and uh ruthie christie's background is a good fit for that she's relatively new to this position she believes that empowering children to love the process of learning is important and holds a master's degree in organizational psychology from the university of west florida ruthie's favorite children's book is the little blue truck because it teaches readers what we are when we are kind and respectful we are more likely to get help from others and my grandsons have this book and they love this book so i'll turn it over to you ruthie if you could take a few minutes and give us an overview of what your organization's doing and how we can get involved good morning yes thank you so much for having me just want to say thank you to the league of women voters and for all the work that you do in the community we're very grateful to be a partner and to get to share and collaborate in this way and a special thanks to mary louise for bringing us together in this virtual space uh it's been a fun one to try to navigate but yes happy first day of spring can you believe it we made we're coming around the corner and i'm very excited to share about ecare so we are every child a reader in escambia ecare has been part of our community since 2007 and our mission is to maximize children's potential through increased school readiness so the vision that we have is lofty but very simple that we want every child in our community to come to kindergarten ready to learn um and so the way that we do that is that we work specifically with high need pre-kindergarten students and their families and their teachers just to help get them ready we're pretty laser focused on the four-year-old space in our community and we've got a three-prong approach um to what we call project ready and so we do that through our reading pals program which i know some people on this call have participated and volunteered that's one-on-one mentoring where we match an adult with a pre-k student particularly in title 1 class room and they come read to them in person for an hour a week and of course this is in normal times we're allowed to do these things um but it's truly that one-on-one intervention it's a literacy mentorship then we also um work with educators we do provide educator support mostly in the form of supporting families so for those district teacher classrooms in particular we try to support the parents the caregivers by providing resources building home libraries things like that and then family engagement is where ecare has really taken wing really due out of necessity to the pandemic um because we know that at home is where children learn first and so we're very focused on building the capacity of parents families caregivers to feel empowered that they know how to do that and how to engage their children with meaningful robust conversation and and dialogue and that 30 million words initiative that we hear about so much in our community and the way we've been able to do that recently is by uh providing access to an app called ready rosy which is really a very cool platform it's it's you know an evidence-based tool that is typically utilized by school districts um because it does work hand in hand with teaching strategies with the software so that it curates playlists for parents and caregivers to see these modeled moments of everyday activities things you're doing with your kids anyway it doesn't require any extra tools or kits or you know special paper plates and scissors and glue all that fun stuff which is great but this is really geared toward the things you're already doing anyway and turning those into teachable moments for your children we are again focused on the pre-k space um so so that's been a huge push for us recently is getting this resource into the hands of families who have four-year-olds in their home so that they can best benefit from this truly evidence-based content um and so that's that's sort of how we do this work is those three prongs the mentoring for individual children family engagement focus and then also educator support we know that it's important i think on this call i'm probably preaching to the choir about why early learning is so important um we've seen a big shift in our community especially in the last few years to focus on that zero to five space because we know that kids who come in ready to learn at the kindergarten level see better outcomes at the third grade level which is tied to graduation rates and it makes sense right if you consider that behind all of that data there are individual children and stories that we're telling with those numbers we think that it's better to invest on the front end and put in time and care and and loving relationships and one-on-one attention when these kids are for so that they can build that love of learning i am previously and before this role i did work in a classroom um with three to six year olds i was in a montessori school is a wonderful experience and um what i saw out of that in my experience there was that there is no replacement for learning at home and what we see in our community is that families want to do that and they could use some help um in what does that look like and so that is what ecare is here for um why it's important to us is because not only you know everyone on our team and on our board do we we love kids and we want kids to be successful but we love our community and we want our community to be successful and those things go hand in hand together so i'm very excited to get to share the mission uh like you mentioned jane i'm new i have been a reading pal in the past as a volunteer um becoming and joining the ecare team just in january of this year and i cannot say enough great things about the work our organization has been doing i am very honored and humbled to get to step into this role and help lead that work now um and i would like to invite everyone to join us on this mission we are honorable to get kids ready for kindergarten and uh we would love to have your support and your help we are gearing up for what we hope to be business as usual in schools this fall where we have a goal of matching every title one pre-k student with a reading pal so whether that's volunteering your time every week to read to come in and read or if you like to box up books and send those home or if you would like to support our mission you can check out more about us at escambiareads.org that's our website and i'll be absolutely happy to answer any questions and talk about children's literature as you mentioned little blue truck is my my favorite children's book these days and and that is that's truly what it is we want to teach the love of learning because that stays with a kid for for the rest of their life and sets them up for success thank you so much ruthie doesn't that make you want to just go out and read a book to a child with a child thank you so much we appreciate you coming and sharing your information we are very fortunate today to welcome the education leaders for our area dr karen barber and dr tim smith are each uh in the first year of service as public school superintendents and um the responses and things i've heard in the community about both of you has been so positive and very productive and i as a retired teacher i am very excited about that um we have asked each of them to speak but before we get to that i'd like to introduce them to you dr karen barber from santa rosa school district has been an educator for 33 years she serves has served as a teacher school principal adjunct professor for the university of west florida and the last 12 years she was the director of federal programs just to mention a few of these federal programs that are very important uh one is djj support student support program it provides a successful transition of justice involved youth back into the school district dr barber has also worked with one family one year one home program a transitional housing program for families experiencing homelessness and and and she's spent much time focusing on early reading intervention programs that were implemented in all the elementary schools in the district to my topic okay dr barber is recognized for many of these collaboration efforts in the community and providing leadership in the in a form of president of the homeless coalition the kiwanis ymca arc santa rosa she is also past president and founder of santa rosa bridges out of poverty a 501c3 focused on building resources for children and families in the county her recognitions go on to include florida's native i'm sorry florida's innovative technology principal of the year uh university of west florida distinguished alumni award two two years she was received that department of children and family community partner of the year santa rosa chamber of commerce community leader of the year escarosa coalition on the homeless grassroots leadership award in 2013. and next i want to introduce to you dr tim smith escambia school district's first appointed superintendent and uh just a little byline the league of women voters was very very active in uh for many many years getting that on the ballot and in 2018 escambia county residents voted to switch from an elected superintendent to an appointed superintendent and dr smith is the first of those in that position he recognizes he's coming in with a strong foundation in escambia county and that has allowed him to lead the district in areas of closing achievement gaps and pushing student proficiency to new heights as stated by dr smith you said we must work for every student and we must be united in both our focus and our determination unity is essential to reaching our goals dr smith spent 31 years with the orange county public school system in orlando as a teacher a dean assistant principal and then 19 years of those years he was middle and high school principal finally his his last position was as executive director responsible for supervising 10 high schools and serving about 30 000 students he holds degrees

florida state grads dr smith is grateful to lead our school district he seeks for every student to have a safe positive and supportive learning environment and to go on to learn successfully and then become helpful productive citizens thank each of you for coming and we'd like to hear from dr barber first followed by dr smith thank you all right good morning i'm going to set my timer for 20 minutes here but if i start to go along jane please uh please uh prompt me i will i'm sure both tim and i could talk for uh for hours and hours about what's so important to us let me go ahead and share my screen there we go um jane can you see that i can all right very good thank you so much for the opportunity to share with you today i just want to start out by saying already you all have have shown an interest and support for our school district and for education in and i'm so glad you call yourselves the pensacola bay area because i i think that um when we divide ourselves by county lines or even uh cities or towns or we're we're we're um we're shortchanging the community and uh so it's i mentioned to you all earlier uh dr smith and i meet regularly um we also have marcus chambers who meets with us he's superintendent in okaloosa county and the more we can collaborate and communicate and just approach um opportunities and challenges together the better it is for all our students um dr smith and i will share students throughout the school year they'll move from from escambia county to santa rosa santa rosa to escambia county they're all our children and and so to work together and to have um a collaborative approach with the league of women voters is really um is really critical so i'll talk a little bit about how um we uh you do that i don't my screen is not advancing for some reason ah there we go um so uh this is our formal mission and vision for santa rosa county educating students for success success by providing a superior relevant education and of course our vision for our students is that they will be productive successful contributors to society this is our formal uh mission and vision when i took office one of the things that i shared with um at the oath of office but also with our uh our administrators and our school district is a little bit of an obsession that i've had since i was about three um i'm a catholic girl and my grandmother babysat me while i uh while my mom and dad both worked my dad worked in a steel mill and my mom um was a nurse and uh so grant my grandmother glowacki and i would sit in front of her black and white tv and uh being a catholic girl or both of us being catholic girls we were just fascinated with um president kennedy and so i have these vivid memories of watching um president kennedy his speeches the parades uh sadly the assassination and eventually the uh funeral procession for president kennedy and so what for my whole adult life i've continued to be fascinated by some of the things that were accomplished during his presidency um if you're around then you you probably remember we were in a space race with the russians and uh from that nassau was formed and there um there's this wonderful story about president kennedy walking down the halls of nasa and he sees a janitor mopping the floor and he walked up to the janitor and said well good morning sir what is your job and the custodian looked at the president right in the eye and said mr president my job is to put a man on the moon and i love that story because i think the more we're clear about what our mission is what we're supposed to be doing and that everyone who who who works or partners with a school district every individual that either drives the bus or serves the food or fixes something that's uh broken that takes care of computers that is in the front office classroom teachers every individual associated with the school district whether they're partners or employees our mission needs to be teaching children loving children because if you don't love children you don't need to be in this business this doesn't need to be your vocation uh and preparing them for a successful future so um i i continue to share that story throughout our school district and as i'm doing presentations because i want people to know it's that simple we want to teach our children love them and prepare them for a successful future and everything that we do should be geared towards that outcome so it's about kids and there they are and of course that graduation and moving on to uh college and career so some of the goals um that we've established that we're working on in our school district uh increasing our graduation rate when i initially we are actually now at 90.3 graduation rate in santa rosa we were at 88.9 and uh that increased to 90.3 however um it was a strange year last year so there were some assessments that our students um did not take uh and that and and some of those assessments uh students must pass in order to graduate and some of those requirements for last year due to covet were were um were waived so uh i i don't want us to get secure with that 90.3 um i want us to be at 100 graduation rate and uh if we're focused on that mission of preparing students for a successful future increasing that graduation rate is is critical and we'll be doing that through a lot of focus on readiness just like ruthie talked about with ecare that readiness is so critical because we start working on graduation the minute those students and their families start engaging with our school district and also really working on our industry certification and opportunities for students to have multiple pathways to graduation and then life beyond high school managing our fiscal practices to increase our financial condition ratio when i started um as superintendent our uh our financial ratio was at 3.09 that is really low and so i worked with our faculty with our our senior staff um to really look at how we are spending our our dollars our fixed dollars and then also to bring in additional grant dollars that are available competitive grant dollars and so right now um in the past four months we've been able to increase our our financial condition ratio to 6.7 i'm proud to say and give a 3.35 raise percent raise to our our teachers and our staff and our blue collar employees so we're moving in the right direction when it comes to fiscal management and uh continuing to be very cautious and careful about how we're spending our funds but making sure that we are using those to attract uh recruit and retain high quality teachers and that kind of goes into the next goal establishing and um we have an equity committee that we've established and i i want to thank penny because penny um a member of the league of women voters is uh is participating in our equity and cultural sensitivity committee it is a very very important work and it seems as though there are many organizations right now that are really recognizing and engaging in this work when it comes to equity and diversity and certainly as a school district we need to do that there are several goals that we have for this committee one is to recruit and retain diverse teaching staff so we'll be breaking into subcommittees and one will be focusing on the recruitment and retention of diverse teaching staff so that we provide our students what we call windows and mirrors first of all so that our our diverse student population can see themselves and their teachers and their leaders you can't be what you can't see so we want to we want to provide our our students with mirrors so that they can see themselves in in a successful future uh and the the windows are so that you can see into other cultures and understand uh people from diverse backgrounds with diverse opinions we'll also be looking at the instructional practices how are we making sure that the instructional practices we have provide equity and opportunity for our students so we'll be looking at some of the ways in which our students are eligible for honors classes ap classes dual enrollment to see where do we have some of our students that are perhaps minority students that are underrepresented in those programs do we have a fair representation in our gifted programs and so really looking at how are we promoting and having high expectations for all our students and where have we created barriers that we need to remove so that our students have access to high quality education the next one is to expand communication with families and communities through our social media and also family engagement and in our community and i was happy to hear ruthie talk about the importance of family engagement and absolutely you know our approach should be to work with the family they are our children's first teacher and uh our our students spend only a small portion of their day with us the rest is with family so to help increase a parents or a guardian's capacity to work with their children and support their children one of that one of those ways needs to be through communication of course but then also providing those opportunities and that goes into my next slide create a family opportunity center in every community this is one of my big goals and this will take many years but our family opportunity center i hope to have one um in every community and eventually in every school and that community has diverse needs we have um schools there are 34 school campuses in santa rosa from the jay community which is very rural uh to the navara and the gulf breeze community which of course are our uh our beach communities uh and have a higher socio-economic um average uh to the milton and east milton communities where we have some of our highest um poverty uh communities and and situations so each community opportunity center will be based on the individual unique needs of that community and there will be four major parts of that one is is to really provide our families with opportunities to engage and volunteer and support the school and that would be for volunteer organizations like league of women voters what are the ways in which you can contribute and support to the success of the students and the school the second way is to do what ruthie was talking about that family engagement so we are building the capacity of families to support their children's learning the third area is really for that that uh the adults in the household their own capacity building so perhaps they want to learn how to read maybe they want to become a first-time home buyer maybe there are financial literacy classes that would help the family become stable and self-sufficient so that's the third way and the fourth way is really if there are other necessities that the family may need maybe we need to make sure there is a washer and dryer in the opportunity center then maybe they need to find out about ways in which they can obtain supplemental food housing assistance uh whatever kinds of maybe they have a uh a they want to work with career source escarosa and find out about opportunities for employment and so uh those four main pathways through the opportunity centers we hope to be able to create the next goal is really really to achieve a one-to-one device student ratio so right now in our school district it's been very critical to have laptops to have ipads devices so that students can learn whether they're at school in a brick and mortar setting or whether they're working remotely perhaps they're they're learning all of their uh all of their class and their schedule is remote learning or virtual learning or maybe it's a student who has to quarantine and so they take their device home to learn and have a seamless transition right now our school district is about three students to one device so we need to increase uh until we have a one-to-one device not that students will never use that device or tool that educational tool together in a group collaboratively we certainly want to uh engage in group collaborating collaborative kinds of learning activities but there may be in the future a need where each student needs that that one device and we want to be able to be ready for that and the last focus is that developing a five-year strategic plan with community input so we'll start engaging in that work this summer and have um town hall meetings uh really bringing in interested uh folks like yourselves to sitting on those committees to provide us with some input and some feedback and uh and really look long range uh we've got a variety of of interests over the next five years we can't implement them all at one time but we need to have a pathway to be able to get to that full year uh that full implementation in five years so those are some of the goals that i've um i hope to accomplish a few of our demographics right now we have an enrollment of almost 28 500 students and although we took a slight dip in enrollment this year if you've driven through santa rosa county you have seen the development that is going on everywhere so we are in the midst of really planning for that growth we have a new school east bay k-8 that will open up um this school is uh in the navarre area um and it will open up this august so we've already hired the principal uh we'll be hiring the assistant principal for that school um at our april 6 board meeting and uh so uh we just uh our school board has just approved the attendance zones for east bay k-8 and so we're really excited about about having this school in the south end and right now it's it's critical that we open up that school because so many of our schools in the south end of our county are are are at the brim and uh you know they are they are at capacity and so uh east bay k-8 will allow us to be able to lower the the enrollment numbers at those schools to accommodate for all that new growth that is coming in the pace area in uh school year 2023 24 we'll be opening up wallace lake k-8 it will probably not remain that name but right now that's where the location is wallace lake road uh so we'll be opening up that k-8 which is just north of pace another um school that we hope to open up um i don't have a definitive start date yet we're still acquiring the property for this uh some of you may be familiar with um with a lockland technical college and so we are hoping to open up a south end technical school and then of course a north end high school so those are all in the planning stages some of our current projects we've got about 64 career academies at our middle schools and high schools from cyber security to construction to a teacher academy all of our career academies focus on high paying high demand jobs that are relevant to our area i mentioned lachlan technical college and jane mentioned our one family one year one home project which is a the first of its kind in the state of florida and now there are five other counties that have a one family one year one home project um soon um we'll be on cnn they contacted us and want to be able to tell the story of of this transitional housing program and then about one of our other projects that you may have heard about is our steam transformation it is a k-12 transformation bringing science technology engineering arts and mathematics into to each classroom every classroom in our school district and really what that's about is not so much the content is about how we teach and we learn through critical thinking collaboration communication and creativity future projects include a default department of defense stem education grant 1.5 million hopefully we'll hear some good news about that grant soon and that will focus on middle schools and health related stem occupations we're working with on the board of county commissioners and our economic development office on a workforce development triumph grant we're hoping to be able to convert the old santa rosa medical center on stuart street into additional space for for more career and workforce development we're hoping to bring a helicopter maintenance program as well as a water treatment facility management training program the first of its kind in the state of florida we want to develop a stem ecosystem and dr smith and marcus chambers and i have talked about that that brings together all the entities in a community uh business industry k-12 post-secondary um um his uh let's say um um goodness i just lost my words for a second um the institute for human and machine cognition zoos uh any any entity that has something to do with stem navy federal is very interested in being part of that ecosystem as well we're doing some work in algebra one um some acts in research because algebra one and passing that end of course exam for students is a huge barrier to graduation so we're working on identifying how we're going to increase our students um math identity sometimes students will tell you i'm not good at math i i i can't do math that's not my thing well we can all do math and so we're trying to identify where we need to back up and it's probably all the way to pre-k where we need to make sure that our students see themselves as competent when it comes to math we're also working on preparing for an application and i know dr smith will be doing this too um with um some covid related uh grants we've got another 14 million dollars that we need to prepare to spend on covert related activities a lot of that will do have to do with uh intervention and providing services to our students who throughout this pandemic have lost some ground and then another reading intervention grant both dr smith and i will be engaged in that work uh and have been fortunate thanks to senator broxton uh there will be five counties in the state of florida who get these funds and uh so we'll be working again to to figure out how we provide intervention that is evidence-based to our students and prepare them um you know for the next grade level but help them to see themselves as readers and reading as being very important i'm going to wrap up here very quickly uh because i think i'm about 21 minutes right now um as far as cova goes uh our um our positivity rate in santa rosa is going down as a community we were at about 30 percent test positive rate as a as not as a school district but a county we're now under 8 which is very uh was is very exciting um that hopefully we're getting past uh the worst of the pandemic during this time we have ninety percent of our students are in brick and mortar instruction and ten percent are full-time or virtual so we're working very closely with our department of health and the board of county commissioners and emergency operations they've done a great job of making sure that our employees that wanted to be vaccinated are getting vaccinated so uh even though we're in such challenging times i think um the pandemic has created opportunities for collaboration and for support and really focusing on the future and so being able to share with the league of women voters and to have you all engaged with our equity committee is just really exciting work um i know that we'll be sending out the survey that you've given us uh that will focus on um some of our students and are their social emotional needs and that is certainly uh critical and something that we're spending a lot of time on right now with mental health counselors and making sure students know and families know how they can ask for support if they need it so i appreciate the opportunity to share and i'll stop sharing my screen now and but look forward to some questions later thank you dr barber and we'll move right away to dr tim smith escambia county superintendent okay i'm sharing my screen i hope everyone can see that um want to just thank the league of women voters for this opportunity to to share today about escambia county and want to just thank dr barber too for her partnership she and mr chambers and i have had great opportunity to collaborate during the past few months and the the partnership we have is is really terrific to have when we we talk about education in the panhandle to the the western part of the panhandle so now now karen i will say i really was intrigued with the story about the custodial employee and at nasa so i may steal your story because that was pretty good you go right ahead thank you and and ruthie uh we of course had an opportunity to meet and uh you and your team have so much uh to to bring to the families in the community really thankful for for you and and all the work that your organization is doing and you know as you're speaking uh you i share i share very deeply some of those ideas about early early literacy and early childhood education so very excited i want to go ahead and begin and gonna going to take a little different route than um my powerpoint starts out with because i had the opportunity to share with the state board of education recently on behalf of superintendents just a few items and i thought it might be helpful to share some of those concepts that that i presented first of all what i what i shared with was as superintendents in the state of florida we were very supportive of the concept that the governor has in his proposed budget which really is he what he did is he [Music] really came up with a design to minimize the impact of lower student enrollments because that's been a difficult piece that we've had in school districts is declining enrollment as a result of covid people have found out other opportunities other possible ways of having their their student educated so some of our district enrollments have gone down that's been a challenge and the governor and the commissioner of education thankfully very very very helpful of them in their their decision making throughout the year have taken steps where we were not suffering from low enrollment as it relates to our budgets so i can tell you in escambia county we were embracing for a four million dollar shortfall in this current semester while the the governor and the commissioner took a a position where they were able to spread out some finances and cushion us where we didn't have to take that take that fall financially so we're very very appreciative of that and what the governor's budget does is he proposed an increase in per pupil funding to offset lower lower enrollment numbers so very very thankful for that and we we appreciate that support we we also uh have been encouraged through executive order to really try to get as many kids to come back to the brick and mortar to come back to our campuses and so those initiatives have been very helpful as well and in fact i i attribute some of the return to our school from that that executive order because we were we were very aggressive in our response to that and and the communication we had with families really encouraging them to get back to the campuses and the reason for that is we ran some numbers where the difference in grade performance just looking at our first quarter uh report card grades and our second four quarter report card grades where there were there was a difference between students who were on campus and students who were off campus to to the betterment of those who were on campus they the discrepancy lean towards their their favor so we know that students are learning more when they are on campus now that's not to say there's a certain percentage of students who do well on remote learning that's that that is the case for some of our students but collectively we see those trends are quite strong where being back on campus has a positive difference in in performance so the the other piece i wanted to share too is that in the proposed budget there was 10 million dollars of increased funding recommended that the legislature approve for mental wellness and we really applaud that applaud that stance we know it's been tough on our kids it's just been it's been different and some of our our students their days have been disjointed uh where they may started off in remote learning come back to brick and mortar but then they might have had a student in class who had coveted and they we had to contact trace so students who sit around that student might have missed two weeks of school and then if a teacher fell into that situation students might have had two weeks of substitutes coming in and out and so just this this lack of consistency for so many of our students can be very difficult can be very challenging so having more money to support the the the needs for our students in that social emotional and mental wellness is is greatly appreciated um i want to want to make one more note too before i i really jump into my powerpoint is that in in escambia county our transportation costs are funded in above 50 i believe about 56 percent of the budgetary dollars cover our transportation costs so we have to pull dollars from elsewhere to bridge that gap part of the reason for that is we're very particular on hazardous bus for out conditions what that means is if we have a student who lives within a two-mile radius of the school but their way to to school is not very safe there might not be sidewalks or whatever the case is we're going to bust those students and so we we increase that and we're going to err on the side of safety so we have a lot of bus routes that fall into this hazardous walking category and um the other thing in the scan via that we do is we have a lot of school choice so if a student wants to go to another uh school that has let's let's say a particular career academy that that they're interested in we run what we call trunk routes so we have routes going maybe across the county or north or south or east or west wherever the the needs are so we we have a lot of additional busing for that so the reason i mention all this is because the hazardous hazardous conditions is we're really we're really trying to provide safe safe path pathways to schools and as we develop especially in the northern part of our district that infrastructure is really critical for when new building is taking place for us to be cognizant of the need for sidewalks the need for crossing lights over over large intersections and busy intersections and so we we certainly want our community to be aware and cognizant of that that need so we have safe pass pathways to school so i want to jump into the powerpoint at this time i want to start with saying i came into a district with a strong foundation i want to congratulate mr malcolm thomas on the work he did and and thank him for our transition and for the five outstanding board members that we have that form our board and our incredible employees and and as i say that i i want to make note that it is amazing what our teachers have done as well as our support employees our maintenance employees our our administrators covet has been nothing like we've experienced in the past in the past and so it principles and assistance principles their contact tracing it they just lose hours and hours of of instructional leadership time because they are are attending to these needs and and they're prioritizing uh safety of our our students and our our staff members and i really applaud them for doing that that's a pressing need we we have to more than anything make sure our our staff and our students are safe and so our administrators have done a great job and it's taken a lot of time but they're they're vigilant about that and i really applaud them for that our teachers i walk into a classroom and there's four monitors sometimes around a teacher's desk and they're they're talking with their kids online and while they're instructing the kids in the classroom in the dynamics are absolutely incredible of what they are doing but what our teachers have done is they have just taken a deep dive into it and they will not give up they will not stop and they collaborate and they share and they've improved their practice in this coveted world throughout the year and i just tip my hat to to the educators uh not only in this but in all of the state of florida it's been incredible to see the heart and the grit that our our teachers have had and then our custodial employees they're they're working so hard to keep classrooms clean to provide the personal protection equipment as are many of our our district level employees so it's been a great team effort so when we look at this gambia we look at where the foundation is and where we go in the future and so there's been strong academic performance in the 2018-19 school year that was the last accountability cycle 15 schools increased a letter grade tremendous surge in academic performance there so our job is to keep that going and even push the trajectory to to higher levels the district has well managed operations uh human resources and finances really our finances are have been have been really managed well and a keen eye to that has been uh focused on financial stability that that can be very challenging at times and especially when you have an uncertainty that exists and as i said earlier we thought at one point we were going to have to find four million dollars and deal with that shortfall but thank goodness estate came through and helped us out so so there are many good things that exist in the county um also some great blessings in our community i was so excited when i came to escambia and i have to say i'm just so honored to be in in my role uh leading the district and to be a part of this incredible community and i quickly learned the heart and the soul that our our community has for our schools and our our kids and so i i i saw that the half cent sales tax for capital dollars where we can renovate and build schools has been voted for a number of times and passed a number of times here in in the district the escambia children's trust was just voted in this past november 61 of our residents in the district in the county voted for that that's such a strong statement on the the heart and the care our community has for children the studer institute and achieve escambia working to together to focus on that early childhood development having the brain bags go into hospitals where they're given to new mothers and really bringing in experts i i was able to hear dr hungerford from harvard expert on the achievement gap talk about the the importance of brain development in the ages of zero to two and as you think about it premature births often a child will go into an incubator and there's incredible growth in weeks well if you think about that that doesn't necessarily stop those first two years there's incredible incredible capacity development in the brain and so the community looking at that and trying to provide options or excuse me opportunities but the knowledge of that dr hungerford said there are five steps that can be taken by parents five practices that just create great growth in brain development and it also postures students to be ready for kindergarten so i'm really excited about that drive in our community and we just have so many caring leaders and government officials and and people throughout our community in the military and in churches but as i said earlier very very fortunate to have dedicated teachers and support employees administrators and in our our five board members i i have to say i i've just really enjoyed working with our board members and they have this really strong common thread and that is each one of our our talented board members they care deeply about children and they care deeply about our schools and our children learning in schools and i am so thankful for the heart and dedication that they bring every every day to the escambia county school district we also have tremendous parents our pta has had such a tough year because they want to volunteer so bad in our schools and we've had it been closed to volunteers and uh that's been that's been hard for them so they just can't wait to get back into to our schools and to provide those opportunities so where are we going as as a district in in escambia county really three points that i like to to highlight first we want to increase our student proficiency rates where our students are are learning more and more the second thing is we the second point is we need to close the achievement gap specifically between our black and white students there is a 34 achievement gap between black and white students in english language arts and there's a 35 gap in math that's in our district now the district i came from wasn't much different as far as the achievement gap and the state of florida that those metrics are 29 percent achievement gap in math and 29 in english language arts so what's happened is and this is a national issue we have to talk about this we have to address this and it is time for us to eliminate that gap the reality is when you look at the numbers and let me step back a second because i want to add this piece as well i recently had a conversation with a research group national national company research group and i posed the question i said can you tell me one school district in the united states of america that has closed the achievement gap between black and white students this is what i heard no no but we do have some school districts in the country that have made progress i think that that's an encouraging thought but the reality is we live in the united states of america in 2021 and we've had this we've had this this is not a new achievement gap and it's persisted and we haven't solved it we haven't gone after it in a way that's made a difference now i can tell you the district i came from just about every time we talked about goals and vision closing the achievement gap was was the number one topic but the question is why is a nation is our educational system good for a number of kids but it's not good for a number of kids it's a condition that has to be addressed it has to be dealt with and we have to eliminate that achievement gap our school system should be effective for every child and so in escambia county our our job is to close that achievement gap and make sure every student receives a quality education and has a tremendous future awaiting from for them because of the opportunities that are available to them when they graduate now for us to do that that's a that's as i said the research company told me there wasn't one that they knew of that had closed the achievement gap that's that's a a herculean effort but it's time to do it and and there's no i i've been in education over 30 years i don't want to wait any longer it's time now and i think when we as a country put our our hearts and our minds together and our our drive together we can do great things and we can't we can accomplish monumental hurdles but we have to be unified to do that it can't just be me i'm not i don't have all the ideas i i'm not capable of doing that by myself i need to have all of our district employees on board with that i need all of our community leaders i need all of our residents to be on board with that i need this state i need universities we have to be united as a society to to eliminate this achievement gap and and that's that's in a core component of the vision the mission that i bring is to provide a safe positive nurturing environment every day for our our students where they're learning at high levels they're graduating and they go forth they use their learning to be helpful productive citizens and that's important that we teach our students that there's a purpose why we're learning all of these standards in these subjects it's because we want to equip you we want to strengthen you to give back to your community through your job through being a great family member through being a volunteer through being a community advocate in whatever the role that they're called to be in we want them to have a focus on on on doing what's good and right to help communities and to help others so when i speak about our our vision and our mission uh i really i really say it's kind of a 20 000 foot view at this particular time because we have entered a strategic planning process and we currently are gathering input uh on that on that process from our district employees and we are about step step two into that and we eventually will be asking community uh for community input but we want to take that and then we want to shape in the vision and the mission and we want to fine-tune it and we want to have pillars of goals where we focus our efforts so i say my vision and mission are 20 000 foot because it's a launching spot but what it really needs to and i go back to that unity piece it needs to be our vision our mission where all the community owns this we we jointly own it it's our school system and after all residents who don't have children pay they pay our residents are paying for our school system so i want our our citizens to be excuse me that's my my phone i want our our residents to be proud of their school district i want our residents to feel that it is their school district and i think that's really really important so there's a host of ways as i'll try to wrap up here in the in the next minute or two uh there's a host of ways to to do this um and how we're going to do this kindergarten readiness expand preschool opportunities support parents with uh children beginning at age zero we've talked we've been uh designing a number of pilot programs uh looking at community partnership schools uh that that's a concept at weiss elementary where we have three-year-old children in a classroom on campus and so we've been talking about how we can expand that concept looking at new funding streams we must have outstanding instruction great staff development and we must have strong measures and accountability in place so the last piece that i i share with you is that you are you are needed we need to to be a great united community where we are doing great work for kids and so your support your advocacy that you give has made such a great difference in our community and we need you to keep doing the great work that that you've been doing and we thank you for all of your your support and uh we just want to emphasize the last line on that power point when we talk about reaching all of our kids and having our system be effective for every single child who comes through we must we can and we will thank you thank you dr smith uh i know we have many questions at this point i'm not sure who can hear me but um i would like to turn it over back to mary louise and let's hear some of the questions from our audience sure we we do have a considerable number of questions um first of all this first question is for dr smith um and it's a long one so bear with me we are delighted to have you as superintendent you bring with you many talents and experiences that you can share with us here in escambia county here's our question in orange county during the 2019 2020 school year there were two school arrests per 1000 students whereas here in escambia county during the same period our arrest rate was 9.3 per 1000 students what factors do you think contributed to orange county in having such a low arrest rate and what can we do here to help you produce a similar result and increase the use of civil citations perhaps which may include appropriate family or individual counseling community service and restitution it's a long question and i can read the second part of it if you need me to i i think i think i um i'm fine with uh with the question uh as as far as understanding the the components of that um the first thing i share with you is i've already been in meeting with a state attorney one of our juvenile judges on in our the individual who heads up the probation services for the district as well as a couple of our law enforcement officials who uh or law enforcement leaders who who oversee [Music] the school resource officer program and and that was the heart of the decision of the discussion was civil citations and how are we using using those um one of the the big focus points in that conversation was about truancy issues because we we do have a number of students who are excessively absent and what happens is that works up to a level where it's it violates all kinds of laws and requirements and so it ends up ends up going to court and so that that's a whole piece into itself so let me circle back to orange county and one of the reasons that the the rate was lower there a number of years ago there was an initiative to look at trying to lower the arrest rate and what was happening is things were just flowing as as as our resources were in place and so the student did something that was in in an extreme category of behavior often what would happen is the school resource officer would arrest a student and take them off to the juvenile detention center so the district leadership and this really came from our superintendent dr barbara jenkins an incredible leader the idea surfaced of having a police department for the district and that actually was formed it is in place today where there is a police officer for basically a region of schools and so what they do is they work with the law enforcement agencies and the sros and they're able to create a dynamic where they can intervene and they can work with the law enforcement officers with the a big focus on holding students accountable working with the school but not escalating to an arrest level and so i think that's one of the the areas that made a big difference in orange that's that concept is uh really an important concept to to look at we don't want 14 year old kids having an arrest record that that sometimes that has to happen when extreme extreme behavior happens and especially in the violent arena because we do have to have safe schools but there are ways to use things such as civil citation to minimize that okay thank you so much the next question is for both dr barber and dr smith so we'll start with dr barber um recognizing that the school resource officers have to balance law enforcement responsibilities with their role to help create more positive relationships between students and law enforcement detail for us your expectations for the persons who hold these positions and if you could please include such factors as the selection process including considerations such as diversity and equity and the training program for these officers and we'd like to know also if the school districts have no input into the selection training or evaluation how do you propose to make this process more of a collaborative one with the sheriff and or police chief so dr barber over to you thank you mayor louise can you hear me i had some technical issues during dr smith's uh presentation right we're good yes i'm gonna try to take some of those additional ones of you out but i'm i won't do it until you're done speaking yeah yeah my internet left for a while and so i was trying to join from two of my phones and then i have a second laptop so for a while you you probably saw multiple karen barbers there but uh um that your bandwidth is low so if you cut out we'll we'll just let dr smith answer until you can get logged back in no problem okay thank you so we have a terrific relationship with our our sheriff's department and our school resource officers you may know that after marjory stoneman douglas uh their law was passed so that we must have safe schools and that includes funds for mental health of course it also included funds to harden our schools so that we created single points of entry to ensure that our schools were safe and that's they were secure and we knew who was on our campuses it also requires that we have law enforcement present during any school related activities whether it's during the school day or after school or at night and so um i have to say that about 24 years ago uh i was an assistant principal at holland of our middle school and bob johnson who was our current sheriff was my school resource officer so he and i worked very closely together and and i joke that um i raised uh sheriff johnson and you're welcome he is a he's an excellent excellent sheriff for for our county and um he uh he and i work very closely together even before i became superintendent the relationship was great and so we very quickly made sure that we had law enforcement officers um at on all of our school campuses pre-k through um our technical college level as far as the selection process that hasn't been something that um to my knowledge we've had put in but uh having been a school resource officer himself i can tell you that sheriff johnson has done an amazing and a very effective job at um at selecting the sheriff's deputies who would be in that um in those positions um it's now saying my internet is unstable can you hear me still mary louise yes speaking okay okay very good uh so the philosophy and the approach that we take with our school resource officers so they're not just there to um ensure um that you know anybody who is violating the law or violating one of our school board policies or of our coder student con is handled in a punitive fashion they become part of the fabric of that school campus we want those students to see law enforcement as as a as a as a member of our school community and uh so they're involved on a level of building relationships and helping students feel safe and faculty feel safe so that should we have to address an issue of safety or bullying or any other type of violation that that we have the relationships in place already and the great communication when with our students who are justice involved youth our law enforcement our school resource officers know who those students are but they are not there just to make sure you know that or to catch them should they they violate their probation they are there to be a support for that student and so that's really the approach that we take that they are there to support students they are a resource for our students and our faculty and and that culture of collaboration and um that culture and climate that we create uh that this is a uh we are focused on supporting students and supporting our faculty and staff um so that they're all successful um that that's the kind of proactive approach that we take resource officers um they are under the leadership of lieutenant bobby samples and uh so uh it is it is constantly a collaborative problem-solving approach that we take with them that i think has served us extremely well okay thank you so much dr barber over to you dr smith well we have um a group that we call refer to them as guardians and we hire them within our district to supplement the school resource officer program so our school resource officers are present in our secondary schools most of our elementaries have the the guardians that we hire so we we have a two-fold program there and the guardian program has been very successful we we've uh had the sros uh in the secondary level and that seems to be working fine haven't had any uh really major red flags surface on on that implementation of the school resource officer program of course we have two entities we have the sheriff's department and we have the city of pensacola depending upon where the school is zoned i had a great opportunity to meet with sheriff simmons about a month ago he and his team and very he is very pro schools supporting schools having a safe school environment he uh he is a strong supporter of the school resource officer program and so i think we're in a really good situation uh where maybe even in the future we can get more school resource officers it's what happens is you can get into some funding issues because um there has to be adequate funds on both sides because we we share the cost of that through the law enforcement agency and the school district so um we both both entities have to have the funding to add school resource officers i haven't haven't seen a concern about the um or certainly haven't heard any concerns about the diversity or of our our safety personnel and we we take control of the guardian hiring so that's all that's all in-house so that piece we we have 100 control whereas with the sro we we do rely on on the law enforcement agency to they they do the hiring and they do the evaluation of the employees so it's important to have really good relationships very positive very fluid open communication based relationships with those law enforcement agencies and i feel i feel pretty good about that um in fact i feel really good about that um with our meeting with sheriff uh simmons i was we just really um had had a a great great conversation a great dialogue and i think he and i see uh the sro in a very similar light and i think it's going to be a positive program for us for many years look forward to meeting the pensacola police department chief who is going to be hired in the future so we'll see who that is but we certainly want to have a great relationship with pensacola pd as well and we're assuming that the um the sros get different training depending upon which school they're in right so the elementary school sro would have much different training than the high school sro are we right in that well there certainly is a common language amongst the sros where they have some training that pertains to all all levels i i think that probably varies from region to region uh to to how detailed it gets in differentiating between the elementary and the secondary there there are different programs that sros implement at at the elementary level so previous district i worked in we called it the dare program right and so that's pretty well known program our elementary stude sros would be trained in that in delivering that as opposed to a high school sro they wouldn't be involved in the dare program so so you do get some programmatical variances there on on the training for the sros okay thank you and this next question is again for both of you so we'll start with dr barber um said net sed net is a multi-agency network for students with emotional slash behavioral disabilities that serves the child functioning poorly in the home school or community due to alcohol drug abuse or mental health problems it was active in its gambian santa rosa county several years ago do you have a current field representative in our area now yeah we do we do have a representative and we work closely with them we also work very closely with um our cdac counselors uh and our m flat counselors uh and both of those organizations as well as lakeview um work with us when it comes to behavioral health so we have um an additional counselors have been brought on that are mental health counselors uh through some of our cares act dollars so we have counselors trained mental health counselors licensed mental health counselors that are on all of our school campuses and though that those counseling um uh services are available to again our military connected students our other students who are on campus or who may be learning virtually so we have telehealth services available for mental health counseling uh as well as uh through our our devices or laptops our mental health counselors are able to work with our students then we have through lakeview um a mobile response team so uh that if we really have uh students that are are in a critical a crisis uh we work with the families do an assessment and then work uh for uh continued behavioral health services or additional assessment and treatment for those individuals with support for the family so sudden it's very important to to our schools and we have a rather large exceptional student education department and we also have a student services department and between the the two groups said net comes in to be very very helpful resources are important and being able to provide what is needed for our students in some of our programs is is really critical i i think when you look at what some of our students are are facing in some of the supports they need we we need we need all those help we can get we can we need all this support from sednet we need all the expertise we can pull together because some of our kids have some some very challenging challenging issues so we will we have quite a range of exceptional student education services that we provide as dr barber said we also use lakeview and we have schools with different programs some some are pretty intense programs that we have to to best meet those those student needs that we have okay and the next question is also for both of you but uh well i've got you dr smith i'm going to make you talk some more it says uh in this question for both superintendents how will you help ensure that students who are members of the lgbtq community are included in your non-discrimination included in anti-bill anti-bullying policies and are able to form student organizations without retribution well i think that goes back to the core of really one of the the core components of of the mission i shared earlier and that's to have a safe nurturing and encouraging environment for for all of our kids and so however a um some of the issues surrounding this topic come up the bottom line is every single child is important and precious to us and kids have different backgrounds different cultures different unique attributes that they bring with them and it really actually speaks to i'm going to digress here just a moment it really does speak to the complexity of what a teacher has to do is have to teach you know class for students often at the high school level you're looking at 25 students who have very different backgrounds different learning styles learning different ways and they have to bring them all together to learn all the standards and so sometimes we i think miss that the true complexity that exists for a teacher there's really quite no other profession like a classroom teacher but in with that is that whole philosophy of every child is unique and special and and we're we have lots of similarities but we also have lots of differences so it doesn't matter what those differences are every child needs to be safe they need to be respected they need to have uh if if there are issues that are raising concern for them and they're not feeling comfortable at school we we need to support the the student so it's it's really to me the the way a school should be run and the way an environment should be every student regardless of their their sexual orientation their gender identification their religious beliefs their cultural background whatever the case is every child should feel safe should be encouraged to be respected and should be welcomed have that welcoming embracing feeling at school dr barbour your turn same question the work we're doing with this equity committee is really making sure that our our practices are our policies but our day-to-day practices and culture within our schools is one that is inclusive uh and that is also sensitive to the diverse needs of all of our students so we have school board policies and our code of student conduct that prohibit discrimination with within a school environment uh and then we really have to develop that culture um we have uh uh many of our schools are what we call capturing kids heart schools in which we are realist really establishing what we call a social contract in which we we make sure that our students and our staff agree about how we're going to treat each other and the students are part of creating that that social contract you'll see one on on a school-wide basis you'll see social contracts in every classroom and if you walk in one of our classrooms one of the student representatives will come up and say hey i need you to see our social contract and that social contract is on the wall and it's it's a as a visitor you you sign it and agree to this is how we are agreeing to treat each other with respect with without arguing with uh and so um every contract is very unique to that classroom but the whole approach is that we're being inclusive we're being supportive um and we're making sure that you know you can't teach you can't capture a student's mind until you capture their heart so capturing kids hearts and also our positive behavior programs that we have in schools is really focused on on positive behaviors and when we have a student who um is doing something or a staff member who who isn't uh perhaps making the right choice when it comes to how they treat others uh are our approaches to say uh first we have to teach that person or or that student um what are the expectations here at this school in this school district and and what do we need to do to help that individual learn how to have those positive respectful relationships uh with other students uh and then everything of course is on a case-by-case basis so as we work especially with our lgbtq community and students who identify with another gender or have a different sexual orientation we want we want to make sure that they understand that they're respected that they can ask for help um and that as um needs arrives or an issue arises that that we address that and that we work with the families of our students as well to make sure that we're receptive and we're listening and we're we're addressing those needs as they come up and then of course there are federal laws that require um those actions to be taken too uh even when it comes to the access of restrooms uh and uh and and so what we wanna make sure that um we are we're aware of the law we understand our responsibility when it comes to providing those students and staff with a safe environment and and we continue to address um issues as they occur very very quickly okay thank you and this next question is just for you dr barber one of our members would like to know if you will have staff reconsider or take every opportunity to include students who have had past discipline problems or behavior incidents and not not permitted to be admitted to the career academies sure i'm i'm not aware of that practice ever going on in santa rosa if it did it certainly was not in the recent um recently uh what we're trying to do especially um so about four years ago i established our our support program for justice involved youth and this may have been students who weren't in a juvenile justice facility it may have been students who had a civil citation that were on probation or went through team court and our whole focus has been through that four years to engage those students especially at the middle school and high school level in career academies so i can tell you in the last four years that has not been a barrier for our students what we try to do through case management and through opportunities both in the classroom and with our career academies is to show them let's keep you in school this um what your the decision that you made that got you in some trouble does not define who you are and doesn't define your future uh so uh our career academies have been one of the ways in which we have helped engage those students and and encourage them to stay in school and and finish high school and then move on to college and career okay thank you the next question is for both of you so we'll begin with dr smith although a focus on pre-k is certainly key to success we can't forget those kids in middle and high school that have had challenges along the way what is your intention regarding dropout prevention for these older students well the the first thing we have to do is we have to thoroughly track the progress of our students and what can happen is students can fall off off-pace and if if we don't pick that up and we don't know that that's taking place it can persist and then we have a student in a far worse condition academically than had we picked that up quickly so the first piece is tracking then the second piece is what are we going to do about that if there is a problem if we have a struggling student so one of the things i've been uh speaking with about our with our principles at the high school level is we need to start tracking ninth graders at the end of the first quarter we we need to know if we have ninth graders who are struggling but then we have to craft appropriate intervention programs and pull support and resource to them and and we we need to provide oversight for those students so that they're not continually just going on and on and on without doing uh what needs to be done for them to learn successfully so ideally um you we add we had people and we have guidance counselors who who can track track performance the reality of that is though the funding for our guidance counselors is we have about one counselor for every 400 kids at the secondary level that's that's a a great challenge for our counselors and that's where mentors can help out tremendously because they can provide insight they can provide one-on-one contact with with the students in just providing that extra set of eyes and oversight and i've seen that pay off for kids in the past and i know we've have a lot of mentors in our community who who they would love to be back on campus we've had that closed down for covid so that's an important piece that we need to get back into into play i will tell you we're looking at a pilot program for kids who are struggling with motivation a lot of times our kids you can you can have dialogue with them and say why why are you not doing well and we know with our teenagers we're typically um with a struggling teenager we might get an answer that says the student says i don't know i don't know i just don't like it or whatever the case is well we we've got to push that we've got to dig a little deeper a lot deeper but but also we have to understand that sometimes kids don't articulate that it's hard for them to articulate why they're struggling with motivation they genuinely might not know but we can't give up on that we have to be relentless with that and no doubt it can be frustrating when the school tries this this this this and this i recently met with high school principals about students who were falling in our negative withdrawal category and some of the things that our principals have done well we've met with this student 20 times you know it's not lack a lack for trying um but we just have to we have to have those great intervention programs maybe it's additional tutoring that's provided maybe it's pull out resources by specified teachers who have the ability to really coach up kids we just have to have an array of interventions where we have our kids get back on track okay thank you um dr dr barber would you like to answer that one as well sure i i agree with dr smith you really have to have an array of interventions available um you know i'm so proud to say in florida that we've had brick and mortar instruction five days a week since the beginning of this school year because some of the best dropout prevention um efforts are athletics our extracurricular clubs and so to be able to engage our students many of our students come to school uh because of that sense of belonging that they get uh and the encouragement and that that family that they gain from the clubs and activities that they're in whether it be band or njrotc or or athletics uh or some other kind of extracurricular club so having those available and creating some of those clubs that perhaps some students might it might be chess club it might be some type of gaming club but whatever it is we need to find that hook for that student and engage them in a positive way and then if part of the um their reason for perhaps wanting to drop out has to do with an academic need uh then of course providing them with that as well uh our djj support program that i've mentioned already uh was put in place and we really looked at over the years the outcomes of our students when it came to a student who had a civil citation or was uh that had gone through teen court we were able to turn that student around pretty quickly and engage them and get them on that positive trajectory the critical kids that we had more difficulty with were some of our students who had been um in a juvenile justice facility in which they were in this very structured environment and then when they were back in a regular high school that with some of the lack of structure um they struggled with that so then we really had to individualize and do what uh dr smith was talking about with really having some of those mentors so that's where um each of those students were assigned a mentor at that high school sometimes that mentor happened to be our school resource officer who could really relate to that kid and really really provide them with some support and understanding for some of the things that they had been through and then of course working with that family to engage them as well right now our high schools have their um we have an early warning system so one of the and i know and escambia they do as well that's kind of a requirement in the state of florida that we have an early morning system to identify what are the indicators that a student may um be prone to dropping out of school and so we monitor that we identify those students and then put a plan in place to to make sure that we're keeping them or we're getting them on track some of the times students drop out because they fall behind in credits and they get discouraged uh and that has happened this year of course with with our pandemic so we're using um some of our our educational software to help them accrue some of those credits so they don't give up they don't fall behind or we help them catch up get those credits so they can graduate on time all right well thank you we have two more questions and i know that we've kept you over already both of you um and ruthie as well would you like to stay or can you stay for those last two questions or do we need to wrap it up at this point i i am going to have to graciously uh excuse myself um uh at this time we understand we understand dr barber how about you i can stick around for a little while yes okay and and ruthie i know that you have some some important plans that you have to take care of today so we we understand if you have to bow out as well so um so audience will will stay on and finish those last two questions and again dr smith thank you so much for uh participating and for staying so long over time uh but but everything was very interesting to us we don't normally have this many questions so you can tell that our audience really enjoyed both of you speakers well and and thank you again for this this wonderful opportunity to to talk about the education of our youth and thank you your organization for what you do uh in in the community you have such a positive impact on so many people and on this community and again very very happy to have had this opportunity to share with you today and hope everybody enjoys the rest of their weekend thank you thank you thank you delightful okay so um dr barber here's one of the last two questions um this is a long one while the work that cdac mflc's and children's home society do within schools is invaluable in providing emotional support slash counseling for students with these organizations being separate entities parent permission is required before they can provide most servative services and this makes it difficult for them to provide crisis services to children during the school day without getting parent approval which of course can be difficult on short notice what's being done to better address crises among students during the school day douglas there was legislation passed that required that um all personnel on a campus uh teachers paraprofessionals administrators get a full day of training uh in youth mental health first aid and so all uh personnel on a school we're about two-thirds of the way through all of our personnel being trained in youth mental health first aid so that's kind of our first line of defense when it comes to making sure that not only are we seeing the red flags and warnings but then we know what approach to take when we do have a student in crisis so that is our our first line of defense uh we we are continuing with that training our school resource officers as well um all of about three of them out of the 35 school resource officers we have have been trained on in a crisis intervention and the other three are set for that training so we've got folks on on campus every day that have been trained to be able to respond to students in that in that crisis situation okay thank you and the last question has to do with with funding what is being done to retain educators and support personnel with experience in light of the state legislatures restricting money to hire new teachers and striving to reduce local bargaining ability right uh so in this past year of course you know the governor said after he was elected that he was going to be uh an education governor and last year was considered um or this school year uh the year of the teacher so there was legislation passed to actually raise the minimum teacher wage throughout florida um to a minimum of forty seven thousand five hundred dollars a year that is um a goal uh and so uh school districts many of them are well below that but we were provided with an additional 3.8 million dollars in santa rosa county to address that minimum teacher pay so we have three bargaining units we have our santa rosa educators association santa rosa professional educators and those are mainly our school related employees and teacher assistance paraprofessionals and then we have our blue collar union as well and so i can tell you that this uh past year um we were able to but let me go back to the legislation what this legislation required was that about 80 of that 3.8 million dollars we received was to go to classroom teachers that left out uh guidance counselors that left out deans that left out even interventionists that see students and provide them with instruction but they aren't that traditional in the classroom teacher all day and so what the school board and i did was to find other dollars from our general fund so that if you were in your let's say your first through the ninth year of teaching um you were uh we needed to bring your salary up um so right now um based on the money that we receive from this legislation our teachers all earn um 42 500 and some change now so we were able to increase our minimum teacher pay but we used other resources that we had and the 20 left of that 3.8 million to increase the wages of all of our teachers and staff so the average um percentage in wages increase was 3.35 but many of our teachers who were in years one through nine received a higher wage but overall the average from first year through 30 plus years of teaching was 3.35 um i mentioned earlier one of the goals of that i have is to continue to increase our financial condition ratio it's best basically a a savings account so that if anything catastrophic happens and it's required by law that you keep that ratio above 3 it's best if it's between percent and ten percent and soon we will be at seven percent so we're it we're going to be in a great spot for that um as we plan for our budget for next year it is all about how do we make sure that we are using our resources as efficiently as possible so we can retain and recruit and be competitive with our salaries and benefits for all our employees so that's critical over 85 percent right now of our revenue is focused on salary and benefits and that's where the magic happens it's with the teachers and the paraprofessionals and the administrators it's not with uh with a a computer program it's not with a book it's with our personnel so that's where we need to focus and invest through how true it's lovely to hear someone say that though um well thank you so much for being so gracious to stay on and answer those last couple of questions it was obvious that this was a very successful uh presentation this morning lots of interest from our membership and again they'll be watching online on demand um as it suits their schedule and with some people as it suits their bandwidth which i'm sure you can understand so so thank you again and dane i'll turn the meeting back over to you thank you mary louise and i again say thank you to dr barber uh it was a very um informative meeting and we i can't say that we've had another topic this year that went over time so if that matters uh uh i think you can tell we have lots of involvement and lots of interest in the school districts where our children attend um thank you to our membership for tuning in and for being here and uh your questions were very much on target and made a uh made it for an interesting uh ending to to the presentation and don't forget we meet every third saturday morning each month we have a program and next month will be uh entitled food insecurity and we will look at some things that are happening with food pantries and across the state with the department of agriculture so tune in uh for that one next month and um hope everybody has a good day and enjoy the last few minutes of your spring break dr barbour thank you thank you going out to work in the yard me too okay well with that i will end the meeting for everyone and see you next time thank you mary louise bye bye", "rte1xzReAJ0": "hi everyone welcome to the\ncrochet steps channel today we will make this dove together in view\nof the Easter holidays I thought of creating together with\na dove that is ideal both to make a gift or to decorate the house\nbefore presenting the materials and get to work\nI wanted to remember them and subscribe to my channel and to click on the bell\nto receive notifications of my next videos\nin addition he wanted to invite you to follow me on my facebook page and on my\ninstagram page passion crochet for our project we\nwill use the cotton number 5 white cotton in this case I chose a\nnice dark yellow and to make paws here you can\neasily use orange as well a light orange I will work everything with\ncrochet number 2 then I will need a needle of the objects on\nmark stitches to be able to them insert, however, for this I can tell\nyou that you can also use stars\nthe important thing and insert them with and fix them with de lla glue how much they are in any case\nsure that not unless they come off and then the padding just\nto stuff our dove we take the cotton we will start from the\nhead then we will start working on the body\nwe must still make the head with all the body\nis worked as a whole then we will make the part of the tail then we will make the tail\nloyal and then the part of the legs so let's say\nthat we select our dove now we will start with the processing\nof the head with the body we make a magic circle and inside of the\nmagic circle we pull the thread as usual we make a\nchain and work 6 single crochets made our 6 single crochets we pull\nthe codeine we tighten it and we return to the first stitch we made and\nfollowing a single crochet and this is the point that we are now going to mark with the\nmark points the dove is a friend rumi I have already spoken to you previously I have done\nsome other projects always of amigurumi and you know that they are common nque\nof a Japanese technique for crocheted and stuffed puppets\nI explained to you in the video of the first steps before\nthe spiral processing, however, and this is what we are going to achieve\nfor the processing of our dove so we are the first point scoring\nand now we are going to work two points for each point below\nwe will make an increase per point so we will get 12 low points at the end\nthen the first yellow done by and I make the second point and then for each\npoint I have available I make two low points up to get to the end\nmade our 12 points lower mesh explain the brand and enter\nthe point always marked with a shirt that will score low again, and here\nwe will work a crochet we have already made\nan increase in the next stitch a shirt so low an increase at the end\nwe will have 18 single crochets then a single crochet 2 single crochets in the same single crochet\npoint 2 single crochets in the same point up to at the end of our 18 single crochets we enter again in the marked\npoint and we believe it so we did the first but whoever lowers now we will have to do another single crochet\nso 2 single crochets and an increase for the whole round then 2 single crochets in the\nthird point we will do 2 single crochets in the same point a single crochet in the next one single crochet\nand then 2 single crochets in the same point\nat the end we will have 24 single crochets made the 24 single crochets\nhere arrived at the end we hope to mark points\nwe always enter the marked point with a stitch low we mark it and here\nwe have to do five rounds of point by point\nso this is the first we are going to do we have to work by working a\npoint by step for each point below and this we have to do we have to\nrepeat it five times then work five rounds point on point and we will\nmeet again at the end of our five laps\nmade our five laps point by point then by 24 low points we\nrelease the The mark points we enter again by making the first\nlow point we re- mark and now we will do 10\nthe first we have already done it 10 low points so 234 5 6 7 8 910 an increase then two low points\nin the same point two low points 1 and 2 and an increase so we did 10\nlow points an increase two low points an increase and now we will redo 10 points steps 1 2 3 4 5 67\n8 9 and 10 and we arrived here at the end we release the points\nmarker anyway in this lap\nwe just made two increases then from 24\nwe go to 26 low stitches we return to the marked point we make a\nlow stitch and we re-mark it and here we perform 8 single stitches 1 we have already\ndone so 23 45 6 7 and 8 an increase in the next point then\ntwo low stitches in the same point [Music]\nthen we will do two low points in the following points one increase in the next point 2 low points 1 and 2 another increase again two points steps then we will\nrepeat the sequence two low points the increase four times\nthen two p greasy low and one increase to summarize 8 single crochet double\ncrochet raise two single crochet increase two single crochet increase and now\nwe're going to do our 8 single crochet 123456 7 and 8 and we're at the end\nso we're still doing some increases to start forming the\nbody of the dove in this case increases we have made 4 then from 20\n6 single crochets we pass 30 single crochets in this round that we have just made unhook the stitch marker we reenter it in the point\nmarked with a single crochet and we re-mark it this round we will make a point on point then\n30 low points the first we did we will work a low point for each point\nbelow until we get to the end at the end we unhook\nour points marker we enter and we make the first low point\nand we re-mark points and here we will work 8 low points so\nwe have already done the first two three four 5 6 7 and 8\nnow then we will do an increase then two low points in the same point two p one\nstep in the following points one increase three low stitches 123 one increase 1 and 2\nin the same point two low stitches in the following points\nin the next we will always do one two point increase steps 12 one increase in the following point and then we will\nwork our eight single stitches then 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 here\nwe have made 5 increases then from 30 we go to 35 single stitches the next\nround we will work point by point then we\nreturn to the marked point with a single crochet we re-mark it and we will work\na point for each point below so we will have to work 35 single stitches until you get to the end worked\nstitch by stitch then 35 single stitches we unhook the stitch mark we always return with single crochet and we\nalways mark the first stitch and we will work the first we did it\nwe have to work in total 11 stitches steps then 23 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11\nthen we will make an increase in the next step then we will do two low points in the following point an increase in two\nlow points in the following point an increase two points\np aces in the next point one increase two points steps in the next point one\nincrease and 11 single crochet 2 45 6 7 8 9 10 and 11 therefore in this round we\nmade five increases going from 35 single crochet to 40 we unhook the\nstitch marker we enter the first point always marked\nand the rebranded and here we will work a round of point by point so in total\nwe should have 40 low points arrived here at the end unhook the\nbrand points always enter the first marked point and the risegna me and here\nwe will do 15 points steps then the first l ' we did 2 3 4 5 6 78\n9 10 11 12 13 14 and 15 in the next point\nwe will do an increase then two single crochet in the same point then we will work 8 single\ncrochet 1 2 3 4 5 678 an increase in the next point and 15\nstitches then we have increased this lap by two points\nhaving the final total 42 points 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 and 15 and here the front\npart of our dove takes shape now from here on unhooked the points marker we have to\ncontinue point up point for seven laps so we must always lengthen this\ndimension that we have obtained then we release the points marker we enter the first marked point we mark it again\nthis will be our first point and we must do seven laps\npoint by point and we will meet again at the end of the laps completed after the seven\nlaps turns that allowed us to give the shape already\nto the front part of the dove anyway look at the part this is the\nfront part and this one where there is the stitch mark and the back part then before\ncontinuing the working of the body then to finish it and then\nto start stuffing them we have to insert the eyes and the beak in this\ncase we have to work the beak which is really very simple so\nwe take and the orange cotton a light orange however I am\navailable this we make a magic circle inside we pull the\nthread that we make a chain a single crochet and the second single crochet\nthen 2 single crochets we pull the yarn and tighten the codeine\nit is very simple we have formed a small beak with two simple single\ncrochets in the magic circle we cut the thread we unthread it [Music]\nand we are ready to insert our little beak inside the dove\nwe take our shape so far it is from the top we count right\nfrom the very first turn right in the bed 123456 here to take the central\npart so what we highlight is the central part we\ncan also help ourselves in this way by bending it here we take precisely the central part\nin this case we count 1 1 2 3 4 5 in the sixth let's say it should be the exact place\nroughly to insert our nose\nso for now I stopped it let's say with the crochet I take the part\n[Music] I try to enter the other part\nperfect or crochet and I pull the two nose tails so you can do this even earlier because\nmaybe you get even better doing it anyway we turn here the back part and\ntie these two these two tails then c we try to tie them quite\ntightly with back on it remains nice adherent however the nose sorry the\nbeak remains well adherent to the work we do a double knot and cut it is not interested in being healthy of the small\npieces because then it is stuffed because inside we rearrange\nour head and nose then the beak is inserted\nnow we have to insert the eyes to insert the eyes\nwe count 1234 so this is the position and then from the nose we distance ourselves\nby 12 meyer on one side so we can insert them in this point we have to\nhelp each other but according to you what do you find\nyou owe me help to widen the machining a little therefore predicted\n12 34 this is the position and 12 with respect to the\nnose then insert the screws inside the machining therefore so on one side and on the other always with the\nsame distance from the nose after positioning the eyes and the beak\nso we are maybe satisfied with the result\nalways take account of the front part must be re face here so\nin correspondence with the little body I say that there are we can put\nthe safety buttons so we fix them well then always\ninside and after which we continue the processing and we will not have problems later\nif you insert some pins you can also do\nit later after it is padded because the important thing is always to insert it, I\nrecommend you put some fabric glue and more so that you will not risk\nthat the pins come out or maybe they are used by\nchildren and then become in danger later having fixed the eyes and the beak\nwe can continue the work then we resume we had reached the\nseven rounds of single crochets that we made\npoint by point then 40 2 single crochets we remove the stitch marker we always enter\nwith but whoever lowers it and we mark it here we have to work 15 single crochets because\nnow we have to start the decreases so we made the first maya we made 15 single crochets so c it is a decrease so as\nwe have always done we take the outer solina the two outer lines of the\nnext two points then so we pass the yarn and then we close together\nso we made the first decrease\nthen we make 8 single crochets then 123456 78 another and then decrease solina first\nand second solina do pass the wire\ninside the pull out that we pass in both\nthe wire 15 and lower mesh       12 3 4 5 6 7 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 and unhook the brand points always enter in the first point \u00e8 we re-mark it\nand here we perform 9 single crochet so the first we did it 2\n3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 a decrease then we take\nexternal pasolini and only in the external of the following two points we pass the\nthread and then we pass it in both\nwe continue with three low points 123 do another decrease then\ntake the two solos we do pass the thread and close together\nwe always three low points another decrease here ndi 1 and 2\nwe pass the yarn we see together with 33 other three single crochets 2 and 3\nwe always make another decrease always taking them aso outer lines three single\ncrochets and decrease and now we make our 9 single crochets\n1 2

stitches steps 1 2 and 3 decrease and six single crochet 12 3 4 5 arrived at this point we can\nstart to stuff our dove we pull the thread a little more so\nwe have no difficulty and we take the stuffing into pieces and start to stuff it so we also give a shape to what we\nhave done so far we put many pieces of stuffing\nand avoid I love to put it all piled up so they will not create it all will be\nhomogeneous so I advise you to take it into small\npieces then gradually padded with your hands arranged all the part\nafter having stuffed them a little we continue our work so we\ncontinue our decreases and then we will continue anyway mammana stuff it\nthen we unhook the point marker we enter the first point and we re-mark it\nand here we will do two single points it is a decrease so the first\nwe did it we have the second decrease two single points\n[Music] no and 2 decrease however we continue\nlike this until the end two-point distance and a decrease in\nthe entire round got here in the end always unhook brand points we enter a low point and\nrebranded, and here we will do a low point is a decrease in the entire round so a\npoint we did take the bus usual and\nwe make a first decrease in the following a low point decrease I have a low point decrease well themes n not only so I did the\nlow point 12 and continue like this until the end of the\nround arrived here at the end as you can see we are tightening all the\npart now we will do all decreases then\nwe will do a round of all decreases so we release the greased market and already\nstart with the first decrease then take the first solina and the second and\nmake the very first decrease that we are going to mark because we need to\nrealize the beginning and then we will all take all the aso external lines\nand we will make a decrease that is all decreases then close to\nmy points to 2 to 2 so that we will fill the remaining part\nthen the last part we made we fill it with the padding\nthen with the wadding and we can close the work for this we also need the\nstitch marker because we need to know the closure and then do then he has them alone nor\nwill we do them then with the lake and we will close everything with the lake [Music] here we arrived from the beginning to the end\nof the tour we have this last part and we make and the\ncomplete closure of the body of the dove after having stuffed it we cut\nthe thread we unthread it and we insert the lake we take the case external lines of all the points that we have\navailable [Music] and we pull the thread\nwe give some points of closing after which we can cut the thread is the\nlittle body that then apple tree modeled for good of our dove\nas you can see is the shape on both sides is ready now we should do all\nthe other parts and therefore we are already ready to assemble it then the body is\nready now we will make the piece of the back part of the dove where\nthe tail is placed let's take the white cotton and make a magic circle\nhere now we will go to work the back part of the dove what\npractically the small cone that will then support the curled tail we\nsaw above then pull the wire inside the circle make a\nchain and within the wish 6 low tele meshes 4\nand 5 if we pull the codeine and enter the\nfirst single crochet that we made by making another single\ncrochet and positioning the stitch marker in the first point we made now we will work two single crochet for each\npoint below so we have worked the first one we re-enter and work\nthe second and then two single crochet for each stitch at the end of the round today they\nhave to find 12 single crochets at the end we unhook the\nstitch marker and knit the first single crochet and re- mark it\n[Music] here we have to make a point\nso we make a row by working a tube a single stitch for each stitch\nbelow then 12 single stitches processed our 12 basic stitches and\nthen point by point we challenge and mark points we enter the\nfirst stitch again we make a single crochet and we re- mark it and here\nwe work the first stitch just we made it\nwe will do in the second stitch an increase then we will do a single crochet an\nincrease with this alternation for the whole round so in the end there we will find\nwith 18 single crochets then a single crochet and an increase in the next point at the end we unhook the\nstitch marker we enter the first single stitch again we re- mark it and in this\nround we work in point by point then a single point for each point\nbelow then 18 points steps worked our 18 single stitches now\nwe enter the first point again we make a single crochet we re-mark it\nand in this round we will do 2 single crochets plus an increase\nthis we are doing anyway to obtain the dome effect so we\nworked round by round just for this reason then we did\nthe first low point we go to the other point we make another low point and an\nincrease then two low points is more an increase for the whole lap and we\nwill end up with 24 low points arrived at the end decided we release the\nbrand stitches we always enter the first point we re- mark it and we will work 3 single\ncrochets plus an increase we made the first one\nso we do the second the third and the fourth point\nwill work 2 low meshes at the same point\nso we'll 3 low mesh plus an increase for all the way around and we\nwill end up at the end with 30 low mesh arrived at the end unhook our\nbrand points and we return always at the same point and we will work precisely on the\npoint 30 low points so we do the first and we mark it that from the first\nwe count point by point 30 low points arrived here at the end we always release\nour points marker we enter with a low point we re- mark it and in the whole\nlap we should do three increases alone then we will divide them 9 low points plus\nan increase 9 low points increase 9 low points increase then the first point\nwe did we will count 234 56 7\n8 9\nin the tenth point we will do an increase then two low points in the same\npoint and start counting again 9 low points that we will make another increase in the\ntenth and so we will also at the end and we will have\nat the end 33 points at the end we release the points marker we enter if mpre\nwith a low point we re-mark it and make the last round point by point\nso we have to do 33 single points a low point for each point below\nand we have finished so the back part of the dove arrived here at the end we can remove\nthe points marker in the marked point let's go in and make a slip\nstitch and in the following point another slip stitch we can cut the\nyarn in this case we cut it slightly\nlonger because then we will need it to come out all the parts\nso we write it and the back is done now I'll do a little see how it\nwill be inserted approximately this part will be inserted in this way then we\nwill make the part above the curled one and the other pieces of the\ndove in the next video I hope you liked this video and\nif so left a like on the video and we will see you again for continuation to the\nnext video [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "_AI_xSk5Avk": "all right let's get started uh good afternoon everyone uh my name is cecil chick um i use female pronouns she her and hers welcome to the third day of social justice week here on campus um while social justice week has been around thanks to dirk and asi this year we were able to bring many more of our campus partners to the planning of this event we're proud to offer over 30 workshops and programs this week to faculty staff and students i also want to thank you all for joining us for our fifth installment of the titan table talk um series brought to you by the office of diverse inclusion equity programs in partnership with the alumni engagement in government and external relations today our panelists will be engaging in a dialogue focused on the power of the female vote our dialogue today will be moderated by dr natalie fousaki's professor of history here at cal state fullerton now before we get started with the program i want to provide some zoom housekeeping information um first and foremost um today's uh dialogue will be hosted in a zoom webinar setting so participants of the webinar are muted and will not have the ability to use your mics we will have a moderator that will lead us through the dialogue with our panelists today if you do wish to ask any questions or have any follow-up questions for our panelists please utilize the q a function located in the menu bar at the bottom of your screen your questions will be addressed in the last 20 to 30 minutes of the program finally this dialogue will be recorded today and posted with closed captioning on the diep youtube channel for everyone to enjoy at the end of this program please fill out the event feedback form that will be sent to all participants um you to the email that they use to register and if you enjoy today's dialogue please keep a look out for the appetah heritage month on titan table talk on april 14th to kick off our event today i would like to introduce the president of cal state fullerton fran virgi to provide some welcome remarks thank you president virgie for joining us today well hello everyone thanks for being here it's great to see you even though it's on zoom and uh we're not in person that's going to happen soon on behalf of the number one university in the csu for both graduating women and registering voters welcome to titan table talks the power of the female vote they are so interconnected for us what an outstanding topic and one of one of just many events on campus centered around both women's history month and social justice week and the confluence of those events as well as we discuss the theme of the power of the female vote i want to recognize who we are in addition to the number one ranking in women earning bachelor's degrees that i opened with seven of our nine academic deans are women three of whom are women of color two of our new vice presidents who joined our cabinet this past year are both women more than half our asi leaders our student leaders are women we are the first university we were the first university on the west coast to appoint an african american woman president will jewel plummer cobb and we were the first csu to appoint a latina president i bring these points up not just to revel in our history but to underscore a truth that you've heard me say about cal state fullerton before we are orange county only sooner we are california only sooner and we are america only sooner which is another way of saying that as the titan family goes so goes the rest of the nation what we are today orange county will be in five minutes california will be in a week and the nation will be next month so when you think about the fact that president jewell plummer cobb the first black woman in our nation to earn a phd in biology is a titan and when you think about the fact that president mildred garcia the first latinx woman to lead a campus in the nation's largest system of higher education is a titan and when you think about our ranking atop the state and atop the nation in conferring degrees to women and when you think about the hundreds of thousands of titan women on our campus and around our nation past present and future who have and continue to chip away at these and other glass ceilings you know an epiphany begins to form here at least for me and it is this when someone finally does break through with a shattering of that glass ceiling that it can be heard around the world someone such as vice president kamala harris just did it's not a stretch to say that at least some of the shards that are left in that wake at least some of the resulting social justice opportunities that are created can in some ways be traced right back to cal state fullerton so when we see gender pay gaps decreasing and equitable access for women leaders increasing we can be proud that cal state fullerton has been a significant force in that progress and when we see 126 women in congress 25 women in the senate and 101 women in the house we can be proud that these diverse women including the first two muslim congressmen in history the first native american congresswoman in history and the youngest woman to serve in congress ever that they look like our faculty like our staff and like our students they personify the social justice that we claim to uphold and like all of us they are america only sooner as i mentioned at our title titan table talk for black history month my colleague and friend president parham at cal state dominguez hills he recently wrote a piece in which he reminded us that when it comes to social justice no one person tells the whole story with that in mind it's important to note that just as kamala harris stands on the shoulders of women leaders of the past like geraldine ferraro and shirley chisholm she also is lifted up by women leaders of today particularly in regards to the power of the female vote george's stacey abrams rightfully became the face of that power of equitable voting but let's be clear countless other women most of us will never hear about some from right here on our campus were integral in the voting rights and the advocacy that helped pave the way for vice president harris's election now these points of pride certainly don't negate our need to do better any more than they suggest that gender inequities no longer exist on our campus in our state or in our nation and as i wrote in an email to campus just this past friday like most institutions across our nation we have not yet reached our goal to create and uphold a campus climate in which all faculty all staff and all students are truly free in all facets of campus life that is our goal and we are working toward it we want them to be free from the sting of marginalization free from the injustice of unacknowledged privilege and the pain of systemic discrimination and racism and as the social justice principles document that were attached to my email suggest we cannot separate we cannot separate the conversation between racial justice and justice for all marginalized groups when the oppression and liberation are interconnected instead we need to take a step back examine and discuss the historic parallels of racial injustice and other human rights movements in our country women's rights and as we saw in this last election the power of the female vote are critical parts of the human rights movement on our campus in our region and around the nation through our work and advocacy a day will come when there is no equity gap or salary discrepancy or disenfranchisement when it comes to women voters and leaders but if we are america only sooner then we must first catalyze that change right here at cal state fullerton you know as i have mentioned to some of you before when we've talked informally through the non-profit work that my wife julie and i lead in rwanda i have seen firsthand the transformative change that can come when women have equitable access to voting work pay and power when substantial numbers numbers of the able-bodied rwandan men were killed during the genocide in rwanda and in our efforts to help rebuild the country it was impossible not to notice how much of the leadership positions had changed and were for the first time in the country's history history were being occupied almost exclusively by women women judges police attorneys government leaders teachers everything everywhere these women who did not have the opportunity at education or training that their male counterparts had had who had to move forward without their husbands without their brothers without their sons who had just witnessed one of the most horrific massacres in human history these women single-handedly led the country out of despair and they continued to lead its ascension out of the darkness of genocide they are the physical manifestation of the power of not just the female vote but also the female voice and why it should be at every table everywhere in the world like all women these brave women rwandans possess the inner strength and natural leadership abilities that the other half of our population can and should and must study learn from and follow so that's what i'm here to do listen and learn and that's why i'm going to be quiet now but first i want to say thank you to bobby porter cecil chick courtney keon and the entire team in our diversity inclusion and equity programs

has also worked as a co-host for a weekly bilingual television program aimed at bringing government closer to the people with all of this wonderful experience that you have i think we're all going to have a lot to learn from you about the power of the female vote and community engagement so i would love to open the first question um to our panelists and again no order of who can answer um just pipe in when you would you like the first question is what issues do you think have the most impact among women in our society well uh it's it's a great question and uh and especially the tagline when when you add uh the question that you asked uh added to it the the issue since 2011 10 years ago and uh because the it's funny i was doing a little bit of research um what i love about uh president uh virgie's opening remarks is connecting cal state fullerton to both uh what we look like in orange county and how orange county is representing uh the face of the united states but i will dare say we are also a global hot spot in orange county as we are at cal state fullerton such globally connected uh faculty students issues that we deal with and i say that because the world economic forum did a global gender gap report back in 2011 and the top issues at that time if you recall the demographics of the world were changing we're experiencing youth budge ins bulge in some countries but in others an aging population as we are in california as we are in the united states and women had multiple roles as workers caregivers mothers and as the majority of the world's older persons they were critical to making uh a transition to that those new demographics successful so we have to sort of think about family and fertility and that was back in 2011 also think about the fact that they were key civic leaders in 2011 in the uprising that launched the arab spring right think about that 10 years ago that their role back then it needed to be re recognized um with increasing gender equality in a political arena so i'll close by saying the issues in 2011 think about them economic participation and opportunity for women educational attainment for women health and survival for women and political empowerment right ten years ago those are the same issues we need to deal with today right and and so i love this conversation and what we can add to it further but those those are still the top four issues even in 2021 hard shoes to to fill going after lucy dunn you know someone who will respect tremendously and filling her shoes as a in her former role as a california transportation commission certainly uh have my hands uh a full um based on all the work that lucy has been able to do and and i have always looked up to her and the great work that she's done in orange county but throughout california so thank you lucy um it's a great pleasure um to be on this panel the way i look at things and i'm a proud titan to move forward we always have to look backwards and i think it's imperative for us to understand that even in 2011 and lucy said it very well the same issues that that we faced in 2011 as women we face today but i think what's really important and we've been hearing this with with the racial justice issues of our time after george floyd is equity and equity to me means access and i think women in particular have not had the same access as um as as men whether it be in the workplace whether it be in the educational space and more importantly when it comes to the political space i one of now of eight women who had the great pleasure of serving on the santa ana city council for 12 years so 150 years you have only had eight women to serve on the santa ana city council that says a lot when you look at the representation and the breakdown of women in particular in santa ana they vote more than than than than our counterparts as males and to understand that why only eight women i think a lot of of that has to deal with access uh and more importantly about civic engagement and you know when we think about civic engagement i think as women we are more honed in on community on working alongside community we volunteer we participate um you know i'm not a mother but i had a mother i know a lot of mothers out there they participate in ptas they're very well vested in community not more so the political process and one of the things that um i've come to realize especially now the work that i'm doing with the houseless population specifically here in the la region and you're starting to see the uptick of of of women who are houseless you know it has a lot to do with access and you know the amount of women that i'm seeing on the street specifically on skid row is heartbreaking and i think we need to also look at the opportunities um in particular for for that population of women and and the barriers and the access that they have to educational attainment uh but more importantly these the civic engagement role um i think we need to talk a little bit more about that because it has a lot to do with culture and um sometimes we tend um not to um have that discussion and i think they go hand in hand culture and access and so with that um i i know there are a lot more uh folks that would like to speak on this issue and so i'm glad to participate thank you michelle i'll follow michelle um you know i i i i appreciate how you brought up the eight women that are in position in decision making positions and um in preparation for today um i had i had another idea in terms of um what the most you know the issues that are most impacting women but the events of yesterday in atlanta really just resonated with me all night and i couldn't sleep because i think about not only what has um you know what has changed in the past decade uh and what hasn't changed in the past decade and what hasn't changed in the last 40 years um yesterday atlanta there were eight people that were killed in a senseless act of violence and i have to say it was an act of hate eight women you know who worked in working class women were killed and in a lot of ways um i really identified with those women because um i i'm without knowing their names today without knowing their names or their faces today i feel a lot of affinity to them because we're both we're all immigrants um we're of asian descent um and and i often think about like you know if my life had not taken a different path if my mom my mother had not left vietnam as a refugee and come to united states and was um was sponsored by a church in laguna beach my life could have been could have taken a different path and so the question of what what issue i think is most um impacting women is equality and representation and i think that there are some things that to this day there's still a lot of inequality that exists for women and compounded by women of color com on top of that women women who are new immigrants the country that don't speak the language of the country these are all issues i feel like impact all women and i know i speak from a place of privilege to be able to be on the screen with all of you it's something that many people i know who look like me who have similar histories and background that aren't able to share the same kind of forum and so i think that's something that's important to talk about and to really reflect on is this inequity that exists even you know even within our immediate communities and our families my mother you know was someone that got to go to college um when she was in vietnam but because of the war she had to give up her education and then come to the united states and kind of restart her life again and give her up her life for myself and i've been so lucky um to have worked for a titan um lou korea and so i feel like i have a lot of connections to the titan community and my daughter annalise is seven years old she's going to have more opportunities than i did um yeah i feel like there's still these inequalities and lack of representation that still exist um for women in general thank you tammy yeah you know i can just compliment what everyone has already you know so eloquently stated i mean for me when i think of that question for me it's just it's just the economy is not working for women you know that's kind of the first thing that you know comes to my mind and i think something like covid really highlights um kind of the breaks and policies that really affect women and there's just shocking gender equality gaps and that affects you know if women are still to this day making 80 cents on the dollar and women of color making even less than that that affects housing that affects health care that affects income and so for me just to quickly complement what um the panelists have already um stated it's just that the economy is just not working for us but there's things that we can do together to change it so i'm i'm hopeful thank you before we move on um lucy there was a question from the audience about for you to to restate the top four goals for women that you had um given us at the beginning sure happy to do that um they the these are the the the overarching four metrics that global leaders look at for countries as they try to elevate women uh with the the gender gap and they are one economic participation and opportunity two educational attainment three health and survival and four is political empowerment interestingly enough both in 2011 and in 2020 the top country in the world was iceland that both that best uh had opportunities for women in equal the united states to their credit bumped up um uh uh in 2011 i think they were prior to that they were like 39th ranked and then they bumped up to like 19 or something so they they are getting better compared to other countries but it is an interesting study when you look at those four performance metrics which what countries are doing it um better than others so yeah and and you can find all of this online um so it's a it's a very very interesting analysis thank you lucy and i think all the other panelists talked on and touched on different aspects of that um exactly right here at home so i'd like to move to our to the next question um so based on your personal and professional experiences how have you all linked civic engagement to the advocacy work that you do i'll go i think it's important um i think the civic engagement and advocacy work are one and the same um i was very lucky at a young age to be involved with politics and a lot of ways it was by accident um straight out of college i got an opportunity um to connect with a friend who was working for then assembly member lou correa again a titan a very proud titan um i applied to work in his office and rather than go and continue with graduate school i end up working for him for one year and one year turn into 12 years um and i feel like one of the things i i believe is important about linking civic engagement to advocacy work is is is taking those opportunities when they come when they come up you know really caring about an issue and i think today it's so easy to get involved with civic participation or to get civically engaged whether it's through the formal political infrastructure or it or or just voting and so i think as students um especially at a campus like cal state fullerton there's so many different opportunities and there's a huge alumni network where you can tap into where there's plenty of internship opportunities opportunities to work on a project or an issue that you care about and so i feel like it's really just making sure that you own your voice and then one thing that i've always learned is one is too small a number for greatness and so always remembering that you're not alone that you could be part of something greater um at a very young age i was very always very interested in things that were happening in vietnam and i learned in high school about modern day slavery and how women are women and children are still part of the slave labor when i worked for leukoria at the time i was able to kind of link that to my work working on human trafficking issues um there's an orange county human trafficking task force um and i share that because there's so many things that we can care we care about and there's so many ways for us to really have a voice on that and to be be an advocate so definitely in summary you know use your voice join with others and it's so easy nowadays with social media and so many different opportunities that are available to be involved as students a great i i'll go next michelle martinez um i always tell folks if you're not at the table you will be on the menu and when i look at civic engagement and advocacy it is imperative as women to be at the table and not on the menu but more importantly so before even if we're at the table we should also you know use the analogy of food that we should also be making sure that we get to choose the ingredients uh typically through policy making a lot of times in my personal experience what i've observed is that there's a lot of of specifically women who get to the table but don't get to choose the ingredients and and and and community period and that's what i've observed in my uh 15 plus years in the in public spaces but one thing that i also want to talk about is that we need to step into our power but it doesn't always have to be you know um you know a position of leadership that is political you can't have a lead take a leadership role that's informal and still make a tremendous impact and what i've seen through many women organizations that i've been a part of um you know i always ask women to run for office i think i said it's important for you to be at the table your voice is important but i i've also have realized that it's also important for women to have these informal leadership positions to be behind the scenes to help other women who so choose to want to be in the public eye and want to run for office i i will say that as someone that served for 12 years i really enjoy being on the other side now not being in the public eye being in an informal uh role being able to to really speak my mind per se uh where when i was elected you know there there are times where you know you had to have a tight lip you know because you're addressing um issues that are sensitive um and sometimes you know our opinions um you know can't matter when you're addressing public policy you have to look at the whole and not part of the system and so i've recognized that over time and so what i would say today whether you're a student and you choose to take an informal leadership role or formal leadership role in the public um in public policy is to step into your power and to also recognize that it's not only important to be at the table but to also ensure that if you have an issue discuss that because there's never a wrong answer one of the things that i always tell young women that i mentor that we're going to make mistakes and and guess what it's okay we are not perfect it's okay to make mistakes and learn from those mistakes they make us better people and so um the last thing that i would just share with with you all that i think it's important is that you know we look at democracy um in general uh you know i really believe democracy lies within its people and i think as women we have realized that it lies within people but it lies within our communities the power doesn't lie per se uh within a political government institution it lies within its people and its community and i think it's important for us um that we can't do this by ourselves and it's going to take a community it's going to take a village to help raise not just women issues but all issues that we face in our community thank you michelle michelle's is and she's so um modest because this woman started um as just a santa ana resident who was very young and at a very young age engaged in her community and things bugged her and she ran for city council who knew she was so brave and now not only uh a leader uh at santa ana on the city council but also then at the southern california association of governments where she ran the entire elected officials on good transportation and housing planning for all of southern california and now a statewide role so it's blossoms from very young and it's just a passion you have and i can't i couldn't agree with both of my colleagues more in that um civic engagement is advocacy but it you never think about that right because even in the four paths of my life when i started out practicing law i did a lot of work with conservatorships caring for the elderly and it became one of those things in my work where i recognized i needed to do something more to help them and you become an advocate just from your work you don't even realize it's civic engagement i moved on to doing real estate and land entitlement my passion became for the company i worked for they were a homebuilder but my passion was wetlands restoration and protecting the environment and learning about how to do the best plan to protect endangered species who would have thought about that from a real estate developer but that was my passion and i learned and i became engaged in our community benefited the company but also benefited the environment you move on state housing director right now i'm learning all of this stuff about homelessness i was in the market side of home building the market rate side now i'm learning about mobile home parks and homeless shelters and farm worker housing and you become engaged and uh an advocate in the civic side and now last but like at ocbc you can't distinguish civic engagement from advocacy because your passions become those things that you fight for and it's all about at the end of the day the things that that we women in particular find very moving it's about helping other people and making life better for other people and we all may just disagree on what that path might be to doing that but the goal to help people's lives and to do something better for your community and make your community more livable it it moves us all and so um continue to help uh in those in those those those realms but uh helping people recognize their passion and recognizing that they do they can do it and and you don't start by being on the transportation commission like michelle and i you start with those small little things that move you and suddenly they blossom and grow and you realize you have a voice and you have more power than you think and you can make a difference that sounds true and i think you know we do advocacy and everyday actions that we take um i personally found my voice at cal state fullerton so i think as students you know participating in this i think it's it's a great place to start i am an immigrant from the middle east i came here when i was about seven years old and so my culture isn't traditionally very involved and as i was working two jobs and putting myself through a school at cal state fullerton um you know there was elections going on and that was kind of my first kind of um you know put your toe in the put your toe in the water right but i mean cannonball too i mean i've learned as i've grown in my career it doesn't have to be perfect like the other panelists said don't worry about being perfect don't worry about knowing everything that's not what advocacy is about right it's just taking your passion and not just having good intention but having action behind that um every time you volunteer that's advocacy every time you stand up for something that you're passionate about that's advocacy so you may not even realize it that you're you're you're doing advocacy you know advocacy isn't voting for a president every four years right and i know personally i really found my voice i joined clubs on campus i started to volunteer and for me i turned that into a career um you know i i was when i was in college i was doing you know sales and business development and i was able to turn my advocacy and my passion into a career by joining the nonprofit industry and it's a tough industry um you know but it's it's a great place to um you know start to volunteer start to intern start to just reach out to people regardless of industry and ask them um you know how did you how did you get to where you were and i guarantee they're they're passionate about something and they're choosing to um go to work every day and be passionate about something whether it's a volunteer or corporate but there's so many great opportunities at cal state fullerton and for me um you know 15 years later they're still my best friends that i met at the feminist club um at different clubs on campus at fullerton so it's a great time to be involved thank you our next question deals with the two main political parties in this country what do you wish both the republican and democratic parties knew about women and their civic engagement and i'll go this is michelle we have common sense and we want to bring people together um you know i you know for my last two years in office and i want to share this story i served with six other men i was the only woman on the santa ana city council and the and i left as the mayor pro tem and so you know which is funny and interesting and i love my co i love my former colleagues like they were my brothers we grew up together i was 26 when i got elected and i left at 38 and so you know we i kind of grew up with them and so they're like my my older brothers and what was interesting is that you know when the position came up for mayor pro tem um after um mayor pro tem claudia alvarez left after six years she had that role as mayor pro tem and then it was uh me and and the boys and they were all you know figuring out who was it to be the next pro tem and you know and i'm the only woman on the council and they all make a decision who's gonna be next and they move on and it's you know sal tina harrow and then vince sarmiento and then dave and then the last is is myself and council member david benavidez and they're thinking david next at at some point someone comes to me actually our former mayor comes to me and says don't you think it's your turn to be mayor pro tem i'll support you and i'm like well what do you want miguel that was my response and not once did i think about serving in that role because it's no different it's just a title and i think it's important to realize that these titles actually can make a difference um and and really move the needle forward and i sat predominantly with a city council that was democratic but i worked alongside many republicans at skag or through the toll roads and the different regional boards that i sat on and what i would say is that you know i think it's important for um you know uh for for these um i and i guess how do how can i put it in these terms is that whether you're republican or democrat i think it's irrelevant i think it's the work that women want to do they want to help we want you know as a council member i want i was the glue i wanted to bring my colleagues together to set an agenda to move my city forward it wasn't a republican issue wasn't a democrat issue wasn't a male issue versus a woman issue i just rose up to the occasion and said hey this these are the things that we need to get done so my comment's gonna be simple and i'm gonna i'm gonna borrow the words of um ruth bader at ginsburg women belong in places where decisions are made i think it's that simple whether you're a republican party the democratic party or the corporate world or any other places where decisions are made things are just better if women are making the decisions or they're included in the decision making process so i i just feel like um i've been very lucky to be in spaces where i'm not the official decision maker but i get to be part of the decision-making process and i think that's so key to civic engagement and i think the other thing about the republican or the democratic party is that you know that reaching out to women or getting women involved it's more than just politics right it's something that that needs to be a critical part of all of our activities in society um and and the other thing i would say with civic engagement we have to change the way for um make it easier for women to be involved i'm a working mom of two it's very difficult for me and sometimes to be in to be involved and even more so it's because my kids are so young but i've been very lucky to work for a company at southern california edison or to have a former boss lou korea who's very um inclusive and i many of you have seen i bring my kids with me i take them to the voting polls i take them along with me to speaking engagements or to events and i think that we have to normalize that in order for more women to be civically engaged um and at the end of the day more women in decision making and decision making positions thank you tammy yeah i'll um i'll jump in on this one too i i would like republicans and democrats to recognize that there's a huge swath of us out there that they don't appeal to and they are tacking too far left they are attacking too far right they are not dealing with the issues that are the bread and butter issues that women have to deal with every single day we have to balance our own home budgets we have to educate our children from freaking zoom boxes and they're all talking politics and we're fed up and so uh and that that uh that dynamic because those women will vote and they are they showed that they voted uh very strongly surprisingly so because there were a lot of votes that went ways you didn't think they were gonna go because women are dealing with real life issues every single day and i would like uh those parties to start thinking a much bigger tent instead of a smaller tent because they're already good women you're you're tammy's right and michelle is right there's already great women in leadership in both parties to a great degree women have engaged more there are more women in congress now than there have ever been in history and they're in fact more women graduating from university than men for for several years that has been the case so we've got education uh there but the politics of um that that has been going on the last few years uh has it is not something that most women find attractive or inviting they much prefer to build consensus and get stuff done and so um that's my my fair warning to both parties thank you that's a good morning hopefully they're listening lucy um yeah i agree i just i don't care what party you belong to i don't even love the fact that i don't think women care that there's a traditional two-party system that's not what it's about for us um we want justice and we want accountability and i think more and more regardless of what you know party you ascribe to that's what you want you want justice for your community and you want accountability um and just you know i think um women are going to be holding politicians more accountable and i think that's a really really great thing and i think both parties should be terrified of that and terrified into action i hope um action that makes a just an equitable society for women and i think that's what women care about thank you that was really wonderful responses um so kind of conversely to that question what do you wish women knew about civic engagement beyond presidential elections major elections political you know elected office i think you all have touched on this already but what else can women know about civic engagement that's beyond sort of the obvious i i'd like to begin by saying if you haven't read uh cheryl sandberg's book lean in it's a good one to start for for women of all kinds whether you're a stay-at-home mom or you know the highest level in in government one of the hardest things for women is they that that resonated me so well is um a woman uh won't apply for a job be it employed or volunteer unless she thinks she's 100 qualified and men will apply for a job or volunteer even when they're not god love them because they know they're going to get on the job training they're smart they they know how to do this and they have a network of of men that will allow them to you know succeed and women haven't always learned effectively how to develop their own echo chambers and their own support system with other women that that rule of thumb applies for civic engagement because women you can engage at any level and volunteer at any level from your child's um parent-teacher association your pta boards to uh seeking an appointment on a parks commission in your city council to literally there are thousands of openings um at uh within the governor's administration that are not paid staff positions there are volunteer positions and you can go online and check them out and submit an application and they're looking more for women in fact jerry brown to his credit he stated to me that he wanted every boarding commission before he left office to have 50 women god love him uh i heard i haven't heard the same thing from uh the newsome administration but from the highest levels in this state to um even just your local city council do you like your little little local you know community um fourth of july parade volunteer to be on the parade board you don't have to you don't have to lead it just volunteer and that kind of engagement builds your confidence and gets you going if you're ready to go for a governor's appointment by lord just fill one out now i don't care what age you are practice applying and practice um going for it you're going to get something and that's the a nice great start for civic engagement find your passion you can do it and uh that start will build successes for even greater things eventually here's my sneaky this is my sneaky thing if i can get you to apply as a volunteer for a board or commission i'm setting you up to run for public office someday right i'm making you brave because now you're dealing with the public and you're able to speak and you're able to get involved and so there is a there is like um like an ulterior motive for me because i think smart women that are fearful and um you know afraid to engage i can get you out there and then eventually you're going to be brave enough that you'll actually be in a position of great power over money and over policy and then we make the world better so i i would um start off with hyperlocal i'm a big believer and i definitely agree with everything that lucy said and hyper local is exactly what she's saying starting out or pta starting in your own um in your own neighborhood um i think you know taking a true hyper local approach and more so in an informal approach getting started there is imperative there's so much work to be done at the hyper local level and that is at the neighborhood level the most impact we can make whether it's government institutions ngos private sector um you know government period is at the neighborhood level that's where it all starts at and there is no better place than to begin at the hyper local level which is the neighborhood level i would then also just say that it's important for us to recognize that if we choose to to volunteer um you know don't look at that as well you know it may not get me anywhere because lucy is so right those of us that ask women to volunteer we always have a motive it's either because we want you to run for public office or we want you to be part of this bigger board we want you to apply for a statewide commission to prepare you um you know and and it so and and that's a starting point and one thing you know i'll say this is that when i left office i was trying to figure out what i was going to do i wanted to continue to serve i have a heart of service and i wanted to continue to give back i just didn't want to do it in the in the political world and so i decided to volunteer my time as a special master to federal court judge david o carter people saying you don't get paid for that you're doing all that work for free and i and i and i would just my friends would tell me like shouldn't you get paid you spend a lot of time doing that and i was getting paid and i have been getting paid the reward is seeing that i can make a difference in the lives of women who are out there in the street and being able to get them a home to learn to meet new people to navigate a system that i was unaware of that now i have the tools and the wisdom to help elected officials a federal court judge nonprofit organizations on what should and how things can be done in a productive way we let the way in orange county and now trying to lead the way in los angeles but it takes a village it takes it takes a lot of us and what i would encourage is that we as women should not only have groups of friends or pods that we call them now of women who we associate with but also build relationships with women you may not think you have interest with or you may not agree with a hundred percent of the time i do my best not to just hang out with like-minded people i love to learn i want to know you know why they think a certain way so that i can listen and understand i think it's so important for us to listen today and to understand the perspectives of of various groups and specifically in our in the women's spaces there is a lot of hostility in our society today there is also um you know a lot of of burnout and and specifically during this pandemic women who've had to work at home take care of their children having to co do several things and there is a burnout effect and we need support and so i would just encourage us all no matter if you're volunteering or you you you you are an executive director for a great organization or you're a politician or a student um you know doing multiple things that you need a support structure you need mentors and you need advisors to help you along the way and i would just add to your kind of original question was about leveraging civic engagement is just the power of organizing and that could be you know with large organizations but even the power to organize kind of in your own circle when you're passionate about something don't hold that you know um kind of close to the chest talk to your family um talk to your parents talk to your aunts talk to your uncles talk to your friends talk to your neighbors um and you know there's a way to kind of engage in that because i just you know we we've seen it we've seen it recently and hopefully we'll continue to see it when somebody uses their voice to organize so imagine if i was really passionate about something that's really really great and that's where everything starts but if i was to kind of combine forces with tammy right or somebody else it's kind of that that compound so that's the only thing i would add to your kind of how do you leverage support for women is just to make sure don't forget the power of organizing i think we've seen it recently and it's just so critical i absolutely agree with that i think it's so important that we remember that we're not alone like i really truly believe that one is too small a number for greatness and so i if i think back of all the things that i've been able to be involved with it involved other people it involved other women it also involved men who are allies right and so that's important too is to recognize the men in our lives or in our communities that that make way and create space for women to participate i mean i got to work for a latino legislator and there are so many ways that he just he um he affirmed and helped me grow as a professional you know i'm the kind of person i'm an introvert i i don't naturally love to be out front and center but you know but he would often put me in those positions and i think that's important is to leverage those opportunities where you have someone that backs you up you have a community that supports you um and i will make a commitment to all the students that are on this um you know on the zoom event if you're willing to reach out to me on linkedin um tammy tran on linkedin and and i will take you out to lunch um after this pandemic and commit to supporting you as a student because i was a student someone gave me an internship somebody took a chance on me invited me to be a part of an organization or invited me to an event michelle has done that for me lucy has done that for me many folks at cal state fullerton have done that for me and so i commit to you guys for taking your time during this lunch hour to listen to us reach out to me on linkedin i promise i'll take you to lunch and whatever i can do to help you if you want to come work for southern california edison we're always hiring so join us um that's how we leverage civic engagement is by supporting each other and bringing people along with us thank you okay we're um the last question of the of the day before we open it up to um all of you is um where'd i just lost my question sheet um oh here we go from your personal and professional experiences what advice would you give to individuals who want to leverage civic engagement to support women okay you guys this is a i think this is sort of a hard question because we kind of touched on a lot of these factors when we were uh chatting before um the the one thing that i would just is you know women we we have a lot of priorities in our life there's you gotta manage home and family and work because we're all working with managing children as well and so i i would just when you add civic engagement to this one more thing following your pla passion right follow your bliss things that you love um the the one thing is to support you just remember i i you know you can you can't always do everything at one time and so i i am old now these women on this zoom are young and i my old person's advice is to really choose your children make sure your children are are a priority because they're not going to be with you for very long and if and and i love the quote from jacqueline kennedy if you bungle raising your children it doesn't matter what else you do so just from and i'm sharing this with you with a little bit of guilt because there were many times in my career where it seemed that i chose my career over my children they turned out okay thank god but when i look back and i go gosh i wish i had spent more time don't be that person spend the time and recognize that our society is going to cost you the you will pay a price for that because it's not fair it it does result in a lower pay scale you got to catch up there's not equity in pay when you take time off for your kids but i will share with you now and it didn't happen in my generation and it is happening in yours men are taking time off for their kids now and so therefore that pay equity that pay gap isn't going to be there long because when they recognize how important their children are in their lives and you've been doing it all along my advice to you is you can do this take the time off from your kids and don't be afraid that you won't be treated as an equal men are doing it you can do it so engage in civic engagement do your do good work finish your education and those with children that's our future right i mean that's why we have you in school you are our future and um and i would just that would be my my best advice from the older generation i didn't agree more with lucy and she's definitely not old um lucy i um i would say that today um you know and and and i you know we have students here that are fairly young and you know they probably think i'm all too i'm going on 42 years of age uh this august and you know what i would say is this the way i look at civic engagement is you being an active citizen and and i have a you know in the question that i pose as an adjunct professor when i teach i ask my students who do you choose to be for this time for this time not what five years ago 10 years ago or what's ahead of us now be fully present and who do you choose to be for this time and focus on the work that is in front of you so if it's your children focus on your children if it's your family focus on your family if it's your church focus on your church if it's you being an active citizen and wanting to organize from the bottom up do that but don't create more work i think a lot of us want to save the world and we have all these great ideas but there's so much work in front of us that sometimes we tend to miss it because we are thinking globally and it's okay to think globally but you must act locally and i go back to that hyper local perspective and so i leave you all with this who do you choose to be for this time and to and and to have an open heart to be an active citizen is truly civic engagement and and ensure that whatever you do to focus on you self-love self-care and focusing on family does matter in my 12 years of office i will too i will say as well i didn't have children i was fairly young i missed out on a lot of opportunities because i was so dedicated to the job wanting to be the best policymaker santana had but at the same time i realized that i was missing so much in the world in the real world and and they're i could have had so much more could have done so much more as a human being and so what i would say to you all don't think that you can't focus on your family and also be an active citizen because you can do both thank you thank you michelle should i open oh go ahead tammy i'll just add that i'm i'm an example that you can do both um you know i i joined i left um politics and and and now currently work for southern california edison and the first year i was at edison i became pregnant it wasn't planned i did and i freaked out initially but ultimately it worked out i have had two kids since i've been at edison i've gotten promoted twice and and i feel like you can do it all because you have the support of other women the workplace has changed um you know i have mentors at the um you know at edison that you know who are probably 10 15 years ahead of ahead of me who said it was very difficult for them to even talk about having kids or being a working mom that's not the case anymore like nowadays corporate america the business sector and everything being being able to support your working mom your working parent lucy is is something that employees are asking for top talent is asking for that and so i would just end by saying that the advice i would give you is make sure you know what you want in life you know make sure you figure out what how you walk in your purpose because you know i didn't set out to work for edison but i feel like what keeps me uh at the company is not only our broad goals on clean energy future but it's also because they allow me to live the life i want i can be a mom i'm here at home with my kids you know on zoom which i don't want them on zoom but it is what it is but i feel like i can be involved with pta i can be involved in my community i can join a candlelit vigil tonight for those women in in atlanta and so i think that's something that we have to demand of our employer we have to demand of our society that they have to make it work for us because we the future is female tammy is spot on and that is something that is so important that companies are looking to hire is if you have gotten a great cal state fullerton education you are a smart titan and you're going to be romanced by companies you're going to be looking for companies that will enable you to have it all to the extent that that's the opportunity for you right there and so good good talent talented um employees and prospective employees you look for those companies that give you the opportunities that edison does and uh and and if you don't find it at the first job you'll find it at the second job so that's very wise advice that tammy and michelle have both given you and this just you know reinstates that representation really matters that's what i hear from this so um whether you're a woman who chooses not to have children we every single person has a family right and your family is who who you choose whether you have children or not and it's relative to everybody and it's just a huge reminder to me that representation matters so as women um with or without children regardless of age regard like we need to be at the table um to make the economy work for us to make health care work for us to make child care work for us to make income um housing all of it um so representation matters and it's just a huge reminder uh thank you all so much and one of the things i was thinking about amongst all the themes but you all clearly have been mentored and have been mentors to people and i think that's really really really important um and it's also whether we have kids or not if you have kids you're mentoring your kids right so one of the things you do is you take your kids with you right they need to see this stuff but also as a professor i try to involve my students in the work that i do so that you know if they want to go that path they've at least had some experience or introduce them to the people that can give them the experience that they want so i really i thank you all for for being such good mentors um so we have some general questions uh from those who have been listening to this wonderful conversation and um so the first one is how can others be better allies to women and support the female voice one of the things that i really have had fun teaching women is to be good echo chambers for each other men have learned this uh in the business world very very effectively over generations and we women now need to help each other when you're sitting in a meeting or you're doing a group discussion um it's it's very effective for you to say uh well you know tammy just said an important point i'd like to reinforce that because what she in other words be the echo so that because we women don't tend to like to brag did you notice how long it took each of us to just like say who was gonna unmute their mic to answer a question we were all just politely sitting back waiting for each other that's a typical woman thing men on this panel they would have jumped in and go oh me first me first me first but we women are are we tend to be a little more like oh well what's the protocol right so in this world start to help each other by being an echo chamber for another woman uh an echo and her and and amplify her voice to give her power and support while you're also adding to her conversation so that's just one little hint that i would do um uh to to help women and then the other thing is the second point that i reinforced said earlier is women you don't have to be 100 qualified to go after that job raise your hand raise your hand apply don't worry just do it you know that's that's the best way to get your place in the world and and start out okay um this the next question um it was it starts with a comment and then has a question so it says thank you ladies for participating and sharing your expertise with us today given the polarization in our society today what can we as women do to bring us back together for the betterment of our shared community i would say in just it's one word listen we we we have to listen i i think um it's imperative uh for us today um to not just listen but work alongside you know i i when i go into community i don't act like i'm the expert i'm a helper i'm a connector um you know going into a community saying you know i'm the practitioner i'm the expert i'm the one that's going to tell you what's right um sometimes going into the spaces and specifically other spaces we talked about mentorship earlier um when i mentor um other women elected officials throughout this country you know what i share with them is that what's your lived experience let me help understand who you are and then let me listen to that before i try to give any kind of advice um you know because my live experience is very different than their lived experience specifically with someone that i mentor in boise idaho santa ana california boise idaho two different um parts of the state and and different issues and so i i again i would just say um the the most important thing is for us to listen uh specifically in this polarized uh society that we are facing and it's very daunting okay um next question is what for and i think maybe each of you could answer this one what is something surprising that each of you learned in your past civic engagement leadership experiences i'll go it's not that hard it's not that hard to get civically engaged you start having a conversation with someone and it leads to all sorts of opportunities to have your voice heard my my big aha moment was you wouldn't know that now but i i was painfully shy and i still think of myself as sort of an introvert extrovert i mean i can do these zoom things and i public speak all the time but my little aha moment is my company had asked me to do a press conference on this major project highly contentious project in the press every single day and i was supposed to do the press conference and they the reason was is they said because a woman on this issue has more credibility than a man and that's why we want you talking to the press and i was petrified i'd never done that before never spoken to the press never had to take questions so i had to do a presentation and this and they said no you're you're going to do this and i think i must have been all of i don't know i mean it sounds old now but maybe i was 38 or 37 or something and handling my first press conference and as i was standing up there scared to death with 20 reporters in front of me and i'm putting on my my presentation and then i if the aha moment came the surprise came for me when all these reporters started asking me questions about this project and i was able to answer the questions and i articulated in a way that made them understood i understood my audience because i couldn't speak in jargon speak i had to speak in a way that a reporter could write an answer or to put stuff in nouns and verbs together that made sense to a general reader audience and i had a moment as they were asking me questions where i thought to myself i suddenly stood up taller and i went wow i actually can do this i i can do this i i know my product i know my my my you know um project uh and i'm able to answer and it was it was one of those moments where you suddenly became more powerful and more confident just by doing someone threw me in the pool and i learned to swim right there and i made it to the goal line and afterwards the stories got written and the the press conference was a success but it wasn't the surprise for me was actually petrified and then just doing it um so as a result i i do a lot of press conferences so it's kind of it's kind of interesting when you but you kind of learn your gifts right who knew that that was a gift that i could do and and that you could do public speaking i didn't know until someone a man pushed me in front of a microphone and said we think you can do this and uh and that was kind of fun that was kind of a nice nice revelation do either of the last two of you want to share a surprise we have a couple more minutes i would say for for me um one of the surprises is that small beds small things you know a lot of us think big is sexy you know that's what makes the the headlines but it's those small little projects or those small little efforts within civic engagement or advocacy that could have ripple effects and and i've seen that time and time in my work of addressing homelessness and you know i'll tell you that in all my years of service and dealing with public service there's no more gratitude and grace and and just um this this love for helping those people that are focusing on wanting to help at the neighborhood level and are making drastic changes the world may not know about it their city council may not know about it but they're changing lives block by block and sometimes it's those small bets that have ripple effects you had to start where you are just start i think every single person has kind of come back to that just start don't hold back don't be afraid don't worry about like so-called failure it's all just learning um and if you're not you know we all learn along the way and it's okay to change your mind that's actually um you know a very good thing and it shows growth and resilience so just start that's it just start well i i want to say a personal thank you all for sharing so much wisdom and insight with everyone today and as a historian of women as somebody who you know has studied grassroots activism and civic engagement for most of my career i am appreciative of the work that you are all doing today and you're standing on the shoulders of women who have been doing it in this nation for a very long time and i think sometimes people forget that right they they forget how long women have been working maybe not in the front of the house but behind the scenes uh you know and from places that people have missed as you know as as you were all talking about in your neighborhood that doesn't get seen right that's where you know for a very long time women were making a big difference but nobody saw it um and now people are paying attention because we have uh you know more women than ever in congress more women of color than ever in congress um but but women have been doing this work and i i think more of us need to keep doing it and i think i think we've got all the questions yeah um thank you so much um to our panelists for a moderator and our partners in alumni engagement in government external relations for for our talk today i personally felt super empowered let me tell you i went up and looked up like ways to get involved in like boards and city councils in my local city so thank you so much for empowering and and sharing your stories and then and giving us the opportunity to kind of remember it doesn't matter where you start but you have to start somewhere right so thank you so much for for that um today um i want to remind everybody that this conversation will be posted on our diup youtube channel with closed up captioning for folks who um didn't catch the whole thing or wish to share this with somebody else who couldn't make it today um i also want to thank all our attendees for coming um please keep a look out for our next titan table talk it will be on october 14th um and i hope folks enjoy the rest of social justice week um we have a ton more events that are happening um we have a keynote speaker friday um w kamal bell will be here to speak to our campus about social justice we have a lot of different other programs titan night market will be happening tomorrow night so um if you can please come and enjoy more programs and events and workshops and once again thank you so much for our panelists thank you so much to our moderator today to to kind of remind us right of the power of the female voice so thank you so much to everybody goodbye and take care everyone thank you natalie thank you seesaw thank you thank you president graham bye everybody hi everybody go titans you guys were incredible really really amazing thank you all of you you guys were i i i you know i'm i'm so proud to be led by you it's just you were really really inspiring thank you so much thank you bye everybody bye here you", "bp-yFFISKb4": "what is up everyone and welcome to another episode of how to sculpt with handmade hairs now a topic i want to discuss is something which holly ever gets discussed um a lot of people tend to think that painting is their only option now of course there's a whole bunch of different polymer clay brands some of them come in a set cutter we have to paint them with acrylic paint after you've done the official sculpt and then you have to use some form of a coating like a uv resin or something like that to kind of coat it to protect it from dust and fading and sun damage and all this kind of stuff just be careful when using the coating make sure to do your proper research as i've tried using different products and it didn't work as well anyway back to back to the topic okay so what this video about is about is i'm going to talk about color mixing when it comes to polymer clay where you have individual colors now yes you can go buy each and every individual color that's going to cost you a hell of a lot of money so stuff i picked up on different forums and stuff like this is people have a tendency to kind of guide people in the wrong way when it comes to mixing up colors especially when it comes to lightening your color or darkening it up either saying use white clay to lighten your color or use black clay to darken up your color in some instance there's very little that does actually work but for most parts there's a very big difference between a faded color and a lightened color if you're just going to go if you're going to have a set green and you're just going to add white to that that's just going to fade that color it's not going to lighten the color where as with black you have the problem if you're going to use too much black any color would easily go gray without it it turns into gray it turns into a horrible mess okay so with white pretty much you first gonna work on your original color that you want say now for instance um green you're gonna have a mix of yellow and blue you're gonna mix it you're gonna get your green then if you wanted more of a lighter green you're gonna go more yellow if you wanted more of like a c c green you're gonna go more blue it's like that kind of stuff that you that you have to look at like if you're gonna calm down that color then you're gonna use a little bit of white okay now with black with black you use very little but that is kind of like how to make the color neutral so so now for instance you've mixed up your colors but the color is too bright or you want to you don't want to fade it you just want to have a little bit more of a natural looking color then you'll add a little bit of black mix it in and i'm talking about the speck of black clay okay so without further ado let me get into it and i'm going to show you how to mix up your different colors with particular clay if you're not big on painting for most part you are going to have to do some little bits of paintings out for instance you're doing faces or whatever the case might be i'm not sure what what kind of stuff you want to do but this topic is literally about mixing the clay into certain colors so i'm going to cover the ones that i know that are quite popular you get like a whole variety of different colors as long as you have this set of colors um with these colors you can pretty much make up any kind of color you can think of you have the whole library of colors that you can use okay so let's get into it okay so to start it off i'm going to start with maroon now maroon is one of the popular ones that people make a mistake of what you would do is you would start with your your bigger mass being your red and then slowly starting working blue into your red here i did a bit too much blue with the red and i came what came out was like a really dark maroon but it's always better to work backwards so start with a really small little bit of blue and then start mixing it into your red up until you have the marine color that you want now obviously you're going to have to play around with balance when it comes to all kinds of colors when you're playing with balance that means like you have to start small and then work your way up you'll see as i go along and then i'm going to tie it and do another maroon i'm adding more red to it you'll see the color lightens but it doesn't fade which you want to try and avoid okay just beforehand i want to mention as well there's a time the yellow that i have that i used in this video is called lemon yellow now that is not the actual color that you're going to want to use when mixing up standard colors if you go look through the fimo packets or something like that you want the basic yellow not the any kind of weird yellow not the golden yellow not the like lime yellow no weird yellows basic yellow okay so there you can see i've mixed up this is some more red that original mixture and you can see that's the color that's coming out that is pretty much maroon now the same thing goes for when you want to create navy but then you're going to start with a big mass of blue clay and then start working it in with a little bit of red clay at a time trying to see if you get the navy color that you want if you do too much at the same time it will just end up with a color that usually is not the color that you would want so yeah you can start with a big bowl of blue and then start working a little bit of red once again just mentioning it you need to use the basic colors not the other random ones there you see like i made these little schematics hopefully they will be helpful as i'm as i'm going through the video a fair bit fast we'll see this the first i think ball i rolled was just a tad darker than the other one just to kind of give you an overall idea of what that yeah that you can see at the the darkening of the blue because usually like these are the two ones that are most popular on forums and stuff like that when people say how do i get navy how do i get maroon and people would usually say add a bit of black no you don't add a bit of black that does not work you either add a little bit blue to your red or a little little bit of red to your blue that's for navy and marooned there you go there you have it like navy and you can go for a bit darker as well you can see i'm just giving another guide iron it's always the balance between the blue and the red when it comes to these two particular colors but this is not a bad thing me using the lime yellow this is the this is the um clayology brand i didn't they didn't have the basic yellow i had two yellows i had the um golden yellow which is not actually yellow and then the lime yellow which is a faded yellow where you want to use the basic yellow but i came up with a few colors while using this particular color okay there you can see that is pretty much maroon and there's not too much blue in it so you have the the ideal color for the moon that you would want okay next up i use green once again just mentioning it i'm not using the the correct yellow so the green that i came up with this is a faded yellow the green that i came up with was a jade green the color called is called jade but you'll see it's actually quite a nice color always make sure all as well when you're mixing your colors that you've thoroughly mixed it because sometimes the thing does happen but you think you thoroughly mixed it you bake it off and afterwards you see you got like these weird like little colored lines within your clay so it's always good to like just make sure that you really mix it up well okay once again if you had the normal yellow that would have been green but i ended up because i used the lime yellow with a turquoise color which is also quite nice now if you want to buy the ideal set of clays like fema has like these big packets i think they're like i'm not sure about the size but these big elongated packets i think they're like 475 grams or something like that those ones are the basic colors so if you want to buy one of the smaller packets compared to those particular sizes and you'll know that is the basic color those big packets don't come in weird colors saying the small ones that have all these different name colors and stuff like that and you can see you got the turquoise where if you had the normal yellow that would have turned into a normal green this is always use small little bits of cake to kind of test it out before doing something if you're not quite sure okay next step this is another cutter that i've never used but it's a color that you might be might have used for is coral once again it's the lime yellow that i'm using and i'm mixing it up with a little bit of red always be careful when you buy these different packets with the the smaller sizes usually your big brackets or the standard colors like for instance the red i'm using here is the right color red but the wrong color yellow that's how i ended up with the coral because it's the the faded version of the yellow because what i actually wanted to do is give you an a basic orange color uh reason for the orange color is you'll see in a few moments i'm going to show you how to do the flesh tones yeah i'm busy with it now now what you like you'll see like i mixed quite a bit because i'm kind of kind of used to it now like mixing up the colors and stuff but pretty much the overall idea is how to mix up your own colors be it flesh nude or champagne now the only difference between these three or the variations between the how much red how much yellow and how much how much white as well where nude is usually a fair bit of white champagne is a bit more yellow and flesh is a bit more towards the red side also another thing seeing that i was just mixing up all these places for like on the kind of the purpose of the videos always just like when mixing clays and stuff just make sure as soon as you're done make sure to use baby powder on your hands your hands are dry and not too moist the clay doesn't stick to your hands or compress onto your hands also make sure that you wash your hands if you have clay that's compact on your hands wash your hands with dishwashing liquid and the form of a scrub otherwise like normal soap doesn't take this stuff off your hands you'll see now i'm playing around with the idea of adding more yellow to the color that i had there but yeah i think soon a little schematic will come up like to give you like more or less an idea of how you can get flesh tones flesh champagne and nude oh yeah i hear the schematics come up in a few seconds it's always just like balancing it out as long as you have the general idea down of what you need to be making it would make life a lot easier they see it's a like the the sizes that are represented in these like little schematics is just to give you an overall idea of what you kind of look at yeah oh there's a fair bit of white and there's very little black that's once again just to make the color more natural the only times when you actually use a fair bit of black is when you want to make gray specifically you can use a little bit of black in your different clay colors but i'm talking about like very little it's just to neutralize the color but because it's very easy for instance saying are you gonna use a maroon or a navy to add a little bit of black and for that clay to turn out gray so yes you can use a little bit of black sorry but if if you're going to use a little bit too much that's going to end up gray same with the purple same with most of the colors there i have another brand that was already which i bought which was already flashed on um just comparing like the colors you can see like that one has got a bit more yellow i don't want to mix any more yellow because i don't have the right color yellow so i'll try it again once more one more time mixing up yellow but you'll see mine is a little bit too on there's too much white every time i'm adding my yellow to that particular yellow but the other one's got like a solid yellow mixed into that formula but you can easily if you have the right colors you can easily like recreate these colors i don't know why i added more lights i was that was a mistake okay now the brown is once again just like balancing it out to the kind of brown you want if you want more on the reddish side you're going to use more red black you always use very little bits of black into your clay to kind of see that you don't darken it up too much or it doesn't go to a gray color even there just with that little example there you can already see like just that little bit of black that i used there that that made that brown quite quite dark you know it's almost at the point of if i had to add a little bit more black chances are that's gonna start going gray very soon mixing some red within that brown obviously once again saying it's all about balancing it out like playing around with the different colors like different sections of clay if you want more to the lighter side you're going to go to yellow if you wanted more on the darker on the redder side you're going to go to red the more dark and black you can use that but use it in small little sections bit by bit working it in seeing what it ends up as because if you don't mix it up properly and there might be black clay that you didn't see and you start editing it there might be a black smudge and that might darken up the clay so yeah it's always just good to really properly condition your clay to make sure that the color is consistent through the whole bowl of clay there we go there's a decent color brown now okay next up i think i'm gonna make uh i can't remember what i'm gonna do now i think i'm going to be making pink oh no this is actually quite important but okay so now i use the what is that yeah the jaded color the jade green i split it into two it's all both the same color but i'm going to show you like what's the difference between mixing white with that particular color or mixing the as the overall color is green i'm going to mix in a bit of yellow you'll see how how drastic and what's the difference between what i'm talking about about lightening up the clay or fading the clay sometimes you might want it to fade but if if you want something that like like is like pops on the eye you you don't want to go with dimmed colors okay so you'll see the first bit of green the jade green i'm mixing up with white you'll see afterwards like the kind of the comparison between the two afterwards i'm going to mix the other green with the yellow which is also not the right yellow it's so it's it's not going to be the best example but you can see the the difference between the two okay there if you compare that to the original one it's it's quite quite different okay now mixing up the yellow within to the to the other bit of green you'll see it brightens it up it's not as faded it's actually more it's better it's easy on the eyes where the the faded you know that like i've made that mistake many times but i've just added a lot of white and eventually it just looks it looks horrible so it's it's rather better to mix it in within the parameters of the colors that was used in the clay to begin with and soon you'll see like a little zooming of the two different clays with the two different mixes and you'll see what a big difference it makes obviously you also have to kind of keep in mind like do you just want to um like the type of balance you want to use now if you compare the two that one is like more you know it's lighter but it's a bit brighter it's better on the eye with the other one see the the difference the fade between the the one on the left and the one on the right a very big difference sorry the zooming in options not that great but yeah you get the idea okay and then also i want to show you another thing um sometimes you add like i said earlier in the video sometimes if you add a bit of black it neutralizes the color it doesn't necessarily mean it's grays it turns down if the color is too harsh so if if the color is too if you're making like something more serious and that kind of stuff i don't know if you i think if you're doing jewelry and you're done something that looks like too child-oriented that's the kind of stuff you're going to use you're going to use a little bit of black in your clay especially if that's how you do it i don't know i think most people paint paint the jewelry i'm not sure i don't do jewelry but you'll see as i mix it up like the green gets um you know it darkens up it doesn't go gray it's a very it's so so little um black that it actually just like gives it a little like push and then a few seconds you'll see what i'm talking about about the the like um the natural tone of the color see more more standard nothing crazy nothing too harsh on eye just like neutralize that color as you wanted it okay now the next color this is not going to be the most amazing thing i'm just mixing up pink the only reason i'm mixing up pink is because i want to show you how to do purple now if you want to make some purple pretty much what you're going to do is you're going to take your pink it's also once again a balance between the red and the white to mix up your pink if you're on a bright pink or a light pink and that's the same like usually blue and pink those are the only ones that you can't actually play around with the color you can you can take them down quite a bit with white but for the rest uh it's it doesn't work too well okay there you see i have a pink then i'm gonna add a bit of red just to darken it up a little bit and also once again using the correct balance with mixing up the clays when it comes to the purple with purple it's pretty much you mixing up pink a fair bit of pink and a little bit of blue you can play around with the idea it's all all in your hands it's up to you how you want to do it but yeah that's pretty much the overall idea of the of the mixing of colors you can create a whole bunch of different ones it's literally playing around with these basic ideas sorry for the for the wrong color when it came to the to the lemon yellow if you have the basic colors your color schematics are going to be a much better i'm actually going to have to go buy myself to correct yellow very soon because yeah like i only realized that now i have a golden yellow which is not yellow which is like a very bright orange and then lime yellow which is a very faded yellow now you can see they're just taking a bit of blue mixing into the pink and in a few seconds we'll have the color purple yeah i'm just seeing that i make so much like there was a few times i had to wash my hands in between because i started getting color off onto my fingers and mixing it into the clay but i wasn't too worried because i'm going to use this clay for like another little random project so it's fine and yeah there you go there you have your purple anyway thank you so much guys i hope you really enjoyed this video i hope it helps as i said you all you need is the basic colors then you can play around with it from there you don't need all these different colors if not if you have a one standard color just paint it anyway thank you so much guys i really appreciate your viewing you", "FY-b6C9_Hfs": "pruning is an essential production practice on citrus fox if the right practices for the citrus types and conditions on the farm are applied at the right time of the year the farmer will reap benefits in terms of production volumes of the desired fruit size higher export perhaps more efficient pests and disease control improved fruit color and quality better rind integrity lower picking costs and greater efficiency in production practices around South Africa's citrus pruning strategies vary greatly some growers do annual maintenance pruning while others only prune trees every three or four years some prune straight after picking while others wait and prune closer to the end of winter some employ mechanical pruning while others go nowhere near it and use only manual pruning and some use a combination of the two no matter the pruning strategy the same factors expected outcomes and limitations are in play across-the-board what factors do we need to take into account when considering how best to achieve the outcomes that we want from pruning firstly we need to understand how citrus trees grow and develop here we look at growth factors that have direct bearing on pruning but we recommend that you watch the audiovisual module on plant structures and functions where you will find more information on the subject the plants vascular system consists mainly of xylem and phloem xylem transports water and nutrients from roots to leaves where they are metabolized into food for the plant in the form of carbohydrates phloem transports the food that has been metabolized by the leaf to other plant parts for storage roots stems trunks and leaves all contain vascular tissue that is connected and forms the vascular system of the blood how is food metabolized by leaves photosynthesis is the process by which green plants use sunlight to turn water and carbon dioxide into carbohydrates these carbohydrates are stored in the plant until they are needed for vegetative growth flowering and fruit growth respiration is the process by which stored carbohydrates are turned into energy in plant cells during photosynthesis half the water molecules absorbed by the plant are released back into the atmosphere through the leaves this process is called transpiration in order for a plant to grow well and develop fruit of good quality and size it is essential that is vascular system and metabolic processes are robust and efficient for photosynthesis to take place sunlight is critical a citrus tree is geared to grow so that its leaves can get the maximum sun exposure by pruning we can open up the canopy of the tree to allow sunlight to penetrate so that leaves shoots and good quality fruiting wood developed throughout the canopy when more healthy leaves are exposed to sunlight transpiration and photosynthesis increase producing more carbohydrates which leads to higher respiration and means the tree and its fruit will be healthier and more robust another relevant factor if the action plants used to transport water through xylem cells - leaves for photosynthesis xylem cells are tubes which do not actively transport substances the plant depends on transpiration to pull water through xylem up to the leaves if photosynthesis is sluggish because of the lack of sunlight transpiration will also drop therefore if there is little foliage in the shaded parts of the tree such as a dead zone within the tree canopy less water and nutrients are pulled to that part of the tree citrus trees have two to five growth flushes per year depending mostly on create during each flush new stems leaves and axillary buds grow when both are induced to flower flowering shoots which become fruit bearing would grow from exile rebirth of recent growth flashes leaving flowers develop and grow only where there is enough sunlight if the tree canopy has been allowed to get so dings that it is shaded inside all the flowers and fruiting wood will develop on the outside of the canopy leaving a dead zone inside at the same time if trees have been allowed to grow too tall they will shade the lower parts of tree canopies in neighbouring rows forcing fruit bearing wood and leaves to grow higher and higher up this complicates production practices and causes stems and shoots to dry out and die inside the shaded tree canopy which makes dead wood dead wood is undesirable for a number of reasons of which the most important are that it causes wind damaged fruit and it plays host to latent pathogens new shoes can grow directly from all the branches inside the canopy often where pruning cuts were made or where Deadwood was broken off these water shoots often tend to grow very fast to get out of the canopy into the sunlight and they tend to be thin and weak because they grow fast and tall they are often responsible for increasing the tree height another relevant aspects of foliar development is the response of the tree after pruning pruning induces new growth / pausing new shoots and leaves to grow from places where cuts were made and we previously shaded thoughts are now exposed to sufficient sunlight if cuts were made on the outer shell of the canopy ash tend to happen with mechanical pruning it means that the canopy will rapidly become even more overgrown dense and shaded the natural structure of most citrus types consists of a single trunk from which a number of lateral scaffolding branches grow at different heights scaffolding branches develop into strong thick branches and they branch out further into smaller secondary branches it is important to keep branching as simple as possible the further removed bearing wood is from the central trunk the more inefficient the transport of water and nutrients to fruit becomes which has a direct impact on fruit size bent or crushed branches are also not desirable the different growth habits of citrus types cultivars and rootstocks are important in deciding the pruning strategy it is essential that a grower must be familiar with the habits and requirements of the types cultivars and rootstock under his management with regard to vegetative growth trees on root stocks such as rough lemon tend to grow vigorously which can exacerbate the problem of dense shaded canopies and excessive street size especially in hot climates certain citrus types and cultivars such as mandarins lemons and Delta Valencia's also tend to grow more vigorously some Mandarin hybrids such as inadequate or and more have a habit of growing long shoots from the central trunk which grow up widths at a sauce rate these trees can rapidly become very tall and difficult to manage in terms of where and how particular types or cultivars tend to be fruit orange and lemon types came to be single fruit on stems while some Mandarin cultivars came to bear fruit in bunches as can clearly be seen from the differences in how they flower great fruit is sensitive to sunburn and develops a deeper color in the shade and we therefore encourage trees to bear fruit on the inside of the tree canopy away from direct sunlight linens has multiple fruit shakes during a year which is a unique characteristic this means that at a given time when it's likely to find fruit in all stages on one tree from bud to blossom to small fruit to mature fruit this can make the timing of pruning challenging certain citrus types and cultivars are disposed to alternate bearing which means that the tree will bear a lot of fruit one year and almost none the next season this can have significant financial repercussions for a grower radical pruning especially on young trees and also forced trees into alternate bearing pruning enables the careful management of fruit bearing wood and can break alternate bearing cycles the prevailing climatic conditions on the farm can have a significant impact on the pruning strategy that is employed transpiration photosynthesis and respiration rates are all affected by temperature photosynthesis and transpiration is optimal between 15 and 35 degrees Celsius at 35 degrees the stomata on the leaves close to prevent any further water loss the respiration rate however keeps increasing as the temperature increases this is why in hot areas and in particular when nighttime temperatures are high in summer and they are excessive hot days citrus trees tend to grow very vigorously at the other extreme in areas where frost occurs during winter new growth can't die back if trees are pruned too early so to synthesis and transpiration slow down completely when temperatures drop below 10 degrees Celsius and respiration becomes sluggish which means that little growth takes place even if there is no frost low temperatures will inhibit regrowth after pruning when there is a major course of cosmetic damage to citrus fruit in windy areas it is even more important to remove dead wood from inside the tree canopy to limit damage to fruit and to prune young trees to have a balanced canopy less likely to be damaged by wind prefacing decides the space available to each tree canopy in high density plantings there's no space for each tree canopy to be flat and open and trees are often allowed to grow taller trees in such orchards also forms a hedgerow sooner than in orchards with a more conventional tree spacing in very low density plantings on the other hand there is space for the tree canopies to spread out which requires a different approach to pruning increasing the efficiency of production practices while keeping production costs as low as possible is central to the profitability of a citrus production unit there are a number of essential production practices that are relevant to pruning an agro chemical product is only as effective as its application applying spray material to trees that are too tall and too dense is ineffective and problematic Spray material cannot penetrate a tree canopy that is too dense this means that pests and pathogens inside the canopy can survive and flourish a situation that is exacerbated if there is dead wood inside the canopy hosting latent pathogens as a rule of thumb if you look through a tree canopy and cannot see the trees in the row behind the canopy is too dense to be penetrated effectively by spray material trees that are too tall present a similar problem most spray machine towers have a maximum coverage height of around 4 meters if trees are taller than this spray material will not reach the crown of the tree as an illustration it has been found that there is a high prevalence of citrus black spot in the Crown's of pole trees which poses a phytosanitary risk for the grower agro chemical stem applications and spreading of granular fertilizers are made more difficult if workers struggle to access the space under trees this can also make irrigation maintenance more difficult Phytophthora is a soil borne disease that causes brown rot in Sakura spirit this is a particular danger for low-hanging fruit if soil gets onto the fruit either by them touching the ground or by rainwater splashing up onto them the risk of Phytophthora contamination is too high for fruit to be exported African citrus greening is a bacterial disease which results in the chronic decline of citrus trees once a tree is infected with a bacteria the tree can still be saved if the branches showing disease symptoms are removed African citrus greening is spread by the Victor citrus Siller which is attracted to new growth / it is important to scout for Silla on regrowth after pruning and to put control measures in place citrus seller also prefers the shade and is attracted to dense tree canopies Alden area causes decay in oranges and cosmetic lesions on certain soft citrus varieties the more dense the tree canopy the more conducive the microclimate for the development of the disease and the less efficient the spray application of control products during the harvest Pickers must be able to get into the tree canopies to reach all the ripe fruit on the tree if trees are too high they need to use ladders which is time-consuming more costly and can be dangerous if the letters are too long letters can also damage the tree and the fruit it is much faster and safer if speakers can work from the ground what is it then that we want to achieve with pruning taking into account all of the factors discussed improved light interception inside the tree canopy is the first important outcome from pruning sunlight inside the canopy encourages the development of flowers leaves and fruit throughout the canopy and increases productivity this also leaves dead wood and fewer water shoots in the canopy increasing the fruit bearing wood inside the canopy is essential remember that the impact of pruning will be seen the next season on early to mid season varieties if pruned directly after harvest but do seasons on full eight varieties like Valencia's when a fruit bearing wood that is now unable to grow will bear fruit this long-term view is important and must be kept in mind firmly they are however also more immediate benefits of improved light interception in the improvement in fruit volumes size and quality improved light interception will mean that the tree will be able to deliver more water and growth energy to the fruit improving volumes size and internal quality it has also been found that greater light interception inside the canopy improves the integrity of the fruit rind which fortifies the fruit against chilling injury and other physiological rhymed disorders light interception is improved by making windows in the tree canopy at the top or at the sides windows at the side are particularly suitable for cultivars where sunburn on fruit is an issue as is the case will grab fruit ideally they should be dabbled shade almost like leopard spots inside the canopy this action will also thin out the canopy enough to allow spray material to penetrate tree height impacts on the efficiency of a number of production practices and also causes shading of trees in neighboring rose generally speaking the ideal tree height depends on the space between rows a guideline for calculating ideal tree height is to double the distance between rows measured canopy to canopy for example for mature trees 1.8 meters is a practical distance to have between the canopies this converts to an ideal tree height of 3.6 meters keeping branching as simple as possible is another important outcome the Bruno must be on the lookout for crossed bent or overly complex branches because this compromises fruit quality pruning is also used to help young trees develop a desirable tree structure the slices between rows must be kept wide enough to be accessible for practice and spray machines they should also not be shoulders protruding into the rows please are skirted to keep this space under the canopies open and accessible skirting also limits the danger of fruit hanging on the ground being exposed to fight off or a contamination increase in Altered rows uniform in terms of the shape and size makes production practices more efficient for example Spri machines are usually calibrated for the largest trees in the road and if many of the trees are smaller a large amount of spray material is wasted uniformity is difficult to achieve and may not even be possible because trees get injured or die it is however still a desirable outcome worth pursuing deadwood must be removed during pruning as must all broken or damaged browsers Bruna's must also be on the lookout for branches that may be infected with African citrus greening if these branches are removed the disease might not spread to the rest of the tree suckers that grow from the root stock must also be removed water shoots with triangular green stems growing from the base of the canopy should be removed however if there is a shortage of fruit bearing wood inside the tree canopy which may be the case if the canopy has been too dense water shoots originating from framework or secondary branches can be topped to about the length of a pruning shear to sprout and form bearing wood in the allotted space opinions differ on the age at which trees should first be pruned if trees are pruned at too young and age it will prolong the juvenility and limit development on the other hand is left too long the tree may grow too complex and develop a dense canopy which will require radical brewing this practice advocates lightly and selectively pruning trees from as young as one or two years to manage their shape to maintain balance in the canopy and to encourage framework development regular light pruning also encourages foliage development if trees are pruned properly every year and they are not subjected to extraordinary stress it is possible to maintain the trees and altered very close to an ideal state for its whole lifespan without ever having to take radical pruning action however if pruning has been neglected or if trees have been subjected to extraordinary stress or damage such as from disease hail wind storms floods lightning frost also via drought or if it has been damaged mechanically it is necessary to take corrective pruning action which may have to be quite radical although it is of course not always possible to avoid extraordinary stress and damage to trees it is better to have a regular maintenance pruning programming place that avoids radical pruning as a result of neglect heavy radical pruning removes a lot of the total tree mass including foliage and quality fruit bearing wood this is a shock to the tree a world regrowth response is likely along with a drastically lower yield at least in the first year after pruning please could even be forced into an alternate bearing cycle in cases where pruning has been neglected and trees have grown too big and dings it is better to improve light interception and bring height and sprague down gradually over two to three years when and how often do we prune young tree is not yet in production are pruned more than once a year until they come to fruit bearing age once trees are in production they are pruned at least twice a year the main pruning is usually done in winter soon after picking has been completed followed by a summer pruning which is important to manage regrowth and maintain light distribution in the canopy however managing regrowth throughout the season is recommended the timing of winter pruning is important ideally the best time to prune is during the coldest period of the winter to reduce the intensity of regrowth however in practice we prune directly after harvest in order to have sufficient time to prune all the objects best practice is to follow up winter pruning with summer pruning to remove unwanted regrowth particularly when a Christmas tree growth response things to occur on most cultivars especially soft citrus varieties it is desirable to prune more regularly during the year to control regrowth and manage the density of the canopy if summer pruning is neglected it might cause the canopy to become dings and shaded before the fruit inside the canopy has matured Bruning can be done manually or mechanically manual pruning is done by hand the benefit of manual pruning is that it allows one to be selective in terms of the vegetation that is removed and it also allows one to make cuts inside the canopy it is however labor-intensive and slow and requires cramed Bruner's pruners must be given instructions that precisely set out what they need to do how many windows must be cut in each tree how high should the trees be what should the minimum canopy to canopy distance be between rows should they remove water shoots or top and bend them at what height should trees be skirted in the citrus pruning practices model we look at how these instructions are executed manual pruning requires equipment in the pruning equipment module we look at what equipment is suitable for different tasks and also look at how equipment should be clean and maintained in principle however it is important to buy the best quality equipment you can afford and to make sure that it lasts by incentivizing workers to take care of their equipment using cheap poor quality equipment leads to inefficiency higher costs and it can cause damage to trees and injury to workers mechanical pruning makes use of machines with large blades that drive in orchard rows and cut trees back it is the best way to cut trees in a row into the same size and shape and to bring down trees to a uniform size mechanical pruning removes vegetation in bulk without being selective by its very nature it makes a multitude of small cuts on the outside of the canopy this means that the tree has a wild regrowth response which results in bushing where the vegetation was removed often in the shape of chicken feet this can cause canopies to become even denser and more shaded it must also be noted that the bearing wood on Danes trees is on the outside of the canopy where they is sufficient sunlight by using mechanical pruning most of this bearing wood will be removed it is therefore impossible to achieve the desired results with mechanical pruning alone and it should always be used in combination with manual pruning once pruning has been completed we need to deal with cut vegetation on the orchard floor open pruning wounds and expose tree trunks it is practical to mulch cut vegetation in the orchard and spread it under the trees this has the added benefits of limiting evaporation from the soil and of allowing the vegetation to break down to compost in the orchard it is however important that it must be mulched fine enough to allow for composting best practice is to treat all pruning wounds with a diameter of more than two and a half centimeters with wound sealant this will protect the wounds from secondary pathogens and will decrease the chances of died back if trees have been proved radically and the trunk and branches have been exposed to direct sunlight it is important to protect them against sunburn applying diluted white PVA paint is an effective sunscreen pruning should not be viewed as a cost item for a farm if the correct pruning strategy is employed it can make a significant contribution to the income generated by the farm there should be the aim of every production manager to employ pruning as a central strategy to improving yields exports and income", "EnpG9pY3dY8": "[Music] hey welcome to the infuse show it's the month of march i'm here with mike hello and francesca hi how are you guys doing this morning you know it's still got snow on the ground and we're navigating the icy paths outside and it's the middle of winter and yeah all those things mike you're joining us from uh up in new york and you guys snow on the ground we have several feet of snow on the ground here so it's a winter wonderland i love it up here it's kind of like a nice retreat but i can get a lot done and um still enjoy the outdoors too yeah and through the magic of technology we can all be together doing our show it's our favorite thing um so i wanted to share something with you guys i don't know if you knew i got this special telegram uh provided by uh frankie fifth your producer extraordinaire and um yesterday we had a couple of articles published by big organizations that said the following that the summer of 2021 has the possibility to be a lot like the summer of 2019. that's good news yeah i mean i mean isn't that just the thought of that isn't that amazing yeah i've been reading similar stuff too especially as it relates to the east coast where we are and just the rate that the vaccines are coming out and like i'm cautiously optimistic that by even early summer we're all set with you know everybody and her immunity and all that stuff so this is really really good news it really is and i i i just when we can all return to regular patterns without even thinking about it where if it's you know four o'clock in a weekend at the beach your body just goes to the starboard you don't even have to don't worry about the mask yeah don't worry about the mess don't worry about any of that stuff and so i thought today okay at a time where you know we still do have snow on the ground here in delaware snow on the ground up in new york where mike is um we are all yearning for a return to warmer temperatures for baseball for the beach for all things summer and what concerts yes yes outdoor events summer outdoor concerts and i thought of something you know when those summer days early june days are uh school days are shorter you know are uh they're coming to an end and remember around early june when you were a kid and you heard that the carnival was setting up shop in town i mean was there anything cooler than that yeah that was awesome you see them setting the rides up and you know daily progress like that i i just carnivals were one of the the staples of my youth it was the it was the beginning of summer they totally marked the beginning of summer for me and they they came in order like the same carnivals visited every year and so it was like oh okay say helena's is first that means that we're getting there and then there's like the italian festival or it's just so much fun to see the rides and the lights and it's like breathes a little party into um a community and it's it's so fun it really does and there's this almost implied understanding where if you you buy that ticket you get to be part of the show whether you know you really are part of this show and that was one of the things that francesca mike and i talked about at one time we always heard this term in our business in the cannabis space of the ah man it's the wild west it's the wild west and a lot of times we don't think that's entirely accurate i guess um but we for you today would like to throw an analogy your way one that we use all the time uh ladies and gentlemen we're going to take you to the carnival today we have a special treat for you guys so so if i may ladies and gentlemen boys and girls wait a minute now we're all about compliance here in the infused shows and not boys and girls adults over 21. it's an adult carnival today on the infuse show please join me as we walk through the midway of marijuana marvels and we try our best not to be a mark and we're not going to become a mark when they see us walking down the midway today because we have mike patterson we have francesca vavla we have our guides who can walk with us into the can of carnival and walk through these attractions so uh wow this is a lot of responsibility francesca i feel like all of a sudden the pressure ramped on me real quick here see i love that i'm i'm so ready i've i've been to the carnival i know they are tricks my grandparents were carnies oh that's a different episode yeah there's a big reveal there i don't know if you guys knew oh her her grandmother would tell me all the damn carny tricks and i was like man you you were you had no principles no ethics you were straight up carny when i'm looking around guys it's there is a vast landscape here it's crowded um there are several people grouping in different attractions but the one closest to us up here on the left i can barely make it out but uh the the tent says the great ganja seer of all things master of marijuana marvels and indica illusions now it also in small print in small print it says he also has the workaround to the credit card oh so we're in the magic tent i see we are in the magic tent francesca now from a a newbie like myself um i you know i got plenty of tickets i got money in my pocket what am i going to get when i enter this particular tent this is so much fun because i personally i love good magic tricks good illusionists um fortune tellers that are convincing anybody that's in that sphere of the metaphysical or the not easily explainable when it comes to actual carnivals with the can of carnival we have a very similar landscape they're still illusionists there are still people that are trying to convince you that something is there and it's actually not there are people that may be sawing a woman in half but don't worry she's just fine you don't get to pieces you still get the one hole um there's people that have these secrets these inside secrets that they think they can give to you as the the magic key to unlock the entire wide world of cannabis and that you can walk up and own it if you just know this little piece of it it's it's that magic for formula or um secret potion and there's also the the fortune tellers you know the people that are going to try and predict the future whether that's the investors because they certainly need to have some semblance of that the illusion of control and predictability of the future or it's the um the research companies which are fantastic for their own you know things and they're they're meaningful but to consider the history of cannabis as a major factor for the future of cannabis is just an illusion right now because things are moving so fast and forward that the past becomes not as meaningful when it's such a short past and such a limited exposure to the past so you do have people in the cannabis community that act as these illusionists magicians and fortune tellers and you just have to be aware when you're going to engage with them that they're showing you one thing you need to be looking for what they're not showing you right and that's how you prevent yourself from becoming a mark for those magicians right mike was nodding his head emphatically for those of you that aren't watching and are just listening emphatically mike have you been in the tent before uh unfortunately i have like you know it's kind of funny you think about these magicians and illusionists and friends i love how francesca described these different characters that we've encountered over the past four years or so and you know one thing that really jumps at me is you run into a lot of them also at trade shows where they're walking around and especially you know we're in our booth and they come up and they've got the next big as this or that um there's a you know you mentioned credit card processing i mean how many people did we have that like what was that about 18 months ago two years ago where everybody had the next thing and then that doesn't work i got something else here's another work around it was like a shell game with these guys sure it's not offshore it's bitcoin it's not bitcoin it's a reserve it's not a reserve it means it was like a sleight of hand everywhere and it's like flash paper going off and they've got this solution and that solution you know it's kind of crazy and then you know we talk about trade shows and one that you personally ran into nick you and frank was the illusionist of people that put on really crappy trade shows these are the ones the illusion is the trade show is the biggest it's the best of course you want to be here that's why awesome speaker yeah we've got traffic out the ass and then you get there and the only people walk in the aisles is you and the other board-ass exhibitors because there's no one there no but i was i was promised they were the cannabis show in illinois yeah that's but that's a master illusionist you know and i think you know you'd mention fortune tellers francesca i i feel like there's a ton of those too in this tent where it's they i feel like a lot of people want to bring something that's not cannabis related a success they had in the past or an idea that they have and they come rolling in and they cling to this idea they don't really understand cannabis but they think that just because it was successful somewhere else it's going to be successful here but they don't want to do the work to make it a success they just want to do a bunch of talking and just talk about what it's going to be and what it's going to do and how it's going to change the cannabis landscape and i have yet to see any one of those ever work out so if i'm if i go into this tent i basically got to look out for you know if somebody's pitch is is too good to be true chances are it is it is it's got to be legit you have to do your due diligence on the players that you're going to encounter in the industry because there is a lot of people that are the magician and the illusionist out there that are trying to not deceive maliciously but to skew things in their way to make you see things in a certain light that ultimately will benefit them more than it will benefit you so do your due diligence qualify people in qualify them out if they're not a good fit and and move on move on to the next 10. oh man uh would you guys care to move on to the next tent with me i'd love to move on to the next ten i don't i don't want to go in there with without you guys and i think we might get a seat up front because your cobra kai t-shirt mike you know i was gonna wear it today but i thought i wore it on the last episode i need like a stylist or something to help keep my [ __ ] together okay that's for the add that to the 2021 plans for infused um well it's it's over here on the right there are a ton of people outside but but i think we'll get in um dank the dominator a kenna colossus am i brave enough for an encounter with the strong man a strongman tent huh do i'm i'm not the biggest guy i mean for somebody who's a you know ultimate fighting champion but can i can i enter this tent and come out unscathed what's my best shot yeah i think you know this is always a fun tent because there's a lot to be gained from this it can be intimidating to some i mean but most people want to go in here to see the feats of strength you know i mean it's they want to see these big powerful looking people come in there and lift tons of weight and you know huge barbells with massive weights on either end lifting them over their head and they're you know pressing and all this and that but it's a classic deception it's one of the first deceptions and so instead of weights being on then it's two balloons that are just filled with air and so it's the deception of making you think that somebody's big and strong and when they're really just normal average joe and so in the can of carnival there is absolutely a number of people that fall into the strongman category where they want you to think they're not just powerful strength wise but really i think a lot of it comes from what they are in terms of being successful in the industry and how their success can maybe be part of your success if you're so lucky so i feel like that's a lot of what you're going to encounter in this tent and and i think there's two types of strong men actually i'm going to get a little more granular with this one oh please please i'm going to start with the perceived strong man this is the most common strong man out there i think that's my opinion i don't know about francesca um these are the strong men that are deceptive about things about their business so maybe the size of their operation the amount of flour they produce their test results you know all that kind of stuff that kind of lead you to believe who they are and what their what type of business they have in terms of the scale and and successfulness of their business um the one i think is kind of interesting in this perceived strongman category too is it's i'm gonna call these out as like the established successful business guys typically older white guys they love to talk marijuana they love to talk about their investment how they're getting ready to invest how they have the next biggest investment blah blah blah blah blah right and and i think a lot of what this comes down to is this big talk so that when they're in their circle with their cronies at the country club or at the rod and game club or whatever waspy ass club they're at they want to talk a big ass game with their with their friends and about how they're on the cutting edge of the green wave and whatever other jargon and headline chasing vernacular they're throwing out there they're doing it and and i've encountered a bunch of these these types and they kind of all have one thing in common too and i've never really seen any of them follow through you know they've all or know what they're talking about well that's a definite common thread but like every time somebody's told me they have an investment they're going to invest in a grow or an a production company they're going to have they have a chef that's going to make awesome edibles whatever it's going to be i've never seen any of them come to fruition because i think it's just talk because they want to be the big strong man and they're within their group of colleagues at their in their social life status type things um it is isn't it very equivalent to like the strong man's muscles and like ripped body the equivalent in the cannabis world is the what mike is saying the big talkers the ones with the big mouths are like the big muscles absolutely that's exactly it and um so it's you know it is that is francesca you're exactly right i mean it's the big talk type thing and i think there's one other type of strong man that i i'm pretty sure francesca's going to jump on because we've talked about this strongly before um i would characterize this strong man as the deep pocket strong man okay i think i like where this is going this is this is so it's really interesting because the first strong man has glamour muscles and can't lift anything he doesn't follow through but the deep pocket strong man their strength is in their money that they bring to the table because it allows them to actually quote unquote lift real weight as in they can buy up a lot of um dispensaries or real estate or property or grows they can actually invest or you know consolidate businesses and buy them out they can establish gross because they already have made all of their money in the traditional segment of business and so now they've got this overhead covered maybe they are already in some other kind of growing maybe they're growing cranberries or something and now they suddenly want to grow marijuana and it's like oh okay so you already have all the overhead taken care of you already have all of the profits from your traditional business established so you can use that and you can float as long as you need to you can really hang in there because those pockets are deep and that's your strength and so this is the strong man that i think bothers me almost more than the big talker because they get to have the the actual feat of strength it's it's technically real i couldn't lift that kind of weight i don't have that kind of money to go out and do what they're doing and actually own stuff in the cannabis industry but they haven't earned it they haven't been working at it they don't care about the culture they're not participating in any of the causes they don't actually invest in any intellectual emotional or social way it's monetary so that strength is really just a demonstration of strength it's not true strength you're not actually lifting the weight of all that cannabis has behind it you're just doing the easiest job with the biggest tool that you have you know and you mentioned like the money part of it and being financed and all that kind of stuff and i feel like the other part that goes along with the deep pocket strongman is just the established resources of say like they have a marketing team already yes they don't have to hire it out they have idle resources that they're already paying for so they don't have to go and spend additional overhead they've got marketing covered they've got compliance covered they've got legal cover they've got accounting covered all these things that for everybody else starting up is additional cost and layered on layered on layered costs for these deep pocket guys they don't have that it's not additional over it it's not incremental cost it's already fixed costs for them so they're just spreading these costs amongst more of sbus in their in their business so you know for them i feel like that's a huge advantage that allows them like you said francesca in a lot of ways it's like they can almost bully their way to have a seat at the table and there's not to see a table they're bringing their own goddamn chair or they'll build their table and they'll be like okay now this is the table guys this is the table you need to sit around not that table and so there's this implied or or suggested or there's like a subtext of dismissiveness of what is built by people who have been in this industry and have struggled and suffered and it's like that's cute let me show you how to really leapfrog you yeah yeah and and so very well said it's a big fu in um in a number of ways that really chaps my ass i just i can't stand i was like sitting on this one nick because i knew it was later on fired up we have another hour i can keep going so this is a new segment called chaps my ass there's a little graphic coming down but i you look i'm i'm right there with you and i'm always amazed by how many people we run into and this this goes back to when you can encounter a bunch of people that aren't in uh the business you see them at trade shows and i'm always baffled at the number of people that are dismissive of the industry and the plant in particular and and just like the the weight that the strong man is going to lift in front of all the ticket paying uh audience it's a question of authenticity right yes whether or not those that weight is authentic or not because you can come in i i invested in med men so i'm in canada well are you really in cannabis um because you invested in med men i i it really i've read a piece where a grower uh from out in the emerald triangle told me that the way you know he sniffs people out is you know well did you try the flour have you tried this edible that you're investing in you are you actually invested in more than that that monetary commitment yeah and it's funny nick you just combined the two strong men the big talker invested in the deep pocket and and med-man is a great example because that's a strong man the deep pockets that definitely tried to lift way too much weight and even they have their breaking points i think it's it's interesting if the ticket if the ticket buyers don't go to see the strongman the strongman's strength runs out so you need to to be aware of who you're doing business with and make sure that you are paying for something of substance and something that's actually impressive i would be so much more impressed by a small farmer that's been doing this who's probably suffered and been put in jail for this [ __ ] has been you know harassed for it and everything has used it to share as a medicine for free among people that he knows needs it or she knows needs it and then they fight tooth and nail with next to no resources to get a single license and then they use every dollar that they have or whatever to try and make this happen because this they are all in on this this isn't a side hustle this isn't easy for them to lift this is a truly heavy weight so sometimes opening one dispensary or one grow or one processing facility is a much bigger feat of strength than buying up 10 dispensaries across five states yep that's a great point i like what you really i really like what you said there francesca the um and it fits along with one of the things that we've noticed too when we see like these the big strong men and kind of how we've sniffed them out um after wasting time with some of them you could really definitely stayed in that tent too long oh yeah and it sounds real attractive to talk to you know but yeah i think one of the things that we've learned over time is to really try to dig into what their what their passion is for it um how it's viewed internally is this a long-term growth or is this a flash in the pan uh yeah what does their board of directors think about this because we've seen situations where uh the people we've interacted with are are all on board and then all also comes time to change the website to include cannabis and it comes to a screeching halt so you know little things like that are very telling um also and i think the biggest thing that we've learned that over time is really understanding how the resources can come to play in cannabis i mean just because somebody has a 10 person marketing team doesn't mean they understand branding and labeling and what makes for a strong can of brand and things like that and and i would much rather work with somebody that knows all that and i don't we don't have to teach versus people that have a established agency so to speak that know nothing of the nuances that you really are super critical in this space yeah yeah yeah absolutely it's something where that's so important um the big strong man can have his own marketing team or his own like you know but if it's not if it's not related to cannabis if it's not a cannabis dedicated resource or a team of people that have been in this space it's worthless if somebody's like wow but back in the 90s we moved thousands of flowbee haircutters per month like well this is the hydroponic grower that you're trying to market it's it's a little bit different of a game so i don't know if your flowbee experiences yeah that's a nice one nick i'm actually 107 years old so i i uh i wanted to go in and if i can i'm getting a little hungry and i promised fifth year i'd pick him uh up something so uh there's a food tent up ahead so i'd like to go into this uh craving cannabis confections enter here um and the problem that i'm seeing francesca is um there are long lines everywhere why are the lines so long can all this stuff be that incredible you know the thing is is that it is good they're making something that we all want or we all need it's the cotton candy and the funnel cake and the popcorn and the stuffed pretzels and now i'm hungry but um the equivalent of that are your edibles your flower your products that you're selling whether that's b to c or b to b so you can you can talk about grow units or lighting or any kind of thing that is in the cannabis that is an actual product that we sell i think falls under this food tent which is the product isn't the problem most of the time the product is usually fine what we're seeing in those long lines is that they have an operations gap so you can make the best funnel cake that there is but if you can make it at a rate of one per hour and a hundred people per hour trying to eat that funnel cake you've got a problem because that one per hour will never give you enough business to be able to lead up to the hundred per hour people are going to fall away they're gonna you're not gonna be known for your great funnel cake because only one out of 100 people know about that you're going to be known for the other 99 out of 100 that know you have terrible service or it's impossible to get to your product or it's too expensive because you're trying to mark up to get the money i mean there's a million ways to mess up a good product in the cannabis space and i think i see that probably more than anything is these really well-intentioned people with good ideas that want to do this for all the right reasons it's like the opposite of everything we've seen before they're not magicians and strong men they've got it yep but they can't serve it and that is just as critical of a gap as not having the actual quality product yeah this is almost the one that's heartbreaking it is you know we get them to know these people you know we you know one of the things with us is you all know when the team knows we love to go see the people we work with to build absolutely to understand what they're all about and kind of see behind their tents so to speak right but this is where it's really sad because you know you see their passion and you see the quality of product that they can produce but operationally they have gaps and a lot of times it's because they don't have the financing or they don't have the staff that that can help them fulfill against the demand um to really help their their dream and their vision become a reality and and these are ones like almost the opposite of the strong main because you know strong strongmen can lift up a barbell of daddy's money and an angel investor right but these people don't have that i mean a lot of people we've seen in this situation are bootstrapping it and i have the utmost respect for how they do it and it's and they're so close but yet they're so far too and it's just really heartbreaking to see that um their vision not become a reality because of like just some usually it's small too if they can fix something small operationally it'll spin and cause some momentum and then that can build on itself and then you can reinvest and it but it takes that one kind of step change for people to be able to do that and that's really what we see a lot of in this food tent area so it's a big blind spot for people coming into the industry with a killer idea or product or it is a big blind spot for people looking for partners in this space because if you don't have your eye on operations whether you are the product producer or you are partnering with the product producer then you're going to probably miss some major things that will affect productivity revenue growth all of those things that are the business part of the cannabis business yep absolutely i had a best teacher in my life guy named tom daley used to when i was struggling with picking something up or learning it he'd say just go do it go do it that's it that's how you're going to learn to do it so that's why i've always loved that you and mike are like no we're going to go visit this grow before we get involved because it's a very sobering thing that i don't think a lot of people get when they do their their investment in cannabis or whatever i think you should go to a farm uh because you you learn one of the things that people overlook and i don't know how they do it but it's it's a lifestyle it's not just it is people it's a lifestyle it it it interweaves with everything they do on a daily basis um and that that's really a barometer that i think people need to to reach i don't know right yes yeah yeah and i think we're all hungry for good product you know we're in that food tent because we're hungry we want it but at the same time like that that want needs to be served in a timely fashion you need to hit that timing when people are hungry for it you can't just count on people always going to want it because chances are somebody else is going to roll up and make killer funnel cake or good enough funnel cake and they got their first they can serve more people they become the producer that you want it to be right yeah it can go backwards real fast easily yeah and we've seen that happen and i think mike i think we see it a lot because we are part because our our services are operational based you know so we see when there's a gap because we fill one of those gaps but we even had to learn that oh they don't just have a sales gap problem they actually have multiple gaps that affect the sales part and so filling one it's it's just one hole in the in the boat we're still taking on water so it's really i think this is the one that breaks our hearts because we want them to win we see these people we work with them to win and if they can't it hurts everybody that means product isn't getting into the hands of people that need it and deserve it and want it and you're not winning by not making the money to grow yep yeah it's it's it's really they're easy people to root for no doubt so the big the big takeaway i have to remember is uh regardless of how long that line is and the demand for that product maybe i take a peek behind that that counter behind that curtain and make sure that they have the resources in place so that the last person in line comes away with a funnel cake there you go that's it all right he's on the operation all right all eyes on the operation um speaking of which i want to head over to the it's called the deadeye dispensary it's the shooting gallery for the smokey sharpshooter now i i you know what i kind of say that i love a shooting gallery mike um and i got my quarters um i'm ready to go but now that i think about it um if you're like me i i i spent hours at the shooting gallery yep i'm taking aim i'm looking at that piano player i want to hit that target so he plays the damn song i know i i aimed up and i was i was right on the money i think his hand moved i wanted the outhouse to open so the old guy was in there with the newspaper yeah i lined up my shot correctly is it is it me is it the gun what am i doing wrong well you know that guy i share your uh affinity for the shooting gallery because i've burned through a lot of money in my day and this too and and you know i think in the can of carnival especially there is those big attractive targets the piano guy the outhouse is always a hit there's that grizzly bear in the back that will roar if you hit him in the right spot and all that you know and then like the common thing to do is to take aim at those big targets and like if you look down the road the other shooters everybody's shooting at those like couple things but like what you don't realize is that the sight on your gun isn't true there's usually a fan blowing too i don't know if you've ever noticed this oh yeah yeah there's like a cross fan going so and then you're not using like the little pellets are super light so they get like skewed real easy but um so the ch your chances of hitting a big target in the can of carnival are really really slim but i think you also have to understand that even if you hit the piano guy he might not crack off a song or if the bear he might not roar and some of them are set up so that even if you hit the mark it might not react and i think that's really really indicative of what we see in the in the cannabis space where people want to go after those big targets which in our world in this world is the msos or the big huge mega dispensaries and and so you know you want to go after that's the best like the game-changing client or if you can work with them it's going to be an influx of new demand for your product and so it's ultra attractive and it makes a ton of sense but you can also burn through your entire wallet of money and have nothing to show for it if you keep if you only shoot at those big targets so you know one of the things that we've kind of checked ourselves with because we've taken a couple shots but what we've found to be more fruitful for us and more productive is going after like the squirrel and like the soda can and the spittoon and these smaller targets that are well i can hit yeah i mean everybody can hit them right but everybody wants to go for the big one but if you go for those closer in targets the smaller targets then you can start getting yourself ready to go after some of the medium targets maybe after the coyote you know or whatever else is going to be out there and then and only then are you going to be ready to go after some of those big ones once you have the gun figured out and the site figured out and the breeze figured out and and the sweet spot of those big targets figured out that's the only time you should go after those in my opinion and because here's another thing here's another little inside tip those big targets they're they're trying to grow too they have plans and their growth plans don't include some little shitty new shooter on the range but nick i'm sorry they don't include you they will they'll include a sharpshooter or they'll include other big big targets other msos and other you know mega dispensaries and operations like for them to grow they need the partnership with those big people but yeah they'll work with smaller operations like we have but we have to prove ourselves and we have to prove ourselves as a sharpshooter and prove ourselves as someone who can bring to our game just to just to attract their attention and then maybe we have a crack at hitting that target and getting a reaction i think the i think the parallel here is really in looking at your market you know if that if that shooting gallery is your market there are small targets and big targets within your market and so you can't like mike said just leap ahead to shoot the biggest don't shoot your shot at the biggest target as your first shot that's like insane because you have no practice no experience points nothing you haven't learned anything yet um so what are the smaller targets in your market that you know you can land and that you can use to build your portfolio build your credibility get established learn how to handle your equipment and what your technique is and exactly when your timing is perfect and then you can take those and build upon them but to go from zero to a thousand it's just not realistic it's going to waste your money and it's it's not the way to get the most points um because it's an obvious thing and not a strategic thing so you've got to play your market strategically yep have a strategy stick to it i mean i think there's no shortcuts especially not here you know this journey is comprised of a lot of small steps and a lot of consistency and to try to leapfrog and to cut corners it doesn't it doesn't pay off so just go after those small targets that are in their strategy and let it happen i have a theory about those big targets too i have a theory that it doesn't matter if you actually land your shot on them in the shooting gallery i think they are timed to every maybe 10 or 30 or whatever time somebody hits it only roars once out of those every 30 shots that actually land so don't forget there are other shooters in the gallery and you might just be off on your timing because they're not ready that big target ain't ready to roar yet wow that's a nice point i like that thank you coming out with the willy lowman point they time those things stay time [Laughter] follow my strategy i don't go too fast or too hard and i wanna i wanna be able to focus and hit those small targets with some consistency and precision is what we're saying yes build your experience yeah all right and then those quarters seem like you know it's time well spent you probably like a stuffed animal at the end of the day you know with that yeah i hope so and i hope so i think it's i hope it's something culturally relevant like an elf doll um let's go back to my references um guys uh we're we're moving through this thing i don't know i'm having a blast it's fun i love a carnival and um i still have plenty of tickets and i i still have a decent amount of money but the next one worries me stoner's pot palace high house of mirrors um i look i i know i can go i'm just a little uneasy about what i'm gonna experience if i go into this place francesca um i need this is where i need you and mike to help me a little bit more than even the other ones you know what you're right because the house of mirrors it the trick doesn't seem to be it's not as out in the open because and yet it is it's like you know you're walking into a house of mirrors and so you are walking into a landscape that you're going to get confused by because you are being shown things that are that seem real and aren't real and so if you walk towards them you'll run into a barrier and um these images that you see they're distorted because it makes big things look little or little things look big or something looks like it's the right way to go that looks like a corner nope those were just mirrors angled to look like a corner so you take these risks and you you have to know what's real and what's not when you're walking through it is a self-guided part of the carnival and so you know you're walking into um a different reality and then it's distorted but it's still hard to tell what exactly is real and what those distortions are you can get lost looking at the what's being projected in front of you or reflected in front of you i see this in cannabis in um a lot of different ways like one of one of the most common that we've run into are people who think that um their enjoyment of cannabis means that they will be good at the business of cannabis they see this distortion of themselves as an entrepreneur yet not needing anything about business so it's it's really going to be you running into a mirror running into yourself and having to face the truth that this was just a two-dimensional reflection the whole time and never was anything that you could follow to get anywhere now there's a way through the house of mirrors obviously you stay focused on what's real you make sure you don't get distracted by the shiny objects you have to know um when you're looking at yourself and when you're looking at you know something that's trying to lead you away from yourself there's a whole bunch of stuff that you that you could do there and um the whole thing is a house of mirrors that's the thing it's like it applies to the entire industry it's like everyone is in this house of mirrors where it seems like it should be easy to sell your great product into your your great flower into a great dispensary but they've got 40 people every monday trying to do that same exact thing so you you don't see the actual straight path you think it's a straight path and it's not yeah this is this is probably the most difficult one for me because it's really frustrating is someone that you know i see things as tries like processes and systems and try to you know that sort of mindset and to go into the house of mirrors and to be distorted and things not what they're proposed or supposed to be purported to be um it's frustrating and and it can be rarely discouraging can be just you get lost that back yeah big setback if you get lost in there so my advice is i i echo what you say francesca find like the threat of truth and and find those around you that you can trust and and be true to them and yeah get your ass out of the house of mirrors as soon as you can yes yes and once you've found that path make sure you walk that over and over so it becomes muscle memory to pass those distorted um you know reflections without even thinking you're not even looking at them because you know the way and you've got to follow that way through um if you don't make it through oh i'm so sorry it's just it's keeping your face this is why i thought you know just in conversation and again it's something you know i'm being 100 sincere here this is a total shoot um we'll just be talking about the cannabis business with the team and stumble upon something that really has a lot of truth to it and this this carnival thing stuck as soon as we started working you know as soon as we played around with it you know just in conversation carnivals to me operate on the principle of duality right everything is about duality there are two sides to everything you see two sides to every single attraction uh encounter that you have here and i i really thought that was the the strength of this because um we can be part of the show we can be part of the cannabis carnival it's a fun fun landscape right but the key is you don't want to be a mark right right right you need to be participating in it not um the the the clown of the carnival i mean i'm mixing a circus and carnival here but that's that's the thing is like don't don't go in unless you know what you're buying into and so many people only see that that one side the the biggest stuffed animal that the big huge teddy bear gorilla that's hanging out there if you just knock down the bottles and you know you don't see that it actually takes 13 of the teeny little stuffed animals to get to that big gorilla yeah so there's so many things if you don't if you don't give yourself a real harsh reality check before during being in cannabis you're going to get suckered yeah you know in a full disclosure i mean the reason this came up i remember the first time we talked about this and it was on the heels of someone one of our partners not fulfilling their their contract yes and i've been in business for almost three decades in some capacity i've never had more uh people walk out on contracts than we have in the time that we've been doing this with alias can you and i think it's that frustration to me that's like oh my god this is ridiculous how do people live with themselves how do they not have more morals and they they we did what we were supposed to do now it's time for them to pay us and they don't want to pay or they don't want to do what they said they were going to do and so you know i just it's really frustrating and i think where we when we came up with this concept we did it kind of tongue-in-cheek being like we want to we want to lift the tent on this carnival that we that we love but we also hate at times because of the characters and unsavory people walking around the pickpockets all the other you know people that are out there but it's it's that's what we really wanted to do with this episode was really kind of expose some of that so that maybe someone listening or viewing can avoid some of these characters that we've encountered in the course of our our time with alias can and and like francesca and like you and like nick said i mean it's a it's a fun carnival it's awesome being in here it's a lot of fun there's a line out the door of people trying to get in here but it's just beware that you know you talk about buyer beware it's visitor beware to the can of carnival because it's it's filled with people and it fits i mean look when you're on a carnival and like especially not now not this age but when i was younger it was like oh my god i want to go on the most exciting rides i want to go in the zipper i want to go on whatever it is that looks the scariest and gives me the most adrenaline rush and now it's like that that adrenaline rush is definitely characteristic of the cannabis industry but it is so not the thing to chase it is not sustainable or steady you need to actually find the pace at which you can walk the entire field and make sure that you you see everything and you don't rush to where the most exciting biggest brightest attraction is because it's not real it's not it's probably not what you think it is or it may be it's misleading in what it's saying it is and it's okay if you know that if you don't know that then you could be you could succumb to whatever consequences are of buying into that and we just want people to be more knowledgeable coming into the space because if you come in and you create a better business model better services better products better operations it only helps everybody it's that raise the game yeah so let's improve all of this together and say well we know what some of these people here are doing but there's also a lot of fun to be had so now that i know the game i can play the game a whole lot better yep absolutely yep cannabis is a carnival believe it or not and look um i want to thank you two for taking me through the midway today i would i would have no idea where to go or what i was in for so thank you both for for joining me as we strolled down the midway today it was our pleasure nick i'm glad you enjoyed your time in the can of carnival i did and don't buy a balloon it's just going to destroy the environment and be worth nothing in the end so i know [Music] [Laughter] jeez well you know what the um would could it just make the the carnival more fun sure frankie fifth year yes fifth year are you there sir hey y'all how are you buddy good how are you i'm doing okay it's been a while it's been a while um frank did you have a favorite carnival ride the one that you get in it's like a uh circular machine and it goes around a circle and makes people throw up gravity gravitron you come outside and just be like wobbling for the next 30 minutes i don't know like getting drunk before you're 21. that is that's really true i love the gravatron you know there's a there's a there's a couple of groups that want that one to go away and i'm like kids have to experience the gravitron damn it um mike did you have a favorite ride i like that pirate ship the one that goes it's like a big swing you sit at the two ends you get like almost vertical when it starts really rolling up and down so i think that was the one i like the best if you don't have one of the end seats don't even go on in my opinion but that's true yeah that's very true francesca favorite attraction at the carnival um it it's either the wildest ride but most oft no take that back it's bumper cars i was obsessed with bumper cars before i could like frank's getting drunk before you could you're 21. bumper cars for me was like driving before i was 16. i loved those things and um it was but they never went as fast as you wanted them to or you get a big dog pile of people getting stuck in a nest and you can't reverse somebody's in your way so it never was as exciting as it should have been but i still loved it every time so i have to share this and maybe i shouldn't but um no no no sure is as you guys know i have three sons and um and at the at the beach in rehoboth beach they have bumper cars so we would take them in the summer with the bumper cars and they would a lot of times would have some buddies with them and stuff like that and um so we would identify a mark in line and before we'd get on and then all of us would just gang up on this one poor sap and just like keep demolishing him into the boards and out of commission and just like and i feel bad because i'm like a grown ass man i'm like hey guys let's look at that nerd over there let's get them wait a minute that happened to me i'm sorry sir bad day to wear the dallas cowboys shirt yeah exactly it actually would be some somebody with something they were wearing that would get that would get marked i would do i would do the same thing at the bumper boats uh out on route 1 in rehoboth we would just we would just trap somebody under a waterfall scream it was it was a good time um i think that one uh we were talking about um flash paper magicians and the like in the the magicians the first tent all right francesca let's say magic is real yes what what's the first spell that you learn um i think a transfiguration spell i want to be able to turn into anything like i want to be a professor mcgonagall and just turn myself into a cat and walk around nobody even knows it's me and i'm just uh i'm made by a cat just animate objects animate objects right you could i think it can be anything but yeah i think maybe it is like organic objects or something like i wouldn't want to turn in like the block rocker in the gym no no no i'm not trying to turn into my water i'm still able to speak like your normal voice and stuff mm-hmm oh that'd be freaky can you you might be able to yes you're wrong okay i'm gonna we'll see but i should really keep my i like it because i love eavesdropping i love eavesdropping it's my favorite thing to know everything i don't want to gossip i just want to eavesdrop and hear all the things so that's why i do transfiguration all right as a spell based around gossip um uh fifth year magic's real what are you going to learn i want to be able to summon any kind of food or cuisine at any moment i think that's just called learning to cook yeah i don't want to do that though i don't want to clean and you know prepare so like but magic absolutely yeah oh no that is too on the nose i love it i love it god bless you fifth year [Laughter] mike i'm giving you the power of magic what spell are you learning i think i would want to learn how to fly i think it's like one of those things that is just so different for human beings to be able to like just fly on their own and see different parts of land and transport yourself around i think that'd be pretty damn cool no tsa you just say hey yeah aaron i'll meet you down in the islands yeah you go through this covid really wouldn't dampen your travel plans in that case so i might i i could get you have to wear a mask if you're flying by yourself depends the u.s airspace we gotta see [Laughter] mike how high would you go would you be like above the cl like would you get way up there or would you be like a low low flyer yeah i think i think by and large i'd want to be like lower because this is cold yeah so you'd have to like gear up if you're going to go up too high but it would be kind of cool to get up in the clouds and like look around in there too get up into a storm like there's like it's get above the thunderstorm and stuff that's cool yeah one time i went skydiving i it was like tandem because it was my first time in the only time and so like we pulled the parachute and it was just a lot of time just hanging out and floating and i was like can we go through a cloud and he was like yeah but you'll get all wet and i was like oh yeah that is it's not just fluff okay never mind i don't think i should fly because i don't understand things like clouds yeah or or time or distance did that too i struggle with those stick to transfiguration because that would be a good one um yeah mine was really less dramatic i would just want to have the ability to have a spell where i can make people pee their pants i i really think this is a super power i do i i think super power is different than magic that's a good spell i make it spell look any time i'm in need of a laugh boom somebody somebody's being a little arrogant say we run into one of the strong man at a cannabis show boom peter pants that'd be a strong spell wow i dig that one i dig that one i didn't put a lot of the time into this one but uh yeah it would be my pick guys this was a blast man i can't wait for fun can't wait for the next show so uh mike thank you so much francesca thank you so much thank you nick thank you nick great job this has been a blast

protected by South Africa's Constitution which guarantees the right of self-determination but residents here are thinking big their next goal to creation of an Afrikaner republic", "HElg_5IH_y0": "right so i am going to begin now thank you everybody for coming out for today's events um france and africa uh there are several things that i would like to say before we officially begin um the first of which is that the syracuse university college of arts and sciences would like to acknowledge with respect to the onondaga nation firekeepers of the honda the indigenous peoples on whose ancestral land syracuse university now stands furthermore i'd like to talk a bit about the africa initiative so the africa initiative of syracuse university is a campus-wide project held from the department of african american studies within the college of arts and sciences its purpose is to focus on africa as an important site of knowledge by highlighting teaching research and publication work by syracuse university scholars in the arts humanities social natural sciences mathematics engineering and others initiative aims to revitalize interest in africa which has been on the way into many institutions of higher learning since the end of the cold war in this respect it is important to note that syracuse university once held a vibrant african studies program although notable resources accumulated during its existence such as the east african collection and the bird library remain moving forward from this history the african initiative is building upon this previous experience while charting new directions including offering a significant pool of experts specializing in various aspects of this diverse and richly endowed continent the africa initiative's presence in the department of african american studies reinforces the critical site where most academic work on africa at syracuse university is done and where the continent and the caribbean are perceived as concomitant parts of the department's pan-africanist vision in bringing together syracuse university scholars from various disciplines the african initiative not only promotes interdisciplinary exchange but also reinforces the university's ongoing effort to diversify and internationalize the educational experiences of our students as such the initiative places great emphasis on study abroad programs in africa as well as provision of financial resources to give students exposure to that continent by providing an alternative vision and platform for constructive discourse on africa and african peoples the africa initiative is helping alter the dominant perception of africa as a continent ridden with perpetual crises and despair now i would like to enjoy the pleasure of introducing the moderator for today's events dr jeannette s julie jeannette s julie is an associate professor of religion at syracuse university she specializes in contemporary islam islam in europe anthropology

okay thank you very much for this introduction i'm very happy today to be the moderator of this event dedicated to france and africa france's approach and relations to the african continent that is often also called france afric which is a topic for many of us source of constant anger and a topic that continues to be very relevant for many parts of of the african continent um so i'm going to start right away introducing the first speaker professor amber murray who's a visiting assistant professor at clark university emma murray researches and writes on transformations of life and place amidst structural development and colonial violence the dynamics of social and political resistance and co-optations of that resistance by state and corporate actors and hegemonic and counter-hegemonic intellectual practices and knowledge paradigms her phd research on oil politics and resistance in central africa as well as her collaborative work on the pan-african legacy and philosophies of thomas sakura is shaped by a decolonial impetus and conviction that scholarship be active attentive accessible and decolonized uh professor murray completed her phd dissertation lifescapes of a pipe dream and the colonial mixtape of structural violence and resistance along the chat cameroon oil pipe at boston college and she also received an m.a in pan-african studies from circus university so let me welcome you professor amber to give the first presentation today for 20 the next 20 minutes thank you sorry i think i need to unmute before i can screen share for some reason um thank you very much dr julie for that wonderful introduction can i confirm that my slides are now visible yes they are thank you okay great um yeah thank you so much uh that was a wonderful introduction and um somehow also a step back in time a bit um i think um that bio is a few years old oh this was the link i'm sorry this was the link i was given no no no no please please i enjoyed um revisiting um that moment in time when i was at clark um so please thank you um yeah i i would like to first um thank the audience members very much for joining us um and i would like to express my gratitude for the invitation to speak today this talk is particularly meaningful to me given how significantly my scholarship and my politics were shaped by my time as a master's student in syracuse's pan-african studies program that was in 2009 to 2011 although it seems like yesterday thank you very much to professor horace campbell for the invitation uh to speak and for um to jordan edward thomas for all of their assistance with the logistics and the planning of this seminar i would like to also greet dr yabara bukhari and to say that it's a real honor to be a panelist alongside you today so the topic of today's discussion is the role of france and africa i'm not going to attempt to deliver an academic paper in our brief time here rather i will offer a series of reflections on the changing role in africa of france something that we might like into the french adage chandra plushos so the more that it changes the more that it seems to stay the same and i think this will be a theme that will reoccur throughout many of you will be aware of the term la france afrique so named to indicate the pot the particular and close indeed nearly inseparable neocolonial relationship between post-independence african countries and france in which african leaders governments and businesses participate either out of realism or opportunism or anxiety and real fear for um economic and political uh sabotage the senegalese novelist bubakar boris diap calls the term quote the ultimate symbol of a confiscated perverted sovereignty this singular coinage perfectly illustrates france's dogged refusal to decolonize the term encapsulates a set of illegitimate and sometimes legitimate practices but practices that subjugate the sovereignty of francophone african countries indeed as the former french president francois mitterrand acknowledged quote without africa france will have no history in the 21st century while this includes things like soft power and the promotion of the french language and culture as we see on this map here of the some 21 african countries where french is an official language and five additional countries where french is commonly spoken this relationship is above all economic the issue of monetary sovereignty and the persistence of the central african franc as the currency in 14 west and central african countries has been the topic of decades of debate um and it reappears in a recent article authored by dr ndango samba in the pages of rope the review of african political economy the cfa established by the french ministry of finance in 1945 is underwritten by the french treasury and approximately 500 billion us dollars of african money is held in french banks each year today in cote d'ivoire in cameroon in chad gabon congo brazil senegal niger benin togo burkina faso or guinea conakry french multinationals dominate to an average of 70 of the economies including ports mines airports timber energy construction security systems media and telecommunications these corporations include total bullaret ariva orange carafor and many others now a relatively new generation of french presidents would like to publicly turn away from the visage of la france afrique emmanuel macron much like the president nicolas sarkozy before him wishes to declare la france afrique dead sarkozy we will recall ordered the military use of tanks to dislodge lauren bakbo in cote d'ivoire in 2011. and he has now been convicted of charges of corruption and faces more charges currently of campaign finance violation including allegations of obtaining a legal funding from gaddafi so for his part during a visit to the universite de wagodu in 2017 macron declared quote i am of a generation where we do not come to tell africa what to do end quote in the same now infamous speech he boasted that he is of a generation that quote like many of the students in the audience never knew colonialism his comprehension of neocolonialism is clearly very weak but during that same visit there were tremors of optimism namely for this promise to declassify documents related to the assassination of thomas ankara on the 15th of october 1987. so after he made this announcement i eagerly reached out to professor aziz fall who has been a longtime activist working with the sankhara family and multiple generations of activists involved in the movement internationality international campaign for justice for thomas zenkara aziz told me not to hold my breath indeed to date no documents have been declassified it has been 33 and a half years since ankara's assassination when the family appealed to the un committee for human rights they provisionally requested that the state of burkina faso clarify the facts behind the assassination amongst other things and yet on the 21st of april 2008 the u.n committee for human rights in complete contradiction with the preceding decision closed the record on the case without an investigation having been carried out during this same visit to wagadugu macron referred to the country as lepay de zome integra the country of upright people echoing sankara's renaming of the country from upper volta a colonial name inherited from the french to burkina faso the international campaign for justice for sankhara has recently released a statement pressing macron to maintain his promise they assert quote at a time when the image of france in west africa is deteriorating this disrespectful posture towards justice and the burkina bay people can only reinforce the feeling of mistrust towards france which extends in particular to burkina mali and niger as brian peterson reminds us in his recently published a really excellent biography which i encourage everyone to read he writes quote there were determined efforts to manipulate the press by the french intelligence this happened in the years prior to the uh to thomas sankara's assassination peterson writes quote while france may not have engineered sankara's overthrow from a military standpoint the french government created the conditions in which a coup was more likely indeed um peterson's work echoes the work of other biographers of sankara documenting the tentacles of french influence including in the military economy and political spheres the french intelligence channels were everywhere and and he documents in particular the large numbers of burkina bay soldiers who are trained in military schools and at the same time a number of graduates of the us's program the international military education and training program uh for the military across the the globe also played a significant role in um blaise comparaway's coup against thomas and kara so while the french and the us did not intervene directly perhaps the provision of military to military aid and the sharing of military intelligence undoubtedly helped to foster the conditions for sankhara's assassination this is a point echoed by bruno jaffrey another biographer of thomas sankara who documents um the uh france's financial uh the withdrawal of france's financial support um in the months before sankara's um assassination my colleague nicholas jackson has likewise documented the documented the considerable pressures upon sankara and the revolutionary government to concede um to imf structural adjustment programs and in peterson's new book he discloses a u.s embassy cable that reveals that sankara's minister of finance had reached out verbally to the imf's director for africa who at the time was alessandra tara of course who's now the president of cote d'ivoire to arrange a meeting in the two weeks prior to his assassination so let's go back to emmanuel macron in this idea of the changing visage of france in africa telling lee in a press conference at a g20 summit in hamburg germany also in that same year 2017 macron claimed quote the challenge for africa is totally different it's much deeper today it's civilizational when countries today have seven to eight children per woman you can decide spending several billion euros on it but you will stable you will not stabilize anything so while there are public apparitions of seeming shifts in france's african policy these comments reveal and solidify tired colonial tropes and everywhere on the continent we see french support for authoritarian capitalism even amid half-hearted public attempts to call out repression and persecution which was recently the case um when macron promised to censor the cameroonian president paul bia for state and military violence in the country's anglophone region yet political actions and economic will continue to foster the conditions for exploitative relations between the state and people and between the people and corporate capitalist power i'm not sure how i'm doing on time and i can't see anyone because i'm sharing my screen so somebody yell um if i'm excessively going over time you're still in your within you within your time you still have like almost seven minutes oh great okay thank you um so yeah i'm going to stick with this example of cameroon for a bit before i conclude on the 24th of february 2020 uh macron criticized the government of cameroon for mishandling the anglophone crisis macron made the comments during an informal conversation with a cameroonian protester in france this is what the screenshot is here on this slide who demanded a response to the killing of 22 people and the raising of nine homes in in garba southwest cameroon in the early morning hours of the 14th of february however even were macron's statements against the cameroonian states atrocities sincere anti-french sentiment is so powerful that they were politically irrelevant and in fact potentially damaging for peace activists who are working on the ground paul bia infamously inactive and elusive quickly opposed macron's statements through his secretary general ferdinand and gongo who claimed quote the cameroonian president paul bia is accountable for his actions to the sole sovereign cameroonian people and not to a foreign leader even from a friendly country end quote in response to macron's statement 100 people gathered to protest some 100 people approximately 100 people gathered to protest outside the french embassy in yande cameroon's capital likely orchestrated by bia's political party the air de pesay the protests nevertheless reveal the widespread anti-french and anti-colonial sentiments of cameroonian youth on both sides of the political aisle they therefore also reveal the potential repressive dangers of french political intervention even actions or statements made in the name of peace or against state violence skepticism of french policy in cameroon again came to the fore when a renowned cameroonian political commentator professor francis nyamsi spearheaded a petition on the 18th of april 2020 calling for the immediate departure of christophe gilu the french ambassador to cameroon he was accused of having organized and and editing um a video that uh captured a false hearing with president bia because president bia at the time had been missing supposedly missing for several months um and had been presumed dead at the time by many activists um living in in the in the country as well as diaspora activists so this petition to oust um the french ambassador to cameroon reads quote gilu should depart to reassure the cameroonian people as to france's desire to finally scrupulously respect the right of the cameroonian people to democratic sovereignty which france has flouted since the official decolonization of 1960 which has not yet really been followed by a real structural decolonization this means monetary military geopolitical end quote bia who has been the president of cameroon since the 6th of november 2000 or 1982 is the last remaining african president the last remaining african president who was placed in power by the departing french colonialists at the time in the role of secretary general to the presidency before he succeeded the country's first president ahmadu aijo in 1982 when aye joe stepped down bia has been the president of cameroon for 39 years this he's maintained uh his fixed seat and power with the help of a coup proofing strategy that protects yaounde from military threats decades of military to military aid training and supplies from france the us and israel as well as the permanent prosecution and repression of political rivals and allies alike cameroonians like to joke that you can find an entire presidential cabinet and governing body within the walls of yaondae's kodingy prison everyone but a president so what can we say of france and africa if there's cause for optimism it's the rise and criticism of france's neo-imperial and extractivist relations with francophone africa in particular from young people and young activists including the young activists who i work with in yeonde for flo bear for example a 26 year old university student living in yeonde the economic dominance and political strum strong arming of la france afrique has imparted a mistrust and animosity for french political elites and animosity rivaled only by his derision for cameroonian political elites i'd like to conclude um by returning to this recent press statement from the international campaign for justice for sankara the last sentence of this press statement reads quote after the long dark years of the blessed campari regime which blocked the progress of justice towards the truth it is now in france that the blockage lies it must stop great thank you very much um and i will turn it back over to you okay thank you so much professor murray um and now it's my great honor to introduce our second speaker uh dr amzad bukhari yabara who is an independent scholar specializing in african caribbean latin american studies he got a phd in african history at the ecole des altitudes social or school of advanced studies and social sciences in paris with particular interest in black political and grassroots history he is a founding teacher of the school of african politics that opened in paris in 2018 uh amsat is the author of africa united universin a classic star a classic in the study of pan-africanism and he also published the first biography in french on the guyanese historian walter rodney published in 2018 with the presence african and also books on nigeria and mali and amsat is also one of the leading members of the pan african league so it's a great pleasure to hand you now the floor thank you thank you janet thank you for this presentation i would like to thank everyone jordan and the africa initiative thank you amber for your presentation that was really interesting because i think that when we're speaking of africa you're speaking of beast edger that is a mythical animal that have several heads and one when you cut one head another one is coming and this is the vision that we need from a vision of multiple connections that are coming from france that are leading to the caribbean the indian ocean or africa and everywhere it's a global system and this global system has a very long story that starts in the 16th century in the caribbean with the first colonial empire that was lost after the ancient revolution in 84 and a second empire was built from 1830 on the colonization of algeria and the second empire still remained today under the front so french colonialism has a very long history and we cannot distinguish french colonialism and french racism because racism is structural in the new colonial the french when you're looking at the french political system from the left to the right you can find the franchise everywhere left in the right middle and when you are looking specifically in the middle that is where emmanuel macron says that it is part part of you can take a comparison you can draw a comparison between emmanuel macron and another one french president that was vladi regis kardashian who used to be the the youngest french president before emmanuel macron in the fifth grade both of them belonged to the monetary system they were working in banking and they were making money and in 1974 when vadi regis kazan became french president he decided to reorganize the neocolonial system and he left the old friend of charles de gaulle jacques fucar and he decided to focus on the french economic inquest and i think that the position of manuel macron today is a little bit the same but it is guided by a new geopolitical situation we need to understand that the colonial system is in crisis the new colonial system is in crisis it's contested by other foreign powers today we can speak of china for example but they were speaking of the ussr and the united states it is also attacked by a new generation of mass movements africa popular uprising in africa and we also in a period of repression and economic and political reforms all over the world so we are in a period of huge contradiction between the so-called democratic discontents and the specific repression of the new colonial system and we need to get these two points in comparison to understand how it works we also need to focus on the balance of war between france and africa because in 1958 when independence was given to african countries it was a so-called independence but it was given because the demographic power of african colonies was getting over france teamwork and the issue of demography is still relevant today in the way france is working with our ancient colonies under the regis kadesta there was a ministry of foreign affairs whose name was luis de gringo he used to say that africa is the only place where france can maintain its power with only 300 400 500 soldiers and he explained why africa was at the size of france economically speaking culturally speaking and politically and in those times in the middle of the 70s the target was specifically to counter the soviet cuban influence in southern africa and france was using its colonial position in the indian ocean for example myot and also djibouti to take a role in the new militarization of africa in relation with the support to the apartheid regime so we have to understand how france use its colonial position all over africa to get a role in african geopolitics today with the gringo was also very important because he changed the way the french diplomacy understood africa before zizka destroyed and given go french diplomacy was working with francophone africa and the rest of africa but when he came in power netizens before they decided to divide africa they say that north africa belongs to military and policy but african policy and sub-saharan africa needs to be divided between west africa central and eastern africa and so forth this division is really important to understand because it's a kind of redefinition of french utah west africa meaning that most of the french interests in africa today are not in the ancient colonies in the francophone africa but specifically in nigeria in angola in south africa in etude and they needed to change their approach of africa to get along with the new economic interest at that time and i think that with macron today we are coming back to this vision saying that france africa is over because we are not working specifically with francophone africa and this is really problematic because france is the only country that that developed an asymmetrical relation with a world continent and it was built under the regiscades and nobody registered they started to travel officially in other countries out of the resistance and this redefinition of the perimeter of is uh a um is really actual because in 2020 macron decided to organize um the year of africa the season africa france 2020 and from the beginning he explained that he was not born in the times of colonization and uh he spent his um uh his um internship in nigeria lagos in new africa and he wanted to speak with african youth and macron is the youngest french president and his discourse is the discourse of a very very old french president and this is really interesting because in his way of talking to africans he got this very paternalistic way that is associated with the racist legion of africa always speaking to african youth there are no adults there are not there are no intellectual only youth and this erasure of any contestation in africa belongs to a psychological domination that we need to address the way we we write african history and right now in france one of the main debates is about the return of student artifacts it's also about the opening of colonial archives so it's dealing with issues of memory issues of the past but those issues have the very important impact on nowadays relationships you can also speak of the world of france during the scene in rwanda all those issues explain why we have also in france right now a new contestation a new generation of french african militant activists that are linking their situation as black in france with the way france is treating the african continent and we have a third issue that we need to keep in mind that france is still a colonial power with position especially in the caribbean so we need to understand the french colonialism from the metropolitan area in europe that is dealing with the children of former colonized countries the french colonialism in the caribbean and in the overseas the so-called french overseas that is part of the way french military position can we adjust in the world and third we need to talk about the division the french neo-colonial division of africa in the francophone africa that strictly connected to french domination with the monetary domination with the cultural imperialism because most of the african elite was trained in the french limits most of um the secular production is linked to the french cultural demon so we also have the military domination in those former french colonies and in the rest of the african country france is using those francophone countries to export domination and this is the way we need to understand the debate on the reform of the france the way it was decided to to leave the france efa to create eco that was the ecowas currency but on our position a pan-africanist position whether it be uh eco built by the french imperialism or an eco built by equals still an imperialist currency so we need also to find some alternatives and the issue of alternative is really important because we are speaking do we need an alternative or an alternation and we need also to understand that africa is funding french politics all the french political parties took money from africa whether it was full french book national total health ballerina etc whether it was for african head of states were really proud to say that they were giving money to french political parties except the communists because when france was built it was strict forbidden for african leaders to work with communism because i think is also part of the war against communism there is a war against eurovision so all those issues and today i think that one of um the main point is how do we deal with this old system that is stumbling but it's still uh regenerating how do we deal with this idra and uh this is what we are trying to to to organize that is to say a kind of general collective mobilization on several issues that need to um to um to understand um the way french also imposed on african states the model of the nation states that is not adapted how do we connect or do we build internationalism and this is why i am especially interested that we organized this event with the department of african american studies because african american has reported a role in the story of fighting french colonialism and other imperialism in africa because we need to understand that we are in situations that are more connected that and this issue is really important because in july 2021 there will be the next france summit in modern world in the southwest the city where maryam santera is living right now and for this uh african conservative emmanuel macron does not want to invite african states understood that african youth is angry against african egos who is dealing with african intellectuals african artists dice power so it selected a number of people of association organization that are part of this new discourse upon africa and this cross afric uh summit is a little bit the same as what barack obama organized in 2010 uh august 2010 when he invited in washington civil society leaders from africa for the 15th anniversary of african independence so we can see the way french imperialism is also looking at how the u.s organize their own imperialism so i think that this vision this global vision needs to be studied needs to be investigated because we get connection speak of cfr one part is linked to uh the french treasure but another one is linked to the imf the world and the american interest and we know that in 1994 when the once he was evaluated the u.s knew before the french that it would be valid to conclude i would say that the issue of france africa and france in africa not only france in africa it's larger it's france in caribbean it's france in the indian ocean in the pacific with the caledonia and it's also france and africa inside the french metropolitan area and all those issues belong to the colonial pact it was engaged in the 17th centuries meaning that all the economic commercial and monetary transactions need to control by as out of the this is why emmanuel macron is a very specific president a little bit like valerie with the issue of rethinking a new french imperialism that is also supported by africans themselves devote and understand that they are part of this their own domination so we need to uh to read again france fanon we need to read again we need to understand how this system was built and we also need to understand that we are in a very interesting interesting period because series of crisis the series of action and we need to take advantage of this specific situation thank you so much for another really insight for talk um as i said in the beginning i mean this this is an exasperating topic um and uh i i'm opening now the floor to questions um you can either unmute yourself and just present them by yourself or if you prefer you can also put them in the chat and then i can read them aloud that's up to you and thank you also to for both speakers to sticking so much to your time you made my task very easy yes peter castle yes um thank you to both speakers for very enlightening talks i really learned a lot and i was a question for both of you perhaps um if you could say something about the french role in mali which reminds me a lot of the united states role in afghanistan where the country they just don't seem to want to pull out of and um i don't know what kind of role they're playing there as so be very interested in hearing what you have to say thank you do we answer right now yeah yeah you can just go ahead yeah yeah i think the world of france in mali is uh not new uh because france has a fascination for uh the sour desserts the grand sour is part of the french mythology conquest of this good dessert is very important and in the second world war it was from chad close to mali that france yet got his its um its salvation with the french army from the chad who uh freed um the metropolitan but later when the algeria war was declared the situation of mali was really important and the the project the french colonial project was cut north mali from south of algeria and to create a new state what's called um organization community region syrian area uh commune communal organization and was supposed to be given to um but finally uh the magi president wouldn't book it as a nationalist and who uh worked with uh leopold siddhartha from senegal refused that his country would be divided in two and he expelled in 1960 the french army and he did not sign any military agreement with france in 1968 modificator was overflowed by a musa trawler a general was a puppet of france and would re-engage mali in the france fr and in 1991 there was a huge popular movement that overflowed musa with and later we have the return of democracy maddie was a kind of model of um democratic transition in the 90s but in 2012 there was it was linked to the digital erection of the situation with this situation in the sale clearly linked to the war in libya and the marian state was absolutely failed and france used this situation that was really known from the french legion from the intelligence who um to launch the serval operation with under the the umbrella of the united nations and when president francois london arrived in bamako he's saying that it was the most beautiful day of my political life is what he said when he arrived in bama because he saved money so we also have this vision of the white saviors or the french favors the africans and so on so there was a very negative dispute in the situation and um france signed military agreement at this time with mali in 2014 with the general who is now the provisional head of state of money and from this momentum france installed their military bases in mali and one part of the of the occupation is linked to the resources the natural resources and under the one is supposed to fight terrorism in the cell but we know that the french military presence is perceived like an army of occupation by most of the mali population the world of france in mali is really problematic and we need to address it up here if amber wants to add some information thanks for the question um yeah i mean i think that was response is really comprehensive and i yeah i liked um the situation of um this conflict within the idea of friends french mythologies um and not only french mythologies but also american counterinsurgency mythologies um which follow very closely this trend of militarism across the african continent but in particular the sahel and of course horace campbell who's on this call um was the one who introduced me to the brilliant work of jeremy keenan um who has traced this mythology um in in his book the dark sahara um where he talks about um the uh counter-insurgency doctrine of you know this a banana theory of terrorism across the sahel to ridiculize the the mythology um in in the early 2000s um but yeah i mean france's militarism three some 3500 troops currently stationed across the african continent and so um i i think actually what's you know what's also interesting about the case of mali is that it's not that interesting in the context of france's other militarisms um and so i mean we can look at chad um in 2008 um you know uh co de voir in 2011 where it's either intelligence sharing um or direct uh interventions um sponsored by the french and and the you know also the the knowledge of that sponsorship um creates a enormous distrust um and so when you know just uh maybe a month ago or so on um my social media feed a lot of cameroonian activists were posting um videos of um french helicopters um in the central african republic i mean we don't know if they're if these videos are verified at least i didn't you know follow up with it but in this context i was just thinking well um this speculation is well founded um and that's kind of the history of of distrust thank you very much we have two more very interesting and probably also questions that take a little bit time to answer in the chat so i'm going to read the first one um one area that i want the panelists to shed light on is how france has stunted regional cooperation and integration among african countries at the continental and sub-regional levels perhaps one of you can talk a little bit about that and then i'll ask the next question for the interest of time um that one since the next one uh i i think is directed at dr bukhari yabara so um yeah i mean almost at every level and what came out really strongly um uh in the other presentation um was in particular um france's motivations to quell socialism anything like communism anything like a state structure that would you know support the well-being of the masses of the people um and that has been probably in my opinion the most disastrous um way in which um the french have intervened to um you know to try systematically to um either violently or through other means um quell alternatives to um you know kind of the capitalist status quo um and i mean a really good example of that is is obviously the sabotage the political economic sabotage of thomas sankara in the 1980s which is an excellent example of someone who presented a radical alternative um and you know yet the kind of french political operations and shady kind of backroom deals really ostracized him from other leaders on the african continent thank you so much professor murray and then perhaps for amsat for dr bukharia bar to be uniformism um so the question uh concerning uh jacques the gold africa man who helped construct france afric uh as i so um rob prince says as i understand it in exchange for former independence focus impose secret agreements on the emergent independent states to give france control of countries economic and military systems are any of those secret agreements available have any of them been made public so far yes god died in 1997 and a few scholars got access to his archives one of them i'm working with is john kerbat and they published several books about the focus system and what we need to understand is that focus was really close to charlemogul he was a secretary general in charge of african affair and with this position that was unique in the french republic it could organize many things and those things that organized were part of this agreement one of them is the assassination of any african leaders that opposed to a french administration assassination is the last solution before assassination he organized a vast system of russian with [Music] many african leaders he also trained one of his closed african allies that was felix bonifa and organized the french divisions the french service in africa with many youngsters that were part or two from the private securities of french multination so it was at the center of a huge uh underground system that was not so underground and this is something that is really important because we are speaking of secret agreements but in fact there is nothing separate everything is on the table sometimes it is so big that we can see it and this is what is really interesting because we have a vision of france africa something a little bit dirty uh something a little bit unofficial but we need to understand that it is an official policy of the french since the 50s since it was decided that france must decolonize but this decolonization must be made in the french interest so this is really important to understand so they put in power all the african leaders that were against the idea of african independence and those leaders were locked with a specific condition that were written in the secret agreements one of them was for example the private access plans to uh the resource the national resource of all former colonies the exclusivity of the french military presence all over those countries also the position of a kind of um nicely [Music] private private relation between those african head of states and uh general double so we need to understand that secret agreements is also linked to a personal relation that were organized by jack with uh african and french thank you so much um we have another question um from jordan what is the activism like on the ground in france in regards to uh in regard to french activity in africa is there solidarity among activists furthermore is the activism perceived as both the communitarianism and racism anti-black by the french media that's a good question one difficulty is that french people are not really aware of what is happening in africa they don't know the french army is really enough they don't know what is happening in the french caribbean we have a very strong colonial situation since many years and nobody out of it in france 10 years ago there was huge manifestation demonstration in the french caribbean and only um shown by u.s television and when it was france it was the century we have a kind of um a division of uh the different activist lamps and here in france we have the african diaspora that are [Music] taking the streets every weekend for protesting against france presence in africa but it's divided between each african diaspora mali senegal cameroon etc that really united on the other side we have um black french movement movement movements that are demonstrating on the same day about french racism about um state violence but there is no connection between what the army is doing and all those people are treated by the french for this system so we need to build this connection and take also the prediction of the french caribbean that is a truly colonial situation the real colonial situation is one of the french situation and all those struggles all those um with education we need to build i think a platform that can only be a pan-african platform so this is what we are trying to to organize right now because some of them are french citizens they won't see their life anywhere out of friends so they're struggling for integration in the french system some others want to repatriate in africa so we also have the difficulty that the french system is assimilationist and in the same time targeting by the privatism so this is very complicated and i think that we are really in a huge colonial situation in every um every side of uh yes thank you very much i think this is a really important point you made also um this the separation of groups i think that is really central in understanding the difficulties of of overcoming that and these parallels of internal colonial situation against the you know what this organization the in lis indigene de la republique called this indigene right and then of course people in africa as the you know still the indigene from there so um and it's of course interesting also to think about the um you know this systemic fight right now against the colonial theories there right so i think there's a whole you know thing that this question kind of um brings up in terms of you know points but we have another question that will take us um again in a different direction um also for dr bukhari yabara you mentioned that we need to be vigilant about the ecowas currency that is meant to replace the cfr can you please expand and then uh for dr murray you mentioned the large presence of french mncs in africa how do we challenge entrenched companies like total so first for the career yeah in fact in 1945 france created a colonial currency of french colonial africa that was renamed at the time of uh independence but stayed the colonial currency until now and this currency is divided in three parts one is in west africa so it's the former west african french colonies another one is in south africa third one is in an ocean and in 2013 there was a report written by several french economists one is who said that it was time for france to leave the francefa because the france is not adapted to um fight uh the chinese presence in africa and we need to understand that fr is a huge scandal because it it uh of lots of money to france this time so france controlled this money made this money this money is made in france and the african countries use this money and they must give at least 50 percent of the french treasury and exchange french treasury maintained the stability of the money one world very one word very important in the new system is soft stability money stability political systems this is why we have african president for 20 25 34 years because stability is the meaning of maintenance of french interest so this money this currency is not adapted to a neutral liberal way of recolonization of africa china is making it right now so in 2013 they decided to to enlarge the french monetary zone losing especially in west africa ghana and targeting nigeria because nigeria is the real enemy of french france in west france most want to um to take more parts on the nigerian markets and stefa is not really interesting to to attack the nigerian mall so they decided why this was also hugely contested by the youth to take an african project of monetary common monetary zone that was supposed to be named and france decided to turn on the frontier to change the name in the name of that was the name of the money that was supposed to to be um be launched by african states so it uh triggered a kind of dramatic war uh between france and uh the other uh non-fun countries like nigeria we say that we cannot take this money right now because france would still get control in the in the organization of this monetary monetary system so right now we are still in the old front cfr and there is no specific vision to get out of this creation there are many debates some of them like say that we need to in country to take a national currency we need to uh to cut the notion of collective currency other are saying that we need currency so there are many many many debates but we need to know that france has a solution new coordinate solution for each african acquisition so we need to find the one that would be the best to um to our own interest this is what we need to address right now not to only focus on what france what we as africans want to do because the monetary issue is linked to many other problematics i think that if africa is if as african we have our own money but our leaders are still puppets of paris will change nothing so the political control is central and it reminds us that used to say that we need to seek first the political kingdom and right now the debate is only about monetary and economic issues but it is a political issue so we are in a kind of dead end debate for a few years and i hope that we can find a solution in the next years but can only be political okay thank you very much dr murray could you comment on the other question on the presence of french mncs in africa um yeah well first i wanted to um just briefly touch on jordan's question which was about activists in france because that's a portion of my work is following a cameroonian diaspora group the regard anti-sardina which is the brigade of against sardines and this is a diaspora collective that has emerged in the last couple of years which uses kind of critical diaspora spaces either um in in france sometimes in switzerland in germany um in the united states um and uh they have targeted demonstrations um either at places that have ties to palbia or in 2019 they had a targeted demonstration outside of the cameroonian embassy in paris and they actually managed to occupy the the the embassy um for many hours um and the whole thing was live streamed um but brigade anti-sardina anti-sardines because um they call members of the air depeche which is the ruling party um sardines so it's it's a kind of comical name um on the basis that paul bia in his kind of patronage and in in his campaigns he famously um gives out um cans of sardines um as a kind of you know way to um encourage people to vote for him and so they say contour sardine to it sardine like when you kind of like a cat if you've you know you've eaten the sardine it's gone to your brain um so the diaspora space in france is really important um although yeah i would echo the other points about whether or not these are pan-african solidarities um is is questionable yeah but the issue of not just french corporations but corporations um in in african countries is obviously a question of the century and if we knew um how they could be resisted more effectively particularly in a neo-liberal era when you know so a lot of my work has been with um people in cameroon who live along the chad cameroon oil pipeline and one of the complaints is that honestly memphis helped port konye like you know this was a project um that was supported by the world bank um with the you know the consortium of a malaysian oil firm uh patronus with chevron with exxon you know and has since um you know expanded to include dozens of other oil corporations um and so that you know the kind of neoliberal fracturing of extractive capitalism renders resistance incredibly challenging for people on the ground because they really don't know what door to knock on when they're resisting um uh you know do we go to the world bank do we go to our chief do we go to um someone in yeonde or do you know who who should we go to and then also corporations in corporate interests profit off of that to play the blame game amongst themselves and so you know they will always pass the buck to one or the other to say oh well you know it's not us um it was actually you know and these conversations are always racialized um and deeply racist and the trope of the failed states and the african leadership deficit is perpetually called upon by corporate interests to justify their extractive actions and to say you know we were trying to be more compassionate um but you know uh et cetera et cetera there's also this question about lauren bagbo um which i think is a really interesting question in the chat um about whether or not the fact that he you know was at the hague for nine years but eventually was acquitted is this a victory for you know does this signal that he resisted la france afrique um and you know he's continued to stay in europe does would his eventual return to cote d'ivoire signal a blow to the france africa in the region a really complicated issue um but i think that no um the fact that um you know lauren bagbo and um blake charob leigh gude who was the minister of youth and sport at the time who was also tried with him at the icc um i think that it actually signals the strength of imperial power that they were held for so long um and acquitted um and as part of that um it wasn't that bagbo is simply remaining on in europe because he still loves it um he's not allowed to return to cote d'ivoire and blai gude was also tried in a court um in cote d'ivoire and sentenced to some 20 years in prison um and so you know lauren bagbo i don't think he's also a superhero of pan-africanism or you know someone who is staunchly against la france africa in the first place um so no so no i don't think that it signals um that he was able to resist lefron zafriq okay great so we are more or less um coming towards the end of the the seminar the round table um ask some questions oh yeah of course yeah i i i wanted to ask two questions and the first was about a projection of the weakness of france that the echo was not only in response to what happened in 2013 but because the germans who ultimately dominate europe are worried about france failures in africa and therefore the germans have become much more active in africa and therefore are pushing the echo to undermine france's role and therefore the the the reconstitution of the european project through france was a consolation in that sense that is that's that's the first part of my question and the second part of my question was for the future because france is inordinately poor and what their activities in west africa now depends on the united states of america because the united states of america has no military collaboration with the with the french the extent to which the radical movement in the united states of america gains traction in the united states and forced the anti-racist project in the united states to what extent do we have in pan-africanist like amazon or amber an alternative project for collaboration in those zones between people who speak french and in the global anti-racist and anti-imperialist movement you know do we have a project which is beyond france and anti-racism are we envisioning this project can we can we consider such a project yes i i think we we we definitely need we need to engage in a new internationalism i think it's really important many people many african youth i'm working with are looking at the way countries like venezuela are resisting to u.s realism many many african youth looking at the way the world is going on we have a situation where effectively france is not so strong as it meant to be i think it's really important to understand it france is a very small country it did not have the means of our mission it wants to show us a super power but it's a really small power dependent on the german on the us and even on the chinese are trying to get some chinese cooperation in africa and they're also dealing with the one belt one word project of global of globalization from the chinese so i think that we have a one project that is clearly historical that is a pure african african project that was part of the old european geopolitics saying that the mediterranean sea should be the earth of this global civilization and we know that when it was when it was uh 14s in the 20s there were also works of uh science fiction saying that when europe will not be and it would not be possible to live in europe for dramatic reasons europeans will migrate in africa we need to secure places in africa so this is science fiction but know what science fiction is when you're speaking of this kind of project we know that chinese are buying enhance africa we know that everyone is in africa right now thinking about what we will be in 15 or 100 years we definitely need on the african side to get this global vision and this historical vision i think that the french situation is a very specific because it developed for many years a kind of how can i say hypocritical friendship with africans and france pretends to be the friend of africa they say that they know africans better than africa knows themselves finally so we need also to um to engage i think the ecological uh aspiration this is really really important if we want to get um a break and we also know to to use i think the european division to engage an african vision what we need is a european policy by african and pan-african to employ the european division like tucson virtue in the asian revolution used the division between the french the spanish and the british to liberate santo domingo from slavery and later distant look as independent so we need to to look at the contradiction between earth's imperialism and german imperialism is part of it regarding how could we build a project one project dealing with antiracism with anti-imperialism and pan-africanism i think it's a long long story that is quite impossible if we are not connecting our different mass movements our different organization if we cannot define our own situation in each context of the world and from this work field work we need to find the the actual earth of the regular system this is really important and one of weakness in the imperialist world is the dependency to the natural resources so we need to engage african workers african peasants we need to think about the the the mode of production that is dealing with africa today and to engage the the world economic relations i think that we need to get global vision some local uh position and some connection between the local and not being too small without being big so on my mind it's only a matter of time and [Music] if we keep the distance keep the intellectual struggle if we keep the connections from one part to another one something should come but the difficulty is that we are divided among ourselves so we have many africans who want to work with france many black people want to be french before everything so the issue of identity must also be put on the table there are people who say that north africa is not africa etc so we need to also engage those issues that are really divisive and to find i think a specific definition of pan-africanism that is not necessarily a new definition i think that in the past in our historical experience we have everything but we need to take the tools we need to take virgins from our historical experience to build something new today so is there a time still um yes please okay yeah we have about seven minutes i couldn't find that okay great um well i think um what i would say in response to this is to emphasize um perhaps uh in addition to what's already been said um the role and the importance of education um and i do mean primary secondary and tertiary education um and oh someone's in the waiting room um so um i mean horus of course will know this um that one of my first academic appointments um was at jima university in jima ethiopia and um there we had at the university no department of politics and so i was in a department of governance and development and really what we did under the auspices of governance and development um you know me and and some of my more critical colleagues was to teach political history um but the kind of rise and the dominance of the of notions of entrepreneurship and um neoliberal economic doctrine and um you know decades of underfunding of the critical social sciences and the humanities um across the continent um in in higher education um has you know really i think played a profound impact on how people envision possible futures and so the role i think of um education and really supporting critical scholars on the continent not you know there are many in the diaspora um is is a point that's that's really important um and then you know i mean i would just say that um you know in in considering uh this this project and the the alternative um one thing um you know of course also that we're recognizing is the forms of permanent repression and the deep obstacles to peaceful demonstration of any kind and um and so you know for the activists um that i work with in yeonde um they see videos of intentional maiming by security forces of 17 year old kids who are marching um you know peacefully to demonstrate against um you know paul bia and and authoritarianism um and so the the obstacles are also enormous um this kind of you know systematic forms of repression violent and infrastructural repression as well because even as you know spaces have opened up in social media those spaces have also been foreclosed and so um activists in cameroon have been charged with cyber terrorism and this is you know um something that we have seen in um in chad in egypt you know many places are the kind of shutting down of the digital realm which you know especially in in the arab spring had been an important counter space for peaceful exchange and the kind of articulation of different futures that you're talking about horus um yeah and then i guess just one final point about the the way is the you know this the the repression and um forms of sabotage have been the persistence of divide and rule tactics by um you know uh repressive governments and and so we you know we see in cameroon this very targeted um kind of ethnicization of political issues that is inaccurate right and so it's a way in which alternatives are delegitimized as oh you know it's just vamili k people or oh those are just you know les nordis or those are just uh you know anglophone peoples when you speak to activists and those divisions are not concrete and those divisions are not real and that is not how they understand themselves um and yet that's constantly the barrage that um appears in in state media um yeah so i guess i i really listed more of the challenges um unfortunately but yeah looking forward to continuing that conversation yes thank you so much i think this is extremely important i mean if you see all the if you see the demonstrations of people throughout africa and the kind of tanks and militarized police they encounter which has dramatically grown over the last 10 years i mean really dramatically it is very very worrying and preoccupying yes thank you so much um i'm not sure how um we are in time um should i conclude slowly yeah so um yeah thank you this was a great um debate with you know much food for thought about the challenges the hopes you have to say optimist um and um this is i think um probably a topic that the pan-african studies program will um address in the future because it's not going away so um i don't know if uh mata or jordan you wanna make some announcement for next meetings um then i'm handing the mic to you and i'm i'm done okay thank you before you do that could i could i move a vote of thanks yes okay um it is um now after 11 30 in paris and after 10 30 in um in in oxford so um let me see that the african initiative is very poor and we did not have the financial resources to ask these people to speak so we want to thank them very much because it is a representation of their commitment to the pan-african struggle i have known amsat nearly 20 years and you could see from the work that he's done as an africanist starting with walter rodney that his work is very comprehensive and he's he sees the link between colonialism in the caribbean and the oppression in france i'm sad thank you for and i and i'm sure your work will continue with our war work that we're doing at the global level not only in the caribbean but the north part of our so i want to thank you very much i also want to thank amber murray because amber is an example of what um an africanist who was trained properly here is someone who comes from idaho but now is a leader in the pan-african world and who has taken up the question of sankara and african freedom and she is becoming an intellectual leader among the pan-africanists and i i i can say that um when i met amber and she was in our pan-african program she was already on a progressive trajectory but i'm i would say i want to say this to jordan and to mahi that this is what can happen in other words this is what comes out of our program and and i think jordan and you are making very important connections here with amza for in terms of your work so and let me thank um amber and amber please send the love from the african initiative to your children were born in syracuse that we still remember them um let me thank all the members of the board of african initiative were there i see many of them here and i really want to thank the students who have come out because we have many of the students who are trying to study and honest africa and we want to thank the large audience who come from many different possible we saw goshu in australia who came on so um i i want to thank everybody we have we don't have a lot of resources but we have committed people like um like jordan and mahi whose leadership we're going to work with you know so that um mahi and jordan are the new leaders of the african initiative who are working with the board of african initiative and um thank you so much for cheering um you're the newest member of the african initiative we we plan to work with you um and janet although you're in um cornell you as a member of the faculty of syracuse we want to thank you so much for coming forward and um um i want to um now give it back over to mahi and jordan thank in you um of gratitude i also want to thank you who have not only been a teacher to most people in this conference room right now but have also preserved this space and preserved africa initiative with other board members who are here today for discussions like this to carry on so i want to thank you and on that note i want to thank everybody who participated today both our speakers i want to reiterate the thank you i think it was a great event in terms of historicizing france's role and also globalizing the struggle that's ongoing on the ground in africa against imperialism so thank you again um in april we will have another event african initiative is doing another event on libya and so i will be sending out jordan and myself will be sending out emails in regards to the promotion once we have a confirmed date in april um but yeah thank you again everybody and thank you jordan um he's the one who took charge on this event so i want to give it up to him um thank you everyone thanks so much again for the invitation it was really a pleasure thank you amber please keep in touch we should have a skype discussion sometime soon we're still going to unite africa with our water transfer system", "zccy4hHa2ao": "[Music] morning beautiful people it's dr bacon hope everyone's having a good morning it's a little after sunrise the airplanes are leaving john wayne airport the airport's closed at night so when they open at seven there's a lot of traffic for a while used to be traffic all day there's not nearly as many flights as there used to be so i got up

gonna go in here they didn't have any square ones um so i'm just gonna go with a round five gallon rather short pot and i did work on this a little bit too i'm not really happy with it i'm not unhappy with it but um messing still messing around with some kind of scrog that i can support from inside from from the plant rather than from the uh the tent hey that's the morning update i've got some stuff going on today i'll make another episode um later but i'll just show you how the clones are doing get you guys started for the day and say hello uh like and subscribe i'll shoot some stuff out later as well as an update to our awesome weed map okay guys uh good morning and have a great day bye [Music] you", "-FXmDvLeC9E": "[Music] okay guys welcome back to my channel we are back with another video uh this video is going to be me reviewing some products that i got as well as um yeah basically i'm just gonna be it's a chit chat get ready with me i don't have anything to do i'm bored at home you know the works and also i received some new makeup so what i'm going to be doing is trying on makeup that i got at beauty revolution makeup that i got it clicks on the three foot two sale and also some new brushes if you know me or if you follow me you'll know that like i always tweet about these brushes these are the real techniques flawless base brushes finally finally got my hands on them and i'm gonna be reviewing them basically and letting you guys know what is the works basically this whole video and i'll be using makeup that i just got everything from foundation [Music] to eyeshadow literally everything and i feel like this would help because if you are someone that's like me that likes makeup that's cheap and affordable but still does the job you're gonna find out that a lot of these brands that you just walk past at clicks or disk him they have fire products and you're sleeping so anyways let's just get right into the video i don't want to ramble i'm gonna put this hairband on because i don't wanna get foundation and stuff on my hair and i just did it because i did say this is a get ready with me at chit chat get ready with me i'm just gonna be talking while going through my makeup and also i'm gonna erase the products because i think that's like the first thing to do especially if you're doing a review and yeah i'm just gonna start off by moisturizing my face because i have dry skin and the moisturizer that i'm using today is byzantics it's very cheap and it's for acne prone skin as you can see i don't know what's going on there but apparently i have acne prone skin now so what i like to do with my moisturizer especially when i'm applying makeup is i like to pat the moisturizer into my face i dislike wrapping because you don't get your your blood cells moving when you do that so yeah that's literally what i'm doing so the first product that i'm trying that i had doubts about was the wait and wild photo focus concealer it looks like this i don't know if you guys can see that it looks like this and this is in the color deep tan so normally now when i do my makeup i like to put concealer under my base if that makes sense i know why but i just like doing it okay so one con that i hate about wits and wild complexion products is that they don't have a great variety of stuff to choose from especially when it comes to complexion and that is me because there's so many women in south africa with so many different types of complexions and they literally have like seven concealers marks okay there's not much coverage but it's it's working i think i should have let it sit for a bit but then again this is concealer for under my makeup base so it doesn't really matter to me it just as long as it's brightening up my face i am now just grabbing my regular regular raincoat mascara from yardley and i'm just cutting my eyebrows in it so that they stay and i get that natural brow yeah another thing that i've recently been into is putting liquid cheek blush under my foundation and you guys have seen this i think i think i've posted it on my ig tv because i haven't done a makeup tutorial in a while so this is the one from benefits and it's the benetint in i don't know what color this is it doesn't have a name on the little packaging because mine is the really tiny one i don't know why but i feel like it gives such a rosy undertone under your skin and it makes your makeup look more natural even if you cake it on by mistake so that's what i've been into basically it's liquid blush under your foundation and i tend to put a lot because obviously i'm going to put foundation on top of this [Music] okay so the next step is obviously foundation and with this i didn't change much i just changed the uh fit me from 332 to 336 and warm olive and the reason i did that is because i don't know i really don't know i won't lie to you i just felt like trying out a new one but anyways since my foundation combination hasn't changed because i mix this with the wits and wild photo focus foundation this is one of the best drugstore foundations out there like and it's cheap also guys don't sleep on weights and wild and that's how you don't sleep on weights and wild please listen to me because the complexion products are really amazing and they are so cheap because that foundation is only 100 and you get so much because i remember i had the same foundation and i used it for like seven months and you know i do my makeup quite a lot so that means it lost okay i'm gonna grab a brush and just mix that mixture on my hand okay so now we're going to be trying out the real techniques the real techniques foundation brush to see if there's anything different like if they're worth the height because everyone hypes these brushes up oh my god you should get the real techniques they blend really nicely and honestly when i do my foundation with the brush it blends just as great so i don't know we'll have to see [Music] that does not look like i might that doesn't look like my shade oh yeah i'm just gonna roll with this honestly oh it looks fine it's the ring light huh okay this is the brush i'm using it is number 204 i love the packaging very sleek i can't believe i got foundation on it already so i'm just gonna put this all over my face [Music] i'm going to take the brush and let's see as usual i'm using the same pattern lotions that i'd use if i was applying any other product this is scary like this color is scaring me the foundation color like i don't know if this is my color hmm i won't lie it blends very beautifully like look at that but the foundation color is scaring me i feel like i look orange i look like a butternut i look like someone put tumeric on my face like i don't know where i went wrong but yes definitely worth it it's not very price friendly because these foundations i mean not foundations these brushes for that whole set i paid 495. so it's not very budget friendly but it is worth the hype like i cannot lie to you guys right now do you see how seamless that blended and this is drugstore foundation a hundred round red rendered red red hundred grand foundation okay from where i am the foundation doesn't look too bad i think it's for lighting that's making it look like i have a butternut on my face but yeah i'm gonna give this brush a 9 out of 10. it's bomb i won't lie to you guys like and it feels amazing on your skin like it feels so lightweight i like how it made a 99 red foundation look as full coverage as my weights and wild foundation is looking right now so yeah okay the next product we're gonna try is the maybelline fit me concealer i've seen people raving about it and you guys know i've used it before but um [Music] i don't know i was not impressed when i used it first so i'm gonna try it once again okay so this color is the color 45 and i think it's perfect for me no 40 not 45 sorry it's the color 40 it doesn't have a name it's just called 40. and a concealer tip you guys is that if a concealer is as runny as this one you wanna you wanna like make it sit a bit on your face before you blend it out okay so i said i'm gonna be using a palette to do my brows and the palette i'm going to be using is the home hermosa palette from gorgeous buddies collection it's beautiful this is what it looks like on the inside and i think i'm going to use it today to do my eye look because i've never given you guys a review but wow guys pigment so i'm going to be using this shade over here called brow it and i'm going to just go into it with a very light hand and just lightly fill in my brows [Music] okay my eyebrows are looking a bit crazy right now but i'm just gonna take a spoolie and i'm just gonna [Music] okay so for concealer i'm going back in with the same fit me concealer and i'm just putting some on my hands so i can cover up my brows [Music] okay so i'm just going to be taking my blending brush it's buffy like that and i'm just gonna be taking that concealer and just pressing it against my skin remember to use a light hand i usually just hold the tip of my brush um it's blending okay but usually i do my eyebrows at the weights and wild concealer but i mix it with my phone from la gopro conceal and honestly i think that combination is better than this one right here like it didn't blend too shabby i just don't like the consistency of of this i don't know [Music] this overall i would give it a solid 7 because i've seen better and i've used it better maybe it's because i'm using a dry sponge well it's not dry but it's not as blown up as it normally is and that's only because i'm lazy i'm also gonna use that under my eyes just to give a gradient a solid gradient all over okay that's how our makeup is looking for now and i'm not mad okay so we're back and right now i'm going to be doing my concealer with one of the brushes in the shades um my contour sorry we'll be doing it with one of the brushes on the seat and this is the flat top um brush and i'm basically just gonna be using that to like carve out my bone structure and yeah i'm using the inner girl pro conceal in the shade dark cocoa let me just it's very defined so i like that about this brush like you get the product where exactly you want it to be um i usually use this one because it blends beautifully as you can see and i can't use the foundation real techniques one because um i don't want a dark color on there in case i ever need to touch up my foundation it's a bit thick and i'm just going to be blending out the edges and also right there by my brow a tip if you want to define nose contour you have to bring it like to the beginning of your brow it really gives you that snatch to know when you have your contour right there see the way i'm doing it but obviously i don't want my nose contour this matched so i'm gonna go back with the concealer and i'm just going to do a small line and blend that out okay now we are going to be trying out this j cat beauty um banana powder i got a beauty revolution at the stand dupe factory i'm going to put it here the instagram is do factory is amazing products and it's a banana color which i normally use so i'm just going to be packing that under my eye oh by the way i rate the contour brush a out solid 10 and i need the concealer as i said like a seven yeah i'm gonna read to the saber now i'm using the powder brush and i'm gonna lightly put butter under my eye i'm not a fan of baking but when i have a lot of makeup on i tend to bake i really like this powder because it complements my skin tone and it's not too yellow i hate yellow setting powders like there's nothing that works me more than seeing someone wearing a bright yellow and a like contour i mean under i know what they call it man sensing powder yeah a bright yellow sitting powder i hate it i hate it i hate it i'm gonna go back in under the eye [Music] okay i like it i like it i like the way it's it don't forget to set your smile lines like around your mouth and also where like your contour is i like it i like it a lot as i said before i'm going to be using things that i haven't used before and with the soft glam look i was going for i had already used that palette on my channel before so i'm going to be using the um palette from hermosa cosmetics i'm going to leave the instagram down below and yeah i'm going to first go in with this color called contour it it's this brown over here and i'm gonna just lightly blend it into my crease just like that like very lightly [Music] um yeah lol this is not going to be a soft glam look i'm so sorry guys i forgot the palette that i used for myself glam look the other day so yeah so now i'm digging in to stay humble it's this color here and i'm just taking a buffing brush and packing it on my corner of my eye like that [Music] over it like you see where my crease is i'm just gonna start [Music] like that [Music] okay so to get the same eye achievement as i did on this side you're gonna go in with a white color whitish and just go into your crease and pat that color on the cut crease that you formed okay [Music] and stay humble at the corner again just like that another thing i'm gonna quickly do is take some more powder and just sweep it under my eye [Music] same breath i'm gonna be tasting i think i give the powder a solid 9 out of 10 because as i said i like the color and it's not to watch colors yellow so now i'm testing out the nyx on the rise volume mascara it looks like this it's pink and i'm just literally putting some on my eyes on days that i don't we must i mean when on days i don't wear lashes i think this mascara would be great because it makes my lashes look good it's not the best mascara i've seen because essence i won't lie has the basement scars but it's also good enough okay so next i'm going to be using the lady lock eyeliner pen from is it oh liquid like why did i say lady like liquid luck from switch beauty it looks like this and i'm gonna be using it on my eyes honestly i love this it's easy to apply and it'll give you that perfect sharp wing i'm gonna leave the instagram right here okay so i've also gotten into the habit of doing my inner corner highlight i mean eyeliner and i do that with this liquid pen it's the ultra thin one from fishini the all woman collection as you know if you want to check out the makeup please check out my review somewhere on my channel of the makeup and you won't be disappointed [Music] i just put my lashes on and they are drying right now so while they are drying i'm going to go into the palette again and i'm going to go into the shade glow up which is right here and i'm going to be using i think a very detailed brush so brush like this and go in there and put it in my inner [Music] corner [Music] okay so right now i'm doing the finishing touches i don't get a new blush so i'm gonna be using the same old palette that i always use which is this for shiny one and i'm just gonna be putting that all over my cheeks and i already had a rosy effect from the blush that we used earlier so i don't have to use much now see how beautiful that looks i know why but my lashes look like big looking and i cannot have that am i the only person that can't like apply lashing the same way on both eyes because i'm starting to feel like it or maybe my eyes are just not equal i'm gonna go back into the palette again and i'm just gonna go into the shade whole mood and i'm going to be using that as my highlights because i love it elaborately love it so i'm using homemade right now you can only put at the top of your nose and on your bridge don't cut all over your nose i also like to keep that highlight here first and then move up i feel like it's a more natural highlight when i put it on my cheeks and i opt for a matte blush [Music] so as i was saying i'm gonna use lipstick today because i don't have lip gloss and usually look like this i would wear lip gloss but it's locked down and i don't have any lip gloss so i'm going to be using vaseline right now as a base for my lips i'm going to use this brownish um lipstick from pip i don't remember when i got it and i don't think it's there anymore but yeah i can't even line my lips because i forgot my liner at my place which is amazing not sure i like this color i'm gonna mix it with this it's the color fleek from the miss it miss a hollow sharpness a haul so ladies and gents that may also watch my channel this is the final look uh i love the products that i use one critique i have is the maybelline concealer i've used better and i don't know if i'm a fan fan but it's not too bad like it's not horrible um another thing i don't know i don't like my eyebrows i feel like maybe i just didn't blend them out in the middle i don't know they look like i don't know what's going on but yeah i don't like my eyebrows they're too thick for me i normally do like more what do you call those more thinner eyebrows but yeah i love love the palette yeah and i love the setting spray it looks good because remember how i looked in the beginning that was tricky so the fact that i overcame

"hi everyone its Keren here and welcome\nback to my channel today I have a new video tutorial with ten art acts or\ncraft hacks that you can do using a glue gun so sit down and joy and I've listed\nall the products below in the description area the first hacks quite a\nsimple one is making your own gemstones or pearls so you can create pearl like\ngemstones on your projects whether it's a card art journal or any type of\nproject by just squeezing some glue on a piece of paper or basically on any type\nof surface you can make these pearls any size you want and then you can decorate\nthem all you have to do is just squeeze the glue and then move it in a circular\nmotion to make sure that no residue stays on your paper that way they become\nquite circular if you want to be able to use these as an embellishment and\nactually not as texture all you have to do is just do them on a nonstick surface\nand that way you can remove them and actually create real pearls however for\nthis example I did them on a piece of paper and I'm covering them with black\ngesso just so I can show you how well they look this precision glue gun is\nperfect to create this type of pearls because it has a really thin spout and\nyou can easily create beautiful pearls with it to show you how shiny they are I\nam using some prima fin Abair rose gold wax just to show you how nicely the\npearls come out you could of course color them and white or in any type of\npaint you could basically do anything you want with them the sky's the limit\nthe only thing you have to remember like with all the examples coming up is that\nyou cannot heat set the paint above the glue gun texture you have to let it air\ndry because if you heat set the paint on top of the glue it will soften to glue\nand will melt it the second art hack with a glue gun is creating texture and\nI actually took a small canvas this is a 4 by 4 canvas and I started moving my\nglue gun around creating this really fun texture on the background you could do\nthis on any type of surface it doesn't really matter\nall you have to do is just move and create any type of texture it could be\nlines it could be squiggles it could be just dots so basically you\ncan create any texture to use on your project and as I said before when you're\nadding any type of paint or gesso on top just make sure you don't heat set it and\nlet it all air dry so what I did here is I took white gesso\nand I give it a really nice cover I want to use the canvas for a different\nproject so all I did is I gave the canvas a nice coat of white gesso\nbecause I wanted to add some nice sprays on top of it you could also add paints\nor paste or any type of product that will just let the texture show on the\nsurface my third art hack with the glue gun is creating paint drips so all you\nhave to do is basically create a blob at the top and then let it run down and it\ncreates these beautiful paint like paint drips so I have my precision glue gun\nand I also have a glue gun from the dollar store and I just wanted to show\nyou that that you can use either one to create this I do prefer my precision\nglue gun just because it's so accurate and it's so easy to use and it also\nstands on its own without having any drips going anywhere for my fourth hack\nis actually creating your own designs and for this one I actually used the\nsame precision glue gun and just created a really fun background on a piece of\npaper of course you could do this on any type of surface and all I did is create\na heart with my glue gun and then some lines going from it it's a really good\nway of creating your own backgrounds or any other type of design that you want\nfor your projects of course this also can create texture like I said in the\nother hack but it's mainly creating your own designs with the glue gun to be able\nto see the design and the texture on each of these hacks you really need to\nadd some kind of paint or gesso or some color to be able to see the designs well\nso the same way with the canvas texture I'm adding white\ngesso to the one with the heart and the lines the one with the drips I left lane\nbecause I wanted to add watercolors on it so for the one with the hearts all I\ndid is take some color boom sprays and you can use any type of spray and I just\nwent ahead and sprayed it all over just to show you that you can really see the\ndesign you could also paint this with some kind of acrylic paint or gelato or\nanything at all and I did the same thing for the actual canvas because I really\nwanted to show how nicely the texture looks once you add this praise the\ncolors really make a difference and make it look really cool the only thing with\nthis is that I have to patiently let it dry because I cannot heat set it as it\nwill melt the glue underneath so I use wipes to just wipe off a little bit of\nthe excess so you can really see the deep color underneath and you can see\nthe texture on top as highlights my fifth hack has to do with watercolor\nresist technique and for this one I'm going to use the paint drip background\nso all I did is took some of the watercolor confections from Prima which\nare beautiful watercolors and all I'm doing is adding it to my background my\npaint drip background I'm also spraying on it to show you that you can also use\nsprays as well as watercolors then all you do is you take a wipe and you wipe\noff the excess on the actual drips the glue resists the ink and the watercolor\nand the color only shows on the sides of the glued area my 6 hack is one of my\nfavorite ones and that is that you can create your own stencils using your glue\ngun I'm designing the stencil on top of my 12 by 12 Tonique Studios tempered\nglass mat you can also use a nonstick mat to create the stencils all you have\nto do is just create at any design you want in this case I'm designing circular\nstencil by making circles and making sure they're attached to each other\nI made random stir in different sizes until I was happy\nwith the design I guess it would have been good to use a plain background\nbecause you can't really see the stencils but when I use them later on in\nthe video you are going to see how cool they are\nthe second stencil I created was just making three hearts that are attached to\neach other I could have created more hearts or any\ntype of design but I just wanted to show you the idea the nice thing about the\nglue from a glue gun is that it dries really quickly and when it's done on\nglass because the glass is cold it actually dries even quicker so it's such\na quick way to create this type of stencils and designs and once it's dry\nyou just peel it off and it's so easy to just remove I just have to be very\ncareful to make sure that I don't rip the glue and the circles but it removes\nquite easily from the mat and it's an amazing design stencil that I just\ncreated in like basically a minute I realized after by pure coincidence that\nin order to remove this much easier from my glass mat all I had to do was spray\nit with a little bit of alcohol and it actually came off so easily and you'll\nsee later and another example that I have make now I'm going to just use the\nstencils with some sprays and all I did is just place them on a piece of paper\nand then just spray with a couple colors of Colin bloom spray and locale amazing\nthese designs came out and all you have to do is just clean the stencil again\nand you can reuse it as many times as you want\nyou can also use this as an embellishment or to create texture on a\nproject so you could go ahead and glue this on a project as well for my seventh\nhack I actually used my glue gun to create my own embellishments and there's\na different ways that you can do this you can do this as a stencil that I\nalready did or you could use it using stamps or some kind of image for this\nexample I'm going to stamp a happy word or sentiment onto my glass mat and then\nI'm going to use my glue gun to fill in the letters you could also use any type\nof shade or any type of stamp like a flower or a\nleaf or circle and just create your own embellishments so the same way I did\nbefore I am doing it on my glass mat and you can also do it on a nonstick surface\nso all I'm doing is filling in the lettering and letting it dry so I could\nremove it another way you can do it is printing an image from the internet on a\npiece of paper and then using some kind of clear glass to put on top and then\ncreating your own embellishment as I said before it's much easier if you add\na little bit of alcohol and wet the area where you're in you're removing the\nembellishment that way it comes off quite easily from the mat here I have\nthe finished embellished ward that I can use on any project and the same way that\nI created this word I can also create any type of embellishment to color in\nthe embellishment I covered it in black gesso and then I went ahead and added\nsome wax on it again of course the gesso wasn't dry because\nas you know I cannot dry and heat set it so I should have waited a little bit\nmore patiently for the gesso to dry so it kind of mixed a little bit with the\nwax and as you can see it got all over my mat so I did sit and let it dry for a\nlittle bit longer and cleaned up my area and then I went back and added a little\nbit more wax that way it really took on the color my ate art hack is using molds\nto create embellishments I've already use this hack on another\nvideo where I show how to use molds in five different ways one of the ways was\nto use a glue gun to fill in the mold and create the shaped embellishment so\nin this case I filled out these two roses inside my silicone mold and once\nit was dry all I had to do was pop them out and a have a beautiful shaped\nembellishment for my project you can use these for a card or for journal or even\na mixed-media project it's a very cheap and inexpensive way\nuse inside the mold and the shape comes out perfectly\nmy ninth art hack happened just by accident while I was leaving the glue\ngun to sit on my table some of it would drip down onto my mat and would dry in a\nround form almost like a little pebble or stone so I started collecting them as\nthey were falling because the glue gun was sitting on my table for a while and\nI thought that that would be an amazing hack even if you create your own texture\nballs that you can use them in your projects instead of mini art stones my\ntenth art act is actually one that is very useful especially for mixed-media\ncollage here is an old project where I use this technique and just want to show\nyou how well it held over the years what I do is I use a glue gun as a reinforcer\nfor the heavy gel or for the soft gel so basically any gel media the way I do it\nis that I know that the glue gun will glue the embellishments and will dry\nreally quickly which is really easy because that way I can hold the\nembellishments in place however the glue from the glue gun has a shelf life\nmeaning that after a while it doesn't hold its own and things get detached\nfrom what they were glued on so a good way to use the glue gun is to actually\ncombine it with the gel medium so you're just using the quick drying glue from\nthe glue gun to actually hold the embellishment in place but the gel\nmedium which takes 24 hours or longer to dry will actually permanently glue the\nembellishment so when combined together the glue gun\nholds it temporarily but the gel medium actually hold it permanently so I hope\nyou liked my 10 glue gun art hats if you have any other art ideas that you\ncan do with a glue gun feel free to leave me a comment about them I'm sure\nthere's many other ideas if I have enough of them I will probably make a\nsecond video with more ideas with the glue gun there is so many ideas out\nthere that is just unbelievable just wanted to show you one more time all the\nproject although some of them haven't dried especially the ones with the\nsprays I really love how they all turned out and what I like about it is that\nthey're so versatile you can use them in any type of project thank you so much\nfor watching for more inspiration subscribe to my\nchannel and visit me on my website bye", "vYw_8YfmJq8": "come py on you know

self-sufficient me and I'm back with another quick fruit and veg growing tip and this one's an ingenious way to use vaso to stop scale and athens from sucking the life out of your precious fruit trees and plants let's get into it scale and athens are insects that feed off the SAP in your plants like a tick or mozzie sucks blood out of us and if we let aphids of scale get too numerous that will eventually kill the plant or tree these pests do have natural predators like wasps and ladybugs which is good hey but not so fast because these sinister little buggers have a clever trick to protect themselves and it's called ants they bribe ants yes that's right they bribe them with a honey secretion that ants just love to eat and in return for this sweet treat the ants protect the scale and aphids by attacking any predators that try to get them but if we stop the ants that leaves the aphids and scale vulnerable to their natural predators but how do we do that well it's easy get some Vaseline on your finger and smear a coating around the stem of the tree about an inch or so wide or if there's lots of ant activity perhaps several inches wide what this does is create a sticky boundary that doesn't hurt the tree but it does stop the ants from climbing up or getting back down make sure there's no other way for the ants to get up the tree such as a steak or branches that touch the ground because they will find it and use it as an alternate route the Vaseline should last several days and by then the ants that were trapped on the tree will die off and many of the pests now that the ants can't protect them should become food for predatory insects evening out the balance in nature once again without the use of harsh pesticides if there are a lot of ants trapped on the tree they might get desperate and create a forced bridge across the Vaseline so it's a good idea to get the numbers down and a great way to do this is by vacuuming or blowing them off it's important to point out that this vaso Trek is a temporary fix and if the predatory insects don't clean up the pests the ants will eventually be back and the pests will grow in numbers again but there are other organic measures you can use in conjunction with this vaso Trek to really close the deal and I'll be chatting more about these methods in my next video 10 organic ways to control pests in your garden so keep an eye out for that whoever said Vaseline was only good for sore holes and cracked lips was obviously not a gardener I hope you enjoyed this video if you did give it a big thumbs up and also share it around because that helps my channel out heaps thanks a lot for watching bye for now [Music] another winner for organic dad [Music] all these life is it getting close to Rodney [Music]", "15bb79yHujM": "hey Trevor here with Redleaf and today we're gonna be wrapping up the goodies that we brought home from BC this time around we've got some orange cookies from gage cannabis I'm really excited to tap into this we've got a Girl Scout cookies variant y'all you know that has me excited let's get on over into so that we can actually start smoking this bud let's get over there y'all so like I said before we did the intro we've got some orange cookies here from gage so this is a sativa dominant hybrid it came in at sixteen point eight percent THC with a cvd total of 0.14 percent it was packaged on the 10th of February 2020 so with a package date like that I am expecting the buds to be a little bit on the drier side but still hopeful that they're gonna be nice and potent I've got the lifting Co website ready with the information I'm gonna pull that up right now and we're gonna rattle that off for you guys before we get on over into the herbage scale and actually have some fun smoking and reviewing this bud you guys so orange cookies from gage cannabis Co from gage cannabis Co in Ontario orange cookies is a small batch sativa dominant strain with a very strong THC potency potential and a strong sour aroma the buds of this indoor hydroponically grown plant are bright green and there hanged ride and hand trimmed so we're gonna read off the four effects felled the activities used for the top method of consumption in the sense and all of this again is off that lifting Co website so the top four effects when smoking orange cookies are going to be happy creative energetic and focused the activities that are used for are typically socializing cleaning watching TV and to music the top method of consumption is via the joint and the sense are going to be citrus sweet and herbal so that wraps up all the information we have on the lifting Co website we're gonna close that sucker off and we're gonna get in on this bud on the herbage scale you guys I can't wait to tap into this I hope you guys can't wait either I'll see you guys over on the other side of this urban scale intro and we're gonna get into tapping into some of this delicious bud that I'm saying delicious but because I'm just hopeful that it's gonna be delicious you guys I'll see you on the other side and we're gonna get tapping into this bud [Music] okay guys so welcome back let's get this container open so we've got the first time I'm getting the opportunity to tries anything from gauge cannabis so I'm really looking forward to that because it's a new LP new strain lots of news and let's hope they do well you guys let's hope they set the bar high so we've got the container open I do get a she a start citrus smell holy [ __ ] okay straight up I have not had something this potent and direct in its smell since San Rafael's tangerine dream this that's the only other strain that I've had that has this intense and direct of a flavor like this orange cookies is orange that is 100% what I am smelling oh it's so sweet so potent oh you guys I am this is gonna do unreal today if it tastes like this take a look at that really nice strong crystal coating on there good pistol throughout give it a squeeze and it is a little drier but it's not like popcorn dry where you squeeze it and it just crumbles just because it is a little bit drier I'm gonna off one point and that's it just one point off of this I want to give it a 10 out of a 10 just because the smell but I can't do that with with how how much the buds are closer to that drier side than they are the fresher side and I just I like a little bit of a fresher a little bit of a stickier bud but holy crap you guys this smell is absolutely incredible 9 out of a 10-4 look an aroma I can't wait to start smoking this you guys I really can't let's just get on over into this review so we can actually start enjoying this bud Cheers okay guys so we got this orange cookies ground up in the big canister and surprisingly it actually fluffed up really well we've got a lot of Bud here for how dry it was I am quite surprised at how fluffed and how much actual volume there is to this strain I've got a lot of hope for it we're gonna pack up the bowls we're gonna pack up the pipe we're gonna pack up the vaporizer I'm gonna roll myself a quick joint and I'll see you guys when we get that vaporizer warmed up and ready to go because I am so excited to try this bud you guys I'll see you and we get all of that ready and we're actually tapping into it hey guys so I got this vaporizer packed up we're getting it turned on now there we go we're gonna start out at a 175 degree bake and then we're gonna bump it up to a 205 and after that we're gonna bump it up to 220 the reason we go through these three different temperatures specifically is because the 175 is gonna allow you hit a lot of the lemon and a lot of the lower boiling point terpenes that are gonna give you a really sweet and very light effect in when you're smoking it it's gonna be a lot more of the energetic clear-headed kind of a hive when you bump it up to the 205 you end up getting a lot more of the earthy muggy kind of moist tasting terpenes and you do end up getting a little bit more of that body high a little bit more of your fork type of high as well and it just gives you a little bit of a different terpene boiling point at that 220 you're gonna get the boiling points for all the terpenes before that any are going to end up burning some off but at the 220 you're gonna get maximum THC dump and definitely the those later boiling point terpenes it's heated up to 175 right now we're gonna try out for this first level of terpenes before we go on to the big dozy at the 205 and 220 started out here you guys and see how this orange cookie does through the vapor Cheers very potent orange flavor surprisingly potent orange flavor and it just continues to present that if this flavor is present all the way through this review you guys this but is going to do incredibly well very much enjoying this we're gonna bump it right up to the 205 because I get hints of that kind of Girl Scout cookies undertone because that that the orange cookies it's a orange juice and Girl Scout cookie cross I believe we have it set to the 205 so let's see if we get more like Girl Scout cookies or more the orange flavor cheers you guys definitely still get that orange but you do get more of that earthy woody kind of Girl Scout cookies flavor that I'm really enjoying still it's nice light not overwhelming really mild and a perfect blend of the two flavors I'm finding the orange could be a little bit stronger but that's just me being picky I think we've got it set to the 220 right here we're gonna see what it's like at this temperature and I'm excited you guys I'm enjoying this so far now it's circling on to kind of like a lemon wood type of flavor not really orange it's got less of the body because like I find orange has more of a bodied flavor where lemons kind of hit and move hit move like you get the really tart flavor and that tampers off really quickly but the lemon dropped candies and stuff like that that hold the flavor that's where I really like the the lemon flavor where it lasts and holds this it kind of pops you with that and then weaves over into kind of a woody flavor that I'm enjoying quite a bit too it's got a little bit of a pepper to watch I don't mind at all it's definitely not my favorite but it's not not bad in any means I think I'm gonna give the vape an 8 out of a 10 just because that 220 is enjoyable but I wish that flavor had more pop or over that lemon pop to it it doesn't need much just a little bit more with a little bit more of a residual flavor afterwards and I think could get that 9 for it to get a 10 though it would need to be screaming that orange all the way through you guys after I tasted it the first temperature I would need to taste that all the way through or have three completely unique and thoroughly enjoyable flavors that all kind of match and pair up well together but that's gonna wrap up the vaporizer with the 8 out of a 10 I'm really excited to see how this is going to do through the glassware through the bongs and the pipe that finally through the join but we're gonna start out with my favorite part of the reviews we're gonna tap through the bongs quickly before we head on deeper into the review with the pipe the joint the high in the overall you guys but pop this out write down our scores and continue on with the review I'll see you guys with me starting to smoke out of the glassware Cheers okay guys so for those of you who have been through these reviews before you know how we're gonna do this we're gonna light it up 3 different ways to 3 different bongs for those of you who are new let's explain how those three different ways in three different bonds are going to work so we're gonna start out with this cheat rig here we've got the hemp wick that I like to use to the smallest rig it gives us a lower burning point gives us a little bit of a different starting flavor and a flavor throughout I personally find smallest rig definitely pairs up the best with the hemp wick the next rig we go with a straight clipper lighter and it's usually a simple beaker bong mid-range size so we can have a little bit more of the flower and see how it does through there finally we've got these MK jet lighters here or the davon Ric mini torch and we hit up the bigger bowl with the bigger rigs so all three rigs provide a little bit of a different flavor every time and the way you light them also provides a little bit of a different flavor every time so since we have that broken down for you guys we're gonna start out with a small cheat rig and the hemp wick clip through the nice glass jet through the Kush I will be back after all three of these ribs for us to go over the total score for the bong before we tap into the pipe to join to the high end the overall you guys so let's get this clipper to lighter to light up the hemp prick there we go got that lit up give it a little extra flame today because why not dangerous with it smoke this bowl have some fun and keep rockin this review guess you will be back on the other side of the street rig tambien [Music] that's a great the lighter [Music] [Music] [Music] many tarts try that [Music] okay yes so I'm gonna end up giving this an eight out of its head for the taste from a bong then honestly I mean until I tell you this right off the beginning it is due to the BOD being a little bit too dry through all three rigs I got that hint of orange right at the beginning and then it went into more that cushy Girl Scout cookie crossed flavor that I do enjoy but when you get that hint of the orange at the beginning it is tar it is really really hard to not want that to continue through and have a mellow transition over into that girl scout cookies cushy that heavier tasting earthy or tasting flavor that I do really enjoy and I do really love from the Girl Scout cookie strains that I smoked before at the same time I like it to have that sweeter flavor at the beginning because I really do like that that solid hit of orange or citrus or whatever the sweet flavor is and then the transition into the heavier Hardy or flavors afterwards like that's that's why I like the strains that I do I find like the bubble cush you get that bubble gum kind of heavy push to begin with and then you get that cushy flavor afterwards that's why I love the strains that's like that so much and so lunch cookies I think if I rehydrated the buds a little bit there would be some massive potential for that orange flavor really blow up but orange cookies is definitely a strain I'm gonna have to keep on the list for smoking through a rig because it is unreal how tasty it is you guys absolutely and like just delicious however we've got the Colorado spoon pipe here we're gonna light this up and while I'm smoking on this I'll be let you know how it did I'm curious to see see how it's gonna do through this pipe you guys I'll see you when when I'm done smoking this Cheers hey guys I'm gonna give this a 9 out of a 10 for the taste from a pipe and it's really on its own level it doesn't have that sweet orange flavor it is definitely more of like a smoked rich homie earthy kind of orange flavor that blends really well with a more rich and almost chocolaty kind of flavor from the Girl Scout cookies that I wasn't expecting at all but really enjoyed when I found it I am blown away with the taste from a pipe the only thing that's missing there is for that orange chocolate to blend together more then kind of battle each other for top flavor and it's if it if it blended together you guys I would be a hell of a strain so good you guys Bob today as I normally do I rolled up with the Bob's blue these rice papers I love smoking these we've got the joint right here we're going to take a couple dry hauls off of it see what it tastes like through there then we're gonna light it up smoke my way through a little bit of it and I'll let you guys know how it does but let's take these dry taste and see how it see what kind of Terps we can expect oh it's almost like a lemonade honestly that's what I'm tasting right here is like an orange or a grapefruit or like a like a extra citrusy lemonade definitely more orange than anything else but I don't want to wait any longer you guys I I'm gonna tap into this but this is unreal let's uh try it out Cheers hey guys so I let you take a look it's actually burning a really nice solid white ash and the flavor I'm getting through here is ridiculously consistent and really really enjoyable I am quite tempted to give this a 10 but I don't think I will first draw scream 10 hesitate a couple minutes mmm settles you into about a nine but it is [ __ ] damn close to getting a ten you guys it really does push through a sweet citrus flavor definitely more orange than anything else but citrus in the sense of like Sunny D is orange based for the juice but there's other citrus fruit in there so when I'm saying citrus base for this think like that Sunny D kind of citrus cuz that's very much the flavor I'm getting through here is that Sunny D type of flavor there's like oh this is oh there's a hint of lemon ooh there's a hint of this ooh there's a hint of that but it's orange juice right it's what I'm experiencing here but when you hesitate that like and if it tasted like that strictly that room would remind me very much that orange creamsicle strain that I had down in Seattle two years ago and favorite strain by far still favorites today by far um that's what it tastes like that's why this one gets me so excited through the joint it mild off into a more cushy but not strong cushy tone taste and it it's disappointing because if you're gonna go to that type of flavor I want it to be a strong potent flavor not have the orange at the beginning be the most potent of flavors really enjoyable though you guys really really enjoyable I am definitely looking forward to smoking the rest of this but I'll be back in a second I'm gonna smoke a little more this sit down figure out the high that I'm feeling and come back and let you guys know about it hey guys so I'm gonna give this a 9 out of 10 for its high and I'm gonna tell you right now the mixture of the body relaxation and the mental stimulation is the reason why it's getting the nine because it's not a happy mixture I'm finding it's a fighting mixture of who's going to get control what's going to be smoked next to give it control am I gonna encourage the sativa side or am I gonna encourage the indica side because it comes along with a very nice and strong mental uplift like very encouraging to want to go out and enjoy doing something no matter the intensity it's just enjoying doing enjoying doing something but at the same time the body relaxation where it's like having it comfortable like Girl Scout cookies kind of comfy feeling I get that too and the Battle of that for her for the high I don't enjoy very much it when there that happens I tend to get lean more towards a headache because I'm like [ __ ] do I want to just lie here and do nothing and play video games or do I want to get up and go do something I hate that yeah I Drive like if I was going to okay we're gonna go to the mall walk for a bit and then go to a movie if when we're in the city this would be a good stream because you can go enjoy like really enjoy the mental and then when it's starting to burn out you can let that body high take over and just sit back and enjoy some popcorn and a drink in a movie definitely more that purposed so a nine out of ten with that which is it bad I just wish those two would be more cooperative where it's like okay you decide still but it's not a fight it's more of a okay we can swing either way so but all in all really good you guys really really enjoyable so that suckers done we're gonna pack ourselves up one more ball and talk about the overall cuz this but did incredibly well you guys we're gonna use the nice glass beaker bong I think this time and this bud ended up getting a unreal disgustingly high 52 out of 60 I was not surprised at how well this but did when I add it all up I was surprised at the diketon um the actual score but I wasn't surprised that it did this well that's a better way to say it it really does hit kind of all my all the things I like in there for flavor because it's got a really nice citrus flavor and then it goes into the more Girl Scout cookies cushy flavors that I like in my indicas and the mixture of the two did really well through the majority of the flavor the tastes actually and I'm I'm quite surprised because usually it doesn't usually it ends up being a little bit rough on one of the two flavors and then it ends up just kind of taking the fun out of it for me and this bud didn't do that at all it actually was really enjoyable all the way through smokey and I'm really excited really excited to smoke this bowl and the next couple today and any other ones that I have in there but I definitely think that I'm gonna need to rehydrate the bud and give it a little bit of a better chance just since it was a package date in February and this is the one hitter read review we're hitting it the first time as soon as we crack the container we're tapping into it you guys and that's that's how I like doing these reviews so you guys get

I will back later with some more combat [Music]", "cITuKremX9A": "Back in the 1990s, two workers were discovered\nlying comatose at the bottom of an empty pool. They were rushed to the hospital and later\nmade a full recovery, but they couldn\u2019t remember anything about how they\u2019d gotten\nthere or what they were doing. For awhile, they couldn\u2019t even talk. Investigators later figured out that the fumes\nfrom the glue they\u2019d been using to stick tiles to the floor of the pool had built up\nin the bottom of the hole. Essentially, the two workers had been unknowingly\nsniffing glue for a while. You\u2019ve probably seen warning labels on things\nlike glue and paint about this: deliberately inhaling the fumes \u2014 aka inhalant abuse\n\u2014 can be harmful or fatal. The warnings are there because it\u2019s dangerous\nand there are people who do it on purpose. But it\u2019s a really, really stupid way to\ntry to get high. Inhalants can make people feel good for a\nshort period of time. But they can also cause choking, asphyxiation,\nseizures, comas \u2026 and death. The culprit here is usually a compound called\ntoluene. It\u2019s a hydrocarbon, meaning that it\u2019s\nmade up of carbons and hydrogens, and it\u2019s used in things like glue as a solvent. In the short term, toluene has a direct effect\non the central nervous system. At first, inhaling it can cause a sense of\neuphoria as the toluene boosts the production of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that\u2019s involved\nin pleasure and reward. But it can also cause agitation, belligerence,\napathy, vomiting, and other symptoms that are not as much fun. And it can be addictive. A high enough dose can lead to more severe\nsymptoms like seizures or death. But even at lower doses, toluene can lead\nto some serious health problems, because it causes the sort of damage that stacks over\ntime. I may have previously mentioned that inhalant\nabuse is a really bad idea. It may be worth mentioning again here. Among other things, chronic inhalant abuse\ncan damage the sheath that protects nerves. Which as you can probably imagine, is really\nnot great for the brain or the rest of the body. It can lead to all kinds of cognitive problems,\nand even dementia. That\u2019s on top of the heart, lung, liver,\nand kidney damage that can also come from chronic inhalant abuse. So glue sniffing is addictive and causes all\nkinds of organ damage and sometimes death. Like I keep saying: It\u2019s dumb. It\u2019s a real dumb way to get high. That\u2019s why they have the warning labels. Thanks for asking, and thanks especially to\nall of our patrons on Patreon who keep these answers coming.

today I want to share with you some of the ways I use oranges or more specifically orange peel there's so many benefits of it and I don't like throwing a nap because she's got so many awesome uses so firstly one of the things that I like to do is peel the outside of orange peel just this part and then dry it so you can just leave it in a warm area for a little while until it's kind of dried up and then I use it as tea so I can just store in a small container and use it with everyone because it's dried so it will last and I can just put it in with Harrell teas to make it a bit more citrusy or just have it on its own to have a nice citrus tea and get some of those nutritional benefits from it as well the second awesome way to use it like that as well is to peel it and dry the pure Lagoon and then to use the peels as a deodorizer for your drawers or for any other thing like your shoes or something so you can just use some of the dried peels and put them into a small mesh bag and then put them into your drawers in between your clothing and you'll get a nice citrusy orange smell to your clothes or you can put them into your shoes once you're taking them off and leave me overnight like there and you have a nice citrusy smell in your shoes that will take away some of their odor the next way I love to use it as in body scrubs because it is really good for your skin and all you need to do is take some of the zest of the outside so I have done a video on this previously where I made a tangerine body scrub I think y'all link somewhere around here and but all you need for there is some coconut oil which just want to soften in the end that a little bit of coarse sugar and a little bit of orange zest and then you have a really nice such your scented body scrub the next way to use it is to take the inside of the peel and use it for teeth whitening and this one is a bit touch-and-go because there's some evidence that suggests that it has properties that should whiten your teeth and then there's other studies say that probably will have a little effect the thing that you do want to be careful with is not getting the orange juice onto the peel because it can have acidic effects so just use the orange peel on its own without you need the juice on it and you can try that and see what a fix it has for you the first way I like to use it is as an insect repellent so you can just take piece of the peel and rub it over your body and this will just help to repel insects like mosquitoes and things if you're going camping or some around the bush where there's lots of mosquitoes this is a great thing to be able to do especially if you have oranges on you and you don't have any insect repellent that's a great little kind of life hack the next way it can be used as a sponge and it's because of the oils and acids and things in this that help to take away aggressiveness and marks and stains so you can rub it over different areas whether it's the bench top or over your sink or taps or anything like that just to take away any greasy marks and then the same vein is that you can take the peel and put it into some white vinegar for instance and leave it there for a couple of weeks and all the properties of the peel will kind of seep into the vinegar and turn it into a great citrus scrub or cleaning agent for your different surfaces you can use clean the shower and things like that and you'll have the properties of the citrus in there that will help with the cleaning so another way you can use this is for its nutritional benefits there are so many nutrients in here and it's a great thing to not have to throw out and you can add a candy the peels which a lot of people do but I personally don't like adding extra sugar into my diet where I don't need to but the thing I do love to use it for is assisting it so you can zest it and add it to your breakfasts or your salads or anything like that and just get the zest of the peel into your diet in all sorts of different ways so another awesome trick to use for orange peels as to use as a candle so for that all you need is sharp knife and go around the orange just cutting through the rind all the way around and then slip your thumb into it and go around with your thumb and you can just kind of plaque the bottom of the orange off and out should pop the middle part of the orange the stem I guess and it will be attached to the bottom of the orange and you have your candle base so you just need to put about a tablespoon of oil you could use canola olive or something like that pull the oil in there and then just leave it to sit for a couple of minutes before lighting it and light it with a lighter because if you let it with met just like either you kind of need a couple of matches because it does take a good 30 seconds to light and once it's lit it will last for a couple of hours and the great thing about it is that they float on water so you can have them in the bath with you or something like that they're gorgeous that smells citrusy and they're so easy to do so the next one I guess is the long get vein and it's just to use the peel as a bath scent so you can do this just by cutting little pieces of the peel and putting them in the bath with you and you could always dry them first and store them and you contain annexed to the bath so that they kind of like a bath salt or something that you end with your other things into the bath and they smell so nice and they have all the nice oils and things that they're releasing into the water with you so they help to have good effects on your skin and stuff as well and then the last thing I love to do with orange peel is to use it in my pot pourri so there's basically dried flowers and things that have a nice smell so it just takes them a bit dried orange peel and put it in with some dried flowers like rose petals and things that have this smell still in them and then put it into a bowl in your room or anywhere in the house that you want to smell nice and fragrant and this is awesome because it lasts indefinitely because those things are already preserved by being dried and they smell delicious and it's so simple it also makes cute gifts if you kind of put a ribbon around them and do them up nicely so I hope you guys found these tips useful I absolutely love orange peel it's an awesome thing to be able to use and not have to go to waste anything that you can do to reduce wastage as a simples and things you have to do so if you guys want to see any of my social media or any more details that be in the description box below and I hope you guys enjoyed this and I hope you guys have a wonderful day you", "NM480-f5L1Y": "what's up y'all this your boy Sheldon with another 5s episode of waiting baking

much all I hear is his people across the floor like you guys ever heard of elephant wall it sounds like he's got moccasins on it's weird man sounds like he's rubbing weather across the concrete oh that was so weak and we're gonna scale it down for a flavor review this is a really dense hard knock it's really hard to break I mean I'm actually squeezing my nail into it is it's not even breaking this stuff was really sticky the consistency of this reminds me of glue if you've ever looked at the consistency of weed when you break it down the texture of it this looks just like the texture of gorilla glue all right got a fat butt in there I think we're gonna get away from the UH from the hemp wait for a little bit cuz that fan is messing me up we're gonna get the straight light sorry y'all

critique of yourself the flavor is excellent yes he's got me all the flavor is actually God I would have to give this a nine for flavor just out off the rim just a nun by the way I believe this is dispensary great so we're giving this a mid nine it's really flavorful I could really taste it glue I could really taste the cookies like already told you guys I'm not a real big fan of cookies I'm

YouTube today I'm gonna be testing out ways to make slime out of water and without any glue and all the ingredients can be found in your house this occasion squad shot it's today go to zoo got anime the nonsense channel ache a wolf and mabini Martin if you would like a shout out on one of my videos all you have to do is turn on the notification bellow and subscribe and watch this whole video start to finish and you'll get one in my next video also if you'd like to be entered in my current iPhone X giveaway all you have to do is watch this whole video without skipping and be subscribed and I will enter you to have a really good chance of wouldn't one of these iPhone X's the first recipe I'm gonna be testing today is making me slime out of ice so basically to make this line matter I suppose something you're just supposed to add like a cup or container of ice some dish soap and what you have to do is just add these ashok on top of the ID dish soap is supposed to kind of freeze but that didn't happen for mine and then the next up to this was adding in some minty mouthwash ooh I used this Listerine one I never have been successful on making mouthwash lime so I was kind of skeptical of this working but I added in the Listerine anyways and I let it sit for a little bit hoping it would kind of freeze and I stirred it and nothing happened and I even mixed it for a long time hoping the ice but I guess I transfer its coldness into the dish soap but it was completely a forest I do not try this recipe it did not work this next recipe I'm so proud to show you guys I completely made this recipe up by myself for this recipe you're gonna be needing some water tape paper and a pencil with an eraser starting off you want to take a piece of your tape and make it into kind of like a half loop does that make sense and then you want to stick it to your piece of paper and you need the sticky side of the tape to face up this might be kind of confusing but what you want to do is take your eraser and rub it on to the sticky part of the tape like you are erasing something and pencil and keep doing that until you see the shreds of the eraser sticking to the I guess like sticky part of the tape and it's sure to create kind of like a slime as you guys can see I went through the whole entire eraser by the way you guys this does take a while but after a while it will kind of all Club together and make this kind of like Cley texture then you want to dunk it in the water and let it sit for a little bit and it shouldn't make kind of like a butter slime this recipe is so strange but it works so well and I'm super impressed by it for this next recipe yeah I'm going to be testing out a clear jiggly soap slime recipe first ingredient you need for this is some shower jelly I use this one I thought about the body works for Christmas the recipe then showed them adding in some gel hand wash so I added in some of this one that is for method the last ingredient you need before activation is some more jello body wash I used this Irish Spring one because it was the exact one they used in the video and I added in a little bit I was eyeballing everything because there was no exact measurements in the video then I just went in and mixed all these soaps together and it made this nice and neon green color which I was super pleased with and then you need to add in a lot of water to make it jiggly so I just used this Evian water as the water because I had opened it earlier for the video I've mixed that up and I'm gonna add in a little bit more water because that's what the recipe says to do again you guys I'm not sure if I'm doing this right because there is no measurement but I'm gonna add in a little bit more water because it says to do three increments and we'll mix it all up hoping for this to be super clear but the air bubbles aren't popping so I guess we're just gonna have to deal with it but the last of its activating so let's get our activators to activate the slime you are going to be needing a little bit of baking soda so I'm going to just put it my hands and then mix it all in so I don't add it in too much the recipe also calls for a sprinkle of salt so I'm gonna add a few dashes of salt in and then I'm gonna mix it all up really well and that should actually everything off its kind of keep driving a little bit less sticky and it feels a little less like so going super so on top of this this is what the slime look like after it cleared up it actually took two and a half days to clear up so it kind of took a while but not that bad considering how much slime it was the slimes are to get stickier and it did start to Rick a little bit but this recipe turned out really well so I would totally recommend it to you guys if you want to make some slime without any glue now I'm gonna be testing out hair gel water slime so for this you need so it's max hold hair yellow so I found this avocado one and then you want to add some to your bowl after you have a good amount of hair gel it in your bowl all you have to do is freeze it for ten minutes in the freezer and it is supposed to thicken up a little bit but there's still more steps left to it so this is what it looked like after it froze it didn't thicken up very much but I decided to keep following the tutorial so basically what they did a nice was adding in some water and then they mixed it up and this is only you could kind of see it thicken it up which was kind of strange but I did mix it up and I could kind of feel the texture by giving me back up to its original consistency which was kind of strange it was almost like the hair gel absorbs the water in so then after that you have to add in a facial cleansing wash so I add in this one end that I just got Target and I mixed all that together and some reason it just turn super watery and did not turn into slime so this recipe was sadly a fail a recipe I've been seeing floating around YouTube for a long time was Vaseline slime and I got Vaseline for this recipe and some reason I couldn't find it but I found it in a drawer so I'm gonna be cutting this out right now so basically you need some Vaseline and some water and then you want to mix those two together and it's supposed to make slime but when I mix it together and nothing really happens so this recipe was sadly a fail okay so the last recipe I'm gonna be testing is making thick slime without glue so for this your glue eating some corn stalks of corn starch to your bowl and then you want to add some foaming head wash I have this method one and after you do that you want to mix it all up really well and if the texture is still dry just add in a few more pumps of the foaming hand wash and again mix it super super well until there is no of course search and you're going to be needing a regular hand wash so basically one that is not foaming and you want to add an even amount so basically even amounts of the clear hand wash to even amount of the cornstarch mixture then you need to microwave that mixture for 45 seconds and stir it up super well now you have to activate it and for this you are going to be needing some alum basically you want the alum to dry in a little bit and then you want to mix everything in alum can be used as a drying agent so I think that is why this kind of clumps up but after mixing it for a long time I thought I wasn't gonna be working but then it kind of finally clumped up a little bit and made a super sticky soapy slide but I would still say it was", "nlxcHr3WWy4": "South Africa

because of that contest now i need to be there contest is just a week ago and i need to stay i'm tired i am tired i don't know what's wrong with me maybe i'm cost or something i don't see that i can't see that oh i'm caused i am really close because i don't know what is wrong with me how do i go to the contest with this leg and when the leg is looking like this what's wrong with you what nonsense are you talking about hey it's a life not more important than contest what is the context all about instead of me to concentrate on how you will get well and get out of this hospital you are here talking about context is that context more important than your life eh thank you thank you you need to get well really you don't understand though [Music] so far with italian hunting why are you not going for this and i want to bend on helping this girl in all honesty she came to me asking for help and this girl has been through so much and that was the only little way i could help out now what the what tells you is good question i want you to go for the contest and i'm sure you'll agree to me and when you win you can finally help her since you've decided to be mother teresa you'll be fine soon okay thank you yes hello nos hello miguel hello okay so uh how's the leg today the leg still like a donkey that refuses to move even after being offered a bunch of carrots [Music] that's really poetic are you a poet i don't know maybe i am like they say pain do give back to miracles so maybe maya has gone into labor that sounds like pain is your close companion it's my close companion does actually make my head it's home okay i don't know what you're talking about but if it's about this infected lead trust me this would go in in no time doctor this infected leg is a threat when i mean it's a huge threat to my youngest brother's life my family's peace of mind is a threat even to my dreams and that which i hope to become in the future it's a threat a huge one is it really that bad it's bad my younger brother he has sickle cell anemia and the doctor said huge money is required for his surgery people said he has to undergo what did they even call it bone marrow transplant where do i get that kind of money from and the only means of getting it was actually participating in a talent horn i wanted to go for the beauty you know beauty pageant category and now i can't go because of the leg still it's an obstacle [Music] first of all i'm very sorry about your brother's health and i'm sympathetic towards your family's plight but but correct me if i'm wrong you said talent haunt yes okay you do realize that this talent haunts attracts lots of people a whole lot of people yes okay so what is the guarantee that if you participate in this talent hold that you're going to win and get the money and take care of your brother and give me the medical care that he needs and remove your heart from the situation that they are in what guarantees you that and you will win that's true there's no guarantee but i just i have this this strong conviction that if i go for it i just i have a feeling i have it deep down that if i go for it i may just i may just be lucky besides there's no harm in trying now i want to go for it i really really need to go for this i need it so it's kind of like no venture no success yeah like that no venture no success oh i don't see that happening anyway because the doctor said even if i undergo the surgery it will take like two weeks to heal and i don't have that time i don't have two weeks hello hey bro yes please uh do you have a minute to talk exactly [Music] i need a favor from you [Music] [Music] don't worry everything will be fine thank you so much i really appreciate it man thank you that was surprised thank you so much don't worry

channel today we're going to be doing this beautiful orange color of some curly hair I've been receiving so much curly hair lately and I was like I gotta do something different with my curly hair I will I refuse I refuse to come on my youtube channel with another black curly wig so I decided to go ahead and be a little daring and I dyed my hair orange basically like a copper kind of color I thought this would be perfect for this time of year for this you know autumn winter season I mean obviously it's winter now but I thought this will be perfect to do and I'm also going to be doing the hot water method so if any of you guys were wondering whether or not you guys can you do the hot water method on dark hair you definitely can cuz I did that today and it's so super easy and quick to do so yeah this hair is this video is sponsored by Lu hair thank you guys so much for sending over this wig this is a 20 inch 13 by 6 legs front wig that they pre constructed for me I will show you guys in the video with the wig look like prior to me doing all of this chewing and you guys can get my thoughts in this wig and you guys can get my honest opinion on the hair and this wig I'm gonna tell you right now I absolutely love it I love my hair I love the color that I was able to achieve I think it looks really good on my skin tone and this is gonna be pretty - once I like straighten it out you know later cuz I definitely feel like I want to straighten it out after a while and maybe do like a cute little bob or something with it like a copper Bob cuz I've really been wanting to try this color for the longest so it's finally here so without further ado you guys let's go ahead and get into this hair tutorial [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay guys so this is the finished look this is what I was able to achieve with you know this hair one thing that I am gonna do just because I did bleached your hair and of course you know your bleaching your hair you're ripping out all of the natural moisture is in here so I'm gonna be using this it's a 10 leave-in conditioner spray and this is usually for you know like when you blow-dry your hair or whatever but since my hair is semi damp over here I'm gonna put a little bit over here this I really isn't def any more but this really helps bring in bring that moisture back in my hair that we lose from bleaching your hair so that way we don't have any dry brittle hair you don't want your hair to be brittle at all cuz when it dries and it's curly it just looks like a frazzled frizzled mess so just gonna kind of scrunch that into my hair right quick I really really like this color I'm glad that I chose the color that I did cuz they came out so perfect this is exactly what I was trying to achieve so I'm happy that I was able to achieve it so of course in the video as you guys saw I use 30 volume developer typically when I want to get like a really bold or bright color hour out for a 40 volume the only thing about 40 volume is that you really strip the hair and because this was curly hair I didn't want to use something so strong and end up like really losing the curl pattern what I will say is that there is still a curl in here even after being bleached and dyed with a hot water method as you guys saw so if you guys were wondering also whether or not you guys can color your hair with the hot water method when you have dark bundles you can totally do it you can totally do it it's very easy it's the same process and it's able to evenly distribute that color so I'm really happy about that I also like that because this is a premade wig the the color the bleach is pretty much the same throughout the only thing is obviously you know like when it's wet it looks a little bit darker the ends aren't as bright as the roots are but I don't mind that because it kind of gives it like a little bit of dimension kind of like an ombre type of thing so it's not inside too bold or anything like that I'm really happy with the results that I achieved so I use the orange blaze dye by a door and I use two bottles of that what I would suggest any time you're going to be doing the hot water method and you have a wig whether it's a make that you make or a wig that you buy always use two bottles because it really helps like distribute the color well and it's more vibrate if used one bottle more than like they're gonna have to do the whole process all over again so just use two bottles and you're gonna get this kind of look the hair it's tough I really do like this hair I mean the fact that it was able to take bleach like that and still have a curl pattern and still be very beautiful is amazing I'm absolutely loving this color on my skin tone - I think this is like the perfect copper Orange for darker skin tones I know a camera I look a little bit lighter because I'm like right by the umbrella light but I am you know a dark-skinned one but if I back up a little more you guys can see like more of our color this is a lace front wig that is a 13 by 6 left front wig so if I wanted to I could put like a really neat part in this wig and that's like 13 by six like lace fronts are my personal favorites just because you can obviously do a lot more with him rather than having like the typical 13 by 4 and the only thing that I would say about this week is I just wish it was just a little bit more fuller I just would you know I wish I would have opted for like maybe a higher density maybe like a 180 percent didn't see or maybe like a 200% density but I really like the construction of this wig as well the hair was shipped to me via DHL of course like all of the companies I received it within 3 business days very fast and I am in love with the company's packaging and all of the extras that they like the extra free goodies that you get with your order you can tell that this company puts a lot of thought and care into their customers and things that they would need this is the first time I've ever received a headband from a company and I want to use this like so many times it's gonna be perfect especially for people you know when you want to do your baby hairs or whatever I'm going to show you this is the box I got a little bit of bleach on here so I'm sorry about that but it does have like a clock a crocodile detailed to the box you can't really tell that much but you can kind of see it yeah it's like a crocodile detail to the box and then it has their logo here Liu hair and then of course like I showed you guys earlier you get a free wig cap which I did use one of them today so that was very helpful they also gave me a free comb which I showed you guys that I use I actually put my comb away because I like to clean up as I go when I do my video so I don't have like a big mess so this is a headband that I was talking about though and it's delving on the outside and this is so perfect like so perfect so it's build on the outside and then the inside is like super soft but this this thing is so freaking something so basically what you would do with this is like when you do a baby harriel edges or whatever you would wrap this around and then it has like in the velcro here little situation so and it's really stretchy as well so it'll it's like a one size fits all it'll fit just about everyone not just about literally everyone's head size so you would put it over like if you were doing it baby hairs and then have this and then wrap it around like that I mean obviously this is not the right way to do it because I have my hair down but you would like to put this underneath so you guys definitely will see this in future videos I definitely plan on using this this is perfect for your legs front wigs so thank you guys for sending this over to me because I love it and it's so freakin soft like I wish you guys can feel how soft this is so I really like this because you don't have to worry about it snagging your hair you can even use this on your natural hair as well so that's always a plus they also gave me some elastic so you get some elastic with your wig just in case you need to tighten your wig or anything like that and they give you an extra comb so if you guys need to sew in some combs you guys know me personally I don't really like combs but they do give you a nice piece of elastic so you guys can put this on your wig as well so all in all I really do like this company they put a lot of thought into their customer and the way they package their items how they shipped it my box didn't come damaged or anything like that as you guys know this is just for me bleaching my hair earlier I end up getting bleach on the box but all I got really like a little hair you guys should definitely check them out they have some really gorgeous hair and the fact that my hair still is curly even though I just bleached the heck out of this hair it's just like amazing to me love this color once again I use two bottles of ador orange blaze and this is the color that I got using 30 volume developer and BW 2 white bleach so if you guys liked this video definitely give this video a thumbs up leave your comments down below I would love to know your thoughts on this hair and the color that I achieved and I'll see you guys in my next one bye", "87z0KJN07sw": "[Music] hey guys imagine a super creature that has 25,000 teeth which nose is inside out and that has a belly instead of feet what do you think it is oh it's just a snail see they're neat [Music] this beauty is called a Katina reticulata albino body or a giant African snail it can do some really incredible things for instance they say snails can overcome any obstacles let's see if that's true we'll take a hairbrush this thin bristles and offer our snail to Hitler look how easy and graceful it moves it's really amazing but the bristles are really sharp yes but snails produce a slime substance that helps them move and also protects their soft belly that's called a foot [Music] forwarding you said we have more in common than I thought it kind of looks like that time though these snails are very funny and quiet that's why some people keep them as pets snail lovers even invented a new sport snail racing really I wouldn't bet much on this runner snails can carry a weight that is 10 times or more than its own not impressed well just imagine yourself lifting up a small horse and then imagine running we should see if it can lift up one stool in slime what was it about its nose being inside out unlike humans the snails organ that's responsible for their sense of smell is located outside of its body on the lower tentacle that's also where its sense of touches technically on its upper tentacles they can sense light but besides that they're almost completely blind snail they also have no ears which makes them deaf they rely on their sense of smell and touch to get around [Music] nice did you like this video about snails then give this episode a thumbs up if you want to learn more about other live creatures and where they live comment below and subscribe to our Channel see you soon [Music] hold on if you want to get to know me a little bit better comment below and they'll tell you even more funny stories of my life while you're doing that we'll show you another pillow hi guys look what we have here we've decided to get ourselves new pets little ants this time ants our incredible creatures so interesting to watch them we've purchased a whole house for them an ant farm but we need to assemble it first no Sam ants are studied by MERM ecologist sand will just be keeping the ants at home let's see what's inside here are all the parts I think I need to remove this protective layer cool give a thumbs up if you like removing protective layers from devices right like this till the last strip all the parts are clean and here we have paths for our ants we need to assemble them in a certain order here's they're running ground next we'll need this blue sponge let's soak it in warm water squeeze the water out and place it into this cavity the sponge will create humidity without which the ants will die let's pool the sponge through this opening now we'll take these five plastic frames and put them together neatly and secure them with screws and another one now let's insert the screws into the openings like this [Music] we need to insert screws into each empty opening and now let's connect the sidewall this will be the entrance for the ants now we'll screw everything in place but not too tight or the plastic will crack done let's set this aside we'll take the base and attach transparent walls to it and the right wall let's take the third wall and attach it carefully and now comes an exciting moment you're connecting the rooms to the house I feel like an ant builder to make the walls hold we'll fix them with rubber bands I love this it's so relaxing guys and on the other side we're done with the wall now let's secure the bottom [Music] the walls are secured so now it's time for the roof tada the roof shouldn't have any holes to fix that we'll use these two parts that will make the cover and this net no Sammy this won't let the ants escape I've inserted the Nets between two parts now let's secure them with the screws [Music] and on the other side let's cover our roof and plug the back door to make sure the ants stay inside we'll have the front door on the other side where our friends will enter the house here we have a tube that we need to fill with water [Music] and here's a sponge plug let's insert it into a special opening the moisture will gradually fill all the rooms of the forma karyam the house is moisturized now we only need to add these steps at the entrance a kind of a porch here are our residents let's take the cotton ball out here we have a special tunnel which will insert quickly and insert the other end into the house here comes the second one we really hope our ants will be comfortable in this house our ants are called cat a glyphis innocent runner ants which live mostly in grasslands but also in semi desert sand desert actually there are so many ants on earth that currently there are 1 million ants per human being the common worker ant lives from 90 days to 3 years and the ant Queen can reign for up to 30 years ants can carry weights 5000 times heavier than their own weight can you imagine that our ants are called runners because they are incredibly fast they run faster than any other species of ant because they can lift their abdomen in a special way and don't have here with their knees and eat they sense vibrations from their surroundings oh honey no wonder ants are a symbol of hard work get inspired while looking at them Sammy I'm already so inspired and I'm ready to do something you finally like what oh no Sammy I'll give you another task if you're feeling so inspired because we'll ask our viewers to

thinking of a new video for you subscribe to our Channel and don't forget to hit the bell button thanks [Music]", "l0o6Zg7FvIU": "hey guys it's me JC giy and welcome back to that P side of YouTube I'm really happy I got to hang out with you guys today so you should definitely hang out with me totally very under this video I want to see if you guys can watch this whole video you could do that that'd be super cool of you and if you end up enjoying this video after watching this whole video you should definitely give it a thumbs up and subscribe and I will get a hang out with you again I put on the screen some of the newest notification squad members and if we would like to join all I have to do is watch the video start to finish without skipping and give this video a thumbs up subscribe and comment down below and if I see that you've done all those I will give you a shout up to super colorful flow beads that my friend Kalia gave me so thank you Kalia for sending these to me and for right now we're going to set this aside and we're gonna work on making the base of this line so you don't need much this is really tiny Bowl to make it and for the base you're gonna be needing some shampoo so I just got this really tiny I'll show you and we're going to add them into the bowl you don't need it that much I'm just going to add in the smallest bit I think that's probably good actually there we go we've really activator you're going to be a little bit salt so I have some sea salt right here and I'm just going to add in that much and we're going to go put this in the refrigerator and I'll come bring it back once it has been 2 hours and it has thickened up so this is what it looks like now it looks I guess pretty much the same except it's a little bit thicker and pretty cold for being in the refrigerator for a while but now we're going to take our flow beads and add this in so this is what our flung turn out like it does feel a little bit sticky so I'm going to mix it up a little bit and we will see how the end result so the next recipe we're going to be testing is actually a dish of slime recipe so let's test it I got this green tissue at the so I'm pretty sure that does that turn this down a target and it was this method and dish soap and if I can find a picture of this this will be do so in a thumbnail so I'm gonna start off by adding in a little bit of the dish oh and for this recipe it was super simple all you need to do is put your dish soap in your bowl and also add some dry shampoo so I also pick this up from Target I never know what dry shampoo does and it's sad if you spray it on here and let it sit for a while make sure turn into slime in the dry shampoo should be it like the activator so let's try this out whoa okay so I have let it sit for awhile because that last recipe was a fail I have a one ingredient shampoo salon recipe that we can test out so for this one we're going to need to add some shampoo conditioner into your bowl pop in the refrigerator for two hours and it should come out kind of like slime and I ended up leaving this in probably for about three hours because after two hours it didn't really do anything so I left and for a little while and I made this texture it was super clear but I had to mix it up so that it would kind of combine and not be as sticky and once I mixed it up there was a lot of air bubbles but it was a really nice texture body wash and this is the acai berry pomegranate one so we are going to try to make a big batch of this I have a full right here so we're gonna start off by adding this my bowl and I think that's enough and for this one you're going to be needing cream of tartar and salt so we're gonna start off by activating it with sea salt and we'll see what that says and if it doesn't do too much we'll add in some cream of tartar but let's give this a nice texture haven't done much and it's kind of liquefying so what I'm gonna do is put this in the refrigerator and hopefully it will liquify and we can reactivate it with clear of tartar clear it up but it also turned into liquid as a piston see so we need to figure out how to reactivate this so what I like to do is activate this with cream of tartar like I said we would do earlier than sorry about the camera a vehicle change it has been a while since I was filming so it Henk eyes closed and up I guess I don't explain it so right here absolutely retarder and we're going to add in a little bit probably like that much to this and I'm just gonna pour that a little bit goes a long way so I'm gonna slowly whoa it's already kind of thickening up I guess as you guys can see this is probably one of the best no those lines I've ever made so like I'm super proud she was actually my favorite recipe out of all the recipes I am tested this week and I'm super happy with how this one turned out calm down below if you guys tested this recipe", "gdVFz9SQ43Q": "hey guys I'm Josie if you are new here please don't

beauty products anything like that leave it in the comment section below and I will get back to you as soon as I can and yeah so jumping right in today we are doing a DIY of how to make your own peel off lip stain I've seen a whole bunch of videos um of like I think it's a Korean companies but they have a product where you put it on your lips and then you let it dry and then you peel it off so it got me thinking to how we would do it like a DIY style so I'm definitely not the first one to do this but I'm going to try away and see how good it works for me so I did a mask a little bit ago if you guys haven't seen that I will link it in the description it was a charcoal blackhead remover mask and it worked really really really good so what you will need are some food coloring I have the neon kinds if this is I feel like this would be the trick on if you really want a good stain um and then I have just regular um school glue and then I have a mixing bowl and then a lip brush of some sort to put it on with going to wipe off my lipstick and I'll be right back so everything is off of my lips now they are a little they are a little dry as you guys can see so I'd imagine that if your lips aren't as dry it would work better take your glue and just put a little bit just a little bit in your mixing container because remember this is just going on your lips you are going to mix some of the food coloring in and then I'm actually just going to use a q-tip just because I don't want to have to keep washing my makeup brush just to mix the lip stain you guys can see it so it looks like that and we are just going to put this on to our lips min about 10 minutes and you can see that my lips are like starting to like stick together these are the colors there did for y'all um I'm gonna start taking this off I know I sound hilarious hahaha okay oh wow oh wow wow let's call it top one to make sure don't see if the talent is good I don't even believe this it doesn't hurt you can kind of hear it a little bit holy crap it worked just like a lip stain like it looks just like only thing oh that is really cool guys I gotta be completely honest with you I did not think this was gonna work but it worked so good Wow so this is what I have left the horrible job at placing them on my arm but I did two colors that you know we're kind of like outgoing and not everyone will wear but these three are very wearable honestly it's so much fun to peel it off that would be really pretty so these ones came out very natural and really close to like regular lip stains so this is what I got it kind of turned out to be like pastel II color yeah this is amazing the only drawback that I see to this is don't lick your lips when you first put it on cuz I did and that time is red and my teeth are a little red from the food coloring but it's not bad at all and you can just brush it off after you're done with the lip stain also I just got this like shimmery kind of clear lip gloss from BH Cosmetics this is called angel kiss so that's what the lip stain looks like with a clear gloss on top of it that is it for this DIY please let me know if you liked it in the comments below I also have a periscope Instagram Facebook and Twitter there also at beauty by Josie cave so I hope you go follow me over there oh please please if you could give this video a share and a thumbs up if you liked it and I will see you guys in the next tutorial I love you guys bye ah", "pI6tf-WOFq4": "[Music] these London youngsters are drunk on ordinary household glue new research shows that glue sniffing is killing far more people than previously thought what can be done to control this menace before more teenagers suffer there's a popular image of solvent abuse or glue sniffing as it's usually called it's something skinheads do to shuck passers-by but what many people may not realize is that their own children could well be doing it in attractive suburban parks like this you saw them crisp off freezer bags and tins like these are the tell-tale signs of a place used by the sniffers there's now growing evidence that the sniffing craze is spreading rapidly amongst youngsters from every type of background all over the country parents are aghast if they discover that their children have been doing it but when they try to discover how they should react they find it impossible to get clear advice some people say that the first sniffing session could be enough to condemn a child to drug addiction or even sudden death but others claim the risks are slight and that for most teenagers it's just a passing phase today we're going to try and unravel fact from fiction to show just how serious the problem is and what can be done about it some people may find certain scenes in this program distressing we should emphasize that we shot them only because it's impossible to understand the nature of the problem without seeing just what's going on in every case the youngsters we show sniffing were doing so unprompted by us and well before our cameras started turning last summer the life of one London boy came to a sudden end Stephen Antony was found dead on a staircase near his council flat home in Islington he'd lived there with his mother a messenger in the civil service and his father a chauffeur he's always so sensible we just soldered he's just not one of the idiots of life you know he was it was a really sensible boy he did love life without light so yet I did love life he was Chelsea made he love Chelsea they went one of these boys at cause trouble Steven Anthony was only 16 when he died last June he just left school and had been lucky enough to get a job straight away Stevens prospects looked good and his parents were happy for him but they were stunned to find out that he'd been glue-sniffing in out-of-the-way corners around the estate to use for Sheila I told her dangers of it to which she said we wouldn't he said he squared would never do they don't and we assumed that was about this the second time was the next time he done it he wasn't he wasn't that lewd and it was the aerosol the guess butane thing which was near his body when we found him from what they told me he was already dead when they tried to revive him on the stairs I said Dade I fell knocked himself unconscious and choked on his own vomit Terry and Mavis Anthony are still a long way from getting over their son's death we've all ordered none of us are the same none of us ever will be the same just impossible he wasn't one of those nasty little layabouts and Laird Murphy elbows he was just a fun-loving boy you know the handful of pathetic deaths like Steven Antony's are the cases that make the headlines there's much less publicity about the majority of sniffers who don't die no one knows how widespread solvent abuse is but we had no difficulty in finding young sniffers either alone or in groups all over London from the West End to the parks and open spaces of the outer suburbs there's no doubt that there are several thousand young people in the region who indulge in the practice it was through acting as a lookout for a group of sniffers that mick an 18 year old from Hendon started on the habit that he now can't shake off well I started about five years ago when I was the mermaid you know because there's one sniffing glue right just watch them for about a couple of weeks but after a couple of weeks I was on my skateboard and I was going down the road and I found it old tube on the floor you know I picked the aisle to bar I took it to my house I went back to my bathroom me house Wyman Bachman and so it starts different from then I'm gonna buzzing my head if from that - you start sniffing Illinois the reason of course that young people like Mick and his girlfriend Karen sniff is that it makes them feel good I just do it to get the buzz to get high that's all I do it for I splat it or I can really say about the bars but you know you get different things you know you get trips and I once I imagined myself in the phone box you know and so loads of people in the phone box and thousands of thousands of people in the phone box and what Nick and Karen may feel good but their intoxication means that they run the risk of harming themselves the problem of solvent abuse and the effects of sniffing on young people was first investigated by dr. Joyce Watson the intoxication so caused goes through the entire range that one would associate with acute alcoholic intoxication from the euphoria and then through to the starting of speech the blurring of vision double vision the staggering in uncoordinated gait and finally if the intoxication goes on forever it goes on we come to look at the other sorts of effects that have been closed there's been a great deal made of liberal kidney and brain damage and certainly there have been sporadic accounts of these over the last ten years of that on top of these risks abuse of solvents rather like abuse of alcohol can make people forget their inhibitions and release suppressed aggression poor sabe by they blame I have in my own experience known of people fight with knives over the use of the last crisps bag I have known people use offensive weapons against one another as to who sniffs first and last I have known children end up in hospital through deliberately but one can one use a term deliberately when they're so intoxicated unglue deliberately pushing people into water when sniffers are clearly putting themselves or other people in danger the police do have certain legal powers which allow them to intervene we have three clearly defined areas which we connect one is under the Public Order Act for threatening or abusive behavior secondly under the churning young person's act for children in need of care and attention and thirdly under the Road Traffic Act for people who are using a motor vehicle on the road whilst under the influence of drugs but despite the disturbing consequences of solvent abuse sniffing as such is not in fact an offence parents like Terry and Mavis Anthony feel strongly that the authorities should be doing more to tackle the problem let's find two em favored sons or daughters and let them see their sons and daughters take Glo and die from it and let's see what I would say then then maybe I do something if it was their own the mommies have been weapon it Lynn the spectacle of youngsters sniffing in public like these in Leicester Square has aroused widespread concern over the hazards of the practice a number of measures which might help reduce the practice are being considered the first is that sniffing in public be made an offense Teddy Taylor MP for South and East is very worried about the number of youngsters involved in sniffing in his own constituency and is campaigning for sniffing in public to be made illegal now if we were in fact to make it unlawful to do it in a public place I think could in the case of those who are caught to get them before the courts and the courts can obviously do something with youngsters like that not just sending them to an offender's institution that can get them put in touch with people who can help them onto more stable lifestyles the other thing of course it will is stop it being done in a public place and they are biasing to move a temptation and an encouragement from other youngsters who might otherwise not get involved not everyone agrees however tamargo MP for Enfield north is also actively involved in trying to find ways to combat the problem but he fears that making sniffing illegal could be counterproductive if you make sniffing itself illegal then the chances are you're going to drive it underground though you already have areas of certainly in my constituency and elsewhere where sniffers know where to go to congregate the culture develops now all that will happen if you make it illegal is that they've will be driven underground if you like into more inaccessible places and the chances are that people will become more impaired and the will less chance of helping them in my view the second proposal to control solvent abuse relates to the actual products that are used by the sniffers the idea is that there should be no sale to minors of the glues that affect them here one of the main reasons it's so difficult to stop young people sniffing is that they can buy glues in many hardware stores self-service DIY shops and supermarkets but the problem doesn't even stop there some shopkeepers are consciously exploiting the sniffer market in February the news of the world into you George Moore who runs a souvenir kiosk just off Piccadilly the article said that he sold a sniffing kit of glue with a plastic bag for one pound fifty five pence he was reported as saying that he didn't care how it affected youngsters his motives were strictly commercial we decided to see if mr. Moore would explain why he's still got blue on his shelves alongside the souvenirs but mr. Moore just attacked our camera MP Teddy Taylor witnessed the attack and has his own views about people like mr. Moore but the factors that are far too many shots around about her city centers like this who sell things for tourists things for youngsters but also sell pots of glue it doesn't seem to make sense at all what most shopkeepers are not as irresponsible as this John Baker runs a hardware shop in Hamilton East London since he realized that the glue he stocks can be used for sniffing he's taken it off the shelves he won't sell it to youngsters he thinks the sniffer we were selling you know an unusually large amount of Evo stick and you know we become aware you know and and we thought this can't be you know normal trade and it wasn't long after that when the local beat policeman come in here and Tyler and had a chat with us and of course by this time there was reports in the trade press and of course what we had to do was take it off these self-service shelves and put it under the counter John Baker believes that this system of voluntary control by shopkeepers has helped but in his view making it illegal to sell glue to minors would improve matters still further I think it will be useful for the shopkeeper to have the backing of the law if you like because occasionally not often a kid can get offensive but of course if you've got the backing of the law then you are you know well within your rights not to sell it you know but here again there are serious doubts as to whether such a change in the law would really work I think it's simply impractical if you simply say well right we're not going to ban certain products but we're only going to sell them to people over 18 or 16 whatever the cutoff is you get exactly the same problems we have now with films kids under age getting in to see films whether she shouldn't go or drinking in pubs it is just is an impossible line in my view to draw the third proposal aimed at reducing sniffing is to legislate to make manufacturers display prominent government health warnings on the containers labels on products containing dangerous solvents already give instructions on how to use them safely but many people think that a larger warning saying directly that sniffing damages your health similar to that on cigarette packets might help to deter some youngsters but here as with the earlier proposals it's questionable whether such a move would have more than unlimited effect I doubt if it would help in practice because you know in might in some ways almost add to the attraction of saying this can do you damage I think we see the same with youngsters with cigarettes I think often the health warning printed in the packets quite apart from the what's taught in the schools which I think does some good I think it has no real effect on the youngsters before and perhaps the most obvious proposal that is being made to control solvent abuse is that new formula for the product sniffers use should be developed one suggestion is that the solvent based glues could be replaced by water-based or other glues according to the manufacturers however this is not possible glues have to do many different jobs some jobs can be done perfectly well by water-based lose but for many specific purposes you've got to have solvent present let me instance plastic glue in use in modeling kits let me talk about gluing rubber and gluing inflatables another nice case is gluing Formica onto wood now this involves contact cements and you can make aqueous contact cements but water takes longer to evaporate and the glue tends not to be as effective the bond isn't as effective in practice the products have been on offer and the consumers don't like them so for some purposes you positively can't use non solvent blues for other purposes they aren't so effective the other possible way to make glue lose its appeal for sniffers might be to add something with an unpleasant smell to put them off here again though there are problems this seems a very simple and attractive idea I think it's a very bad idea it's a bad idea for three V's the first reason is that if they are unpleasant for slippers they're going to be very unpleasant for the people who use them legitimately the second reason is the ones that have been tried so far and there has been quite a lot of work darling are ineffective after about six months so that it's a temporary effect the advance mel and at the same time they tend to stop the glue working effectively however I think the most important reason is that there is a tendency for products of this sort to be hazardous but even if a non hazardous additive or a reliable solvent substitute for glue could somehow be found they would still be a problem this is because glue is not the only product that can be sniffed although apparently it's the most popular most homes contain 20 or so spirit based or aerosol products such as dry cleaning fluids nail varnish remover 'he's lighter fuel deodorants and fire extinguishers each of these products has killed sniffers and the chances of finding substitutes or additives for all of them are zero it seems then that the popular proposals for controlling solvent abuse don't have much chance of cracking the problem all of them face fairly formidable practical difficulties it's partly on account of this that recent governments have declined to legislate on solvent abuse indeed they've always said that there's very little that central government can do the attitude they've taken is that sniffing can be best controlled by local agencies with campaigns of prevention in the community as recently as the 11th of March a minister of state at the home office Timothy raisin said the approach favoured by the government and supported by people experienced in helping those who abuse solvents relies on persuasion and education one place where they've done more than most to put the idea of education and persuasion into practice is here at the offices of off-centre in Hackney where adolescents with all sorts of problems can go for help and advice today the hack be solvent abuse panel is meeting here the panel was set up as a result of rising concern about the level of sniffing in the area it's made up of a police officer a parent to social workers an educational welfare officer and usually a local doctor they see a big part of their job as working together to provide basic information to other professional workers in the field to parents and to youngsters small piece of green to play on and you know they're afraid to send this monitor them down because if the bigger ones are glue-sniffing what harm they might do to this noise and that's the panic level we get at the in high school well maybe it will be appropriate for us to suggest that we go along with the panel and have a word with the teachers and is there a parent-teacher Association there yes yes we did at the secondary school was was really excellent it brought out some really one of the most distinctive attitudes of the panel is a low-key approach to the whole problem they almost under play the issue they believe that the dangers of sniffing have been exaggerated by scare mongering in the media and that this has made sniffing steam glamorous and exciting to young people rather than putting them off press have tended to really sensationalize the whole problem of glue-sniffing and they've been a lot of distorted facts they've tended to focus on health hazards which actually have nothing to do the glue-sniffing which have more to do with the more dangerous sort of soul from it's like aerosols and petrol and they don't differentiate the two a lot of young young people do blue smooth especially in the London area it's it can be a passing phase they are experiment a bit of a kick and I think in this sort of situation the best approach is not to panic about it to take a very low-key approach perhaps talk to the young person about the dangers and to try and communicate with them and hopefully it'll pass over as it normally does you had actually stopped through sniffing almost certainly stopping you do sniffing we've gone back to school I believe you that the panel tries to ensure that the minority of sniffers with a serious problem gets special help they believe that youngsters only become heavily hooked if they have an underlying psychological or family difficulties to overcome these they often try to talk out the problem with the glue-sniffer and his family in this case his mother and sister it's probably cuz I just don't understand why he's got back on it again well he had gone back on it again and it could you ask him is showing well yes why why did you go back on it because we I suppose it's go Bristol nice all right we're sniffing hmm just got scented I think I'd like you are no need to just talk a little bit about only the experiences in the last couple of weeks it became very ferocious very quickly because he was had a tremendous amount of glue Kings and tins Hackney's low-key approach can pay off even with quite heavy sniffers though it's a long process and success is never guaranteed but the approach and the attitude underlying it also has serious drawbacks the first is that the low-key approach by central government has meant leaving initiatives in tackling solvent abuse to local agencies it seems clear that very few areas have followed Hackney's examples and that in most parts of the country this kind of help is just not available I know very few other centers like off-centre who deal specifically with the problem of glue-sniffing and I think it's interesting that I get a lot of phone calls from other agencies all over the country asking how to deal with specific problems so I think there is a great need for this expertise to be incorporated in in other organizations the second drawback to the low-key approach relates to the health risks of sniffing non-medical workers with young people have tended to assume that some solvents and glue in particular and not in themselves highly toxic they stressed the danger of accidents and so go out of their way to teach children to avoid dangerous situations like sniffing alone or in places where they could fall in addition they often recommend that youngsters sniff glue rather than other Psalms if they must sniff at all leaflets like this one for professional workers have a checklist of do's and don'ts for safer sniffing don't be afraid to point out that some familiar glues already commonly used are relatively safe if used sensibly unfortunately it seems that many young people have taken this to mean that there's no risk to health from sniffing glue if this advice is followed but new evidence shows clearly that this just isn't true here at some George's Hospital Tooting one of the few research projects into solvent abuse is being carried out dr. Ross Anderson and John Ramsey have recently completed a study to be published next month which for the first time pulls together data on death from solvent abuse from over the whole country they found that contrary to popular belief the whole range of solvents including glue has been a direct cause of death in relatively few deaths happened as a result of accidents or trauma as it's known technically well a lot of people under the impression that many of the deaths are due to accidents arising from the behavior from using the solvents but we found that well over half the deaths were definitely associated with the direct effects of substance itself and that only 10% were associated with trauma the study also shows that the death rate from a solvent abuse is much higher than had previously been thought from the official statistics we had the impression that perhaps there were three or four deaths occurring every year but from our study we found that for example in 1981 there have been 45 deaths now this doesn't seem a large number of deaths in a country of this size but these deaths are occurring in an age group in which death from other causes unusual and so deaths from volatile substance abuse now count for well over 1 percent of deaths from all causes in adolescent males it had been appreciated in the past the death did occur but nobody was aware that they were occurring it was level and I think that the size of the problem has been grossly underestimated the other surprise in the study was that sniffing is not mainly confined to poorer youngsters in built-up areas as is often supposed we found that there's very little difference between the classes in mortality from volatile substance abuse and furthermore though the rates in large cities are about half as high again as they are in other parts of the country and the rates are higher in the north of the country than the south we've come to the conclusion that social and environmental factors are not a particularly important determinant of the deaths one of the greatest obstacles in the past to finding out how widespread solvent abuse is and what its effects are has been the lack of a comprehensive test to identify solvents in the body but now John Ramsey and his colleagues have cracked this problem our method it is one of the first that's capable of screening for all substances likely to be abused it's not just solvents it's not just glues our method is capable of detecting substances ranging from the aerosol propellants right through to toluene which is the common constituent to the contact adhesives this test will certainly help to increase knowledge of which substances are being abused and how often but there's still a long way to go one very important gap is is a virtual absence of any knowledge the long-term health effects of solvent inhalation we don't know if there are long-term effects and if there are whether they're permanent or what the risk is the vital need for this research is dramatically underlined by the plight of Mick and Karen they get through three tins of blue a day but nobody knows how much damage they're doing to themselves to all appearances they're in a bad state both physically and mentally after five years of heavy sniffing Mick sighs can't stand daylight and he's noticed other effects as well mr. darling certainly they get colored pain sometimes in your chest in it I'll get so high on it I start crying and I feel face suicidal in the end I'll get suicidal I'll get too high I'm gonna first story I think I made me violent because I take my bubble of a glue pot you know and beat him up and especially when a head of the glue pot Nick and Karen believe that the only thing that can help them now is a special clinic where they can live in and be treated the government was dressing prevention rather than cure has said that there's no need for such places and no funds have been earmarked for them well I've got a lot of problems at home right and I think I need medical help to get me off it as well I mean my social worker she doesn't really do much I've got a social worker and she can't really help me and the doctors have tried other places to get me off in you know just believe heard that you're six you're over 15 they don't want to know and I just want to help to get it you know she's now good I mean you died for me in the end I think there is a real need for having perhaps some psychiatric beds or at least somewhere where one could put a very violent chronic sniffer even temporarily to try and sort the problem out and let let the heat of the situation die down and I don't think in many places there are very many people who are willing to admit these people very recently the government has shown some signs of taking the problem of solvent abuse more seriously on the 20th of April Junior Health Minister Jeffery Finn's burg announced the government will fund research into solvent abuse consult voluntary bodies on what the government can do to help them consult retailers on whether it's practicable for them to restrict sales of the glues they make to youngsters and finally promote books and a film designed to educate professionals working in the field many of those concerned about the problem believes that the government should be far more energetic what I think both this governed and the previous government have been rather too relaxed about the problem they've pretended to think all tended to think rather that it's going to go away that it's a passing for Norman the passing craze and there's nothing that government needs to do and that hasn't been borne out by events I mean they but they they being proved wrong the Billington family who live in Mitchum have had a painful experience of the present shortage of informed help for sniffers when they discovered that their son Kevin had been blue sniffing for over a year they took him to the nearest drug abuse clinic for counselling but Kevin found the staff there were really only equipped to help addicts of hard drugs and not sniffing when I went to the clinic it was only so many fast tightening on floor there's no way that they didn't make me stop so excited my dear foot before I were more interested in you but I go about your history and your parents I think there was nothing about the club because I didn't know anything about it I still don't in the end it was the unsupported efforts of Kevin's own parents that succeeded in getting him off the glue if I'd done a big shouting match I never saying I wouldn't a chance to tell because I realized that I win it sit down I really want to help I thought you know I can't just sort kick him in the face I don't know don't want your help at home I said you know I'll try well at first I didn't know how to help him you know I mean because he didn't want any help at first no why did he want anybody to help him go I have tremendous patience particularly with a boy that age they've got so many interests and really you've got to try and keep control of them all and make sure that he doesn't get into any other bother but good evening ladies and gentlemen I'd like to welcome you all to the second meeting of the national campaign against old abuse as a result of his experiences with Kevin Hodja and his growing frustration of the lack of reliable information and help available Alan Billington has become one of the leading lights of the recently formed pressure groups election the national campaign against solvent abuse at this meeting at starting Civic offices he's trying to tell people about the problem and interest them in joining a local self-help group John Ramsey and Ross Anderson have joined him on the panel any questions in that area that crop up we are trying to start up a Help Center locally for addicts of glue and other solvents we're working very closely with social services and various other bodies to achieve this and we're hoping sometime in June that we'll be able to start referring teenagers to the Center for help Council and all the Education Committee and my problem is I'm totally ignorant about it you see whatever I try to find out nobody's interested in talking about it to you this is the same thing and if you look around here where are our social workers where are our teachers where are any council officials our talk to speak up they think this is a for subject which people can be best swept under the carpet as far as I can discover first of all that's all you can tell me so we've done it what it is what is the attraction where they where they start and questions been raised why do you sniff glue we got any of the teenagers and the audience would like to answer that young man I think I like it I enjoy doing it you like it well answer that what sort of stuff did you sniff well what sorts of things to do sniff blow just glue yeah you try anything else but blah do most of you sniff glue yeah yeah you don't bother with anything else [Music] do you realize go do you care that it may be harming you in any way because of the samaritans it is no proof nice cook point perhaps one of our medical experts would like to comment on that it takes a long while to establish what the actual risks are but there's no doubt there are a significant number of children who are dead now who wouldn't be dead if they didn't sniff solvents and that's a fact what's the difference they're dead and they died because they sniff solvents and it doesn't seem very important to me whether they died because they fell in front of a train or a bus or what they did it because they were under the influence of blue just because this is where the deaths occur a meeting may have had some success in helping to galvanize local agencies into action but the youngsters there didn't seem impressed by the arguments they had heard as we left they went out into the grounds of the Civic offices and started to glue up as usual that's bad sniffing is clearly a practice that's here to stay and it's vital if those in a position to act find out what needs to be done and do it as quickly as possible until that happens more and more young people will be risking their health and sometimes even their lives come on let it go and speak back [Music]", "L7erHZmURB4": "[Music] do you think i had any intention of recording this clip at this angle no i didn't i oh my god i can see how far i'm i'm literally about to be stuck in traffic for about probably about an hour um it's been a horrible crash the road which i saw on the way to the dispensary and i'm just so [ __ ] scatterbrained today i just hop right back on the highway it's been like seriously 20 minutes i haven't moved anywhere it's a little bit hot um strain review um i've got super glue by verano and i didn't think we were going to do the first sniff in the car i don't want to do the first sniff in the car but we're literally going nowhere and i'm gonna be so pissed off by the time i get home that i'm just gonna need to smoke i'm gonna be too impatient to uh do it normally so here we go if the traffic does pick up i promise we'll cut the we'll cut the clip short but yeah man super glue by verano claiming hand trimmed colas but we're also going to start this video and let you know that they're not hand trimmed colas anymore they have gone to a what do you call that a machine trimming they're not doing it by hand um so the nugs have been horseshit i've got to say that um if we crack this and it's non-dry bud that isn't all pebbled up i'll be really surprised because uh effects aside verano has not been my favorite cultivator to grab for the quality so um let's break the seal and see if just um you know smell alone in the car if we're gonna have anything i'm not even gonna look at the nugs i haven't even looked at the nugs yet i'm just gonna open this and place it right there [Music] oh yeah oh yeah okay okay we'll call that a successful first sniff when i don't even need to bring the jar to my nostrils [ __ ] ah those nugs are looking horse [ __ ] i'm seeing like nine or ten yeah they're your typical verano pebbles but what are you gonna do man i gotta get high whoa gasolina god damn oh [ __ ] son that's nice that's nice okay i'll have that little excitement in this [ __ ] traffic jam the second we're done recording this clip i have to crack a window it's so oi aha it's not the year 1900 we have ac forgot about that man oh man um well terps are on point y'all that that stings that stings to smell um what is super glue super glue is a back cross of gorilla glue number four by verano a back cross i believe i'll look this up when i get home is when the same strain is made to do its its weed sex it's weed [ __ ] and um comes out a stronger more pronounced version of itself this is not my first time smoking super glue i have to mention that i've smoked it about a year ago and number one effects wise taste wise i've always enjoyed gorilla glue so how could i not feel great about almost a super glue i think you understand why they went with that name man that took an obnoxiously long time but we're here y'all we're finally here i cannot wait to go inside and break some of this down for you even that probably looked pretty [ __ ] weird i did that to show that the terps of this are reeking through the package in fact now that i'm now that i'm here there's this big bite to it right i said it almost hurt to oh it is a combination of uh such a sharp smell and just simply so [ __ ] stinky oh pardon the language but god god and you know what these nugs look good they are smaller they're not the hand-trimmed colas that the packaging suggests but checking this out i'm not exactly disappointed the keith the keefe that i remember uh coming off of these nugs a year ago very light green i don't want to say white obviously not white but hopefully i said zoom in [ __ ] hopefully you're beginning to get an idea of what i'm talking about as promised i want to make sure i'm always getting the numbers for you guys i can sometimes get a little too ahead of myself but here you are this is some fresh cannabis in fact oh my god look at that packaging date this just came in it's like may uh may 7th or something good job baby good job get a little bit of zoom for you guys but i'm not gonna go too far into it i don't want the uh i noticed on the last video it kind of distorts the image quality and i just want you all to see that two things look at the size of some of these nugs they give me this was the original complaint i was telling you guys about that the majority of verano eighths that i grab contain buds such as this yep you heard it here you've heard me say it now i don't like this i don't like this at all for a lot of different reasons however check it out y'all just in the sunlight seen that crystalline glisten those trichomes and look at his friends see on this bottom one here yeah look at that man there is a lot of medicine attached to these small nugs so it's a two-part review i really really hate the size of these but the terpene is these are stunk up the whole house and it's looking like we're gonna get nice and toasty so when i speak on uh the nug quality you know it means two things here it means is there medicine on these nuggets are they some dry barrels of hay and also if the packaging suggests hand-trimmed colas then clearly we've got a problem but visually i wanted you all to know that we used to get two to three nugs for a verano eighth we really did they were actual colas and i don't know about the past year maybe year and a half this is the norm one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirty fourteen fifty six like sixteen different nugs for this eighth i mean uh a uh what am i even trying to say as promised i wanted to give you guys an official definition of what a back cross strain is uh from potguide.com not my website first thing that it's the first thing that popped up a back cross is a type of breeding that allows the transfer of a desired trait from parent to offspring unlike traditional breeding bat crossing breeds a plant with one of its parents this process creates a hybrid plant that is genetically more similar to the parent by back crossing breeders can strengthen certain genes in a plant and ensure the survival of rare strains so there you go the plant is getting on some creepy incest stuff with its parent plant however drama aside it's going to produce a really advanced version of the strain itself we should be getting a really really potent high out of this batch of super glue it's been so long that i've smoked it i honestly i remember i liked it but i can't really recall what the high was like i know a large majority majority i think i just said majority a large majority of my strain reviews are verano and they're verano because when i first got that card that was my ticket to getting to show you guys quality cannabis i want to show you guys all cannabis and i don't want it to ever come across like i have a favoritism to a brand that's why i'm showing you guys these like 16 pieces of verano jigsaw if you will and uh i'm calling them out for it man the packaging suggests something different they have to change it another reason that i've chose super glue today to review is really gorilla glue was one of the first strains of cannabis purchased on the black market and sometimes in colorado that i would notice like whoa i'm not just a little high like i'm high high hi um so this is almost the super version of that strain um come on like this is going to be a fun high ow this is gonna be a fun high in general see you don't scratch my neck and i like that thank you and you what's your excuse huh drugs drugs what oh oh my god i was literally physically attacked there um let's break some of these down the tiny ones and uh smoke the [ __ ] out of them it's really been a keef explosion over here grinding up those first nugs of super glue wanted to point out my speak easy tumbleweed i mean look at all the crevices this thing just popped especially in the center there let me get some of this all right finally man here we go oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] it's been like two minutes since i had that told you guys i was looking for a crazy potency [Music] i haven't been this eye in a really long time i have no [ __ ] clue what the [ __ ] is going on right now and that's what i signed up for i had a moment to steal away from the homies in call of duty i apologize for the gunfire temperance this super glue is hitting just as hard as a concentrate would in some ways very reminiscent of the sunshine og of that just you know what the heck is going on hi uh so excited to go in on this second hit i'm i'm messed up but feeling good let's see we've got spicy 74 versus the mooch jr they call me the mooch what no yeah right today's lesson kids is minding your [ __ ] business [Music] hmm super glue is one of those strains that i'm high like before the smoke even leaves oh my god i gave my girlfriend a hit of the super glue earlier and i also noticed that she as well was much more affected by a single hit with this super glue like i was than other strains that i've been bringing home from the dispensary it's really something to know because i'm not a smoker that is generally satisfied with one hit by any means in fact i generally smoke too much and i get like mad at myself and angry and full of guilt and shame but um i was fully medicated off one that second round oh the high that simply stays in my face with uh gorilla glue and especially this super glue i mean it feels like drugs man i love this train okay [Music] just wanted to point out visually this grinder screen has been pretty clean i recently did the freezer trick and took care of it but man oh man there is a lot of keefe making this clip for two reasons i of course want any uh sunshine rip to be a part of this number two uh the hit i took about 10 to 15 minutes ago has absolutely rattled me uh in combination with cold brew being delivered via starbucks to this house right now i practically feel like i'm on illegal narcotics i'm so hyped up the potency of super glue i want to reiterate is one of a stimulating one i do not feel a sudden a urge to sleep after smoking this jaffeel dude you know what i will literally turn this stove on right now oh my god i almost lost it almost lost it there we go talking about but make no mistake even with the beaker y'all no clocks over here this is just quality medicine and then all this shoots out a bunch of hot gases to keep the muzzle from flying up so it's shooting out energy to keep the muzzle where you want it so let's just talk about this gun first because it is my brand new 308 dude she goes nuts with this elephant what do you think about that rose gold super smooth carrier she does especially when you wrestle it backwards yeah right come here watch out for your hand though because sometimes like she can see that one side skeletonized upper both sides so when that bolt is not there i'll just show you i'll just show you guys foreign finishing off the last of the super glue with this little guy i'm trying to put myself into the sun what is my arm just doing right there hey it's me hi as hell um the super glue it's outstanding man i'm right back in it i haven't had any caffeine yet i eventually will but uh feel fantastic so fantastic indeed hello world this is burning my eyeballs but hello holy [ __ ] uh well before i go trip on that maybe i should go fix myself up some caffeine and i don't know um maybe that's it for super glue um what else do i say man i've always loved gorilla glue and you pretty much don't drop the camera come on and i pretty much get the best version of it possible through this but let's make no mistake let's not end on that note verano can oh oh god i'm making a video uh verano needs to absolutely get it together what are you doing um with their nug production slash packaging um you're paying 60 dollars for i guess certain genetics at at this point you know they did grab a lot of those west coast genetics that i reviewed a while back sunday driver god which i haven't seen literally like literally since i made that video um but verano a few things either got to happen the quality of the nugs needs to go up that's probably not going to happen because you said the patient demand is why you changed and we only know that's gonna go up up up um the price man what am i no i i don't know what i'm saying i'm like asking like make it cheaper please i'm high as hell did you hear the voice i just used at that point at that point i know that um this is what i'm paying for with verano the genetics the effects the nugs are too small they can often be too dry but you know what they were pretty amazing smokes on this super glue for those tiny little guys i've been high as hell for the past two days man two three days no clue what day it is oh mailman probably thinks i was just filming him well sayonara it's me getting caught being um a [ __ ] weirdo again

really really unique smell you guys um I I don't think I've ever smelled a canvas that 1g I mean Tangie is always orange E but 24-karat is a kosher kush with tan G so I think it gives it like that

effects of the medicine and how it really makes our body feel so I can really give you guys an accurate description of the effects before you guys purchase this medicine or purchase any other type of medicine concentrate wise really anything strains anything because it's not that cheap and you want to know what's good and what the smells are and how high-end of the stuff you're buying I know

organics Santa Cruz and this was sponsored by grizzly City collective cheer [Music] whoa so this um this is completely full of warm street Wow a very very unique type of orange flavor really nice so far but is it strong what oh so I've noticed one thing you're gonna get is an extremely heavy orange flavor when you're burning it and there's nothing but one stream here you're not mixing it with any flavors here org it's more it's more like - really not kosher cush has given it that really earthy feely type of days about a quarter way done or about a quarter way left with this orange tree this stuff is strong [Music] at nighttime this string is pretty strong I'd say it's a very very balanced hybrid I'm not leaning into any more indica or any more sativa it's really just right in the middle yeah this stuff's really nice you guys um I highly recommend picking this up if you want some quick relief we're about a quarter way down here yeah this stuff is phenomenon you guys I highly recommend orange tree if you guys are looking for some fast daytime I leave so you're able to still function don't um don't fret if you're not able to pick this stuff up it is it a little bit higher to price point but uh [Music] highly recommended so with this super super crazy flavor with the orange tree they're gonna go I'm gonna go ahead and give it a nice 4.5 out of 5 on my scale orange trees coming in really heavy really everly medicating definitely a well-balanced hybrid I'm definitely glad I got to try the orange tree and see what it's all about this was your host Liam dabs this was the orange tree my green line organics strain review sponsored by grizzly City collective here in the valley make sure you guys check them out and until the next review stay happy stay healthy stay high this was

really nice for that kind of gives it more that emoji shape and hope that you really like these two now what I thought was really fun is you can make lots of different ones depending on what mood if you're angry make an angry one and write in it about your angry thoughts if you're happy your happy thoughts if you're feeling cheap like you're cheeky thoughts used or surprised right you're confused or surprised cause so you can make these emoji bookmarks depending on your mood you need to make them for or of course so something like this one would be really nice for Valentine's Day as well and anymore when you're watching this course so remember you have to watch the video because and don't fast forward because I've had a few of you say that you've wasted paper not getting it quite right do follow this steps exactly and maybe practice with scrap paper first that's actually what I do before make these videos for you so maybe get some scrap paper out have a go and see what you can do so come on let's take a look and see how to make these square emoji notebooks so to make our emoji bookmarks all you need is a square piece of yellow paper some scissors and a black pen now I'm going to talk about the pen at the end again but for now that's all you need square piece of paper I've cut down an a4 sheet of paper to make it into a square and now we're going to start folding so the first thing you need to do is is bring the bottom up to the top do them as neat as you possibly can give it a good crease use your nail for that fold it over again and then a good crease and use your nail open it all up and now repeat in that in that direction so you bring this one over this side bring it as neatly as you can use your nail and repeat this now you can open it you don't have to open it all the way you just open it one lot and you need to cut cut cut the three central lines up to that center point so one up cut it along the middle and again and there we go and now just fold these in or out depending on how you see it hold fold flip this is re important flip the paper fold this up fold this down fold it again now if you need to pause the video or rewind at any point now the last step we need to do is push these apart like this fold it over and you have your square mini book that needs no glue let's just count the pages it should be an 8 or 16 if you count both sides so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 great now some of you have said but my sides like this one has some extra pages in the middle or where is it this one maybe or even this one now that's just the way these books works if you want to have these all free not sticking together at all then you can't do an Oso craft okay that no so no glue grass craft so this is how you do the no glue now we decorated in the style of an emoji and I'm going to do the surprised phase so basically across another cross a big round mouth and some eyebrows there we go my emoji buck no glue no anything is finished now I have done some more as you know you saw them at the beginning this is also no glue because you've just had to draw the face on however these are a tiny bit of glue because I've added details with glue don't worry about it you can use pens if you want I think it just looks better if you glue on the you know you get the contrasting colors and stuff and it could of course it just depends it's not a problem so really it's up to you you can make the no glue by using the simpler emojis if you want to add some colors and a bit of variety then you do have to add a tiny bit of glue for your decorations and that's it and there you go that's how easy it is to make your square emoji [Music] no group anyway hope you like this do come back and try like calling planet Uranus make some I'd love to see them and of course see you again soon [Music]", "PJ1EQUz-YEA": "him by Harry where is a collection of styles that cater to any guy at any age with precise haircuts there's no need for a barber go groomed and professional one

gorilla glue in her hair is on tick tock and it's gone viral and i just wanted to give you guys like my perspective from a professional point of view you know because i teach all about hair care and stuff like that so maybe i can even offer her a little bit of advice but if you guys haven't seen the video i'm going ahead and roll the footage as two videos i'm going to roll the fitted so you can see the video and then i'm going to tell you what i think about it after we watch it all right oh dear my heart goes out to you lady oh my heart goes out to you okay and see this type of stuff is a reason why y'all need to go ahead and sign up for some of those hair care classes i'll be offering the 14 day hair growth boot camp the sign up is going on right now i'm putting the link below y'all need to get this knowledge so you won't be doing stuff like this okay all right so from a professional perspective um i don't know i i just gotta gather my thoughts i just gotta get my thoughts because okay this is my second time seeing the video so i got a chance to really really really see it without like anybody else in the room like reaction and laughing or whatever they had to do first of all my heart goes out to you her name is tessica my heart goes out to you poor darling because i know that hair can be an emotional thing and she obviously loves her hair to be really really polished that's probably why she went about doing what she did okay and she looks really nice she got the eyelashes and she got the contacts and she got the makeup and she got the you know her hair it looks really nice she said that her hair has been like that for a month and that she washed her hair 15 times and nothing happened what in the world oh my gosh i don't even y'all i i'm my heart is literally like beating for her so fast my heart is like racing like beating for her so fast because i understand how it is when your hair is in a state that you're not happy with and you just want it better she looked like she about ready to like just break down and literally cry okay first of all the only well not the only the first solution i see is her hair has been it like that for a month and so it's really super slick that means that it hasn't grown out a lot for her to even attempt to do anything with it so in my personal professional opinion what she's gonna have to do is um let it grow out maybe about three four months and then she's gonna have to shave it off unfortunately because right now nothing can get on her scalp uh not any razors or anything like that because it's so slick to her head and she don't want to enter herself trying to do it but from what i see she's gonna have to cut her hair all the way off and start over oh my gosh okay so jessica girl my heart goes out to you sign up for one of my classes so you can learn about healthy hair care for sure i need to send her like a dm or pm or something okay another solution uh she could maybe use some acetone to try to remove the glue from her hair like if she maybe you know got a few bottles big bottles of acetone and just try to like you know little by little dissolve the glue but she obviously sprayed that glue on there like a lot like lot for it to be slick like that and for stay just for it to stay for that long she probably was like use like the whole bottle of glue girl the only solution i see is that she's gonna have to lose her hair yeah she's gonna have to lose her hair because it's like a crust it's like a big like helmet of of glue on her head that's not coming off the video she says she washed her hair 15 times she literally showed you how she put conditioner on her hair and it did not even absorb like zero period nothing so you're gonna have to maybe get some um glue solvent or some acetone or some type of remover to to get that off uh if you want to attempt to get it off but i wouldn't put myself through that because you don't want to expose yourself to all those chemicals and stuff so i would just go ahead and just wait for it to grow out and just shave it off in the meantime what you could do is you could cut that ponytail off the back of your head and just wear wigs until you know it grows out enough to cut off i don't know how how long her hair was previously but if she had a lot of hair previously then she just gonna lose all that and have to start all over before baby you poor darling okay one thing i want to address is she used gorilla glue okay so we as a community we know all about the gorilla snot gel okay and that's what we typically use you know to slick down stuff you know because it's real sticky and tacky the one in the yellow bottle um we do have a habit of calling it gorilla glue we do because we like to shorten stuff and so that's probably where the mix up in her mind came because she was probably like i got some gorilla glue thinking that the gorilla the actual gorilla glue that's actually a glue that sticks to stuff is the same as a gorilla not gel which it is not now i think that she probably didn't from what i'm seeing she probably did not go to the store because she mentioned a couple a couple of things she mentioned that she ran out of her um her got to be uh hairspray and so she and then she mentioned that she got the other stuff and used it instead so she probably already had that on hand she probably did not go to the store to get uh the gorillas the gorilla glue because if she hadn't gone to the store then she could have just picked up another container of the got to be glue it got to be um hairspray instead of getting the gorilla glue because if you go to the spot store they ain't gonna have no real glue there if you go to walmart they're gonna have the gorilla glue and the gorilla snot gel and they got to be but the gorilla glue that sticks the stuff in the gorilla snot gel and the got2b is in two totally different sections one is in the haircare section that would be the gorilla snot gel and the got to be and the other ones over there by the paint and stuff so there's no way in the world she could have gotten that mixed up so she probably had that gorilla glue on hand and decided to use it and it looks like she sprayed a lot of it on her hair and maybe she didn't use her hands maybe she used a comb to smooth it on so she couldn't feel the sticky tackiness of it but i'm gonna tell you what gorilla glue is the the stickiest stick to it is glue you could ever use and literally nothing dissolves it really except for other chemicals so my heart goes out to you girl for that mix-up i mean for sure you know i can't say you know you know what she was thinking whatever i do i do see that she likes to have her hair polished and so that was hard alternative uh that was that was that that was bad that was bad that was bad that was really really really bad and um kudos to you for being transparent and opening up and showing us what happened with you and i feel sorry for you because you're gonna get a lot of people who are laughing at you and and you know dissing you and all that type of stuff and you know she needs to be uplifted because she's going through a trying time right now whenever you lose your hair or something happens to your hair that's unsafe if you have any type of setback whatever it's detrimental it can send you down a spiral depending on you know how you do your hair so girl my heart goes out to you but i don't i just don't see how she could have got that mixed up i don't i don't know i honestly don't know yeah but my heart goes out to you but anyways this type of stuff is a very reason why i do online coaching and online hair care classes y'all get your knowledge so you won't suffer through things like this so you know how to properly care for your hair how to care for your hair the right way what products you use for your hair what products not to use for your hair how to get your hair healthy and not be suffering through all types of stuff like this join the 14 day hair growth boot camp please do it do it do it so you can get healthy long hair the link is in the drop box y'all come on now 29 is worth it so you won't have to suffer with stuff like this okay oh my heart goes out to you jessica brown it really does and if you need any hair care advice for me contact me girl contact me girl okay guys i love y'all so much thank you for watching that is my response to my reaction to this young lady my heart goes out to you girl i'm praying for you you know and everything i love you guys so much and i'll see you on the next

testing Elmer's new glow-in-the-dark glue and as you can see here it's pretty amazing you don't need to be in super super low light conditions for this to glow like most other glow-in-the-dark products so it's really neat I am going to be doing a transform a slime series with this glue so basically if you haven't seen my transform a science series in the past on my channel right I take a glue when I make a slime so for this video I'm making just a basic glow in the dark lines then in my next video part two to this video I will make a difference line using this slime as the base for that slime so what you all need to do is comment down below and let me know what slime you think I should make next and the majority will win so make sure you have notifications turned on so that you

glow-in-the-dark slime like I am make sure you hit that like button and subscribe and now it is time to make some slime the first thing you want to do is add your glue to your container or bowl I like to add one pump of foam soap and then mix that all up I like to fill up the empty glue container with a little water very little water maybe like one third or less and shake that up and then pour the remaining contents into the bowl I mixed that a little more and then I start adding my activator the activator I'm using for these slimes is half a teaspoon to a teaspoon of borax dissolved in one cup of water you could use either or if you are new to slime I would recommend using half a teaspoon of borax dissolved in 1 cup of water because you will have less of a chance of over activating your slime that way keep adding activator slowly and working this line with your hands until it fully comes together you want to have a little or slightly sticky consistency because it still will continue to activate a little bit as you're kneading it and that is all there is to it I am going to be completing the same exact steps with the other two colored flus so stay tuned for that and then at the end I will be mixing little pieces of each together in a mini slime smoothie for the last three giveaways I have giveaway winners that are announced in the description in case you didn't see it in my

according to a recent study poor policing is behind the growing heroin crisis in South Africa of their 4 euros daily income as car guards Marvin and Eagles spent half on Yelp II the one who takes the

making them feel that someone wants to listen to me you know because of those young boys and girls they are victims of circumstances back with the two brothers Eagle takes the first hit then he injects his intoxicated blood into Marvin Marvin stayed clean for six weeks at the beginning of the year but after watching Eagle get high every day he started taking drugs again but soon the brothers want to stay off drugs together before it's too late my first guest today is Shaun chilly he is the founder of the South Africa Drug Policy week it's an awareness program welcome to 2dw Africa Shaun so how widespread is the problem of heroin and now figures in South Africa well we don't actually know but it's certainly increasing we haven't got accurate figures there's there's no daughter that one can rely on but we know that it is certainly increasing and that if there's an abundance of supply and we are picking up more and more issues around the use of heroin in South Africa right Shaun certainly as we've seen it from the protagonists in our report law enforcement isn't helping absolutely not we've got a lot of problems with the the whole way that drugs are managed and you know we deal with the use of drugs within communities and no enforcement of inch become part of the problem becoming just another defector gang in the situation who bribery and corruption is is the sort of standard in fact in parts of South African law enforcement called called drug users ATMs or automatic teller machines Wow and what if it is this having on South African communities the communities affected by this heroin and Yelper use well you know the the issue is that the communities as such are disintegrating you know we're finding more and more problems in communities and that's driving the heroin use often which makes people more marginalized and feel more excluded and that's creating even more of a problem again the the real issue is what is making heroin so attractive to people and what is it what is it that they're finding in it that they're not getting in their community so I think the case is that there were already problems in the community and these are just exacerbated by the by the availability of a drug which makes things seem right and intolerable circumstances tolerable you sort of alluded to it to it as Sean but my next question to you was really going to be why now why are we being told that right now heroin use is shooting up in South Africa why is it so rampant now you've got a confluence of factors first of all we've obviously got more porous borders there's more trade taking place we've got more illicit products coming out of Africa in general all products that kind of thing and often that is paid for with with drugs because it's easier to move them and cash often and we've got these porous borders plus we've got a community that are feeling disenfranchised and involved and unconnected and that together creates a kind of perfect storm for the undue importance of drugs in people's lives so I think that that's really come together and with increasing urbanization where we're seeing the rise of drug use because it provides meaning and purpose in people's lives might not look like it from the outside but when they're lacking meaning and purpose in day to day activities they're going to look for it elsewhere Sean quickly here what can the South African government do well I think the first thing they've got to do is look at alternative approach to drugs and we know that putting people in jail for drug use is not helping it drives the situation it becomes the perfect recruiting ground for gangsters and means economic exclusion going forward in the formal economy so we've really got to find a different way of approaching it we've gotta have more prevention programs which start at school level and that does not mean say no to drugs prevention programs don't even involve talking about drugs they involve building stronger and better communities all right Shaun Shelley thank you", "31n-5idEXf0": "hi there in this video I'm going to tell you all about a wonderful glue that you can use in your crafting it's called e6000 so e6000 is a clear glue that is wonderful for many of your crafting and jewelry making needs you can use it to glue multiple things wood metal fabric glass ceramics leather rubber in your crafting especially if you like to do multimedia you can glue rocks seashells beads buttons it's got a lot of wonderful properties it's waterproof and also it's flexible and that can be important here's a project that I just finished this is a cuff bracelet and all these little pieces were glued on and when I put it on it flexes a little I try not to flex it too much but you know even just through wearing it's going to get a little bit of flex and movement and because my pieces were glued on with ease 6000 I know it will move with them so they won't pop off so that's a really useful benefit of this glue it can go in the wash or a dryer it can be painted it's photo safe and the way I like to use it is I grab a scrap of paper or an index card and then you just glob out a little bit what you're going to need and maybe the next 5 or 10 minutes and then seal it up securely try to keep those threads cleared off and then you can use a toothpick to apply it and notice how it's stringy you can see that and it's kind of runny and stringy you want to use it while it's like that I like to just take my toothpick and twirl it a little and that gets those strings off so they don't follow me to my project do make sure to use this with good ventilation it is kind of stinky you certainly don't want to be bending over it smelling it all day long but if you have a fan on an open window you'll be fine if you need to clean it up before it's cured you can use acetone and after its cured it's kind of rubbery you can actually use a craft knife to cut and then peel off pieces cut and scrape so make sure it's stringy and fresh as you're using it and once it starts to glop up don't use that part anymore just go ahead and get some fresh glue an e 6000 is surprisingly strong but you should always test the bond on a practice piece before gluing something where the hold is crucial", "HNY2ICKvACA": "you know what is cracking you to of it is bacon vape and I am bringing you a fresh

want to do like a do-it-yourself blackhead removal mask I've been seeing a lot of videos going around on Pinterest Instagram and YouTube so I've decided I want to try it out myself from what I've seen it's really really easy you only need a few items and the main ingredient is activated charcoal you can find this at your local health food stores and also you're going to need so school glue you want to make sure that it's non-toxic because you are going to putting this on your face and also you want to use a little plastic container or plastic bowl and also you want to use a makeup brush to apply your mascara face so I've never done this before so I'm a little bit nervous to see how this is going to work I hope it works because I do have a lot of blackheads on my face especially on the left side of my face right above the cheek area I have a lot of blackheads there at this side not so much but definitely right here so I'm hoping that this works for me so I'm just going to go ahead and open up this charcoal just gonna take about a teaspoon of this and put it into my container okay this is kind of messy but some taking a teaspoon of this putting it in here and then I'm going to go ahead with the glue I'm just gonna take a little bit of the glue and I'm gonna add about a teaspoon of it as well I've never made it before so I'm not sure how much I'm supposed to put but yeah so I'm just gonna take my little brush I'm just gonna go ahead and mix that up and it looks like I need to put more glue right so I end up putting about I want to say three teaspoons of glue and one teaspoon of the charcoal so I'm gonna go ahead and start playing this to my face and we want to stay away from your eyes and also anywhere where you have hair like your eyebrows and if you have a lot of blackheads I believe I read that you want to apply more in that area so I'm gonna you want to apply a thick layer in that area so I'm gonna apply a thick layer right here since that's where I have most of my blackheads and if you only have blackheads in one ear in then you can just apply the mixture to that area alone I'm just gonna do the full face [Music] so what am I sure you are away from your eyebrows and also your hairline or going left with no edges and no eyebrows so I'm gonna try my best not to go too close and stay away from your eyes and I believe they said you want to leave this on for I think 20 minutes or so so this is what the mask looks like after I finished applying it to my face as you can see it's still wet it's only been about a few seconds so I'm just gonna let this sit for about 20 minutes and I'll be back this is what the mask looks like after 20 minutes and I'm trying to lift the edges and to be honest it's really painful at least for me so again I'm just trying to lift the edges being very gentle [Music] and reason why it's painful is because we have tiny little hairs all over our face some of us have more than others [Music] the more hair you have on your face the more painful it would be so you just want to take your time and you want to pull up so just examining the mask and this is what it looks like I found a little blackhead flash whitehead it was pretty big so I'm just continuing the same thing this area was really painful for me [Music] my eye started watering and twitching [Music] yeah the nose hurt a lot for me [Music] you just want to take your time and at this point I just said you know I forget I'm just gonna rip this thing right off so the math didn't make my face a little bit red and a little bit dry I just went a cloth with some warm water and then started patting my face with the cloth and then eventually I started wiping off the excess mass that didn't come off so here's a close-up of what my mass look like after I pulled it off you can really see all those tiny little whiteheads especially on this one you can really see the whiteheads it's pretty gross but it did an amazing job I'm really happy with my skin my skin felt really really soft and this one my skin looked like after removing the mess I didn't apply anything and if you look closely you can see all the little holes in my skin especially right here you can see a huge hole that's where the big Whitehead came out of and that's my skin is looking like after my first attempt I did it three more times and this is definitely going to be a part of my new regimen this mess was really easy to make and it only cost about ten bucks for me to buy the materials [Music] - dead on you remember anymore even CBS r Waldman I went to both stores and this was

which I used to create this hairstyle and that is the eco styler gel versus the gorillas snot gel this is my absolute favorite holy grail I use it all the time in this I've seen a lot of people use it and I remember coming across a couple years ago and the first time I saw was it has alcohol in it so I stayed away from it well I see a lot of natural hair girls using them and I thought I would give it a try to see you know if it's really good for your hair this is the final result after laying it down for about two hours and I am going to go out and come back and give you a final review of what it looks like after a couple hours but I would never recommend alcohol in your hair because alcohol dries out anything so it's going to dry out your hair and this has no alcohol in it that's why I love it II almost feel like it moisturizes in my hair sometimes but these are the two different products I created an Instagram poll just to know if you guys want to see the hype about you know which is better or what product is better for your natural hair so I went ahead to give you guys this review if you are inquiring about this full ponytail it's from my local beauty supply store for like $10 I can't help you with an online thing but it's just for my local beauty supply so I have a couple of videos about it hopefully one day I can come up with my own line of pole ponytails and stuff like that but for now the locally the local beauty supply store would have to do this so if you want to see how I achieved this hairstyle using these two product thank you part don't forget to comment like and subscribe thank you guys so much for the love and nice comments I get every day from you guys and really truly appreciate it and follow me on Instagram handle on the screen [Music] so after applying some living conditioner to my hair that's the only to not apply when I'm doing this hairstyle these are the two products I will be testing that's the eco styler gel that I regularly use and the guerrillas snap gel which I've never used before I purchased both for my local target and I think for about three dollars each I purchased each for three dollars so I'm going to read some of the things that's written on each product so let's really ingredients I hope I would do that so the ingredients is water good PvP I don't know what that is it has alcohol in it we just want to try to avoid it has alcohol in it and that's what I try to tell people all the time Gorillaz not Joe has alcohol in it okay it has alcohol in it it has I don't need to go on okay I could just stop after the alcohol and it says cautions do not ingest avoid eye contact how to use apply portion of Gorillaz nut gel to your fingers and style your hair to create the desired look that's it for guerrilla snot and then we're going to read eco styler the ingredient is water carb bummer you know I'm not even gonna read it so I'm gonna let you know that there's no alcohol in this one okay I can't pronounce some of their ingredients but I would let you I'll write it down in the description box below and I'll let you know there is no alcohol in it this is why I use it and directions apply to dry or wet hair work desired amount and yeah [Music] so I'm going to leave this on and go apply my makeup which takes about 10 to 20 minutes and would suit you see what it looks like after 10 to 20 minutes and I'm also going to go about my day and come back and share to find the result with you guys okay so I laid around for like two hours in my towel just you know being bored and I have my scarf on so I've added on for two hours now I'm gonna take it out to see what it looks like [Music] as soon as I'm going out I'm going to wear my fault ponytail and just attach it so far so far I love my eco styler gel always I always will but since this Gorillaz snot is a first for me my hair feels really stiff meanwhile over here my hair feels really really soft because this is a water-based gel but here my hair feels really it feels more stiff than this side I don't know how bad it's going to dry my hair because it has alcohol in it but I'm gonna go I'm going out with my friends it's currently 437 and we'll see how I holds up hey guys so it's I just got home and it is 12:00 midnight so I've had this for many hours I've had this for eight hours and this is what it looks like remember this is the Gorillaz in that side and this is the Eco stylist side over here and what I can technically tell you is this is definitely harder did this side it looks I don't know it looks good but it's just the fact that it's alcohol and there's that I don't like that's all its licks my head and I'm really good you know it's also it's harder to be hard okay this is also hard but this is definitely harder I can feel some softness in this and this is really stiff it's just a faggus there's alcohol in it I'm not sure if that's good for my hair you know alcohol dries up things so that's definitely gonna dry up my hair so I would still I don't know I don't know if I would recommend this but I would definitely recommend the eco styler gel I'm not going to be using this I did not like the consistency of it like it just creates a big mess so I would not recommend that at all so stick to whatever product that doesn't have alcohol in it and you're good to go so I hope you guys enjoyed this little demo and

gonna bother me oh this is gonna bother me I would not suggest this for a wash and go I would not suggest this twist out no long-term styling hi guys welcome back to my channel my name is ebony if you are new here then o welcome to my corner of the YouTube universe and if you're old here and then hey guys welcome back don't forget to click that subscribe button down below so you don't miss any more videos from me and thumbs up the video if you find it helpful and without further ado let's jump into it so today I'm gonna be doing something a little bit different I wanted to do a review and comparison but this is kind of more like a first impressions and comparison of the gorilla snack gels so I am gonna go over some details about the products this is the popular one here on YouTube among the natural community because it has the strongest hold and this one is also something I wanted to try out because it has a softer hold and it's just different my mom got these for me from Walmart I think there were three dollars each or like 350 each or something like that and something I forgot to mention is that it's 350 for eleven point nine ounces or almost twelve ounces really like I mean extremely affordable and something I didn't know about this brand is that it's Mexican or at least manufactured in Mexico the labels are in Spanish so mo coded gorilla is actually the name of the product which translates to gorillas not but it doesn't actually say that on here in English and a lot of other labeling on the packaging is in Spanish which is fine you know I took a bit of Spanish okay I don't know everything that it's saying on the back here and you can definitely read the directions online in English it's pretty Universal like using hair gel you know so yeah I wanted to try these out for you guys but this is my first time using them and I just wanted to see how they would perform so yeah let's jump into it hey guys this is one certain office and I'll twist out like huge and I'm just gonna part off sections here in the front they don't have to be exact look this is just basically the hair I'm gonna be working with I thought about using ponytail holders like scrunchies but then I ended up just going with bobby pins so I am wetting my hair here applying some Jamaican black castor oil I didn't want to put any more cream on my hair because I felt like it already had product in it from when I did my twist out and I'm just smoothing that in because I heard that this job was drying so I want to make sure something's underneath it so the yellow will be going on the right side but it's left here in the video and it's very tacky and sticky but going on to my hair was very smooth and slimy and I'm just smoothing that aim I am an equal-opportunity slicker so no hair left behind and taking some bobby pins to set it in place I did not use a brush I do not tie down my edges I didn't feel like it was necessary because I wasn't really going anywhere today so this is just keeping my hair out of my face and the red one is gonna be on the left but it shows as the right and it is not a sticky coming out the jar so I'm just applying that here making sure the sideburns are snatched and sitting that in place with a bobby pin as a well and this is what everything is looking like I'm just gonna go about my day but so far so good it looks kind of white here cuz of the shine from my lights but it does dry clear this is what the yellow gel looks like right out the bottom and this is what it looks like after its dried down for about five minutes so it gets a lot tackier and gummy ER and sticky and this is the red one right out the bottle it shows his white at first but it dries clear and this is how its acting after about five minutes as well also very tacky and sticky so these are the final results here I'll just lean in here this is what everything is looking like I have had this in my hair for about four hours so it is completely dry down or hardened this is the side where I had the red here on my left side and this is the side where I had the yellow and my hair is pretty hard because I didn't brush it in or because I didn't tie my edges down it's like the top layer of my hair is hard but up underneath it it's still pretty soft but this stuff is crunchy it was sticky going on but it is pretty crunchy now if you wanted something to get frozen in place I mean and stay there forever I would suggest the yellow one the red one still has a very similar hold again the yellow one this one is a hold of ten is what they're saying and the red one is a hold of nine so the hold is pretty similar I don't even know why he would make a hold that close together on there and if you look closely to the little guys on the labels hopefully you guys can see those but this guy his hair is standing completely up and this guy on here his hair is like not completely standing up and the yellow is the punk and the red is the rocker Oh or the rocker ooh wrecker oh I don't think one is better than the other unless it has to do with application going on I felt like this one wasn't as sticky but the hold is like almost exactly the same so I don't see the difference in the yellow versus the red in my hair again I also put the Jamaican black castor oil underneath so I'm sure that has a lot to do with it but in my head they're performing the same seeing is how I did put the Jamaican black castor oil underneath both of them and they still came out hard as a rock I would highly recommend that you put something anything moisturizing on underneath before you put in the gorilla snot I would also recommend that whenever you style your hair with this stuff only leave it in for like one or two days and then wash your hair like one or two days before wash day and then wash it out like I'm about to do my wash day is tomorrow so would not suggest leaving this in the long term but it works man it it's staying it is like a hardcore stand I would not suggest this for a wash and go I would not suggest this twist out no long-term styling no long-term styling I really probably would only do this to slicked down my edges I wouldn't use this on the rest of my hair either this stuff also left my hair very shiny because everything is so frozen it's just it's very shiny which I am pretty sure is one of the claims that I read on their website and I did not receive any flaking which is also one of the claims their website so that's a plus but this stuff has all of my baby hairs snatched them them things are snatched but for the price point and for the effectiveness of it I would still highly recommend this product if you're looking for something more natural I wouldn't suggest this but if you don't care then girl it is what it is now as far as a fragrance is concerned I don't remember what other product smells like this to me this is gonna bother me oh this is gonna bother me it smells exactly like another product I've tried before and I can't put my finger on it it is a light sweet perfume me it's not strong at all fragrance and after it gets in your hair like you it completely dries and you don't smell it whatsoever but they do both have the same fragrance I would highly suggest these I mean they are very effective they're extremely affordable they're pretty accessible and I mean it just it works the only thing is that I would do this for like instant styling something that you're gonna do for like a day no more than 24 to 48 hours and then wash it out getting this stuff off of my hands it seemed to have mixed with water like relatively easily and just like come right off so I don't think we're gonna have a problem on wash day trying to get this out but it is pretty sticky going on that much I will say this Mexican hair gel is pretty dope I like it I suggested I think you guys should go get some this will probably last me for the rest of time I don't know when it expires but it would probably expire before I used it all like I said this is like it's like hair insta freeze this of it like it will keep your hair every hair every baby hair every full grown hair every adult middle-aged postmenopausal elderly military hair in place okay and I'm not mad at it it's time around I probably would use a brush and set it with the scarf but because I wasn't going anywhere like special or specific today I didn't feel the need to do that so yeah you sparingly but would recommend anyway I hope you guys enjoyed the video I hope you enjoyed this first impression so don't we give

guys it's ray back with another video if you're new to my channel hey if you've already been here hey but let's get right into it today we're doing butterfly locks oh my gosh you guys loved my ceiling video so much that i went ahead and wanted to go ahead and do a full tutorial for you guys so here we go first we're going to be individually braiding the clients natural hair now let's talk parting real quick you don't want to do two small parts and you also want to make sure you window your parts this is very very very important do not put try not to put braids right on top of each other where it's not windowed the brick method the window method whatever you like to call it that is what we need to do because these locks are i want to say on the larger side but they're on the chunkier side you just don't want your client to be looking all scalpy and stuff you know so let's just you know make sure we got them looking nice and full today we are using water wave i like lulu tress i do not like freetress well that's a whole nother video for a whole another time but lulu stress water wave and also marley hair what i do is i take two pieces of the lulu dress and i fluff them out fluff them out split them up whatever you have to do make them nice and fluffy and then with my marley hair i take one piece of the marley hair and i split that in half and i use half a piece for each lock to braid down my base you want to make sure you have five to six packs of the water wave hair and about two packs of cuban twists should get you through an entire head so we're going to start by taking that half of piece of marley hair and we're going to braid that over her natural hair now you can do this the knotless method i don't like doing it the knotless method because the hair pieces are uneven and that just becomes a headache to braid especially if the person has thin hair so i just braid it over it takes a little tiny bit longer but it's not that bad so we're going to start by crocheting your water wave hair on into the braid and you're going to have you know two pieces on the opposite side of the braid and what you're going to want to do is pull the hair so that one side one piece is pretty short really short you're going to want it shorter than the marley hair and you're just going to grab that the marley hair and the short piece in one hand i'm showing you the length here and you're going to start wrapping and so you're gonna wrap like a regular faux loc about three or four times i smooth it over with my thumb and i just you know wrap it nice and tight for the first couple of times now y'all go easy on me because i look a little awkward trying to do this because i'm trying to do it in a way that you guys can see it well on camera but now i'm doing the thumb method what you want to do is you want to loosen your grip you don't want to wrap it tight that is the key when it comes to your locs being able to move do not wrap it tight wrap it nice and loosely you want to stick your thumb into the hair like you could do it in the middle you could do just a little bit i kind of just randomize it and you want to wrap it when you stick your thumb in and then when you when you're wrapping it with your thumb in it i pull i like to pull my thumb up a little bit off of the lock so that it gives it that butterfly that that loop coming out of the lock and as you can see i do it pretty randomly i don't do it like every time but you want to do it often you don't want to do it too sparsely because then it'll start looking too neat and you don't want it to be too neat you want it to look a little messy and and stuff so also please remember to loosen your grip because i kept tightening my grip i have a habit of doing that from doing regular locks and just just make sure you're wrapping loosely now let's talk length so you want to make sure because i see a lot of people start trying to do this style and they in their in their locks end up being a lot uneven and things like that so you want to make sure you're using a guide you can use the lock next to it you can use the lock you started with but you want to make sure you use a guide and what i do we're going to do the the my loop method and from my last video and we're wrapping wrapping wrapping then we get to the end we wrap it four or five times like a regular faux loc separate a small piece of hair fold the rest of the hair up and use that small piece of hair to secure it and wrap it around then you take some nail glue you secure it with that and wrap the rest of that small piece around and you're secure that lock is not going anywhere i promise and you cut that excess hair off and you are good to go i don't like the whole um just wrap it back up method not with this hair because it's softer it's much softer than spring to his hair the curl is looser so it does it's not going to hold as well if you try to do that with this lulutress hair or any water wave hair for that matter so i'm going to show you guys again how i do it i'm just going to take that uh marley hair and start sorry i'm all in the camera uh don't come for me i'm i'm sorry i didn't mean to but we're braiding it over the braid the natural hair we don't braid it we don't need to braid it all the way down you just spray it about an inch down when you add the marley hair oh here i'm showing you how i parted it in the back i used that round method and i part ear to ear in the back and i made two rows in the back so that's her back that's how the back of her hair looks why did i say back so many times anyway just watching um just go ahead and watch and watch me do this again and i'm going to talk a little bit about parting again we're going to talk about this round method so a good rule of thumb for me when i do the round method of course it depends on the person size of the person's head because if somebody has a big head you're going to have to do more parts because you just you just don't want them to look sparsey um i do a rule of thumb from the parting from the top of the ear all the way up it should be one two three four five rows about five rows five to six rows depending on the size of the person's head from the top of the ear from the from the top of the ear up you're always going to do two rows in a bag i do about two or three rows in the back but from the top of the ear up is going to be five or six rows that's a good rule of thumb for your sizing if you want to do them this size of course if you want to do the smaller then absolutely make them smaller but that's how i like to do them [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] also i forgot to mention earlier when you're doing the lymph you can see here that that one that i'm doing right now is a little bit longer than the one that i'm using as a guide you want to do it like that you want to make it about a half an inch longer when you're wrapping because when you go to loop it when you go to turn it up it's going to get shorter so you want that to match like that so when you're wrapping it down you're going to wrap it down a little bit further than that then that one that is already done next to it so that when you're looping it up it matches is the same length and you're good to go and it's not like a bunch of different lengths all throughout the head last thing i want to mention before i go is why i use water wave hair instead of spring twist i like to use water wave because spring twist tends to give me too much frizz like i don't like that it gives me way too much frizz when i'm trying to do these locks i like my locs to be nice and soft and pretty and not really frizzy so the water wave hair works so much better for that and this was the finished product tell me what you guys think in

such as vitamins and minerals and on seeds of gold this week we'll take a close look at oranges this help in proper functioning of the body often times people are advised to use fruits for a healthier body and mind coming up on seeds of gold the way people put it they'll put farming to be for the poor for the failures those ones all failed to achieve I am doing farming and I am benefiting in one year you are reaping not less than hundred million is that for the poor we are here to learn about growing oranges don't move the show just got started [Music] today on seeds of gold would take to surah t the land of oranges and other sytrus fruits after cruising through Zarate town we head straight to ghwarri sub-county in Auto guru village where Elemis a great service limited is located mr. ela leu Moses our host today is ready to take us farming let's now focus on the process of how mother trees of oranges come into existence most especially with the new varieties on the market as recommended by the government I am mister Allah Loomis's who is the managing director aloma cyclic services limited these are the oranges the ceilings were planting for the transplant for mother trees ela leu was not always a fruit farmer he started out wearing chickens and then his life took a new direction when he joined nods this is when he ventured into fruit family I was somewhere and I just got to birth this to cheek to chicken just to birds and that is the beginning of this company yeah so from there I began hatching now full swing so that when I exposed me that is where now nuts came in they kept on a devising during a group to like you in the nuts when I do in the nuts I realized siblings also was also one of the good businesses their mothers had gone there who the poultry but I realized this was there then I began incorporating the seedling thing [Music] lu lu will now give us an overview of the various stages of growing oranges so naturally our starting point is the nursery these seeds we extract from the lemon the real lemon we use yeah because the lemon is a resistant to desire arranged diseases so the lemon is much much resistant so what we do we get the lemon seed we extract the seed from the lemon then why we plant the seed put them in a nursery then we transplant them to now their ports like this ones that is after like one month then from there you maintain them in the ports till when they are like each month is when we do the body depending on the management but when it's above sixty centimeters the root stock is a lemon we get a scion from the recommended variety that is for the Hamline species the Hamlin variety so we get a scion then now we make kind of a teacher into here make kind of a tea joint then we fix that say on then our in we tie it with a some Peppa yes I'm police in the pepper after two weeks or three weeks we untied a pepper that we use for bedding we cut off the root stock like now this upper part we cut it off to allow allow desire now to germinate then we keep on maintaining them pruning spraying the annually exactly what is a Sian so what we are talking about is I answer as I own is this one this that germinating point that one you are seeing so what we do we remove this this leaf then we cut that one okay we cut it with a blade and that is the one we fix on the rootstock untie you tie it for two to three weeks you are untied at a pepper then you cut off little stroke now you will remain with the purely assume it is our root stock you tie it you cut even they had that growing part of little stock but with a Zion now tie down the root stock now after cutting here you untie this one the roots desire that you planted on the root stock will now begin growing it will be germinate and that one will come as harmony if you use the design of a Hamlin will be humbling if you use the valence here it will be balanced here if you use the hammer washing to a novel to the Washington lemon is very instrumental in orange growing it oftentimes acts as a root stalk it is a special plant indeed ela leu takes us through the next stage in this intricate process and that is grafting and budding this grafting also on the ones which are grafted is almost the same thing one less for us to decide we use designs by the other ones okay they also they use graft sake do the science still but they cut theirs they cut some long stem like assuming this one assuming this is a stem they remove all these leaves all these then now it is cut at some angle then they cut the roots tacos are some angle then it is joined then they tie so that is drafting so when the upper one survives because they use the rootstock which is resistant and basically dars of a lemon the biggest capital I see in this project the biggest capital I see is the passion a passion treat they love to fami you love it that is the only biggest asset and a capital that I think someone can have because you can have even millions of shillings but if you don't have the passion you cannot make it [Music] there are a variety of oranges in this nursery with different characteristics the varieties in this nursery are Hamlin and Valencia Hamlin is a small sized orange but fruits very much very sweet then Valencia is a slightly bigger also fruits and more do you see Hamlin has a smaller leaves the smaller in size and curvy and yet Valencia has a slightly larger leaves you can see how these ones are slightly bigger they leaves a bigger than yellow one these actually start bearing fruits slightly different like like this ones which are budded you can begin realizing fruits after three years from the time of planting now if you took this and planted by the third year you'll begin realizing fruits but they will begin giving fruits in a low yield but as they grow the bigger the tree the better depending on the management on how the farmer will manage it manage it on the ground but at least we expect it to last something to do 30 years yes if well managed animals elaborates on how farmers can have options on how to go about this process but fast how is the soil prepared like this once I put the seed but what most people do they first have them in the nurseries then when they're like 1 month 1 month 2 month you pick them and have them imports depending on the system you are taking if you are taking having them in the nursery you really clear your nursery you dig it very well make sure that the soil is well prepared the particles then you try to get manual you man you are at the city bed we are going to have you seen the man you ate very well make sure you have some water you make sure it is at least watered after putting the seed you mulch you cover it with the grass I knew and you keep on watering and in one month time twelve three weeks you receive the immunity after germination when you see like a majority like say 80% has germinated you remove the grass which is the mulch yes this here is used to cool down the temperatures of the seedlings in preparation for the transplanting process and transportation to the main garden all that and more when we return [Music] [Music] let's now get down to real business if I have one acre of land how many of these seedlings do I need Africa you can have even over 200,000 because this one is not even half is just something like a quota half an acre you can we've got 500,000 if you have them on a port slightly way this one sir so at what point are these seedlings ready to be transferred to the main garden the science of this is just regulating the heat like now this one is giving 70% like they will event you can fill it seven the percentage so it gives a cool environment for the ceilings that really promotes the growth and also allows light there's a difference between this one the under once under the shade where it is the other side you will first give it time of like a week for them to stabilize so we picked them from the other side now they're here so these ones are now ready you can take ten away this one does not have anything that has gone so this is how they are now so these ones you can take it in well if you want to take them to Juba they will have no problem this one's a totally pruned you remove all the rootstock that anything that comes from the root stock you only maintain these upper ones which is the real variety that we need if it is like Valencia you maintain them the same one the same but is that these are the terminations like now this one today you find these are fast shoot which is all now we are having the second shoot so these ones are now ready for transplanting to their mother garden this one is a eight month eight to ten months from this point of their pot up to their bad this is two feet those are the standard measurements we use here but other regions I don't know how to use them but we use a list to fit this one this is two feet so if you are digging your hole you make sure now like from this to this should also be something like this and this one so in other words what you need the hole that you need is something like this by the time we reach the two feet you ready you see you even see that right there brown and had you see so this is what we fight hard to make sure we remove so we remove this one completely till you see that it is two feet deep so now when this one is off what you do you gift get this off the soil now up there Lomond yes you bring it back okay the soft soil because this one this one keeps for water retains water so you bring this you leave it at some point then you add your manual now if you add the manual as you are planting can either pour water first or you can plant then pour water no basically for us were not actually using those like any peak is for us here we deal basically only yeah that's why we can go for maybe the droppings the chicken droppings you have there the manual a dang of course the one which has decomposed no the one which is fresh okay now with this one you don't plant it with a pepper so you remove there pepper after the pepper you will recover you only cover where their port is so this is where you have you have your Sydney make sure it is a strong enough so now in the process you'll find that you've created kind of a basin around this you see that this is kind of a basin so when it rains you'll find water we like roll accumulate goes down to their hole with the soft soil so you will find that the retaining capacity of this hole is better than somebody who has only digs then you plant after planting you can water your sibling [Music] even before the oranges you plant come to maturity you can start making money right from the seedling stage apparently there is a clear market for these seedlings visca you have like three common markets the individuals who just come and buy because they are planting the Madiga in step planting their their farms - we have NGOs that also buying to distribute to farm us three and the biggest buyer that is the government that is nuts and a operation worth question yeah each of the lines here has about 450,000 seedlings he has sold at 1000 to 1500 uganda shillings supplies that include transport and taxes then go for 3,500 uganda shillings [Music] if we take a look at 120,000 siblings at 1,000 each per year one is able to get a reasonable amount of money basically farming is not a bad thing but the mindset the way people put it they'll put farming to be for the poor for the failures those ones are failing to achieve that is the biggest problem we have in this country and more so with the youth that we have everyone is a striving once you get a white-collar you someone wants to be smart so they look at this ones like for the poor and for those guys who have never gone to school but that is not a case where the funny like for example I am doing a lot I am doing it but I am doing for me and I am benefiting you've done my estimate now if these are like 120 say just take it at an average of 1,000 in one year you are reaping not less than hundred million is that for the poor I mean that is that is money how many offices how many people with white-collar jobs can earn a hundred million in a year very few so if you happen to have some small thing like this is not even an acre just a quarter and besides you will be doing your other things [Music] there is more to this firm than meets the eye including new technology in orange production all that and more next week on the show [Music]", "WWr5jd6Fztw": "[Music] good night

Make a papier-mache mask for Halloween, a\nmasquerade party, Carnival time, or anytime! You will need An old tablecloth A work smock\nA clean, empty plastic gal. jug, labels removed Strong scissors A craft knife An elastic band\nNewspaper White computer paper Unbleached flour or glue Acrylic paint and decorations. Step 1. Cover your workspace with an old tablecloth\nor sheets of newspaper, and wear something to protect your clothes, like a smock. Step 2. With strong scissors, cut the plastic jug\nin half lengthwise. Turn the jug upside-down: The handle will\nserve as the mask's nose. Cut holes for your eyes and mouth with a craft\nknife. Cut a small hole on each side of the mask,\nat ear level, for an elastic band. Step 3. Tear newspaper and white computer paper into\nstrips about one inch by six inches. Shredding the paper by hand works better than\ncutting it. You\u2019ll need enough pieces to cover your\nmask with three layers of newspaper and one layer of computer paper, plus some extra paper\nfor molding facial features. Step 4. Whisk two cups of flour and one cup of water\ninto a paste, adding a bit more of either, if needed, to reach a gluey consistency. You can also use glue thinned out with water. Step 5. One by one, dip a newspaper strip into the\npaste, shake off the excess, and lay it flat against the mask horizontally, taking care\nnot to cover the holes. Overlap each strip with a new one. When you've finished the first layer, let\nit dry completely before putting on the next one. This time, apply the strips vertically. If you\u2019re putting away your project for\nthe night, store the unused paste in the refrigerator. The next day, microwave it for one minute\nbefore using. Step 6. Apply the strips for the third layer horizontally. After you\u2019ve applied three layers, mold\nsome of the newspaper strips into features, like cheekbones and eyebrows. Step 7. Make the last layer out of the torn computer\npaper, applying the strips vertically. The white paper will give you a blank canvas\nfor creating your character. If you live in a damp climate, you can dry\nthe mask on a lightly oiled cookie sheet in an oven set to warm. Check on the mask after about 30 minutes. Step 8. When the mask is completely dry, decorate\nit with paint, feathers, glitter, sequins, beads, fabric, rhinestones, or whatever will\nmake it your own! Did you know At 12 to 16 feet tall and several\nfeet wide, the Igbo _ijele_ mask is one of the largest ceremonial masks made in Africa.", "3FFWYE7evzo": "[Music] hey dancers welcome back to my channel today I like to share with you how I made this really beautiful but inexpensive wall art interested then just keep watching I'm starting off with this value pack of 16 by 20 inch canvases that I picked up from Michaels here I'm using painters tape that I picked up from the Dollar Tree to make a geometric design on my first canvas [Music] [Music] next I'll be randomly coloring each of those sections with paints that are already had as well as this glass glitter and the color vintage that I picked up from Michael's as well [Music] to paint each small section I'm using these cosmetic wedges from Dollar Tree [Music] to add my glass liver I'm using tacky glue [Music] [Music] once my paint was completely dry I removed the excess glitter and returned it to the original container I then carefully removed my painters tape [Music] to clean up my lives I'm using this acrylic paint in the color wicker white [Music] I'll out my white paint to completely dry before moving on to the next step I then use the combination of tacky glue and water to help seal my paint as well as my glass glitter [Music] [Music] [Music] I then set this piece aside to dry while that dried I painted these towering wood pieces that I picked up from the Dollar Tree with my black acrylic paint [Music] and when those glutes were completely dry I use them to frame my canvas here I'm adding two blocks to each corner of the canvas and because I didn't have any way of cutting these blocks to an exact fit I decided to evenly spaced some and add them around the canvas as well of course you could always go to Lowe's or Home Depot to have some wood cut to frame out your canvas but this solution only cost me a dollar and it gave my canvas a very modern look [Music] [Music] for my second design I'm using this really pretty Z Gallerie painting and this painting that I saw at HomeGoods as inspiration [Music] so the first thing I did was paint my canvas with this champagne gold paint that you guys have seen me use on several projects [Music] once that paint was completely dry I used a metal ruler and a pen to add lines to my canvas in a pattern similar to a starbursts [Music] I then covered each of those lives with tacky glue [Music] [Music] as you can see I wasn't too concerned about having perfect lines but I did use this small skewer to help thin out and clean up my lines as needed [Music] I've been allowed my glue to dry overnight the following day I added four coats of this pearl white craft smart paint to my canvas I picked up this white pearl paint from Michaels for less than $2 it may look silver on camera but it's definitely a pearl white and it complements the chef angle color wheel once my pearl white paint was completely dry I added more of the chef angle paint to make my starburst [Music] [Music] [Music] next I mix silver and gold glitter together to give me more of a champagne color and add that to my painting as well I'm rubbing the glitter in just a bit while the gold paint is still wet I then allow this to dry I've been added that remaining glitter mixture to the tacky glue water mixture that I had left over from my first project I then added that mixture to my design [Music] I ended up with a bit more gold than I had wanted so here I'm adding just a bit more of the white pearl paint on top [Music] and here's the finished look [Music] [Music] I started off with a 16 by 20 inch canvas because I wasn't sure that I would be able to mimic this high-end look but I think that my painting turned out really pretty and it cost me just a few dollars to make which of our two paintings do you like this are you into the modern look or are you all glam let me know down in the comments I hope you enjoyed this week's video if so please like comment and

They have money and can buy sodas We used to go to a place called AA where we engage in prostitution We get something like KSh 500 that we give our mothers to buy food I turned into prostitution after I lost my father I had to look for money to pay for my siblings school fees and other basic needs We hang out there as we wait for clients who come to pick a lady of their choice A clients could ask for a number of rounds The rounds vary depending on their preference, some would ask for 2 another 3 We charge KSh 500 for 2 rounds and KSh 1,000 for 3 rounds How did you feel the first day you went to that place? I was feeling ashamed I was even scared of leaving the house during the day Do you use protection? Yes I always use protection. I feel lucky because it has never burst You have never been scared that it might burst? I am always careful in fact I am the one who helps my clients insert the condoms just to be sure There are some clients who refuse to pay us for our services Some would give less cash and another will physically abuse you and not give you anything What is the highest amount you have ever received? Just KSh 1,000 For one whole night? For 4 rounds What do you use this money for? I give it to mum to buy food and even pay school fees for my siblings She has never asked you where you get the money from? I can't disclose to her Sometimes I feel like quitting so that I can start a business of something that is constructive I wanted to be a doctor in future Then what happened I dropped out of school because there was no school fees What is your advice to other young ladies involved into this kind of activity It's a risky business They can get infected with various sicknesses, they should just stop If they can get sponsors to pay school fees for them then it would be so good They should not follow our example even though we never chose this kind of life What kind of activities do you involve yourself in? I look for plastics and sell to make a living You told me a while ago that you used to sell bhang, where were you operating that business from? Some ground around here How much were you making in a day? KSh 5000 and my employer would give me KSh 800 So why did you stop? I was caught and he ran away leaving me in trouble The authorities needed money but I did not have any because I had already given him My name is Rehema Mwikali. I am 29 years old and I have 5 children I gave birth to my first child while I was 14 years old I dropped out of school after completing class 8 because there was no school fees I hustle for my children through prostitution So that I can get money to take care of my children Some clients are hostile they turn abusive after sleeping with you How much do you charge It depends but mostly KSh 50 or KSh 100 Once I get the money I buy food for my children Since the money is little the elder one goes out to hustle for the younger ones Especially when I am a sleep after drinking Do you smoke? Yes I do How does that help you? I smoke to repress memories of my actions and to gain courage because I am hustling for my kids You basically don't want to be haunted? It helps me see my actions as something just minor Have you ever sent your elder children to buy you alcohol? Yes even cigarettes They know where to find it? Yes What did you wish to become in future? I wanted to be a salonist, if I get that job I would feel happy Do you know how to plait? Yes What kind of styles do you know? I know how to do braids, blow dry, how to apply chemical I drink to avoid depression because I don't like the kind of life my children are living How do you think your children get affected by your actions They are affected so much, they get annoyed at times and pray for me to stop The other day I entered the house and they forced me to sit down before they started praying for me What were they saying They asked God to change my life so that I can stop drinking How did you feel? I felt really bad and started crying What kind of life do you wish for your children? I want them to have a good life like the other children so that when I see them I feel proud My name is Amos Omondi Abong'o I have been living here since the year 2000 I wasn't happy about some of the activities that youth were being involved in here I started training both young girls and boys Most of them are school drop outs who have been abusing drugs Others were involved in prostitution So I made sure they engage in vigorous exercise while in the pitch So that when they leave this place they are so exhausted they simply go to rest Some of them don't even have a place to live So I decided to accommodate them here when they come for training Our small organization is called Mukuru Talent - Ni Sisi Chapter There's a lot of peer pressure in this slum coming from different youth groups When they are somewhere idling they influence each other negatively If we find a place within this area and build a resource center Complete with accommodation because some of them have no place to live It would be an amazing idea to put up such a structure here so that they can all live here away from home where they can easily escape it would play a big role in changing the lives of youth in this slum", "LsKOzrymxZE": "for last 1012 years I'm doing Editions all over the world I have never filmed my expeditions because of course it was almost a secret and it's time to show the world how we start from scratch how does a seed company should work and where does he obtained his stuff that is grown outside that's why we decided to go to all different regions to show where the original Malawi gold comes from [Music] [Applause] how are you yeah very good this isn't a good care of a sir Malhar is a very very special African country I guess what makes it special is the wildlife the beautiful scenery but most importantly the people it's one of the poorest countries in the world I think it's the number in the top 20 of the HRD P which is the highly indebted poor countries also very friendly country they marketed as the warm heart of Africa one of the reasons that I already for a long time wanted to visit Malawi is that I grew up in Africa and I'm a strain hunter and I know that one of the best sativas grow in Malawi [Music] an expedition like this especially Malawi is only possible with four-wheel drive cars because it's rainy season it range between two and four hundred mils a month I am I had I think 25 phone calls and 15 emails with the manager of a measly long-wear and in the end we arrived at the airport and instead of it Toyota Hilux 4x4 they gave me the Corolla the long walk the longest walk the old weeks for nothing we get a one and a half to two hours walk program officially we start walking we get to the first location we find the group that is supposed to guide us to the second location and on the way we start discovering that the two hours are becoming three the flat side area is that where it is and the three hours are becoming four is it up the top or in west work all the way down to the rhythm and the heels are getting steeper and steeper and steeper look the most important thing to know is that if you are not sure about something you have to let us know tell us we take you're not sure it's fine but don't let us think it's one hour and then after one hour it's another 45 minutes and then after 45 minutes it's another hour and a half because it doesn't work so watch the whole day the walk was like longer than six seven hours and we had to go back in the dark and we did it make it sometimes that's what it takes it can't always go good sometimes you have to just keep walking for nothing [Music] good morning this is Franco I'm waiting I'm part of the crew that he's waiting for this to four-by-four sir city and how high are the plant high in the second day we started driving and meet a very very old contact of me called Isaac he brought us to a really tiny tiny village high up in the mountain and you set up for a while talk to the local people made our connection see this plant this plant here is ganja plug John it's his plan the minty one the minty one yes in a sativa and then we only had to walk 500 meters down into the bush and there was a huge huge field of five six hectares in Malawi [Music] yeah [Music] Sammis coke man we find your stop make [Music] [Music] some serious really the size of the crystals short Shyamalan unbelievable no it's marvelous this is very good this generation to catch a sheet now you don't see this in Africa normally so many Russian on the plans how many people you need for this to work because there's a lot of work 15 people you have from the village to clear all the weeds and that field really impressed me because it was for me the first time that I had the chance to see the Malawi Gold growing in such a scale so I could really see many special characteristics of the plants on a big scale on a good volume for statistical watch this is monkeys don't eat heavier and gets told it's funny and the baboons is a problem they take a lot or because I can see everywhere a little bit baboon dementia they then they make party if you go into an area like Malawi and you meet a lot of people you see grows for 20 years you see grows for 10 years and she grows for one or two years most of the time they are a little bit scared and not allowed to say to you from the family or the community how long they grow as a straight hunter you really have to make sure that you know who is doing what because often you can see that the not so good grower is also the guy who hasn't obtained the very good seats too gross next year crop dramas in Malawi are very resourceful people they are very poor people there are people who have used everything they can to maintain their family and the children there is one why the quote marker is that this coke yeah it is rare just like code you can't find it in other way or another can and this with just a little you can take much man that words makes them good growers the need for survival these guys don't know nothing they don't know to speak English almost but they know things about the plants that are pretty amazing did you ever try to be fertilizer to the plant yeah that the talk all the users fertilizer yeah some of them are already so advanced they actually pull their mails some of them are so advanced that they actually know they have two phenotypes in their field even if they don't know the meaning of the word phenotype in English hey when did you plan this when did you plant anywhere between 20 January and when you harvest May May 20 May 4 months yeah so you for most of harvest you can", "mrYBI9ilPoA": "(upbeat music) - Is every single Ray's Week episode going to likely start with\nsome sort of Target haul? Possibly. What can I say? Today is Friday. I went to Target while Ziya was at school, after I finished at my work for the day. Most of this stuff is not for me. 99% of the stuff is not for me. So let me explain. So here's the rundown. A few things are going on, like within my little friend group, which I feel like I haven't\nreally talked about this or explained this. I feel like this kinda needs\nto be its own podcast episode. Stay tuned for the podcast coming soon, depending on when you're\nwatching this video. But I've been really happy lately because I actually feel like I have such a good friend group, like a local friend group,\nwhich has never been the case. So last time that I felt like I had a good friend group like this was honestly maybe in high school. I had my little local friend group and we all obviously\nlived in the same area, so we were able to do things together, but there was a long stretch of time, like especially after college,\nlike after I had Ziya, I just felt like I didn't\nhave a solid friend group. My best friends were in a different city and I just didn't feel like\nI had that many friends or different types of friends who were into different\nthings, but now I do and it's been really nice to\nbe able to hang out with them and connect them and celebrate\neach other's achievements and I even work with some of my friends, like Taylor and Rell. They are some of my best friends but Rell is my photographer, Taylor is my social media manager and then I also have Sadie, Kanesha. I have Ogden. Ogden is a o.g, and I have, Daisha and Age who\nhave always lived in Dallas, so like four hours away, which\nwas always kind of a bummer, but Daisha is moving back to Austin. We're both from Austin. So anyway, I have this whole friend group. Things have been going\ngreat in the friend group and we've all been\nhaving really good news. We've all been achieving things\nor reaching certain goals or just different things. So anyway, long story kinda short, I went to Target because\nI wanted to basically like get gifts for everybody, and I'm planning on giving\nthem the gifts tomorrow because tomorrow I'm\nhosting a seafood boil, dinner party celebration at my house, for just the immediate circle\nof friends that I listed. With COVID and everything,\nwe still have to be careful, but we just keep\neverything within our pod, we get tested regularly, we make sure that we're\nbeing safe and careful. Everybody works from home\nand everything like that, but I still have been\nwanting to figure out like little ways to be able to entertain and like have my friends\nover and just do nice things for my friends and be able\nto hang out with them, cause I'm like, I have friends\nnow, who are here in my city, I wanna entertain. I wanna use this house, use this kitchen, so I've been trying to think\nof little things to do. So, if you guys did not see the video that me, Sadie and Rell did a while back where we did a seafood boil, that actually turned out bomb A.F. Okay, the food was bomb,\nit was a fun experience, it was fun to make, fun to eat it. So we're like, let's do it again but let's like invite everybody this time, and let's just celebrate all the things that have been going on\nwithin our friend circle. So I'm hosting tomorrow and I decided to get\neverybody little gifts. So, the rundown is, first things first, it's Sadie's birthday coming up. So for Sadie's birthday, I got her this really\ncute coral pink purse and it also comes with the cross body. So inside of her purse, I\nam going to be packing it with all types of travel\ntoiletries essential. So like the little mini shaving\ncream, bodywash, mouthwash, toothbrush, razer, makeup wipes, deodorant, Advil, hand sanitizer, all the little mini travel\nthings that you need. So obviously the main\ngift is the purse itself, but I wanted to pack it with something, so it would be something else with it, and the reason why I wanted\nto do the little travel stuff is because we as a friend\ngroup are actually going on a little vacation and it's kind of to celebrate\nher birthday as well, so I thought this would be perfect for her to kind of just already\nhave her little toiletries together for the trip that\nwe're gonna be taking. I don't wanna say where we're\ngoing or anything just yet, stay tuned, and yes, I know, there's still a pandemic\ngoing on, but don't worry we are being as safe as\npossible, as smart as possible, following all the guidelines,\nstaying to ourselves, sticking to ourselves. We just want to go out and enjoy nature, and enjoy the scenery. We not trynna be out in the\nclubs, in the restaurants and be around people. We are trynna go outside and enjoy just a break in that sense. Then I got a whole second set of all those toiletries\nthat I just pulled out. I have two sets of 'em because for Daisha, I got her all the toiletries and I got her this really\ncute pajamas/lounge wear set. So it's these little sweat pant-shorts, super soft and fleecy, with a matching crop\ntop-sweatshirt thingy, so cozy, really cute. It's got like this nude,\nleopard print on it. So pajamas and toiletries for\nDaisha because she is moving and we always joke about how my guest room is really her room. So whenever she's here, she\ngets to stay in the guest room and so I thought it was\ncute to kind of be like, \"Here's your pajamas and your toiletries,\" to keep in my guest room because you're gonna be living here now, so you're gonna be over\nhere all the time now, so you might as well\njust have a set of stuff, spend the night stuff, at my house, 'cause you're gonna be here. And it's just to like say congrats, because the reason why she's moving is because she got a new job. So I wanted to get her a little\nsomething to celebrate that and say congrats and kind of\nplay off of the little theme or whatever, so that's for Daisha. Then for my other friend, Kanesha, she just got her own apartment, moved out, got her own first apartment\nand got a new job, so I wanted to get her, kind of more like a house warming gift. Everybody's getting new jobs,\nnew apartments, birthday, celebration, all types\nof stuff, so I'm like, \"I'm getting something for everybody.\" So for Kanesha's house warming, I got her this really cute mug. And then the way I'm gonna pack it up, I got her all these nice\nwooden kitchen utensils, which I have some of these\nand I really like them, they're cute, but they're also functional, so I was thinking to cut\nit in here like this, and then I got her a little basket, 'cause you always just need little baskets and stuff around the house. So I was thinking to pack it like this, like a little gift basket\nand put tissue paper and put a ribbon around it,\nlike a little DIY house warming, kitchen gift basket. The last two people are Taylor and Rell. So Taylor Rell and I, what\nwe're celebrating mostly is just the success that we've\nseen through me bringing them onto my team to help me with my Instagram, I just reached 350,000\nfollowers, which is a milestone, a goal for me, I wasn't really\ngaining followers very much before working with them,\nbut since working with them, I hit 350K, I landed, I think\nI said in my other vlog, I landed like some really big\nbrand deals for Instagram, and they've just been really\nhelping me take things to the next level, so that's what I'm celebrating\nat the seafood boil tomorrow and I want to celebrate them for helping me do that. So I wanted to get them a\nlittle something for that. So for Rell, my photographer, I got him this camera strap, sling thing, it's a special camera strap that supposed to make it more comfortable\nand easier to use your camera, 'cause he has the big DSLR camera with the big lenses and stuff, so I thought he could\nget some use out of that. And then for Taylor, her color is green, all green everything, so\nwhen I saw this, first of all it's so cute snakeskin and like\na suede with a gold zipper, it is a tech organizer, so it\nholds your charging cables, your earbuds and more. And I feel like you could just use it for whatever you wanna use it for. She's coder bae, she's\nmy social media manager, so I just thought this\nwas like the cutest thing and if she wants to use it for toiletries or makeup or whatever, that's fine too but I just thought a tech organizer for my tech girl and it's in her brand\ncolors, it matches her office and everything, so I thought\nthat was really cute, so that's for Taylor. And then I did get two things\nfor myself, only two things, okay, I got myself this purse. I don't know why I was\njust really drawn to it, it does come with the cross-body strap but I really mostly like it for the, wait! Oh you can. (sighs) I was about to be mad because I don't really want\nthe long strap, (laughs) I like it with just the little short strap it's got gold hardware,\nit's a unique little shape, cute little purse, looks\nkinda designer, right? And I also just got a makeup\neraser, little towel thing. Mostly things for other people,\nso I don't really feel bad. All right, so it is Saturday\nmorning, still morning, got up and went to Costco\nand H-E-B this morning, I forgot my phone, my\ncamera, everything at home, but went to get the goods\nfor the seafood boil. This is only part of the\ningredients I was in charge of getting the seafood, so I\ngot all this shrimp, lobster, crab, two different kinds of crab, two different kinds of\nshrimp, a lot of stuff, everybody else is pitching in and bring in all the other ingredients, I also got a couple bottles of my favorite Kool-Aid\nwine, children's wine, as I like to call it. This one is one of my favorites, (giggles) and this passion-mango one. I also got butcher paper this\ntime, 'cause that is something that I didn't have last time\nto just be able to lay it out, I'm thinking I'm just going\nto cover the whole countertop, with butcher paper so we can\nlike dump with the seafood out and everybody could just sit\nin a line and eat like that. Party shelf is dwindling\ndown quite a bit actually, finally I always end up with\nall these bottles left over from different parties\ncause I don't drink them on a normal day, uh, we\ngot some tequila, some rum, some red wine, champagne,\nwe got some whiskey, we got some stuff, I also have\nthese four Locos, (laughs) leftover from my 2000's themed party, I'm sure nobody wants this, these were really just\nlike for props, I mean, \"Hey, if you wanna get\ncrazy, we got this.\" When I got back from the\nstore, I had the mobile carwash and detailing people come\nover to my house to do my car, highly recommend a service like this, to get a deep, deep clean\nright in your driveway. 'Cause I know I highly messing up my car, that backseat be destroyed! It's super convenient 'cause\nyou could just be like, \"Hey, I'm gonna be home from\nthis time, or this time, can y'all come over and do my car?\" So while I'm here doing whatever,\nmy car is getting washed and they do a super good job too. 'Cause before when I took my\ncar to the detailing place, then you gotta sit there and\nwait, you know what I mean? You're at the place just like... So this way I can at least be\nat my house being productive while they do that and I can\nalso keep an eye on them, like y'all, y'all missed a spot. (giggles) Honestly, days like today make me feel like a successful person. What does success mean to me? What does reaching my goals mean to me? It means being able to\nhave the financial freedom, to have the mobile car wash\npeople come to my house. Having the financial freedom, to go to Costco and buy seafood,\nto invite my friends over, to celebrate my friends' accomplishments, and things like that. That's what makes me feel successful. It's little things like\nthat, like being able to have a housekeeping service coming\nto my house and like help me take care of this house that I invested in and just different things like\nthat, it's not really about buying a whole bunch of fancy\ncars, and fancy clothes, and designer this, and designer\nthat, and diamond jewelry, and designer bags or stuff like that. It's more like the services\nand the experiences that I'm able to pay for\nit, that's what makes me feel successful, I guess\nthat's what financial freedom feels like to me, being able\nto like do certain things versus just by material things. Which, I mean, if you wanna\nbuy some material things, that's on you, nothing wrong with that, we all have different\nthings that make us happy, I don't know why I'm telling\ny'all this, (giggles) but just a little positive\nthought of the day, I'm very grateful for all of this. But y'all, I was in the\nprocess of actually trying to clean up and organize my glam room, and then I came in here and\ndid a PR on boxing last night, so now I just completely re-destroyed... \"Bougie! You better not be eating that paper.\" But yeah, I completely\ndestroyed my glam room. These are all the new\nproducts that I opened, this is all the recycling trash,\nMaya is gonna be in charge of this on Monday when she\ncomes to work on Monday, I'm just gonna leave this for\nher 'cause that's her job, but all this stuff and all\nthis stuff on the table I need to organize and I don't feel\nlike doing any right now. Bougie loves these little\npacking paper things, but he'd be wanting to eat it, and you're not supposed to eat that, I got him this little cat window thing, I talked about it on my Instagram\nstories, it's on Amazon, I can link it for you guys,\nbut I thought he would like it 'cause he was always in\nhere, he always wants to be in the sunlight in here, but he hasn't really been using it, you just want to be in here being bad instead of... Stop! Just lay here and relax and be a good boy, stop! Stop! Wow, see, just relax, stop\ndestroying everything. Okay, so one thing about me, if you don't already know this about me, you gonna learn this about\nme, I love a good theme, okay. When it comes to throwing little shindigs, little parties, little get togethers, anything where you could\nhave a theme to it, I love that, I have so much\nfun putting it together. So, this little get together\nthat we're having tonight for the seafood boil, it was not supposed to be like a full-blown party, whatsoever, I came up with the idea\nyesterday, asked my friends if they would be available\nand threw it all together in less than 24 hours, so\nit's literally just supposed to be a couple of friends coming over. But I'm sitting here\nthinking, \"I have a few hours until people start showing up. What am I doing with myself? Let me be a little extra.\" So, it's going to be\nwelcomed to Ray's Crab Shack, like Joe's Crab Shack, we're\ngonna do Ray's Crab Shack, I think I'm going to make\na little sign. (chuckles) And I have gloves, I have put your paper, I feel like we need a signature cocktail 'cause normally I try to do\nsomething cute like that, like if I do like for Christmas, I had little special cocktails, so I just had the idea, what if I do a underwater,\nunder the sea themed cocktail, since it's the seafood\nboil and everything, so I just came up with it,\nI don't know if it's... I feel it's gonna taste good\nbecause it's gonna be so sweet, but I came up with the idea of... So, either with tequila or vodka and then, you know these little gummy\nworm sour, gummy worms but they're octopus shapes? Get some of those, and\nthen get some Swedish fish, and some Nerds, and some\nof this Calypso ocean blue, blue raspberry lemonade. So I'm thinking, and I hope it works, but I'm thinking if you take\nthe glass, you put the Nerds in the bottom of the\nglass to act as like... It kind of looks like the\nlittle rocks in a fish tank or like the little rocks\nat the bottom of the sea and then you make a mixed drink with like, I think I'm gonna do the Calypso\nblue lemonade, and Sprite, and either like tequila or vodka, so it would just be\nlike a spiked lemonade. And then put the little octopus, and the little Swedish fish\nfloating around in there, and I got the little drink umbrellas, so like put it on top\nof the drink. (squeals) Isn't that so cute? A\nlittle blue ocean lemonade. That is why we have Shipped and we have the grocery delivery apps, because I can get this stuff\ndelivered in like an hour, so I don't have to go back to the store. So, I'm gonna order all\nthe stuff for the drink and I'm trying to think, like, I feel like we need\nsome sort of appetizer, I know we're gonna have a lot\nof food at the seafood boil, but people are gonna be here\nand we're gonna be cooking it, I'm not cooking it, it's\nnot like I'm cooking it and it's going to be ready\nwhen everybody gets here, no, y'all gon' and y'all\ngonna help me cook it, so in the meantime I feel\nlike we need something to snack on, so I'm trying\nto think, what can I get? So I'm literally going on\nJoe's Crab Shack's menu to see what do they have as appetizers. Now for the Ray's Crab Shack's sign, see this is why I keep all\ntype of foolishness upstairs in the craft room and\neverything, 'cause you never know when you might need to\nbust out some foolishness for a special occasion. (chuckles) I have used two poster\nboards in the craft room, so I think if I connect them\ntogether to make a big sign and then I'm thinking, I could like use some of this\ncolorful card stock paper and cut out the letters in\nthe shapes on the cricut, Ray's Crab Shack, which should be blue. I gotta think about how I\nwant to brand my restaurants, I feel like different shades of blue, 'cause it's under the sea. Joe's Crab Shack is red but, I think we gon' do blue, cut out the letters and\ncut out like a little shape of like a crab, to put on there. (giggles) Why do you do that? Literally every single\ntime, I turn the camera on, Bougie comes and steps directly in front of it, and puts his\nbutt directly in front of it, there is no reason why you\nneed to be standing here, other than the fact that you wanna put your butty in the camera. Why didn't you do that? That is so disrespectful. And I have to keep this\nsign because you know what? This might become like an\nannual tradition at my house. Ray's Crap Shack because\nwe did it last year for the first time, me, Sadie and Rell, that was last year when\nwe did the seafood boil. And now we do it again by adding more friends into the mix and I feel like I wanna make\nthis like a little tradition, wait... I've been trying to take note\nand teach myself how to use the cricut design space, where\nyou like create everything and the actual machine to cut it out because you all know I always ask my mom, and I never learned how to do it myself, but she leaves everything\nover at my house, the cricut lives at my house. So we go see new projects. (ambient music) I'm not gonna lie, my mom\ndid come over here for... Oh, no, she was dropping something off and while she was over here, (giggles) I did have to ask her\na couple of questions, but now I know how to do it. And I'm gonna do the second round myself but I got the letters,\nI'm peeling them off, this gonna be so cute. (ambient music) Okay, wait, I was in the\nmiddle of making my sign and then Daisha just texted me and said that she is on her way over to my house, she's coming early because she's in town looking at apartments, and she just finished, so she's gonna be obviously\nthe first one over here. And I still haven't\nwrapped everyone's gifts and I don't want her to see, let me go up to my craft room. (chuckles) Ziya is like, what's going on? Yes.\n- When she comes over, I'm gonna ask if she can spend the night with us, then\nI'm gonna play with her, with my baby doll. - [Raven] Oh, you're gonna\nhave to clean this up before the people come,\nWe don't want everybody to trip over all this stuff. - Okay, (inaudible) - [Raven] Not just, you\nhave a couple of hours. - Is Daisha almost, almost,\nalmost, almost, almost here? - [Raven] Yes, she's\nalmost, almost, almost here. - Okay. - [Raven] Are you excited?\n- Yeah. - [Raven] You haven't seen her in a while. - Hmm. Well, when I was three\nI've seen them, (mumbles). - [Raven] You've seen her\nsince you've been four too. For Daisha and Sadie's gifts, since I got them all those toiletries, I thought it would be nice to\nput them in a toiletry bag, and I actually have a lot of these little bags that are like,\na lot of them are brand new 'cause they always come with PR packages, so I'm trynna see if I can\njust use maybe one of these that I already have,\n'cause I didn't get one, should've thought about that. These two might work but\nI don't like the fact that this has a brand on it,\nI want like a plain one. Okay, actually found two\nbags, this is like a nice, little mesh travel bag\nand then like another kind of similar one. They have like little brand names on them, but I think it's fine. This is not the important\npart of the gifts, I just wanna have something to put it in, that they can actually like use and reuse, reuse or recycle making use of what I got instead of creating more waste. Y'all don't judge me but\nfor reusing my PR gifts as part of gifts, but I got\nsome PR from Kendra Scott and so one of the sets of\njewelry that they sent me is like orange and it kind\nof like matches with this, and it made me think of\nSaidie, so I'm gonna give her some of my Kendra Scott PR,\nobviously I spent my own money, but I'm adding in some\nfreebies don't judge me, okay. I feel bad, receiving all this stuff. And yes, I do giveaways and\nstuff like that, but I just want this stuff to go to a good\nhome, so I'm just constantly trying to give it away\nbasically. (giggles) So I'm gonna give Sadie some\nof this Kendra Scott jewelry, but they're going to\nknow, Sadie's gonna know that I didn't buy this. So it's not like I'm trynna trick her, like, \"Oh, I bought you\nsome Kendra Scott jewelry, but really I received it for free and just gave it to you, it's not a scam.\" I'm gonna tell her that I didn't buy this but, you know what I mean? (chuckles) We're close enough friends\nto where I can do that. And then I need to wrap up Taylor, Rell and Kanesha's gift as well. And again with the reduce, reuse, recycle, I always keep a stash of gift wrap and what not up here in the craft room. Some of it is brand new never been used, some of it has been used\nand I'm just recycling it, but either way, who really cares, I try to be kind of sustainable\nwith some stuff that I do as to not waste extra materials. See, look at all these\nperfectly good gift bags, why go out and create more\nwaste, when you can choose to reduce, reuse, recycle,\nthese things are perfectly good. Some of them look like\nthey weren't even used, you know what I mean? (laughs) (ambient music) Okay, boom! Here is Kanesha's little house warming gift basket, it's harder than I thought to style a gift basket but\nthis is what I came up with, I put everybody else's stuff\nin just the little gift bags. So I'm gonna go hide this upstairs, and then I will bring it out obviously when everybody gets here. If y'all ever are curious\nwhat Ziya is up to, while I'm doing my thing,\nshe's doing her thing, baby dolls, baby dolls,\nall day, every day. Okay, but now that I got\nall the gifts wrapped and squared away, I can come\nback to my little craft here. So, now I think I know\nhow to do it myself, so I have some crabs that I wanna cut out and I got my paper, so\nlet's see if I can do this without my mom's help. Okay, cutting, Oh, no! That doesn't seem right, stop! I think it was trynna cut on this part, why didn't it take the\npaper all the way in? Okay, I think I figured it\nout, I think I just barely didn't push this thing\nfar enough in there, so now if I press cut,\nI think it should work. (machine cutting) There we go. Hey, look at me, cricut queen. You probably can barely see\nit but my first cricut cut that I did all by myself. Okay, so I got all the pieces\ncut out and pulled apart, is this not... Come on, this came out\nbetter than expected, is this not cute or what? I think I'm gonna layer\nthis on top of this. So, it's like Crab Shack and then put the little\ncrabs around it, wow, I need to open up a\nrestaurant, come on now. Okay, now I just need\nto glue everything down and well, here's my restaurant's\nbillboard, sign, whatever, I made it to where the crab\nis holding the letters, get it? (chuckles) And I added a little, established in 2020 'cause the tradition started last year. I'm very proud of it,\nwhat do you think Ziya? - I like it but I wish it'd be better more if it had more if it had\nyou and me stickers on it, of our faces, remember we had those. - [Raven] Yeah, but it doesn't\nreally go with the theme. - Yeah. Oh, no! Mummy now you're so tall. (ambient music) - [Raven] I think somebody's\nhere, Bougie, you don't go. (car door closing) - Aw! (laughing) - [Raven] I saw you from my,\nuh, I was in my glam room. - [Daisha] Oh, Ray's Crab Shack. How you doing? - [Ziya] I'm good. - [Raven] Ziya you\nalways act so nonchalant, trynna play it off, she\nhas been asking and asking, and now you just gon' act\nlike you just don't care? (chuckles) - [Daisha] It's okay. - [Raven] Oh, my goodness.\n- [Daisha} What's up, it's Me, it's me, I'm in the building.\n- [Raven] Back in the city, back in the town.\n- [Daisha] Back in the city. What's up? How are you? How's your baby? - She's sleeping right now. - Oh, she's sleeping, oh, yeah, be quiet. - [Raven] All right y'all, so\nI just got my stuff delivered, my little ingredients,\nfor a signature cocktail, I wanna test it out, to see\nif it's even going to look or tastes how I think it is. Of course Ziya's--\n- I want candy. - [Raven] curious about the candy. Okay, so making this up as I go along, in my little shaker I have ice, I'm gonna do a shot of tequila, this would probably be better with, maybe some different flavored\nvodkas or whatever but-- - Two shots of vodka. (vodka pouring) - And then we go into some\nof the Calypso ocean blue... Oh, it's called ocean blue. And I guess that's it, to\njust check that together, I only have like two of\nthese glasses, but whatever, so we got tequila and\nblue lemonade in here, we gon' shake that up. (bottling shacking) I can't shake it 'cause the right top, and then you get the Nerds\nas the bottom of the ocean, so like this. So pour this all over\nit. (lemonade pouring) Dang, I didn't even\nmake enough. (laughing) And then maybe this'll make it look like, you know how the ocean be kind of foamy? Oh, no! (laughs) psyched. Oh, okay, see. (giggles) Then you get the octopus the\nsea creatures, little octopus, you can't see it, it's\ntoo murky. (laughing) A little Swedish fish,\nyou just have to like... I want it to be more clear\nso you can see, (laughs) maybe I should put less\nlemonade and more sprite, I don't know. Okay, when you top it off\nwith a little drink umbrella, you have yourself a little\nunder the sea. (chuckling) This is a Ray's Crab shack\nspecialty under the sea cocktail. Now let's taste it 'cause that's the other thing,\nwhat does it even taste like? - [Ziya] Please say cotton candy. - [Daisha] If it is. - I mean, you know. (laughs) It's not the best drink I\never had but it's not nasty, you wanna taste it? - [Daisha] Yeah, let me see, let me see! - [Raven] I don't feel like tequila is the best liquor for that. (chuckling) - Maybe with Vodka. - It's just the tequila doesn't ace here. - The tequila is sprite are not. - [Raven] That's why I said\nlike with a fruity vodka-- - Did you even put any tequila in here? I can taste it but barely. - [Raven] It's not a whole bunch. Oh, well I tried, they look like dead fish\nat the bottom of the ocean. (chuckle) (ambient music) - Raven special, um, drink\nrevised, how do you get the ice? - [Raven] It's already on, just do it. These are the appetizers\ngetting ready to go in the oven, I was trying to buy mozzarella sticks for everybody but I didn't\nrealize how small the box was when I placed my grocery order, so it's only eight mozzarella sticks, so one per person. (laughing) Everybody can have one,\nsomebody can have mine, waffle fries, sweet potato\nfries, just something to snack on while boils is boiling. And then I perfected my,\nwell kind of perfected my little recipe. - [Daisha] Want some of this? - [Raven] Yeah, I really\nwas just eyeballing however you think, is\nsome of that, some sprite and some vodka - Two shots of vodka. (vodka pouring) - [Raven] Little octopuses in\nthe, octopi, I guess and fish. - [Daisha] All right. - [Raven] Be careful\nwith that shaker though 'cause it's not very\nsecure. (bottle shaking) - [Daisha] Oh man.\n- [Raven] Yeah, I told you, I told you, I told you. (laughing) Look at the ocean water\non the sea creatures. - [Daisha] On the sea\ncreatures, (Daisha chuckles). - [Raven] Oh, okay, I like garnish. - [Daisha] You should put a\nlittle octopus on the side. - [Taylor] Chef Ray, head chef Ray. - Look, see I didn't\nhelp that much last time, but this time, don't\nsay I didn't do nothing. - [Taylor] whipping up\nthe work, head chef. - Well, Raven's a big chef today. - [Taylor] Big chef Ray,\nshe even prepped the water. - [Taylor] Wow. - The stirring is the most important part. So.\n- [Taylor] Wow. (ambient music) All right, ma'am where are we at? - [Raven] Sausage, onions, lettuce-- - [Taylor] Okay, we getting\nsomewhere. (laughing) - Oh, it's in my eye. - [Rell] She got in her eye?\n- Oh the spices. - [Rell] So now, how you all feeling? - I got the spice in my eye. (chuckles) How am I gonna reach all the way down here to get the potato? - [Rell] Leave a comments\nabout Raven's new eye. - (indistinct chattering) - Okay, here we go, here comes the eggs. - Okay, see.\n- [Rell] Okay, yeah, yeah, come on. - Why don't we take this\nout of here? (screaming) - [Rell] Ooh, hold on\n- Wait! Wait! Wait! - [Kanesha] Wait! Wait!\nWait! It's hot! It's hot! - I know you are.\n- We need to pray. - [Taylor] Ray did we crack the\neggs before you put them in? - We need to pray on food.\n- [Rell] Ooh. - No, I just broke that one. - You say just soak it\nup and chill. (laughing) - [Raven] I'm okay. - [Kanesha] Hey baby, hey baby, we know who the child is (inaudible). - We ready. (upbeat music) - [Raven] So what do you think? What's the review? - Good job. - [Raven] I'm enjoying myself. - (indistinct). (laughs) (indistinct chattering) - [Daisha] Everybody's hands clean? (clears throat) First celebration is Sadie's\nbirthday's coming up. (cheering) - Saidie's birthday, happy birthday. - Happy Birthday.\n- Happy birthday. - [Raven] The next\ncelebration that is in order, Kanesha got her own place,\na little house warming, - [All] Yeah, turn up. (cheering) - [Raven] Next celebration is\nthat, Daisha got a new job. (all cheering) And she's moving to Austin, which I've been waiting for a long time. - Finally here, finally here, I'm in the building. - [Raven] And I just can't\neven believe it. (laughing) I can't even believe it. And the next congratulations\nand celebration is to my social media team,\nI only had one basket, you got to share. (chuckles) (all cheering)\n- That's okay. - [Raven] That's team\nwork, exactly, exactly, I just wanna celebrate the... Well, we did reach 350 and then it went back down\nto 349, but that's okay. - We'll be right back.\n- [Raven] It's close enough? - Yeah. - [Raven] We've made some\nmajor brand deal goals and I just feel like y'all\nreally been doing the damn thing when it comes to the Instagram, so I wanted to celebrate\nthat as well. (cheering) - Than you. (cheering) - [Raven] As for Orlando and\nOgden y'all mean nothing to me. (laughing) Next time, next time, I'm sure\nyou got something coming up. - That was so rude.\n- [Raven] I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding, I love y'all too. - I'm like yes, my bag be here. - [Raven] You don't have\none of those? I didn't know if you already have one.\n- [Taylor] No, he don't. - No, this is a different\none, I don't have this. - [Raven] And this I thought\nwas so arm brand for you. - Yeah, she's very money green. - [Raven] It matches-- - She's very arm brand.\n- [Raven] You're branding. - It's going straight\nto the office, Period. - Aww, this is thoughtful, thank you. - [Taylor] Thank you. - [Raven] Oh, I'm glad you liked it. Daisha your explanation, just\nopen it, I have to explain, it's pajamas, there's a matching set, so since you're going to be here now, I feel like you need your\nlittle set to like stay here, you know what I mean? (gasping) So I stuffed toiletries in there too, if you wanna like keep your\nlittle set in the guestroom. (indistinct chattering) - [Raven] And then for you-- - This is a perfect color. - [Raven] This gave me vibes. (cheering) - Especially after the\npictures, I just saw. - [Raven] Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so then inside you\nhave your little kit. - Ooh, there's a kit?\n- [Raven] For the trip. - Stop! Don't zoom in. (laughing) (indistinct chattering) (laughs) - [Raven] I'm not gonna lie\nto you, I got this for PR, but I thought of you, so you can have it. - What is it?\n- [Raven] It's Jewelry. (laughing) - [Raven] I don't want you\nto think that I bought it. (indistinct chattering) (laughing) And yours is pretty obvious,\na house warming gifts. - Yes. - [Raven] So your Kitchen essentials. - I need this. - [Raven] Yes, congratulations! (ambient music) - Good morning, it's Sunday morning, the morning after Ray's Crab Shack, trying to finish cleaning up, but my garbage disposal doesn't work as a result of the snowpocalypse and I still haven't gotten it\nfixed, I'm kind of struggling, trying to use my sink. Everybody helped clean\nup a lot last night, so that there's not too much to do now, and then Ziya said she\nwants to make pink pancakes for breakfast this morning,\nso that's what we gon' do. (bottles scattering) (ambient music) - [Daisha] Look, mama's\nmaking pink pancakes. - [Ziya] Yay! - [Raven] Wow, maybe I should\nleave it tie dye like that. We just invented a new fun pancake. (ambient music) - I'm making Daisha one of\nmy Raven's specialty coffees, the super froth supreme, you\nguys have seen me do this many times but I don't know if I've shown my new frother on my vlog, I talked about it on Instagram\na lot. (timer bleeps) I like it, now that I\nfigured out how to work it and the best way to use\nit, I do really like it. Very nice results, as you can see. Tanta rara! Look at that thick froth. - Ziya (mumbling) Taste test. - [Daisha] Hmm, it's good. (chuckles) A little sweet. - [Raven] I made it sweet, you said sweet. Breakfast is served. (laughing) - [Daisha] (indistinct). - [Raven] Is that what you wanted? - Hmm. - [Raven] Is it look good?\n- Hmm - I want the big pancake.\n- [Raven] Okay. (ambient music) - So, this jar used to be in my pantry and I had candy in it, but I moved the candy, cleaned it out and now I'm gonna use it for\nmy little odor defense beads. Say probably hold like five of these. (beads pouring) So fresh and so clean, clean. Ooh, yes, it do be looking\nkind of edible, but it's not. and I will be sure that\neveryone knows that and it's kept nice, and safe and sound out of children's reach. (ambient music) Okay, what's up? It's Monday, Ziya is at school, I've been working from my computer as usual, I do have a meeting\nwith my Instagram team, I'm hungry and I also\nneed to do a workout, I have this workout set on,\nwhich is actually from Amazon, really cute color. I, um, heard about this\nset from Julia Havens, shout out to Julia, she\ndoesn't know me. (chuckling) I don't know if she\neven knows that I exist, but I kind of recently\ncame across her on YouTube and Instagram and I\nreally liked her style, like her home decor style, I\nlike her fashion, cute stuff and she always posts like\naffordable finds, Amazon finds, so I saw a video where she\nwas talking about this set and I ordered it right away. The top is a little small,\nneed to go a size up next time, I mean it still works\nbut it's just like, uh! But the leggings fit really, really well. (soft music) Came in a bunch of colors,\nI can link it down below if you guys want to check out this set. So yeah I'm gonna do a little\nstretching, a little work out, a little posture workout and\nmaybe like some abs and glutes. I don't really ever do\ncardio or a lot of upper body because honestly I am okay\nwith my upper body as is, I really don't want to tone\nup my upper body anymore than it already naturally is\ntoned, if that makes sense. I don't want any added,\nanything to my upper body, so I kind of just want to leave that alone and then work on the lower\nbody and I know cardio is good for building up\nstamina and just other stuff besides losing weight but\nit does also cause you to lose weight, so I kinda\nhave a fear of cardio, but first I'm gonna get my lunch going because I saw this on TikTok. (ambient music) So, it's Hawaiian, hot Italian\nsliders on Hawaiian rolls, so I'm going to do like\na little variation... I was gonna say vegan,\nbut definitely not vegan because I will be using\nreal meat, just dairy free because I will not be using real cheese. My lip cracked back, it hurts so bad, this is what used to happen\nwhen I used to be on Accutane and my lips would be so chapped, that they would just start crack... Like the crease right\nhere would start ripping and I don't know why it's\ndoing that right now, but it hurts so bad. So if I'm like talking weird, that's why, but I have pepperoni and\nsalami, dairy free cheese, I'm gonna do the little butter on top, deep it in some marinara,\nI think it's gonna be good, so I'm gonna get that going\nthen, I'm gonna do my workout, then I'm gonna eat after my workout, then I'm gonna go to my... Not go to my, join, my zoom meeting. Okay, so here are my ingredients, just regular Hawaiian\nrolls, I have sandwich size, like the giant pepperoni's, salami, I have the child dairy free cheese, which is definitely one of my favorites, it kind of reminds me of like provolone or Gouda type vibe. And then I have follow\nyour heart mozzarella, which I also really liked\nthe follow your heart, brand, I normally get, I think it's a provolone\nversion that they have, but the mozzarella is not bad either, so I think I'm gonna use both\nof these cheeses together. I got to put some Chili Onion Crunch on literally everything I make, I have some sun dried tomatoes\nthat I think I might chop up 'cause she used peppers\nand I don't have that, but I'm gonna use this instead\nand then the little butter, seasoned, drizzle to go on top. (ambient music) And then she said just\nput this in the oven at 350 for like 20 minutes,\nI only did half the pack of rolls because I only it's just for me, and also I'm just kind of\ntesting it out, so, if it's good, we could come back and do\nthe other half another day but this is definitely more\nthan enough for me today. My lunch is in the oven,\nso in the meantime... (soft music) Bougie is watching me\nlike, what are you doing? (soft music) All right, it is about 2:45\nnow, I just finished my little, quick little 30 minute\nworkout, I'm stepping outside 'cause it's cool outside. Get a little sweaty,\nstart feeling the burn and get stretched out and just\nfeel active, just a little, little something, huh,\nt's not as cool out here as I thought it was. (chuckles) And my food is ready. Toasty! (soft music) Little taste test. (sandwich cracking) Hmm, pretty good. Almost forgot about a dip\nin it in the marinara sauce. It didn't feel like it\nwas missing something, let's like that. Hmm, hmm! You need the marinara, That's the ticket. Hallelu, hallelu, the\nelectrician just left and fixed my plugs or\nbreakers that weren't working, he said basically something\nhad came a loose or was loose to begin with and he had\nto tighten something, to get these plugs, to\nstart working again, and also my garbage disposal,\nwhich was the main thing, I had stuff that.... Especially after the\nseafood boil and everything, I was trying to avoid\nputting anything down here, but inevitably stuff got dropped down here and it was starting to back up and it was just getting real\nnasty and I couldn't even... I still have this in here. (chuckles) From Saturday because I\nwanna dump it down the sink, but I need the disposal,\nso everything is fixed now, Ugh, that stinks, I\njust opened the lid ewe. So now I'm able to clean\nout my sink and everything and use the disposal, (sink draining) so that is good. (water splashing) (ambient music) - I was able to dump that out, now that I can probably use my sink, I got a bunch of dishes\nto do because we still had dishes left over\nfrom the seafood boil, and just from yesterday,\nmy sink was clogged up. So, my mom went and\npicked up Ziya from school because the electrician had\nto come right at the time that I would normally pick her up, So, luckily I have my mom\nwho's able to help me in times like that, and then Ziya\nsays she wanted to go to grandma's house, anyway. So my mom is taking Ziya to her house, to hang out for a little bit, so I'm gonna use this extra time, it's like five o'clock now, I finished my meetings and everything, well, didn't really finish everything, I had to do foot work today\nbut I'm gonna use this time while Ziya is at granny's\nhouse to, like I said do the dishes and stuff, and\nmaybe finish up the content that I did not finish editing, hmm, I know I say this all the time,\nbut it ain't nine to five, it ain't nine to five,\nwhen you work for yourself, Here is Monday nights dinner,\nin case anybody was curious, we are having garlic butter, herbs-salmon, lemon-pepper broccoli,\nand some sweet plantains. I loaded up my plate cause\nI'm trynna get thick 2021. (chuckles) And Ziya's having the same\nthing, just chopped up in kids' version, - I'm just gonna eat the\nsalmon and the plantains. - [Raven] And the broccoli,\nyou are gonna eat the broccoli, Yes you are. Yes you are. Yes you are. 'Cause guess what? You're\nnot gonna get anything else, no desserts, no snacks, no nothing, you're gonna be talking about\nI'm hungry, I want a snack, I want a cookie, and I'm going\nto say no, eat some broccoli. (ambient music) All right guys, so it's\nWednesday morning and today is? - Wacky Wednesday. - [Raven] And what does that mean? - That means you gonna wear\nwacky and crazy clothes. - [Raven] To school, right?\n- Yeah. - [Raven] And you're just\nsupposed to wear your craziest, mismatch outfit. So we've done this every\nyear at Ziya's school, basically We just try to\nfind some, crazy stuff, wear stuck inside out. Let's see, I usually go\nfor the most wild printed, these leggings are kind of\nboring, they're just black, this would be wacky, to\nwear Valentine's leggings and then wear like--\n- Ah, no valentines. - [Raven] Yeah, valentine's\nwhen it's not Valentine's Day and then put something on top\nthat doesn't match, like this on top or something, you\ngotta make it look crazy. And for the socks you should\nprobably wear like high socks so you can see them... I think I have some socks downstairs, you could even wear your\nswimsuit on top of your shirt or wear your little swim suit\nbottoms on top of your... That, now that would be\nwacky, this on top of this. Okay, so far we have Valentine's leggings with a mismatch skirt on top, with the inside out shirt on top. Then you need tall socks\nthat you're gonna be able to see from your rain boots. These socks you won't see them 'cause they're gonna be\ndown inside your boots, they're too small, so you can\nput one Christmas sock on, Christmas and Valentine's Day together! That's silly. So for Ziya's hair we wanna put\nsome crazy stuff in her hair like pipe cleaners or something,\nbut Bougie likes to come in here and steal all the\npipe cleaners. (giggles) So, We only have a few left. - Because, look, Bougie\nlike pipe cleaners, and he takes them all around the house - [Raven] Yeah, see he came running, this his favorite thing, I don't even know how he gets them out of this second drawer. What else can we put in your hair? Let's see, what other accessories? - [Ziya] Mom we put\nbomber worms in my hair. - [Raven] Put what? - Bomber worms. - [Raven] Bomber worms. (giggles) (ambient music) Okay, here is the final\nWacky Wednesday look. So we have one loose ponytail, one bun, pipe cleaners in the\nhair, bubbles hanging off, of one of the pipe\ncleaners, a big tie dye Bow, mismatch scrunchies, crazy blue\nsunglasses, green necklaces, inside out shirt, mismatch\ngloves, mismatch skirt on top of mismatch leggings\nwith mismatch, crazy socks. (giggles) (clapping) Okay, give us a pose, another one, another one, let's see the back. And rain boots to finish it off, although she wears those everyday anyway. Tarra! I think we did pretty good for throwing it together last minute, I think they're gonna get a kick out of the bubbles and the hair, I bet you they're gonna laugh at that. It's Wednesday, which means\ncleaning service is here, and they usually do a really good job of just being as quiet as possible, and just kinda being in the background. I looked like a mix between\na grandma and a crazy 80's workout person, like\nI got full curly Afro, it's giving Justin Timberlake\nin-sync frosted tips. Yeah, I don't know if\nI said it on the vlog, but I'm kinda trying to grow my hair out just temporarily long enough\nto get some box braids. So I'm in a very awkward stage, like normally I would\ndefinitely be cutting my hair, I would be re-dying it, I\nwould be slicking it down, I would not be wearing it like this, but just for now, I'm kind\nof letting it breathe, letting you grow, letting it\ndo it's little natural thing, so I can have enough hair to\nget some braids back here. I know I've got enough up\nhere, but it's back here that I'm trynna grow it a little bit more. So anyway, I dropped Ziya off at school, they had all their little like\nWacky Wednesday decorations. Ziya's school is really cool,\nthey do a lot of fun stuff, they basically do a special day, or a little party for\nevery single holiday. Valentine's Day, Wacky Wednesday, St. Patrick's Day is coming up, they want to dress up for that. Then they've got, um, Holy or Holly, I don't know how you say\nit, it's like a Hindu. How do you pronounce it? Holy or Holly, H-O-L-I, the festival colors,\nwhere they have the colored powder that they throw, let\nme show a picture like this. So you make this colored\npowder and you like throw it at everyone and it makes\nthis cool explosion and it gets all over\nyour clothes and stuff, so the kids wear white t-shirts\nthat you don't care about, and then they like make the\npowder and they throw it. It's really cool, they\ncelebrate all different cultures and different types of\nholidays and festivals, so it's always something\ngoing on at the school to dress up and for bring something for. Anyway, I dropped her\noff, they had everything all decorated, all the\nkids were dressed up, so that's gonna be a fun day for her, then I stopped at StarB's\n'cause I wanted to get the new brown sugar oat\nmilk shake and espresso, this is my second time having it. 'Cause when I first tried\nit, I really liked it, so I wanted to go back for another one, I just get it exactly\nas it comes, super good. And I got myself a little\nbacon gouda with no gouda, so it's just egg, bacon\nand bread, (sniffs) and then I put sriracha on it. I like this one and sausage\ncheddar, with no cheddar. (ambient music) - Hey y'all so it is Sunday. I don't think I've vlogged\nlike the past, like two days, but it's Sunday now, and\nSundays are often shoot days, so I spend, it's like\nfive o'clock already, but I spent most of my day\ndoing an Instagram photo shoot, if you guys have been keeping up with me and watching my vlogs, you\nknow that I've been working with Taylor and Rell,\nwho have been helping me just kind of like up my\ncontent game for Instagram, so we normally like take a\nday and try to get a bunch of different types of\nphotos and just kind of... if I'm working on sponsored\nstuff or non-sponsored stuff, just different creative\nideas that we have. So, that is what we did earlier today, so I will cut to some footage of that. (ambient music) - Hello friends, We are at\nThe Lumen Room in Austin and we are shooting organic\ncontent for the shoot. Ziya and Raven are back there with Rell. Um, We had a pretty short day till four, it's already like almost noon,\nso pretty standard shoot, and, yeah, I'm gonna give\nyou guys a little tour of The Lumen Room too,\n'cause it's cute in here. (ambient music) Real BTS right here. (chuckling) (ambient music) - Okay, So we're about to go from this, to something editorial. Get ready for the transformation,\nand don't be alarmed. It's editorial, that means\nit looks crazy on purpose. Here's the editorial makeup\nlook that I threw together, the eyes are probably all creased up, but we've got a glossy\nred lip, a matte red... Glossy red lid, matte red lip. And I try to do like a heavy blush, but, and then like wet hair\nis starting to dry now. Red outfit, I had a\nlot of gold jewelry on, it was a little evil vibe\nalmost, but we just wrapped up, we did like four or five different looks, I don't really remember. Utilized all the different\nlittle vibes in here, pretty much, it was a good\nlittle shoot, good work guys. So yeah, I think we did end\nup getting some good photos from today, uh, we try\nto do bulk shootings, so it's like you just\nspend a couple of hours, but you get a bunch of different looks that you can kind of\nsprinkle it across your feed, and have some variety in your feed, but I'm not gonna lie today, was kind of a hard day\nwhen it comes to my... I don't want to say my mental health, but I guess my mental health\nsometimes as a influencer, as a creator, as a\nYouTuber, as an Instagram or whatever you want to call\nit, it gets annoying sometimes to have to always be the one\nwho's in front of the camera. I'm not gonna lie. As fun as it is, and as\nmuch as I like my job, and as much as I always\nwanted to have this job, there are some days where it's like, I'm struggling with insecurities, I'm struggling with not liking what I see in the mirror that day, for whatever reason, whether\nit be that I'm breaking out or I don't like how my hair is looking or I couldn't get my makeup to look right. Or this outfit doesn't look how I thought it would look on me, whatever it is, stuff that\nnormal people go through on a, not a daily basis, but normal people have those days, right? We all have those\ndays where you might look at yourself and just be\nlike, \"No.\" (giggles) For whatever reason, but for me, I could be\nhaving one of those days, I could be having a really\nbad one of those days, but well too bad 'cause we\nhave a photo shoot scheduled. So you fit to put this on, and you fit it and get\nin front of the camera, and you fit to take these pictures, and you also fit to post these pictures, for thousands and\nthousands of people to see, so get over it. That's what happens sometimes. And today was kind of one of those days, just because I've been breaking out and I'm trying to grow my hair out, to prepare for a certain\nhairstyle that I want. But in the meantime I feel\nI'm in this very awkward stage of just not liking what my hair is doing, not liking what my skin is\ndoing, just all of that, so I'm not gonna lie, just\nto be real with y'all, it's not all fun, glamorous,\noh my God, I'm a model, and this is just so fun and so easy, because sometimes, although it\ncan be like physically easy, it's not mentally or emotionally easy. So, I don't know. I'm just kind of in a mood\ntoday because I'm just feeling kind of blah and not\nextremely happy with the photos that we took, not because\nthey're bad pictures, but just because of how I look in them, but we're gonna look through the photos, and through the power of\nediting, honestly, (giggles) I'm sure we'll pull it together. But yeah, so it's like five O'clock now, we're home from that. Ziya was also, as you\nsaw in some of the photos and since she did a good job, I'll say she was a little fussy and a little non-cooperative, but overall, it's hard for a four\nyear old to take photos, so all things considered she did a good job at the\nphoto shoot, So I told her, we could do something fun after. So what she wants to do,\nshe is my child of course, she wants to go to Target, (giggles) because she wants to get a Lego set? Oh, that's my mom calling me, please hold. But yeah, Ziya said for her reward, she wants to go to Target, because you wanna get what at Target? - I wanna get a lego set,\nand come see my Barbies. - A Lego set, and come see what? - [Ziya] My Barbies - [Raven] Oh, you just want to\nshow the vlog, your Barbies. You have so many Barbies because\nMatell literally sent you the entire collection of these Barbies. - Yeah, and I also use as\na Barbie, first one Barbie, you can get all of this Barbies, but we save some of these Barbies. And look, I made that,\nthis is where the baby's gets to change it's-- - [Raven] Well Ziya, I was trynna ask you\nabout going to Target, What are you talking about? - I'm talking about my\nBarbies and showing your vlog my baby doll.\n- [Raven] Okay, well do you wanna go to Target or what? - Yes, I wanna go to Target. And we can get Frozen, Moana, and maybe they have Barbie legos. - [Raven] Hmm, I don't know\nif they have Barbie legos. Do you have your money?\n- Yes. - [Raven] 'Cause the reward\nis that I'm taking you to Target, but not that I'm\nbuying you the toy for you, you have to buy the toy\n'cause you've been saving up your money, so let's go\nsee how much you have. - Okay. - [Raven] 'Cause you have\nto still learn the power of the dollar. - Okay.\n- [Raven] Wow! You rich! Where did you get all that money from? (giggles) - From doing my chores. So I got one-- - [Raven] No, that's not\none, what number is on there? - Five. - [Raven] So that's five,\nanother five makes ten. What number is that? - Twenty. - [Raven] So 10 plus 20 is? - 15? - [Raven] No.\n(both laughing) 10 plus 20 is 30. - Five. - [Raven] So 30 and five makes? - 31. - [Raven] What! (laughing) 30 plus five makes thirty? - Five. - [Raven] 35, silly. - A one. - [Raven] That's just one, so that's 36. - Another twenty. - [Raven] So that's 56. - Another five. - [Raven] Fifty... No, wait, 61. - Another twenty. - [Raven] Dang! so that's 81. You almost have like $100 no, that's it. 81, 82, 83, 84, you have $84\ndollars in here? (giggles) That's because grandmother\nbe giving you $20 bills on holidays.\n- Hmm. - [Raven] That's where all\nthese twenties came from, 'cause I ain't gonna\nbe giving you twenties. - On my birthdays and every holiday, grandmother always sends me card, and then you know she\ngives me dollars too. 'Cause grandma thinks I'm really nice and sometimes she calls\nme something really silly. - [Raven] What does he call you? - She calls me this. - [Raven] What? - Booty. - [Raven] Grandmother calls you booty? Oh, yeah, she used to call me\nthat when I was little too. Okay, so we don't need\nto bring all this money, I think for a box of Legos,\nyou should probably only need maybe $25 at the most, I\nthink there's more than enough for a little target trip\nand let's save the rest and put it back in your drawer. But yeah, back to what I\nwas saying a second ago, I feel like another good\nway to think about it is, the average person takes a\nselfie or takes a picture and posts a picture of themselves\nwhen they're feeling cute, when they're feeling their best,\nwhen you look in the mirror and you're like, dang, I look good today, my makeup came out\ngood, my outfit is good, you gon' take a selfie and\nyou might post the selfie. So that'll just be like\nevery once in a while. Now, if I did that, if I\nonly posted when I felt cute and when I felt most confident,\nthen I would only be posting once a month, okay, because\nI struggled with insecurities and stuff, I don't\nreally feel as confident all the time, everyday. I have my good times\nand I have my bad time, so you would only get a new\nInstagram photo from me, maybe once a month if I\nwas really just waiting until I was like super confident. So obviously because of my job, it's like, \"Literally get over it, suck it up. I don't care if you don't\nlike the way you look, you gon' post.\" So yeah, that's just something that I struggle with from time to time. But, you know what a\njob is, a job as a job, and I do realize it's a little\nbit weird how I can come on camera right now and post\nmyself looking like this to YouTube, for just as many,\nif not more people to see. But I don't know, it's just\ndifferent between Instagram and YouTube, YouTube,\nfeels like a safe space for me to be crusty. I feel like when y'all\nclick on one of my vlogs, y'all kind of expect me to look crusty. You're not expecting full\nglam when you click on one of my YouTube videos, so it\nwas like normal, I feel safe, I feel normal coming on video like this, but I don't feel normal, I\ndon't have that same level of confidence when it comes to Instagram 'cause Instagram is more of\na place where it's more glam and more aesthetic, and\nit's more all about that, so I guess I just start thinking about how from the viewers perspective,\nyou're gonna be scrolling through all these beautiful,\naesthetically pleasing pictures on Instagram, and then my\npicture is gonna come up and I don't want to stand\nout as the crusty one. You know what I mean? So, I don't know, it's different. YouTube is like where I can\nrelax, and be free clearly versus Instagram, sometimes\nit's hard and I think that's why kinda low-key avoided\nInstagram for a long time until this year I started\ngetting more serious about it and started wanting to like\nbe an influencer on Instagram and try harder with my photos and stuff. But it is a lot of work\nand it is a lot of pressure and it's a lot of mental\npressure, so I don't know, if anybody else out there is\ndealing with the same thing, Just know, I feel you. (ambient music) - Mommy's getting a little reward too. Haven't tried these I've\ngot peach and mango, let's see if it's good, hope it's good. I'm trying to avoid\nthe home decor section, which we just passed\nby because I don't need to even look over there right\nnow, we are here for Ziya. Okay, here's the Lego section,\nis there a specific one that you're looking for? Or you just wanted to\nsee what kind they had? - Hmm, a little bit back. - Go back, this one\nlooks cool, what is this? Music video maker? You\nneed a phone for that? You like Harry Potter?\n- Hmm. - [Raven] You don't know\nnothing about no Harry Potter. Okay, we actually found these other ones that picked Ziya's interests\nmore than Harry Potter. 'Cause I'm like she don't even know what Harry Potter is really. I mean, if she loves it, that's fine, but. So now you're saying you\nwant this one instead? - [Ziya] Yeah. - It's $29 so you actually\nneed five more dollars but I'll cover you this time. - So that means that, we used $25? - Yeah, we only brought 25,\nbut I actually cost the 30. Are you sure that's the one you want? - [Ziya] Yes. - [Raven] Okay, just\nkidding y'all, we came down the other aisle and\nfound all the whole set of this Lego Friends\nstuff that as Ziya likes. So they have bunch of more options, I think we're switching out the pet clinic for the camping adventure,\nare you super sure? - Yes, I'm super sure I want this. - [Raven] I know it's a lot of choices. - I really like this one. - [Raven] Okay, we can go with that one. We also just found some nice\nclassic clear jelly shoes precise, she wears size\n11 now because clearly these are the ones she's wearing today and they have seen better days, clearly, they're literally brown and\nthe velcro doesn't even work. She just wears them with the\nthing flying open, So I'm like, \"Let's go ahead and replace those.\" These look a little bit\nsturdier, those are from Walmart for like probably like $5, these like $10, but they're like a little\nbit better quality, and she really likes\nthese, so sorry Walmart, Target wins this time. That thing has to touch the glass. Like this, silly. There you go. We came back from target\nand we had dinner, and now I'm going to taste\nthis, which one do I taste? This is Barefoot Fruitscato. Y'all know I love Kool-Aid wine,\nso this looks like my style peach or mango? Hmm, I'm gonna try mango. - Mummy, you should try\nthe peach, it's pink, the mango looks orange, peaches are pink, peaches are money, money. - Smells extremely sweet,\njust like I like it. It even just looks sweet, let's see, very sweet, very sweet. (giggles) That's really good, if you\nlove extremely sweet wines, like as sweet as you can get them, which is what I normally drink. You will love this Fruitscato, I'm sure the peach is good too. They also had strawberry, watermelon, I don't know if this is new\nor what but I've never seen or noticed it, I just saw it at Target. So, it's five stars for me and\nnow Ziya wants me to help her build her Lego set because she\ngot one that is for ages six and up I believe, and\nshe has four, (giggles) so it gets a little difficult\nfor her to put it together on her own. Hmm, Ziya, why do you have to\ndump it in my bedroom though? You whole playroom upstairs\nthat you could do this in. So I guess we are going\nto end our Sunday evening with wine and Legos, and my\nhouse is a mess right now, last thing I need is much Legos\non the floor, but whatever. Okay, so... (ambient music) Well, we didn't finish\nbuilding Lego set last night, it was a little bit more\ncomplicated than we expected and didn't get very far before bedtime, but this is what Ziya did. Pretty good.", "lgZRMptA0Lk": "Hey everybody. \nWelcome to Storyline Online brought to you by the SAG-AFTRA Foundation. My name is Chris Pine and today we are reading the wonderful book Clark the Shark written by Bruce Hale and illustrated by Guy Francis. \nLet us begin. In all the wide blue seas, in all the wide blue world, the top school for fish was the Theodore Roosterfish Elementary. And of all the fish at Theodore Roosterfish, the biggest and the strongest was Clark the Shark. Clark loved school, and he loved his teacher, Mrs. Inkydink. He loved to play upsy-downsy and spinna-ma-jig with his friends.  Clark loved his life. \u201cSCHOOL IS AWESOME!\u201d shouted Clark the Shark. \u201cLess shouting, more reading,\u201d said Mrs. Inkydink. \"LUNCHTIME IS SWEEEEET!\" yelled Clark the Shark. \"Munch your own lunch,\" said his best friend, Joey Mackerel. \"RECESS ROCKS!\" bellowed Clark the Shark. \"You are playing too rough, Clark!\" cried the other kids. Yes, Clark loved his life with all of his sharky heart. But he loved everything way too much. He was too loud. \nHe was too wild. He was just too much shark for the other fish to handle. After a while, no one would play with Clark. No one ate lunch with Clark. No one sat with him at circle time. Even his best friend, Joey Mackerel, said, \u201cCool your jets, Clark! You\u2019re making me crazy!\u201d One day, Clark asked Mrs. Inkydink, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with everyone?\u201d Mrs. Inkydink patted his fin. \u201cClark, sometimes you play too hard, you munch too hard, and \u2014gosh\u2014 you even help too hard.\u201d \u201cBut life is SO exciting!\u201d said Clark. \u201cThere\u2019s a time and a place for everything,\u201d said Mrs. Inkydink. \u201cAnd sometimes the rule is stay cool.\u201d At recess, Clark tried to stay cool, but he pushed the swing with too much zing! \u201cSorry,\u201d said Clark. \u201cI forgot.\u201d \u201cYikes!\u201d cried Joey Mackerel. At lunch, Clark tried to stay cool, but everything smelled so good that he munched a bunch of lunches. \u201cSorry,\u201d said Clark. \u201cI forgot.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re STARVING!\u201d said his friends. In class, Clark tried to stay cool, but a good book got him all shook up. \u201cNow, Clark!\u201d said Mrs. Inkydink. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time or the place. Tell me, what\u2019s the rule?\u201d \u201cStay cool,\u201d said Clark.\n\u201cHey, that rhymes!\u201d he cried. Then Clark got a big idea in his sharky head. Maybe if I make a rhyme, I\u2019ll remember every time! he thought. The next day, he put his plan to work. In class, when lessons got exciting, Clark wanted to bounce up out of his seat. Instead, he told himself: \u201cWhen teacher\u2019s talking, don\u2019t go walking.\u201d And what do you know? It worked! \u201cAttaboy, Clark!\u201d said Mrs. Inkydink. Clark smiled. \u201cLessons are fun!\u201d At lunch, everything smelled sooo yummy. When Clark wanted to eat and eat and never stop, he told himself: \u201cOnly munch your own lunch.\u201d And it worked again!\n\u201cWay to go, Clark!\u201d said his friends. Clark grinned. \u201cLunch is fun.\u201d At playtime, Clark told himself: \u201cEasy does it, that\u2019s the way. \u201cThen my friends will let me play.\u201d And playtime was fun. Once more, Clark loved his life. But then a shadow fell across the playground\u2014 a gi-normous shadow with tentacles galore. \u201cIt\u2019s a new kid, and he looks scary!\u201d cried Joey Mackerel. \u201cSwim for your lives!\u201d The squid squashed the slide, and it snapped off the swings. \u201cOops. My bad,\u201d said the new kid. \u201cWait,\u201d said Clark. \u201cHe just wants to play. Let\u2019s find a way!\u201d And he swam at the new kid with all his might. Clark played harder than he ever had before\u2014 \nupsy-downsy and spinna-ma-jig. Why, he even made up a new game: tail-whump-a-lumpus! \u201cWow, that was fun,\u201d said the new kid breathlessly, and he settled down. \u201cIf you want to come to school, you\u2019ve got to stay cool,\u201d said Clark. \u201cThat\u2019s right, Clark,\u201d said Mrs. Inkydink. \u201cAnd thanks for taking care of our new classmate, Sid the Squid.\u201d \u201cHooray for Clark the Shark!\u201d everyone cheered. That night Clark\u2019s mother asked, \u201cWhat did you learn at school, dear?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a time and a place for everything,\u201d Clark said. \u201cSometimes you stay cool.\u201d \u201cBut sometimes a shark\u2019s gotta do what a shark\u2019s gotta do.\u201d The end. That was Clark the Shark everybody. I think it speaks to all of us. It talks about how we all want to do what we want to do , right? We want to be ourselves. and we want to yell when we want to yell and play and laugh and have a good time. But as Mrs. Inkydink said, there's a time and a place for everything. And there is a time and a place to be considerate of other people's feelings. I think the lesson is: Be considerate. Thank you so much for watching Storyline Online. Make sure to check out all of the other stories. Keep watching and keep reading. you", "aratHtUdznE": "[Music] what's up guys you should go suppose sharise classes in session okay so for this video it's gonna be a very detailed instructional video on how to apply your lace front glue okay so if you are dieting like me all right go get you a rice cake if you're not go get you some pizza sit down and watch this video test prepare to be amazed started off by plucking this unit this unit is from my first wig so it pretty much comes pre plucked for you but you guys nap I like to put my own little spin on all of the units that I receive whether it's pre plucked or not so to get started there are two options you can use this one but it's a little bit harsh so I went ahead and use my Tresemme holding spritz to kind of just slip my hair back a little bit come on braces fuzzy as you can see I don't tie my hair at night but you can skip this process if you have some nice fresh breeze next I'm gonna go ahead and use a brush you can use any brush but this was near me so I went ahead and used my edge control brush this kind of doesn't brush back the fuzzies after that this is the unit pre plucked and all this is how inside the unit looks I'm not using a headband guys so this the backpack comes on the unit and I just tightened it as you can see and this is where we're at right now we're gonna be using both hold lace glue I've heard amazing things about it but I'm actually gonna show you guys step-to-step do's and don'ts of how to apply your lace glue so let's go ahead and get started [Music] so full delays the back stuff wanna just folding the lace back get your pole hold and yeah I know I got a big forehead I know I know so you want to make sure you put the glue on your on your actual skin avoid putting it on your actual hair cuz guys you will not have any edges after you take your unit off so to keep the edges intact for 2019 we are going to do actually just put it on the skin like you should do anyways so you can see I'm putting it as close as possible to my hairline I put a couple of strands make sure your don't but my hair was all over the place at this point use a rat tail comb or you then go ahead and just slide the glue back a little bit just kind of like flatten the glue don't put a lot of glue guys less is more when you put a lot it will be a hot mess so make sure you're just putting a little bit and then you want to make sure it gets clear so you see this little area right there you see that little area is clear we want the rest of the hair lines to be clear like this we put on one layer and we're gonna go ahead and put on two layers and if you're really nasty yeah really I'm gonna go on vacation and make it stay gonna put on three layers my dog is chewing on his bones if you had anything in the background please ignore here I am putting on the second layer now here's one thing you don't want to do if you have oil on your face it might make the glue lift a little bit so make sure you have nice clean skin that's why I have no makeup on in this video go ahead and wipe the comb off you might have some residue from the first time and it won't let the glue slide back nice and smoothly so make sure you're really just rubbing that part off ruh-roh well yeah so use your comb and just slide the glue back don't find it back too much where it goes on the hairline and don't slide it back up forward for me I like my big forehead I appreciate it so you don't want the glue to be too much up on your forehead or you will minimize your forehead and have small forehead I look like we're in a wig okay so now we're at this point and you can see we are getting ready to pull it down so right here is where the glue stops the goal is to match the very front of the hairline to the beginning of where that glued that line that invisible enemy created nice okay so yeah I'm holding it right here so you guys can see now what you don't want to do is you don't want to keep putting it down and pulling it up pulling it down and pull it up as I'm doing that will make it sticky nasty tacky start leaving white residue and it won't stick as well so make sure you don't do that you kind of have to just guess is it's on right but don't worry if you put it back a little bit too far we can always go back and clean off any excess glue that is left on the skin use the NFL back to home make sure the residue from the glue is off of the end of the comb and you want to tie this press in the skin hold the lace a little bit and just pull not pull won't press into your skin not too hard though but enough yeah you got a girl use the back of the comb to just deal last bit of pressing in just like that just like this okay so now I'm just feeling really cute and rejuvenated my biggest thicken now we're gonna go ahead and cut it now I never used this product before I usually use the scissors but I know everyone uses this that I was like okay let me go ahead and use this okay so I just gotta split it down in the middle now do not cut yourself okay make sure you are kind of like tilting the razor away from your skin don't cut straight down like you're just using the scissors kind of leaned the razor away from your skin because we don't want to coat ourselves you know okay let's go on to the others other side I can never tell let's go on to the other side so you see these little parts right here this part though that means the lace is a little bit too long for your hairline go ahead and just cut that part off it's okay you don't need it and I'm gonna I'm gonna use the end of a rat tail comb and apply some glue to it and just stick it in that area and wait for it to get clear while it's getting clear I'm gonna go ahead and move on to the other side okay this accents me I don't know what's with me in this accident but use the end the other end of the comb now just push it down now I've got some alcohol okay 99% whatever y'all use is 70% okay and don't do this yeah don't do that but you want to go ahead and just wipe off the areas that have excess glue do not do this on the actual lace girl because you're gonna be pulling the links back up and you will have to redo the areas so just go as close as possible close as possible okay I'm gonna use some powder uh powder from Black Radiance and just kind of put it on the lid because it's a little bit is a little bit lighter than my skin and I was kind of like bothering me a little bit it's throwing me off but next I got something got to be spray and I just kind of sprayed down my edge control brush in the spray and just kind of brushed out some areas now if you are familiar with this technique of spraying your edge control brush you will know your edges will not be hard and there's barely anything on my brush at all so technically I guess it's the illusion this is really my end result and I hope you guys really enjoyed this video I tried to be as thorough as possible but I really wanted to do a video for beginners on how to do your look you know how to apply weight I mean how to apply glue for beginners but you can't put the wig in a ponytail remember you saw a little bit of lace in the back yeah that was if you wanted to do a ponytail I didn't really want to do a ponytail so I'm just showing you guys that it is possible and it is achievable but although I did love both hold it it actually holds my hair boldly and I do love my first wig this big was amazing I didn't curl the hair guys that hair can curls that's why I didn't wash the wig and I was like uh you know I love washing my wig but I did not wash my wig so it came curled already thumbs up for my first wig I hope you guys enjoyed this video I know I did I had a great time making it and I will see you guys in my next video [Music]", "Dwjqc3euFXc": "[Music] guys welcome to the CCC I'm Shane I'm down and we are back for another screen interview this time we are silhouetted out you guys seem to like that last time so

thing for a half-hour wait longer than the [ __ ] over this morning so we said [ __ ] it went got some breakfast and came back an hour now we got a paper now we can [ __ ] and review this this weed I'm Kai I kind of got lost and was just stay in there cuz I this is a trip I don't know that I've ever seen weed that breaks up this dry it doesn't this is a one-finger breakup where you kind of just grab an UGG and crumble it yeah you should have seen when I was breaking down the wheat for the joint I literally just it just crumbled which I don't know I don't really I don't like that necessarily I like my weed to be a little bit more sticky yeah generally I mean most of the strains that weird customs smoking today the really good versions of them like we were saying I'll use the same example is the sour DS and the OGS that you guys see a smoke a lot of it I feel like the does the stickier they are it's almost always the better they're you know um cookies tends to not be sticky sometimes I have had sticky ass cookies for them yeah I just prefer my weed to be a little bit more stickier than this have not smoked it yet so I'm gonna see how how it smokes and how it tastes or in those taste is interesting scoops nuts out of out of this it's take a real muskie taste kind of kind of perfumey almost like a it's almost like a weird cinnamon thing going on in there pick up fish it's this shit's trippy for sure it's weird it tastes all right honestly it tastes better than that when when Shane came back at this stuff I wasn't too stoked no you know it's beyond this really what the [ __ ] is this like sixty and I told him the story without kind of what I was aiming for what I was trying to find and it tastes pretty good though I'm not gonna lie that's probably the best feature of this week it definitely doesn't have the best looks and doesn't really have the best smell the one thing about it is we got to give it some credit this is about a week and a half old it's just yes sitting in this jar of my room for like a week and a half it did have a little bit stronger nose on it when I got it that's one thing about these jars they don't know all the jars that I ever get at dispensaries I hate these ones the most they don't so they got these little [ __ ] rubber air seal caps that just pop right off you know and they don't really give you a tight seal it feels like an airtight seal almost but your weed dries out so quick in those so that's that's probably half the reason it's really dry and doesn't smell quite as much you know herb iron issues herb butter its it the smell I mean the excuse me the taste through the joint is honestly pretty similar yeah I'm not really noticing moto yet much of a difference just like a really really musky flavor not not so much of that smell that I was getting I mean not so much of the taste that I was getting in the smell you know it's not that fresh green I wasn't my anything that's career dusky it's so weird you wouldn't think it would be strange specific but I remember we just ran or the other the other week I feel restraint like it tasted way better through the bombing addicted the joint but this stuff I feel like it's all yeah yeah man that last hit of the Joyce's was pretty nice it's smooth yeah through that I think it tastes better through the trunk too that didn't give me the best flavor not the best flower piece we can't [ __ ] find that 11 millimeter bull peas to the ear auspey so I cleaned all the glass the other day and somehow misplaced that [ __ ] bull piece I got online to see how hard it would be like how easy it is to find a lot of millivolt because you'd be surprised it is not easy to find an 11 millimeter flower slide and a head show up or online because just nobody really makes 11 mil our pieces but we like that piece so I got to find something yeah or get it 11 to 14 transition or something anyway yeah I mean the buzz is kind of setting in on this stuff it's it's pretty mellow so it's you know dominant for sure yeah I feel really really like clear-headed you know kind of almost euphoric yeah this looks good I was doing a little reading around online for this stuff as far as like medicinal benefits people say this one's really really good for nausea can also be also kind of naturally suppresses your appetite obviously that that's not what a lot of people are looking for with media but some people like smoking weed but one thing that they don't like about it given the crazy mudge yeah have weight gain issues so yeah this is one of the strains that I'll still get you get you feeling good but not gonna give you the super munchies I'm actually liking the high a lot I would say that the two best things about this movie is the high in the flavor looks not so good and the smell is kind of yeah I guess we should probably write this we've it we've been slacking on the ratings lately we kind of just a lot of people were complaining because we get we give so many things nines or tens a lot of the time it's just because it's sour OG we just love sour OG t it's really just because we're the only stuff that we have a really a review is what we've gotten our head stash at the time and it's like that's part if I'm gonna yeah if I'm gonna spend my money on something that I'm gonna smoke I'm obviously gonna try to get the best that I can get so and the same goes for glass a lot you know all the pieces that we review are we got them because we've survived this is like them or because we've tried them before and they're work well but we're gonna we're gonna try to mix it up and try to get like we were saying before we did like the the bargain baits we've reviewed that stuff it was like 35 a day or whatever it was pretty good I'm gonna try to mix it up this stuff is definitely not a 9 or 10 for me I'm gonna give this one like a 6 and a half yeah it's gonna go with like a 7 I was gonna give it like a 6 until until I felt the buzz kick in and it's a really smooth smoke yeah that's the other thing early it's gonna make my cough really mild expansion which is good sometimes you know just the flavor is really subtle and the weed is not impressive to look at I mean yeah you know as we didn't talk much about how it looks it's it's got really really small trichomes all on the outside kinda has an overall overall amber color to the bud you know whatts or cherry I would imagine it was taking pretty long cuz you could almost see with your naked eye that liked all those trike heads are like super milky you know got those kind of pinkish orange hairs yeah I mean it's it doesn't look horrible but that you know coupled with the fact that it's just really really dry makes it a kind of a [ __ ] to roll in [ __ ] that that's where it lost points for me but the buzz is nice about this nice yeah thank you guys for joining us yeah the other straighter view for the CCC I'm Shane I'm Dan [Music]", "I6CrEfdpljg": "okay I'll tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it yo guys what's happening ska Bulls back again with the third review on his channel now this time you cable for you finally I'll say start up the 293 this time with just really gets jaffa cake cookies so this is one of my favorite strange to be fair had the last few years in a sense of I've had it a lot in the last few years I've got I know a god that particular tends to bird is it's a really good job a [ __ ] actually who this border he's off here and when he said the other particular batch I knew this ever people to storks I hope you know what all cost get a review of it review the moment sorry so yeah well that's probably the table or do like this [Music] to be funded you're going but there's a really nice border hopefully five came in one good thing about c35 really nice truck incorporated crazy pistols I threw out a bunch of stuff you know it's a really nice look look look you know a really cool book Scripture the reason why it's called Jack a cool to use for anyone's like a very personal film watching this jacket these are it's like a biscuit with like our in the sort of like sweet in the middle taste but you get off this is very reminiscent of this because this would take some real orders these tapes at college sweet it's hard to explain it well thing if you know what maybe this book it's hard to explain for similar to what sort of smell reminds me of again maybe played by the tile wall it is it you do you get the orange fruit @anjghie before I've reviewed orange happening sensor smoke but it's cooked before which cream for example it was they were more orange it's orange flavors or accessible flavors this is like own flavor it's really pronounced if you like flavorful put it really like this I recommend it raining outside anyway they're not gonna be chatting about the would you mind the steamy yet so I let me see the back unfortunate we give it a rating as usual yeah [Music] I mean the looks like a lot of cookies does that mean the smell of this but it actually is pretty crazy if you smoke of cake you'll know what I mean it has a pretty independence or pretty unique smell is what I'm trying to say nice really nice trimmed up on it as well I say to you capable of - it's crazy you can do some big things just you should know I was gonna be looking at you but yeah this you carry on so cool but to start with I said as a Jesse statement just what quickly get a video this with a flush on as well - good that was pretty billion to flush you see all the little trichomes there see the tripod a bit various lactase not crazy comedy track homes but they are obviously really present in Tennessee and the harem pistols which made this bullish nobody reading colors it's more like a light green okay it looks a bit dark and I've got a flash run even more alive green a real perp was about nothing but instead of [ __ ] nice-looking pudding like that think of the UK all day really see it up so yeah as you can see as I say before some really nice cops look at corporate structure and this is particularly fire but you know there's many punished once so clean very kind of nice why I should not you know I've enjoyed smoking it I usually do is Joyce make the job complete but this was a prime example of a teenage girl it's got a sweet sweetness to it do you certainly get some of the cookie saw through his fat cookies you do so haste with the cookies for everybody's and also I think a lot of structures owed to the cookie so as well it doesn't matter cookies but yeah really nice taste really pronounced taste as well written theme readable brain comedy tribe claims Italy UK but lacks a great channel really nice high get enough flavor because it's pronounced yeah yeah I've had so yeah this one if you haven't necessarily minutes was a bass you're part of my last squad hire this think of the batches what put it on there you know that 8.9 high school for UK yeah quicker for you to be the last one today we're still new to this restored - I mean testing the waters try to see what works what ain't working obviously seen in the videos you can watch them bigger yourself but if you do have any feedback first please let us know you're a stranger once you get a hold of keys know if you smell jaffa cake cookies if you're making it if you'd not let us know yeah you know I mean the comments are there for a reason yeah what's really really fire strange point I think next review it's going to be a very edgy today see ya in Harvey demands thing and hopefully after that well you know to the fight okay you be worn in okay so to me you wanna see a play i chef I know in your soul find a way yeah don't ever be talking about fasting not so you didn't push out those name and Yuto ji mu since he's talked about when this way I shall we were checking you back are no lay on my soul I stopped doing on my day enjoy the videos cookies tangey cookies UK good 8.9 really 5 good

in a different way so this is some non-newtonian material so that means that when you move it slowly it's very fluid and can flow very easily like a liquid but when it's stress is applied to them so something like an impact the material becomes instantly more viscous so ya acts more like a solid obviously you can just use this inside a protection item that's the clever part is incorporating this

detecting people so they experience less injuries a script thing that we could be doing our part to help [Music]", "RY2mrIh3VBk": "it's awesome hey guys it's tonight and I'm back today to talk to you guys about this gel right here which is the yellow guerrillas the yellow Gorillaz not it says indestructible on it and on the little hole Demeter - notice how strong the gel is it's a 10 out of 10 so I'm just gonna be talking to you guys about this deal today because everybody talks about it as this holy grail edge control gel like the best you need this gel so I'm just gonna talk to you guys about the pros and cons of this Joe and if I would recommend it and all that so before we get started if you're not already subscribed to my channel be sure to do that right now please and let's begin so I got this job because I exercise snapchat followers like you know what's a good gel like I need a strong job because like ecostyler wasn't working for me for what I was trying to do and everybody was recommending this so I bought it because one is a cheap Joe it was only three dollars like I know a lot of people were recommending me joe's that were like maybe smaller than this for like twelve thirteen fourteen dollars I'm like but why so I bought this one so you know it's a really affordable gel the pros first with the cons okay so I'll just talk about like the pros of this job first and like when I use it and stuff like that so first of all this gel is very sticky instead of wet like ecostyler gel exceeds ever used it so this is literally the consistency of the gel it's very very sticky rather than you know maybe like water-based it's very I don't even know like so that may be a good thing or a bad thing for you depending on your preference of gels but I like that it was sticky instead of wet because it was just different from what I was using so I was like okay if it's different then you know what I'm saying so it's a good and bad that it's sticky because it's like it makes it really easy when you're brushing it like if you're like slicking down your hair it's really easy but like once you're done you're here you need to let go wash your hands cuz your hands are super sticky after you use this gel so this Jo doesn't really make your hair curl up and I guess that's because it's not like a wet gel like I said it's more sticky so like I don't know if you've ever noticed we like ecostyler gel like if it's not laying flat all the way don't like make your hair curl up and then your hair is not even laying anymore like this Joe doesn't do that so it doesn't make your hair curl oh so that's good I noticed that this Joe lays my hair like defects like better than eco styler gel better than got to be better than any Joe that I tried this really lays my hair down and it keeps it down like if I wear my hair slicked down for a day I can wear for the next three days like that and it'll be fine like this Joe is so strong like so that is a really good thing obviously some pictures of how I wore it but like some of these Styles I could really wear for 3 4 or 5 days because I don't really prefer to because the jelly like I was gonna get to that but the gel make sure hair really hard and I don't really like that in my hair but if I wanted to I could wear the same style for probably up to week I sometimes mix this Joe with other gel like eco styler gel like I'll use maybe like half and half and mix it in my hand put in because this Joe it's just so sticky also I don't like putting this gel all over my head because like I said it makes your hair really hard and when I wear my hair sleek down I really feel like I had like a freaking armor swimming cap on my head like I really don't like that feeling so I try and mix it with other jobs just so it's not as it's a little bit more diluted by the other Joe's if that makes sense I also don't like to put this gel all over my hair because it gives at least my hair a little tint now if your hair is black or whatever it's not gonna tint your hair but since this Joe is yellow I noticed that when my hair was like platinum and when it was purple when I would put the gel you would know that you would see the yellow like the yellow would make the platinum yellow instead of you or like the yellow would mix with the purple and make it look kind of off so I don't like the tint but that's really not a problem unless your hair is like blonde or any other light color but if your hair's like a natural dark brown or whatever that's not even gonna be a problem for you so other than edges because that's what everybody talks about about this Joe is other than edges it's also good for like slipping down your hair or slicking your hair into a ponytail as I've been talking about I prefer to only use this gel on my edges because there's a lot that I don't like about the gel like how hard to make sure how sticky it is and a few other things that I literally like to just keep it at a minimum and only do my edges with me and that's it I try not to put this gel all over my whole head but yeah this hair when it rather than flaking like a lot of jobs do since it's so sticky it's literally like glue once it dries and then rather than flaking it kind of just like peels off into little like glue balls or something like that like it doesn't flake but there's some type of like glue residue that I really really don't like which is another reason I don't like put it all over my head but yeah like so it doesn't flake and I wish I had pictures to better describe what I'm trying to explain because I feel like some of y'all aren't gonna really understand what I mean by that but like it's like when the gel is starting to come off or whatever it like will peel and then like roll up into a little gel ball and like that will not look good if that's like all around your hairline and stuff like that like that's another thing that I don't like about the gel so that's another reason I try to keep it at a minimum so that it does not really do that I like to use this Joe best when it's wet I mean when my hair is wet one because like the wet Nick's wedding is mixed with the stickiness kind of like balances out the stickiness like you know what I'm saying since it's not a wet gel like ecostyler gel I like it way better and plus period with a lot of Joe's it works better with water so that's just for most gels for me but yeah there's still I like to use it when my hair is wet or damp so another thing that this gel is good for is for like please lace front wigs lace for these wigs frontals all of that you know it'll it works as an adhesive to hold that down to because I remember I tried I used this as to lay this down before I got what I use now and it held so you can use this if you don't have anything else but I wouldn't because like I said I don't like that whoo peeling process and after all day like once your whole front of your hairline is peeling that looks bad that does not look good so if this is like the only thing that you have to let your hair I would use it but I wouldn't go out and buy this to lay down my hair frontal or whatever but I would use it to lay my edges there really is like a noticeable difference between ecostyler gel and this gel like I know I compared it a lot to ecostyler in this Joe just because he goes a really popular gel but there really is a significant difference like I remember a lot of when a lot of people were telling me to buy this I'm like am I really gonna notice a difference but like no there's really a difference there's really a difference and like I said I'm gonna include pictures in this video like I said this is three dollars so it's really cheap it's really affordable and it's really worth it this is the only color that I've tried and Gorillaz not I know there's another one like a blue and I think there's a red and there may be more but this is the only color I've tried so I cannot compare any other colors to the dough or I can't give you any input or opinions on any of the other colors I meant to split this video into pros and cons but as I talked about one topic it kind of led to another so I mean pretty much you can decide what's a pro and con to you because a lot of pros and cons are by preference you may like that it's sticky instead of what somebody may not like that you know what I'm saying so it really just depends on your preferences actually and the last thing census gel is so sticky instead of way this Jo doesn't work with every single kind of scarf if you're laying your edges down I would use it I would use a silkier scarf to hold my hair down on one side put the gel in my hair because just because it's so sticky it doesn't really work well with certain types of scarves and if you have like the wrong kind of scarf when you go to pull it off like in mace stick to the scarf and like lift up with it wear it like might make it white like I don't know certain scarves just do weird things with the gel so I would just use like a silky ER scarf with this type of gel just because of how sticky it is so those are pretty much all the pros and cons of this gels so I'd kind of just get into like my final overview of the gel and like if I would recommend you know what I'm saying so I really do like this gel and I would recommend it it's a very strong gel it'll have your edges laid if you're slipping down your hair it'll have your hair slicked like it'll do whatever you need it to do the only downsides about this Jo like I said I don't like the the flaking process even though it's not really flaking it's more like peeling and I don't like that whole process and I don't like how hard it makes your hair but I mean Jo makes your hair hard so what can you really expect um so I would recommend this Jo at a minimal use like for your edges maybe or something like that or minimal use I would recommend that each other and minimally use if you want to use this gel on your whole head I would recommend mixing it with another Jo that you may have but if you don't have another job this will work really good on your hair like I said I just don't like some of the cons that there's Jo creates you know what I'm saying so I would recommend it and there aren't that many downsides to it but there are some so just take that into consideration and that's pretty much it I'm sorry that this video wasn't like it's a Soria look at me laying my edges with the gel but I mean there's millions of those so I just wanted to give you my opinion on the Jo if you were thinking about buying it so I hope that this video was helpful for you guys just comment if you have any questions give this video a thumbs up and like I said if you're not already subscribed to my channel be sure to do that right now please and other than that I'll see you guys in my next video bye", "6z_3NHB9Yek": "what's crackin late Jimmy already know it is your boy rut mr. pepper plans my small no blood today I got

this at the end of the night and come completely out of it I got you the video is sponsored by hold on this video is sponsored by hair baby all the details about this week will be in my description box down below so let's go ahead and get right into the video if you I have been keeping up with my real hair series it's been about two weeks since I've straightened my hair my dams are starting to come back I have errands that I need to run today and I can't go anywhere with this ponytail so let's do some makeup and get out for the day okay get my makeup done this is the way that I'm I've been working out ya see mother so this is the wig it was sent to me from here Vivi it's already been opened I like to open my wigs when I get there this is the wig it does have the removable adjustable there I love that companies add these on now saves us so much time to into the measure and sell them on ourselves a comb in the back two columns on the side those come in very handy when you want to wear a week without gluing you down the hairline is pre plucked and the nos are already bleached thrown time saved just apply it and we're out the door I'm going to show you exactly how in this videos I did send me an additional elastic band as well girls wear bras so you know how to use the adjustable band super easy to different wig cap colors lots of shades of black okay little clips as well as a comb and also a hair VV care card I'm gonna go ahead now and just remove all of the excess lace that way I can begin to apply it to my it you don't speakerphone okay I said you know if you want to say hey because this videos gonna be a collapse it's gonna be a voiceover if I already have brakes or something that would be cool but if you guys saw in my vlog my hair it's currently in a state of being a hot mess and needing to be washed so I definitely don't want to go out of the house like this and everything don't have time to wash it really either so I'm just gonna plate it up in this little ponytail that I plan on watching my hair tomorrow this will just hold me over so I can bend these look cute for the day this is a hypothetical video what do you mean play along no I gotta run some errands just tell you to plan I'll get you out we'll watch you longer no more don't throw this cap on here I'm not even gonna worry about my ponytail or anything we're not gluing her down or anything with you being dirty like this I wanna watch me ride tomorrow yes get the wig I'm glad that she's already straight to this let's work for me like I might just have to run the flat iron through it and get out of the shipping tanks okay so I'm gonna put the strap on the latch strap since we're not were doing any glowing or anything we need it to be tired oh I didn't cut the lace in the back this little part right here okay nobody else see that we just gonna put it off and now cut yours off in the back I think but I'm gonna run so and it's already on the tightest strap if you want it to be even more snows I'll show you out how I still use the common so I have on the weed cap and for extra security can't you just laugh this is gonna feature no I like talking to you I'm record okay i copay if i was in but then a little tacky but go ahead I try when I'm done I just rap sing it I put mine in here where it's nice and snug and tight and I like how I could it kind of jagged I've been seeing a lot of people do that lately where they don't cut it like where it's too straight straight okay since my hair it's not so down I'm just gonna stick my Lester band on my ponytail to help hold it down even further if you just have to wear your hair like this without breaking you down like me we're gonna adjust it and see if Harry be warned straight out of the box don't have top anything else oh she's good you take those combs to put them under there help my leg this column in the back and you stick that underneath bigger now she's smelled seriously you know like snugs okay no baby hairs no none of the extra stuff that youtubers like dude we don't have time today so make sure that the wig lines up with your own hair line I have a widow's peak so I make sure I covered it up I don't want my own hair peeking through I'm taking some of the lot about informal OSHA and applying that just towards the front portion to help to mold this down okay this is what we have so far before I do anything to the part of some of my lights away break there's not many cakes really to get out of this week honestly I'm extra so we're gonna do a little bit more to the part because why not I'm just gonna take my same powder that I use on my face and just touch up the front portions of the wig the wig was already blending with my skin tone pretty well this was just an extra step you definitely don't have to do this but if you just really wanted to be like cool alive and this is another step that you can take and I'm a little extra so I'm gonna keep going but you all can see that we really could have stopped right there wanted to park back a little bit further so I'm using the foaming lotion so help me do that it just helps the hair to move around and you can also choose to push this side back and pull that part forward since we're not going it down that'll help to have that lace absolu to much of the concealer because I wanted to go in a little bit more but I just used my Beauty Blender or my morphe sponge to just blend that out some more and now this is what we have but of course I'm still a little extra this is what it looks like on the side by the way since I only blended it just in the middle so I'm gonna go ahead and do the entire front just in case you want to mow down then turn apart you just put the foam a lotion on there smooth it down put your hair scarf on it for a little while and let this sit some marinate your edges oh so this is basically a look is that what you tell me Wow so about five minutes later this is what we have okay okay work with it let it sit longer if you would like while you do some makeup or just clean up the mess that you might have made this is what the hair looks like I definitely didn't even have to Flatiron it I'm loving the way that it looks I can just throw this on go run my errands look at the hairline like did you see me pick up tweezers in this video I don't think so creep look what fossil

video I'm talking about royal icing and consistency adjustments realizing is my favorite decorating medium but let me back up before I dive into how to make it let me talk about the typical decorating icings that are used on cookies and why it is I prefer this one typically there are three one is royal icing the second is confectioners icing also known as glaze and the other is rolled fondant which is a sweet sugary dough I prefer royal icing because it's made with confectioners sugar and egg whites as opposed to confectioners icing which is made with confectioner sugar and some other liquid elements such as water or lemon juice or milk and that might not sound like a big difference but it is the egg whites have a lot of protein in them and they cause the icing to set up and dry very very quickly that becomes important if you're doing a lot of cookies that require a lot of layering of icing the faster those under layers can drive the more quickly you can move on to the next step likewise if you're doing wet-on-wet techniques which we'll talk about a couple videos from now where the icings go down wet next to each other the faster the dry the less likely are the colors are to bleed into one another so there are a lot of advantages to royal icing from a drying standpoint those egg whites also give it a high tensile strength that's the engineer and me coming out but it may means it makes the icing more stretchy so it allows for more delicate line work and detail work as for roll fondant I mentioned that that's a sweet sugary dough some decorators will cover their whole cookies with it I'm really not fond of doing that I don't like the texture of it it will dry crunchy but when you chew on it it reverts to kind of a gummy quality which I think interferes with the taste of the cookie so I do love how rolled fondant can be shaped and molded but I'll typically only use it for small isolated elements on cookies that one can pluck off if they don't like the texture of it so royal icing is my favorite and I'm going to show you how I make it the recipe is also an ultimate cookies and cookie swap but I think it also helps to see how I blend it because consistency is so so with his icing as we'll learn not only in this video but as we move forward so here we've got I start with my basic batch of royal icing starts with two pounds of powdered sugar that's a standard sized bag in the grocery store and I've already got that in the bowl to that I add about 1/2 teaspoon of cream of tartar which is an acid that lends a little acidity obviously sharpness to the icing but more importantly it keeps the white whiter over a longer period of time so if you're doing show pieces like gingerbread houses that white icing will stay really crisp some decorators add white food coloring to their icing to keep the white I've never had to do that and perhaps it's because I use cream of tartar so that goes in at this point you want to give it a quick stir to distribute that cream of tartar and then the next element that goes in is the egg whites in order to contain any risk of contamination from Salmonella you want to be certain to work with pasteurized egg whites which come in different forms you can use those that come in the container and typically five large egg whites which is what I call for in this recipe would be about 11 to 12 tablespoons of this product alternatively you can work with pasteurized shell shell eggs so these eggs are actually pasteurized in the shell and they're marked with a P and that's what I've got measured out over there I will say that these eggs are much more difficult to separate in the typical egg so you may have to use a little bit more than five large egg whites you might have to crack six of these to get the equivalent liquid content one other alternative to using moist pasteurized eggs is meringue powder and this works well as as well this is simply dehydrated egg whites with some other additives that typically a sugar in it and some other clumping agents that keep it powdery and this would need to be hydrated that is mixed with warm water before you actually put it into the royal icing I typically don't work with it because it can be gritty unless you really dissolve it first and it tends to make the royal icing a little bit more spongy than if you were to work with these products here but that's also a possibility okay on to making it I've got roughly five large egg whites in there they're just going into the ball now this juncture since I've got a really small mixer here I'm going to stir to combine so my powdered sugar doesn't fly everywhere and start this on low speed and my royal icing I'm before I start that my royal icing mixes to a very thick consistency I do that on purpose because when you start mixing you'll notice that the icing is kind of gray and murky and loose you have to mix it a relatively long period of time for it to turn crisp white and the incorporation of air is what makes it go from gray to white so I'm so it's very very thick when I do this because I don't want to pump a lot of air bubbles in it I need to mix it long enough that it gets white but I don't want to incorporate a lot of air so I mix it thick if I were to mix it much looser I'd end up with much more air bubbles in the end product so I'm going to start low just to get it going and once that I see that I've got a mass of sugar combined with the egg whites I'm just going to scrape it down because the powdered sugar does like to kind of ride up the side of the mixed mixer and make sure it's all in the center part of the mixer and it'll be safe pretty soon to turn this to high speed I only mix for about one to two minutes that's generally long enough to get this really sharp white and very very thick okay so it's starting to come together and I'm just going to turn it up to high speed and we're going to continue to mix until it's very very thick okay so now the powdered sugar and the egg white serve have come together but it's still kind of an off-white it's kind of a dirty white so I'm going to kick it up the high high speed the highest it will go pull makes this maybe for one to two minutes and you should see a color change it should be very crisp white by the time it's done you may have to scrape down the sides of the bowl in the process but we're just going to let this go for a bit before I do that and as you incorporate air not only does it get whiter but the icing also thickens considerably now some bakers have recipes that require them to beat for 10 minutes I see no reason for that I beat simply as long as it takes person becomes thick and very crisp white and usually that's about 1 to 2 minutes after it's come together and we're about at that point so I'm going to turn off the mixer and show you what it looks like so as you can see crisp white very very very thick in fact this is so thick I call it glue in my book and you'll hear me referring back to glue as in the course of these videos and I'm referring to icing at this consistency that's made with two pounds of powdered sugar about 5 large egg whites and a half teaspoon cream of tartar this is the perfect consistency for putting together gingerbread houses and gluing three-dimensional cookies together but obviously it's not going to work to create a smooth icing topcoat and some other effects on cookies that we'll talk about later it needs to be thin to the right consistency for almost every decorating task so I'm going to show you a little bit about how to do that but first before I do that this would be the time to actually flavor up the icing so let me get the beater back on there I encourage you to flavor up your icing to taste everybody has a different flavor profile but I do have some suggested flavor combinations and quantities in my book I'm going to put in about in each each flavoring flavors differently as well extracts flavor differently than oils lemon tastes different than anise so again flavoring to taste is usually a good rule of thumb in my book I put in a teaspoon of lemon we'll stir that up but it's important that the cookies taste as good as they look so we want to make sure that's properly flavored and now we're ready to move on to consistent coloring the icing and consistency adjustments normally for this task I would dole out a smaller quantity of the icing because that's that that quantity there is about four and a half to five and a half cups depending on how long you mixed it and the size the exact size of the egg whites and that can cover hundreds of cookies top coat hundreds of cookies and often times I'm not doing a run that large so I usually will dole it into smaller quantities as I am about to do to color it up and now is the time I like to color it actually when it's very very thick as opposed to loosen I don't know what the science is here but I find that and you'll see I just want to point this out this clings very nicely to the spoon and in fact you might come back tomorrow and I'd still be standing here and still be stuck to this spoon so this is what I mean about the glue consistency that's kind of what you're looking for at this stage and this is the stage at which I color because for whatever reason I find that the color sets better with less modeling and spotting if I mix it in when it's thick and then later thin to different consistencies if I put the color in when the icing is very very loose it tends to migrate more as it dries and I just never get the same smooth even finish as I do if I call her this way a word on food colorings as you're going to hear in all of these videos consistency is king for your icing so if you're taking you know all these precautions to bring your icing to the right consistency the last thing you want to do is mess with it by putting in a lot of liquid food coloring to make a really intense color if that's what you're going for so I tend to prefer in fact I very much prefer working with a highly concentrated food coloring and I work with a liquid gel also known as a soft gel food coloring highly concentrated and a little bit goes a long way so it doesn't mess with the icing consistency as much you can also work with a gel or paste food coloring which is even more concentrated but the disadvantage of this form is it usually comes in a little container which makes it very difficult to dole out into the icing you have to do it with a toothpick in this case with a trussing needle what use for other tasks and just is very very messy and it doesn't allow you to create color formulas the advantage of this type is that it often comes with a dropper top which allows me to actually count out drops of coloring and create precise formulas I'm going to show you what I mean by a little bit goes a long way I'm just going to put in a couple drops of pink here another comment on food colorings I prefer certain brands some have very strong aftertaste particularly in the colors of blue black and purple and I find that Chef master brand not only does it come in this size with this dropper top but it tends to be much more mildly flavored so a little bit of pink goes a little bit along goes quite a long way as you can see that's just two drops in about a cup of icing that's about a medium pink if I wanted a little bit darker we just add a few more drops and this is still a glue consistency but if I were to use it for other tasks it's going to need to be thinned out and I'm going to talk a little bit about consistency adjustments there are many that I described in the book but I'm going to talk about the three that I use most commonly the first is for outlining which is creating thin lines with a parchment pastry cone and that requires a relatively thick icing but not quite as thick as this generally I add about Oh half a teaspoon to 3/4 of a teaspoon of water to icing of this thickness to get it to the right consistency I'm not sure the exact quantity and I add that to about one cup of my glue I'm not sure what quantity I have in this bowl so I'm just going to eyeball it at this point I can do this all by feel just by how the icing looks and feels to the spoon but if you're a beginner I would recommend you start with the guidelines in the book the measurements I provide and move from there I'm just going to add a touch more water and you'll notice that I'm not using the electric mixer at this point because I'm adding moisture in liquid I don't want to be whipping it at high speed on an electric mixer and popping a lot of air bubbles into it so I'm going to be stirring from here on out when I do any kind of thinning of icing so this is looking about where I want it for outlining which is again piping thin lines and borders on cookies it's about 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon for cup of glue and what I'm looking for is for it to fall and blobs off my spoon essentially like so and that should be a perfect consistency for outlining we'll talk more about consistency adjustments in each of the videos as I tackle the actual technique but again I just wanted to show you these few consistency adjustments so you get a sense of what you're really looking for here's another roughly 1 cup of glue that I made before and this time I want to loosen it to what I call I'm gonna get this icing off my hand what I call top coating consistency which is the consistency with which you would spread icing on a cookie to leave a flat glassy surface and I often do top coating without a border so I like this a little bit thicker than what you might know of as flooding consistency which we'll talk about next so for top coating to this cup of glue I generally add about one and a half to two and a half teaspoons of water again stirring stirring it in make and I do this by feel now but because it has become second nature I do a lot a lot of cookie decorating every day of the week but to start helps to measure it out and also to know what visual cues you're really looking for I do have a range on this this one and a half to two and a half teaspoons because I want it a little bit thicker top coating for me is covering a cookie without any outline or dam so I wanted a little bit thicker for smaller cookies so it doesn't run off the cookie edge it can be a little bit looser for larger cookies so that's why I have that range on the the proportions there and I'm just going to put in and add another half teaspoon that takes us to about 2 teaspoons of water in there and this is going to be just about right now this one wasn't tinted but hopefully you can see here I'm looking for the icing to flow relatively slowly off the spoon as opposed to plopping for outlining is flowing relatively slowly and those tracks you know when the icing hits the bowl it creates these tracks they should disappear in roughly 15 second or so into the bulk of the rest of the icing if it's at the right consistency so that's top coding consistency when I'm not working with the icing because of the protein in the egg whites it crusts very very quickly so I always cover it with plastic wrap sometimes and oftentimes flush with the plastic wrap to prevent that skin from forming because after you've done this the last thing you want is ice crystals or rather sugar crystals in the bulk of bulk of your icing because they can plug parchment cones and reach all sorts of havoc oops this one I've already mixed outlining consistency earlier I'm going to take 1/3 cup of the thick glue I think this is a little less than a cup and show you what it looks like when it comes to flooding consistency so to distinguish flooding from top coating flooding is when I actually already outlined the perimeter of the cookie and I want to flood the interior with a really loose icing to give it a smooth top coat I could work with top coating icing for this most certainly but you can move a little bit faster if you just loosen it up a bit and since you've got the outline acting as a dam on the cookie there's no risk of runoff if you have it a little bit looser and in this case I generally use anywhere from 2 to 3 teaspoons of water per cup of that glue and again there's a range on it because I will go heavier with the water if I've got a larger cookie to smoothly topcoat and you'll see some of this in the next video so I think I've put in about two teaspoons there maybe a little bit too much for this quantity having a hard time work in the water in and now when working with this flooding consistency icing you want to be especially careful not to pump too much air into it because this is when you're going to be incorporating a lot more bubbles because the icing is looser so I'm trying to stir as gently as possible this to me I overshot with the water I had less than a cup of icing in here and it's running really fast off the spoon what I'm typically looking for is it to run less fast off the spoon and for the tracks to disappear in 10 seconds or less and I don't know if you can see but they're disappearing almost immediately but you know that's actually not a big deal and I'm glad I made this steak the other thing you know that tells me I made a mistake is I've got clumps of icing that aren't distributing well into the liquid so I've made a mistake but you can always correct it by adding more powdered sugar to thicken it up I do prefer to sift the powdered sugar in because powdered sugar can get clumpy and those clumps can pop clogged cones and pastry bags and things and hopefully this will thicken it up just enough to about the right consistency I like it when I don't make these kinds of mistakes because less stirring you do of flooding icing the less air you kick into it so I may have added just a just overshot a bit too much but if you see a lot of air bubbles in it you can wrap the bowl on the counter top that pops some of the air bubbles as we get into the outlining top coating video and flooding videos I'll be showing you how to use a trussing needle also known as a turkey laser to kind of pop any air bubbles that do end up kicking themselves up into the icing so there you go a little bit thicker it's got a little bit more body and it's not racing off the spoon quite as fast this would be a good consistency for a very large cookie I might even thicken it up further for a smaller cookie say to one to two inch cookie that's it unroyal icing and the basic consistency adjustments there are many more consistency adjustments dedicated to each techniques such as dipping stenciling and marbling which you'll find in ultimate cookies and as we'll talk about in the future videos and until then Liz sweetly", "0ej4SrRAoPs": "and we are live welcome everyone sorry we were uh waiting for one more participant who will hopefully be jumping on shortly but uh i guess this conversation was inspired by uh some instagram posts right yeah it's a long-running conversation definitely and observation of how do we communicate when we're discussing the things we do you know gosh it's it's something i've been like my emblem for my seat pack says working on since 85 and i lost context to which land races were in a hybrid about 93 the poly hybridization that was coming through in commercial smoke was getting complex and i i could say it was that nigerian this had afghan and this had some mexican but then once it got past a triple poly hybrid and we started getting out with these fancy elite strains i didn't know what the heck was in it it was great but um yeah so so uh but the discussion of the land race is is um what does that word mean when somebody says it the people want to bring up fisticuffs over an acute definition but if we open up the dictionary there is no definition in the dictionary of the word land race so people appoint all sorts of different scientists as it's this or um and and and they literally people ought to get fisticuffs online over you know as far as you can um i'm right stuff and it's like well the fact of the matter is words get used in common context and in um as well as uh scientific context as well as um uh yeah so that's the broad spectrum there and then when somebody's gonna insist on my jargon or my word usage then it complicates things because someone over here has heard something and just need to clarify really what everybody means when they say it and um the fact of the matter is that does range from completely wild and if it exists there's debate on to whether wild cannabis natural stands of wild cannabis actually exists that are not feral right and so hence the technical taxonomic term sativa which means cultivated right um people get in debate over whether there's three specifications that have been determined through genetic information now rudor alice sativa in africanica okay and and so all this stuff can get confusing and how uh were these all escaped from cultivation are they pretty um i'm sorry uh greater driest period right did the stuff distribute before then on the winds or the birds or is it all in this uh historical period okay these are these are huge questions that we can ask in defining whether even a wild stand of cannabis that's been there for time and more memorial uh is actually feral or native right and this is this is a like um wow that that goes back when did cannabis separate from hops and i didn't i didn't take the second to look it up was it 20 million years ago i don't remember exactly but but so specification and diversification and was it wild all the time the man once it got to you know we know in the in the chinese tomb i believe 6 000 years and i'm just going off my head i've not researched this stuff recently and these are articles we can all verify but they found them the pale skin blonde haired blue eyed guy that was buried with uh canvas plants and they're like yeah that stuff was potent right um so so we've had this genetics around for a long time and people have been cultivating it a long time and how long is it once it's gone feral does it become naturalized at what point is it a native plant um or a new endemic versus an island endemic these are terms that people use i try to keep in the middle ground here so everyone understands between the scientists and the end consumer of a seed for instance because it's really hard to buy commercially produced land races any level because most of them take a long time they're difficult to grow and there's all sorts of intricacies to growing them um is it the same thing once you move it outside of its place of origin and those are all part of the definitions that that are discussed um is how true this day is does it stay true to seed is it how much diversity is in there in it and and once it's left its place of origin when is it no longer a land race and it's become something else because somebody's inbred it just by the nature of bottlenecking once you've removed from that population that's so diverse with all the males and females blowing in the wind right whether feral or native or if it's the commercial population that's produced near one of these feral or wild populations all of this changes oh go ahead no no keep going all right so all this has changed exactly what it is in your hand when you have what we might call a land race right so that word in its usage is is broad spectrum right it it covers a lot of stuff and so so what i'd like to do is i got sick and tired of saying in my understanding of what a land race is and and part of it might have been fantasy from just ignorance right and that's that's what we're trying to alleviate here but growing up and then going through uh college and studying um plant breeding from the perspective of a forester the term land race was referred to as the wild stock right and so to me in my mind land race is like um was was uh taking a woof and back crossing it in staking out your prized breed of race dog in alaska so it can get bred to by the alpha male the wolf pack and yuri and so so the wolf pack being in the land race was my understanding of what the land race was right now of course other people have a very different understanding of what land races and and there's some very firm um astute uh beliefs and people are firm on this and that's their right that land race only means stuff that's been cultivated by the handyman so it would be actually the pack of of the race dogs that's getting um cultivated and not the wolf okay and so if we think about that that's two major schools of thought right there or were in the definition of what constitutes a land race so so would the person who calls the race dog land race call the wolf wild and feral or and they would say the word is not a flood yeah okay so for them and i'm sorry i even use the word race dog okay sled dog would be better please sorry scratch race dog sled dog okay so we don't confuse land race to race dog because that's too very if you look at the uh on my instagram today i posted because there is no definition of land race in any paper dictionary that i have and i collect dictionaries they don't have any newer ones but they they go back into the 50s um there's no land race is this is a common usage word in the english language and so so how do we agree on this stuff and there's just have all these papers we can research and say it's this or that and i presented one and the way i read it from my perspective is like it says yeah it's it's barely worked by man or or it's it's not it's wild okay and that's how i read that paper but someone else who has a different perspective reads it and says it says clearly that it's worked by a man okay so i'm not saying you have to use it my way i'm saying this when i'm talking these are the words i use and this is uh and why i use them in in the discussion definitely developed on my instagram page and um but the part of it had to do with azarian has um developed this wonderful concept of [Music] um looking at the plant where it developed on the earth and so again for my forestry perspective i'm studying all the plants and identifying where i might find one on the landscape so i can know what a plant community is in um like dealing with what kind of trees i should be planting on the landscape maybe um you can identify it by the brush and and the plants that grow there uh because of elevation and you know latitude um and your your relativity to bodies of water like the ocean or various other things like that where if you've got aurora any uh how how the landscape affects weather right and that has to do with where you are uh north and south in elevation okay and so i know it is the further north i go i can find lichens at lower elevations but the further south i go towards the equator in the northern hemisphere i have to go to a higher elevation to find a lichen or a pine tree because they have specific requirements they've adapted to but if you go north those can be found at lower elevations and that has to do with proximity to the sun right and how much um spectrum of light you get when the sun's affecting you right and so so we all talk about our spectrum and our and our growth whether it's in a greenhouse and we're adapting with supplemental light or if it's in a closed environment and we want to be um uh specifically maximizing our returns for the energy inputs and lowering our footprint right and understanding the spectrum that the plant that we're working with originated in to maximize its returns is a really pretty cool tool um that's just one way i interpret what i see here when i look at his um graphic that he's come up with in a land race description so i actually just quickly i found i found the the better quality version of the graphics um but do you want to start by just setting the table with with when you personally with an understanding that other people mean different things but when you personally say a word what it means to you so i'll walk through the slides and you can just talk about each one sure sure yeah and and this is you know i've been typing out my scribble scrabble uh chicken scratch i can't type i can't write and and the stuff uh guitar you know it had any people follow this is the words i've been using as long as i've been teaching uh through the internet and were developed through my diverse personal i don't just read cannabis medicine plants i have bred uh my yeast from shall we say land race corn varieties um to have a multi-colored blue corn and that you know i've worked on this for for 20 years um and i have it growing outside right now yeah and that can express its ancient corn origins this essentially it can come out with with really bizarre uh expressions of its original genetic that you will never find in a polyhybrid okay and this is where here's a huge separation once it's gotten past a certain amount of baldneck and we'll get through this in these slides it's no longer a land race it becomes inbred and it becomes a cultivar and it becomes and we have just like looking at soil horizons it's like there's there's oh horizon there's the oa horizon there's the a horizon yeah and and so there's that section where it inner phases right and and so at what point does it no longer be a land race and call it so yeah go ahead go ahead bring those up and uh we'll go through those in my perspective and again i do i collect wild grasses to me a true land race has been a wild plant that that woof out in the woods right okay and um zero hand of man steering the populations these are the rarest of land rays if they exist in the cannabis population we can debate that my understanding is there are maybe a hundred different wild populations in china alone talking to somebody who lived there a couple years ago who's collected some of them these crazy wild treks in the no man's land and literally canyoneering and mountaineering in the wild remote um and so um right right intermixing the entire product so we're talking about this is the most genetically diverse populations when they're when they're wild because they have all the males and females nothing's been removed and they're intermixing through the wind at all times and just being naturally selected to that environment they become endemic and however much time it might take that's a great a great debate because that covers the next one which is the feral wild populations right and i claim to have a uh a true north american land race and this is the word usage i'm using where it's a um and actually so before general language we had we had uh pharaoh we had native wild in separation in true land race and um down in the red there's a bottle okay i missed uh what's going on there um and and so the feral naturalize adapted and and so in the discussion we can say that that could be happening through as man moved around as man traded um and or through animal transfer and it gets to a new location of gaps and so there's there's a great um a great diversity in how long it takes any given plant to adapt like with garlic which is pretty much clone only unless you know the secrets of actually sexually reproducing garlic which can be done um there it's a clone a colonial clone itself clones right and it totally adapts through man selecting it right over and it usually takes about three years when you put it into a new environment you plant the best of the cloves you get off a bulb boom boom boom and you select for the best cloves to come out of your new soil and microbial and air environment right and and rain and water coming out of whatever tap you're feeding it right all those things are affecting how that garlic is going to grow or the field and the difference from my my home here and 17 miles away in in the sand and the in the the clay and the in the irrigation water versus the tap water here right so it takes three years for that kind of even in that sort of distance in space in the landscape and temperatures and things three years for it to adapt with garlic it's a clone and you're choosing each one right i'm choosing that clone that's that's expressing um epigenetically okay so so we have that feral adaptation whether sailor dropped some seed um whether it was a farmer growing their rope or growing a medicine plant or whatever it was that it was being cultivated for and transferred around the world by the hand of man you have or whether it was a bird or whatever it's gone feral and adapted and that's what my new mexico land uh land grant is right and um and so it's it's escaped captivity at some point in time between the late 1500s and three generations ago of human occupation um and you know grandpa says it's old so um and my history understanding was that the priests brought what they needed with them and they were growing him back in the day when they were conquistadoran because they needed their brown robes and their ropes so you know how long it's that's hundreds of years okay through epigenetic adaptation um down in south america and central america and mexico we have other things that we classify as land race that have been they were brought over either and or by slaves sailors and uh what for not for different purposes whether it's uh medicine for physical medicine or medicine to spiritual medicine um for instance my my new mexico i'm sorry my nigerian yoruba bantu is a cultivar that is a regional uh expression there and that gets into our our different the next flight i guess it talks about those ones have been all been steered by the hand of man and some of them escaped and have wild populations near where man grows them okay and so the general usage that most people talk about land rays may or may not include that first category of wild that i call true landlace um but most people talk about land race they're thinking about these these fields that or or small plot small gardens that people utilize uh that involves the hand of man we're selecting no modern technology no laboratories being involved in this right um way i read the definitions used over time it is the most minimal usage of the hand of man if there is any involved in it so for instance over time and they talk about something that's been grown in place for time immoral um so um that that would be like a grain for instance right these old grains that people have grown in different places whether it's a rice or a wheat or a barley or corn here in america you know it was selected from a wild plant and it was grown in a region and it was selected using just like man that one looks a little better that one produced a little better that one if i plant it and eventually it's like this doesn't necessarily i'm going to grow if i don't plant it right i got to shuck it a couple of micro but eventually it's going to fade out over time it's going to be this weak little wild stand that's not barrel and they don't produce a whole lot if they don't get the proper tilling in the soil and things like that so so um grains can go back to feral too but but so associated with a land space a geographical area a nation um that embodies the people and the land okay so that that's the weather that that's going to do with with the geological forces that create the weather and the soil right and uh where you are in that northern latitude and that elevation zone um all that's that's going to affect both what the people who are using it um and or steering it or dealing with it so we're talking about a grain again that was selected a long time ago from being a wild plant and it was grown right in the same proximity as those wild plants over long generations and continue to be interacting with and eventually it was less interaction with the wild and more just like just an open population of males and females interacting but they didn't select into a bottleneck um and you know then and then we get into like people still using the general terminology for the land raise these cultivars they get once it's been collected by a botanist or a seed company or the name of the company that shall not be mentioned you know comes in and says this is now my invention because i found this one particular genetic strain um but it you know it was grown by this village in the india particular basmati rice for time immemorial right um and then so so i've got these cultivars and at what point was my cultivar no longer can i call it no longer land race right i've been growing pakistani chitchakush um that's one of these ones that derive from a wild population somewhere near the hindukus region of afghanistan um downhill it's south of there and in the foothills regions from the wild populations as i understand it originated um a lot of people say most of wild populations from afghanistan were wiped out during the russian occupation and those genetics only exist in seed collections is cultivars that have neck right um one of the things i wanted to point out with who was having is our around is is that they are actually in india uh there's a place that white people just really aren't really we're not allowed to go um it's a national preserve of genetic diversity of all plants and animals and species or not and that is like there's wild original cannabis growing there from time to memorial right and uh that is kind of so so when you get into some of the populations that people have have cultivated for sure ross and and areas nearby how far does that fall and go is it interacting and things like that are all asked questions and um some of the stuff i was going to bring up is how do we prevent um um man's pollution as we move things around and probably hybrids and distribute them and that's something my mentor lamented with in his own reality that he took seeds when he traveled the hippie trail and gathered from the sweet spots around the world where people were growing these garden varieties regional heirlooms uh in proximity to the wild populations and he was able to examine the wild population and go out and compare it with what they had in the garden and say well i want where am i getting my seed from right and um you know but he would leave some poly hybrids with them some people say in a smaller population you're going to pollute it and then a larger population is going to get wiped out but i have a hard time accepting that the small population gets wiped out and a bigger one just absorbs it that that's not in there somewhere is the recessive situation and so you know i'm kind of the understanding beliefs that you know besides these really remote pockets of wild genetics that aren't affected by anyone's pollen blowing around that's been selected by man there isn't a whole lot of wild stuff out there left um and that true original unadulterated even or those um i think a lot of the varieties have just been corrupted personally and that's one thing i'd like to talk to about is he seeing that and dealing with people and documenting folks around the world and and who are growing in situ and this created some really cool cooperatives to get these genetics out and rediversify um so so if you think about like an hourglass um you know wild populations got the most diverse it's got it's got all those nails going around females going around right right but as you get more selection it's getting narrower and narrower narrower right your bottleneck when you bring it out of the field and we have this cultivar and so um when someone uses the word land raise again a good a good thing we want to know is what level of that selection process is it at is it something that's grown in proximity to wild is it something that might have been a wild feral wild whatever right it can be super diverse it's also gonna be wild right that's it's gonna be wild you gotta tame it it takes work to bring that into submission to where it's something that like you can do a production thing um besides like being sadistic why would you even bother what most people say they see those little spanky little flowers and stuff like i why would you even bother with that man what what is what's your you know well having to fully understand fully better understanding of how everything works that's one thing for me um my desire and strife to produce more sustainable uh production methods you know affecting um um how how agricultural systems work in the world has been one of my life goals even along with being a household name for hard work and the best dad i can for my daughter doesn't my three three life goals and and so like uh you know if i collect wild grasses in my um hikes around on the hills and throw them in my front yard is it now a land race is the wild cultivar but we're not talking grasses i'm just using these examples these are things i do and when um you get for instance um something uh a a thai genetic right and there's a couple of uh it's kind of long understood from some of the older generations there's a highland and a lowland thai and that's stuff that you see in azarian's chart um describing um my my descriptions deal with the end user the concept of where did that come from is that coming from a garden patch in the jungle there's a bunch of wild plants and these things can grow for 18 months of flower after nine months of vegetation and throw off an entire arm of male flowers off of a female plant completely destroy somebody's growth regeneration's in if i didn't gain that wild genetic right and that's where my word usage comes from and why i want to expand like when people are talking it's like and then versus i've got i've got this pck that's been worked out i don't know how many generations canadian ran it before the guy i got it from got it and he ran it for six generations and i've now run three four i'm getting into like f5 of an inbred side shoot trying to keep two males and two females on my main line going right trying to keep that 60 40 purple but i've been selecting towards more potent purple right and then my offshoot is just like everything's these pinks and purples and oranges there ain't no green left except for on the leaf and it's got the frost and the potency of the green this is no longer pck right it's no longer pakistani just a fish at that point and and the my hybrid stuff is it still has diversity you're going to find my mentor told me walking in the fields around pakistan around the the um the titular kyber that um it was um the narrowest leaf plant he had ever experienced in all his travels right and all his breeding and and what for not was the what we call pakistani chittel chitralkush and mainline think of it as an indica because most of the selections were more of a wide leaf plant he says that was the narrowest plant he'd ever seen as far as leaf structure goes and i ended up getting some in and um they were coming out of this genetic that was already and read those many generations that were thinner than a pencil just amazing and i wish i could find these pictures and repost i don't think i have them on my instagram but um so so when when uh you see something from me called purple mutant chitchill stardust i literally found the narrowest leaf mutated inbred pakistani chips i don't know how what this guy i got it from said he thought he had read the trade out but there it was and i had to tease some pollen out of it because it seemed like such a runt right and this is the stuff that my mentor and i would discuss why would you do that well ended up producing one of the largest colas i'd ever grown it like out of a small pot of its you know downline descendant that so it's like you if you don't do it you're never gonna know it right it's like scott growing a moldy grow room so he knows how to fix it okay i do the same thing with with bugs and stuff but i also do the same thing with these runt plants and and so we're really just opening up the genetics of these plants and literally we we don't understand the true potential of individualized medicine regimes all this stuff that's we've lost a lot i mean there used to be 12 precursors to human and we really are or humanoid type things that were cruising around at one time and then we keep finding the indonesian hobbit people right and various other lineages that became us and that's all lost there might be a little bit of genetic code in some people and some regions of the world but for the most part so so we don't want to lose all these capacities of these plants and that's why we do preservation okay and that's why we we do these expansions first and when i get a hold of any genetic that's been bottlenecked or not i try and do an open pollination as many males and females as i can when and i do have um we all have the tendency of initially trying to remove um whatever mapredization we can right and so i try and do two of them where i do a selection of fibers one that didn't express her mathematicization or intersecting i'm gonna use that one um for in writing at the same time i'm doing an open pollination we get to the next situation is man that's a lot of work to do it's a passion right it's not for everybody there's a lot of intricacies for doing it when you get these plants in from different parts of the world one of the things that cued me into understanding the lighting and stuff um dj short we talked about in his projects when he's observing cultivars and moving around in his room where they would get different angles of light and different spectrums from the mixed lighting back in the day was hydro hps and metal halide right and that's all you had was the blue and red and then you would observe the ones would be stouter under direct angle of blue or red versus the side angle of one or the other and these are observations i make with timing a year putting things out from flip back into the sunshine and trying to determine like how do they respond with re-vegging and stuff and i'm kind of reverse engineering trying to figure out what's in this right what exactly went into this polypoly hybrid that i'm trying to breed to cross back across to my woof strengthen produce better skin what's going to pair with it and who am i going to give it to so and they ask me what fits in this region of the world right all these are reasons why i love what he's doing with this chart and describing the origins and then and it's just another way of describing where we found failure in for instance calling it a wide leaf or narrow leaf drug type when we see the pakistani agency that we all think of as an indica it actually can have an extremely narrow leaf and um of course everything i'm saying here there's somebody out there who's sitting there going [ __ ] alex is full of [ __ ] right this is my reality this is my experience this is how i've gone through the last 35 years and come to this point and i'm trying to explain to you how we all need to communicate and make sure we keep moving forward and why i i've given up on saying you have to talk like i talk or if you see my discussion on this today it came up and it's like yeah this is people get up and arms over and we have all the egos and and and i go back to it's like i'm owning it up you know everyone loves frenchie and i had a real bad experience with him over word usage literally the word keef and and i've been using it since i was a teenager and i broke out the dictionary that was printed the year i was born that literally describes the etymology of the word keith from old moroccan i'm sorry old old um uh arabic right and and the frenchies first experience with the word was in morocco and it describes chopped up leaf and tobacco and that's awesome that's his experience and and but for whatever reason our frequencies are so tight and there was this incongruency in our communication and then sorry you're not an [ __ ] we just miscommunicated and had a this is what i'm trying to say here is let's all continue to move forward on this communication understanding why there's so many diverse forms there's also irzon on his page shows these guys and i want to say it's in miramar i could have this wrong but these guys use that exact um technique for consumption of cannabis where it is literally this pressed ball of cannabis that they chop up with tobacco and it's this like regional process and i and i meant to at one point when we were in that discussion look at what the word was that they use for it okay and and because there's there's a culture that's using that today and has that process and that's their culture like that their exclusive consumption process is this really crappy just feel wet process packed together into these big bundles and like anything that in the western culture and they have this amazing cultural process and a piece of a special knife in the stone and then they carry a tobacco and they a little thing of water to wet it with and they mix it all up and they make this paste and they smoke it and that's how they consume and you know we want our dabs or some of us do i like flour personally whatever or hash i love that i've been making hash since mid 80s and i haven't stopped um i like playing with it i like handling i love all the different forms of it from around the world and there's some amazing different techniques of producing resins and but we all today use the word keef the same way it's that resin that collects at the bottom of the bag and it's very similar to the chocolate but the original word means feels good and the best translation i could find um and so uh yeah i'm i love making land race um hashes the different flavors and stuff um yeah so so i guess i was heading into um about like some of the intricacies of growing and you know understanding those lights and stuff in your grow room and understanding that using more blue light when you're in flower sometimes might be important to keep a plant from stretching out you're stealing um and uh i don't know i've got i had a list of things that we were gonna walk so just quickly on our slide chart so after general land raising garden variety right so i kind of went through that just talking about how as we move through from from selecting a wild or feral or whatever it is population something's getting grown in a small plot whatever in primitive agriculture it's going to spread it's going to go feral and you've got wild populations nearby um a great example parallel example would be like for instance um bozeman montana sweet pea festival right sweet peas grow wild all over the place and then people have their prized sweet peas and they're interbreeding and stuff right and they got their garden varieties of sweet peas and you can you can go online right now and find hundreds of very specific garden varieties of sweet pea and they all grow getting produced whether it's been cultivated into but they kind of select from something like that um and that's that's kind of the best way i can describe that it's more of a it's getting intermixed with the wild population still in my mind right and and but you know as we all understand there's so many diverse pathways of how all this stuff moved about how many possibilities that um you know and when uh consider maybe with my new mexico land grant when the padres and the farmers there were growing that and it um it was uh first went wild right and they it kind of they had a cultivar it went wild the wild population started adapting however long they continued cultivating it it was interacting right so so there's different pathways of this happening um whether it was growing wild and they're like so hey that that's a a better one for for fiber um [Music] these are it's kind of weird so so it's kind of hard to just literally see this is how it happened right it's like like how do birds migrate from in the weather patterns in north america they go all over the place where's the water at and then um and how does it happen it's confusing so to simplify it and say this is the only way you know went to pontagonico i used to believe all cannabis originated from hindu kush i don't believe that anymore um it's quite possible the pollen says it came from the himalayan pactos of northwestern china today in the discussion somebody brought up the possibility it all came from africa i'd never heard that one before so um but but there's there's definitely there's ways that we able to see with better information uh science somebody asked us to bring up today that if there's actually three species of ginette of of of cannabis and i'm not a geneticist so much but it um the the somebody has come up with genetic proof showing that the ruderalis is different from the um sativa from the afghanistan right and um which how did those developed how did did rooter alice go wild from afghanistan or from from a fire plant or um you know and then we look at we look at some of the the the chemical analysis of some of the older genetics and say well there's a lot of cbd in some of these and what were they you know some of them have that long inner node that they have some of that cbd and you get that kind of natural one to one developed over time to that heirloom selection process that i've described in there where it's we don't got any science to look at what's going on here you know it's a whole different thing once you have a laboratory and you're creating these hybrids that are scientifically analyzed like uh um the the genetic uh the genetic analysis guys are doing looking for the markers that say this one here's the mold for mentor or this one here marker says uh this one's susceptible to mold right and they're looking in and that's the same thing with our tomatoes but what ends up happening at that point you get all these super poly hybrid tomatoes that are developed in the university for disease resistance because you know tmv sucks in your tomatoes and you grow heirloom tomatoes um you're seeing a a wild ground cherry tomato it's a whole different thing um so so but but the the super hybrids they don't necessarily have the flavor the um and and so then they started reading back in and doing these these disease resistant uh heirlooms and same same kind of concept i'm looking for when i'm reading with land race or whichever level of them breeding from wild to um you know full-on i got to change the name now it's no longer pakistani fish it's pakistani fish um if you've ever been to zakistan visit it's a great place um after the pandemic yeah so let's see i guess the next slide was regional heirloom is is what i'm talking about right and that's what that's what most of us give is a land race i think literally when it comes down to it um we're getting something we call it an afghan right but you know since i started breeding or working with afghans i like i got like 30 different afghans they come from different families or regions right and like that pakistani chit-chat that's what i call a regional heirloom and and the discussion that we see in the literature talking about what is the land race this kind of like really gives us that that heart of that name right i think this is what most people are really getting at when they say land races is it's like what this this is uh it it totally coincides with the region whether the land it's not necessarily a selected one-parent bottleneck hybrid you know inbred it's got this diversity to it it's got the hand of man to it it's a production cultivar that's been selected for desired traits right and so so that is i think like if you've got a bell-shaped curve with word usage in the word land race that's going to be the highest point of occurrence uh the top of your curve let's see um china did cannabis studies on the land race determined it was the latitude that was the key factor and greg refactor to what if you don't mind following up on that they got a lot of your personal uh i'll let you know when he responds cool cool yeah they got a they got a lot of diversity there it's a big place all right and um yeah you know it also wasn't always all china so i have something from china that we would call several of them that i would love to get into a laboratory and try and revive i've been interested with that seemed to be dead no one was able to to revitalize and we need to get these ending into an auger with enzymes and stuff but this other one that i got a hold of and it it went through a collection in glastorban i think uh germany and their seed bank and was released and i acquired it through the infamous press and and uh i ended up acquiring pretty much the entire stock of original hemp seeds that he had before he bastardized a bunch of stuff with it and whatever happened you know hands off of that but i ended up with whatever went down i ended up with people giving me or i acquired through trade one of the largest collections of old genetic camps and um one of them was um a uh it's funny because he was calling them land races but they're they weren't these were full on like turn of the last century into the 30s in europe um cultivars primarily but some of them were closer to land race like this thing from china that's called the pink or senpai is what i've understood to be called and it is tested at three percent and three percent tac and cbd by people who had access to doing that and it was a definitely it's a fiber and a medicinal and it also produced a very beautiful healthy seed so it was a protein plant as well and it was multi-purpose and that one particularly was spread all over the mainland of old china and into korea in japan as well all tend to have that same genetic as what was reported in there i'm not sure if that one came out of glastonbury one of the other seed repositories that disposed all of their seeds sometime in the 80s i'm not mistake you know after our government went even more full bore on the war on drugs and such like that but um yeah so so um it's pretty neat trying to really look at the whole big question there that the china genetics that he determined they had more they had three zones one seven one northern and one in the middle yeah which coincides pretty much with what um with uh what is our ends presenting and um and he goes a little bit further and adds that elevation factor into your latitude and because um you know you you get island endemics and such like uh with plant species as they get separated um you know like like for instance um morocco right and in the atlas mountains the elevations that they're growing over 12 000 feet in elevation right near the equator right so that can you take that and you put it down at sea level and it's not going to perform the same thing um and and that's where he's getting into and determining how and what you know it's beautiful watching these guys growing their belia right and and uh i think we'd all agree we consider the lydia to be uh grown if over time immemorial in that location it's an open pollinated but cultivated strain right so regional heirloom is what i would call that um may or may not have wild populations nearby and but watching these moroccans when they they plant that like right about now things starting to sprout up there they you know they're up to 14 000 12 000 feet or above and here it's covered in snow it's i i went the powder ski and had one of the best runs in 10 years and 24 inches of snow the other day uh 10 000 feet was my top elevation right um so we take those things into into account right um they plant those now and they're little seedlings and come into um they don't got it wrong i think it's into june or or july i i could be wrong it could be the very beginning of august but it's like i'm harvesting garlic and they're sifting dry sift to beautiful the lydia um and it's like well is that an autoflower can i in but it it is what it is there i don't know how that's going to perform specifically elsewise like that right i know some other people have grown it and that's all no so so knowing how bottlenecked it is once you get it after those people grew it and things like that it all changes um some of the stuff that i was going to tap on today and we'll bring up we found out early in in when azeri and i were doing uh interactions um that taking seed even from a local cultivator and sending it to some location far away that sea might not ever germinate and so it's best to for people in that location to to select the cultivar or representative of whatever that land race might be from wild to um to very well inbred regional cultivar or heirloom and um that that uh getting reproduced in mass and modern um kind of situation where it can epigenetically adapt to a different growing situation um not in the field and then move from that position into people's private collections for breeding preservation abroad exit you and that's a word will you you might see it and then we've when that's the the word that brought me on the show actually was when i saw you guys talking about exit 2. you know and again so that's reproduced as best you can away from the place of origin and in situ is reproducing in its place of origin so and that that compounds that whole it's like well is it wild is it not wild inclusive in land race so once and here's where the magic happens is once you go to a wild population and take it to the hand of man does it magically become a land race if it only includes the hand of man anyhow um these are all just deep thoughts from alex um because i'm not telling you you have to utilize my word usage i'm saying this is the word usage that get used and this is the discussion around it and have a better understanding of what you're getting when you get it or don't um it'd be nice if people did more production of some of these because they're they're amazing um again you're going to get it you go man that that's just horrible i'm going to show you something right now this is one of the most asked for medicines from from patients let's see and it literally it was just foxtails and it was a feral sheila waffy from india that the zaryan sent me back the day i had inbred sent back and hybridized and created something i call peacemaker taking that pakistani which is horrible for mold all right those dry climates they don't they don't do well when you move them to a wet climate right um and i hybridize it with that tropical open stem the the picture in my mind is a bunch of small little golf balls on a big long stem they're too small to get big enough to rot inside because if you can keep those smaller than two inches they won't but those those are those are all reasons why it really helps to know what um the person you're talking to when he says land race means and um again we all know there's some people that um this only means that and i'm saying well it means this depends on who's saying it like um that word [ __ ] if we open the dictionary we're gonna find an actual definition of it and that's where you know if we could it'd be great um to agree on it that way um jargon just don't don't pull the thumb over somebody because they didn't use it the way you want them to that's the way that's what i come to is just like hey this is how i use it this is why so there's this last one slide we we did the regional right yeah oh yeah yeah yeah and then this one called the bar of land race yeah so i kind of went over that that's what once once somebody who's take gone out to that that location on the land where the people interact and and and have created that what was mostly referred to as land race out in the field um it becomes um a cultivar right you selected it and there at that point it bottlenecks there's no way to maintain the diversity of those field crops above right and in descending order you're losing you're losing diversity and and so we we call the we cultivar we ibl we select and for the most part most of us are just using the same heirloom selection processes and some of us might have access to um testing in the laboratory for for um afterwards seeing what the contents of the plant is and some of us might now have um access to to genomics to see if this is susceptible to rot okay so at that point these things are no longer land races right they are cultivar of land races and to call them a land race is incorrect unless you're utilizing that hyphenated um uh word right but but again that's that's mostly what we're buying when we buy a land race is something that's been bottlenecked in bread and whether it's two males to females is sometimes the best i'm reproducing and you know we have the best of our capacities to do these things one of the most important things i find in in the ethics of it all is just disclosing what you did to the next person has a clue right a lot of the stuff i get i got in trade and have not a lot of knowledge of its previous stewardship and um so that's like it helps to know all that stuff that we're talking about these start system when i do grow it to see what happens you know and uh by region what was it used for these things all all vary greatly and how they process it and that's going to make a big difference in whether it fits in what you're doing in your breeding or or producing a medicine for yourself or others um searching for that medicine think about um that this first cbg plants scraggly ass scraggly looking little things right and just in the matter like three years those guys hybridized that cbg production into these beautiful big plants that look like cannabis flowers marijuana flowers whatever you want to call it you know using the terminology it's all cannabis but it looked like these scraggly wild plants first started out with just a couple of little calyxes on it right um there's potentials and all of this stuff the story about the the the miracle pig right wilbur and uh name your name your runty plants that do the right medicine for you wilbur yeah um yeah so yeah then you start hybridizing with them i'll finish that bottleneck talk or the hourglass right so we've we've bottlenecked in and species or genetic diversity has been completely refined from that wild at the most diverse in those wild populations with no selection of male or female and they're able to adapt to that locality and then and then as it interacts with garden or regional and you still have open pollination but not necessarily you may or may not have wild populations around them because of agricultural sanity or sanitation and things like that um you you might have um a couple of males but when you're doing these production runs those guys are doing these huge fields in afghanistan they can't do that all with just one mail right they do go through and call mails and stuff and i'm sure they have specs for it i've not been able to chat with any of them about that i just see some videos of doing it sometimes and and people do this differently every village every region how many land races are there you name a village anywhere where it hasn't been eradicated and there's a land race right that's you know we get we don't have places here where we get we're starting to develop land races back in the states and stash everything gets bottlenecked after selection it gets more bottleneck more bottleneck whatever you're fine more refined and then you start breeding with it and maybe some of those those recessed traits get expressed and in in those pretty much every time you start hybridizing that's going to happen you've got two refined cultivars of anything whether you're super poly hybrid and then back refined into an ibl five and you cross that to another it's possible to be there any seed you open up it's a new hybrid there is those possibilities with some recessive or double recessive or chain linked double recessive comes out and expresses itself through all that's important and understanding but it okay so yeah as we probably hybrid though we're just calling hybrid everything man we got all this diversity and all this this gene pool that we have with all of these poly hybrids we have on the shelf and it's like no those all came from a very select few group of land race cultivars back in the 80s and that all everything hybridized from that right and now we're just in the last through the internet been able to go global and connect make these connections where we're now rediversifying from those open pollinated pollen populations and people are getting this genetic populations that they'll be able to select through and um each person who goes through a 10 or 20 pack of one of those is going to have a different representation a different cultivar and a different possibility where that can go especially with their library that they have to work with yeah that's uh so oh here's a question smiley's garden at a question i was thinking about earlier which is let's let's go back a hundred years ago when it wasn't being eradicated or 150 or whatever and people were traveling around the world and this is something that was growing in different regions of the world if i brought seeds from outside the local wild population and introduced them wouldn't i be adding genetic diversity rather than starting with the bottleneck yeah yeah okay so so in that scenario that's totally hypothetical because back um a 120 years ago say before eradication really began um it was going seaport to seaport it was getting traded by by overland traders and nobody who was selling it knew the breeder you know we're going to get that happen but you know in the 70s when my mentor was doing this exactly what happened was that but what happens is is if you bottleneck into a dominant genetic presentation and bring it into that diverse population it's going to dominate and overbear right you've got an extremely diverse population there but if you end up overbearing that population like what arjun's says happened in jamaica okay they say bringing in polyhybrids into that zone completely wiped out all the native uh land races that they had heirloom there for generations okay and there could be legal ramif you know reasoning for that as well where eradication was happening right but you know and but but you know at the same time when they're saying that it had no effect in the the land race populations of africa totally absorbed or in the utility absorbed the genetics they brought in that's questions that my mentor and i were like yeah i he and he had him i believe a master's in plant genetics his his parents were human cancer uh geneticists uh both nobel prize winning um doctors and stuff and so our discussions would go as far as i can but the like i i i only understand so much right i i have so much science and other people have none and some people have extremely more than me right um so so trying to trying to figure that out you know my understanding my belief is those original diverse populations were way more diverse than after we've bottlenecked and created these dominant strains that have dominant bottleneck polyhybrid situation um so so if you went in there with um like a less dominant hybrid that it wasn't so strongly bred in and it would more easily be absorbed right and and so these these are things that you hear about people who are breeding with the mail over time and they're looking at i know what this mail does and i hit it to a new female and see what the response is right um eventually in breeding you get to be able to really understand these these intricacies and um part of the hard part of as we move into the scientific world and legality of cannabis is translating all of this before it does completely bottleneck and and here at the university of utah they're studying for instance um hemp genomic scientifically in a laboratory and wonderful bugs does bugs be i'm sorry if i got it i totally got it wrong but the good doctor up there is used to working with he's a master of understanding light and plant response to light and my understanding is he did quite a bit of work with the lettuce all right and but lettuce had already been inbred to specific cultivars for 100 years in laboratory you know analyzed and everything and and then um here we all know and understand that each one of these different what we will call a strain of cannabis or hybrid of cannabis completely acts differently to all these different environmental uh stimuli and an epigenetic response to these things and and so one cultivar does not feed the same way and it's very difficult to feed them all at the same time on one hydro system for instance right and so but they're doing science with a strain of hemp in a hydro system and hemp just doesn't even like hydroponics to begin with unless you've adapted cultivated and bred one that likes a wet foot but it generally likes a more open loam for it to grow in preferably in general right i'm gonna say that because they're all different um and that that's where where we end up having issues with moving into science is like man this thing is it's a it's a big thing you put your head around um and and wrapping your head around that entire concept it literally each five minutes of what i said today is a whole two-hour show with a panel right having a discussion um i'm not saying anything other than it's not my way or the highway it's a big wide way and uh let's all walk our way along it and and some point along the way here everyone's gonna get healed hopefully let me bring up um this chart you can kind of give your comments on it and then maybe next week we can let me see he hasn't i i'm guessing he's asleep that would be my best guess yeah i mean it may well be you know literally on the other side of the world from us right um there's also a bunch of controversy came up on my post today uh uh pre-alluding to the talk and you know he i don't think he really wanted to pursue controversy and and might have felt shy at that whatever i don't want to presume either um so so uh but this right here and this whole this today's talk was spurred from his second presentation of this uh i'm not sure if you got it so fine for me i can't see it on my phone but but uh so the may 13th of 2020 is when he first posted it and it's clear and the newer one he posted it is a little fuzzy and basically what i was describing here is like you know so up in the arctic at sea level you can find liken at the equator you got to go up to 18 000 feet if you can find it right but uh it's there and you think about like the snows of kilimanjaro right there in the middle where um and of course they're like melting away but um that's a whole nother reason why we want to understand land races like where can we do this and use less water where can we adapt where can we make things work um you know back crossing that woof you select where you're living on that chart you select you know someplace around the globe that corresponds right and you can go you can go up and down you can go from the far corner right as long as you're kind of like looking like okay i live that this amount of uh latitude that's up and down north and south right um and i'm at this elevation where else on the globe can i select a particular to match what would i want to back cross this poly hybrid i have to strengthen it okay um how am i how am i going to make something work better for me where i live to provide for all those around me with putting less energy in it reducing my footprint how all this knowledge adds up right you know some of us just grow these things and see what they do and like not everyone can do that but it's not with the amount of people i've helped with some of these more wild plants and they're like dude that one so our roads here take the seed and grow it um it's um it's it's a powerful thing once you've got it all under control though right the communication the acquisition the presentation um for for [Music] our medicines let's see oh boy is so fine and at 50 years old i haven't found a pair of glasses that work yet and i don't know exactly why but this is this is talking about zone a tropical lowlands a1 16 to 20 weeks tropical highlands yeah 14 to 18 weeks zone b temp temperate lowlands same exact thing as the round chart in a different form right right different graph form so yeah so it it literally is just just kind of like saying hey this is where this was done at because because we can find tropical plants with wide leaf we can find alpine northern latitude plants with narrow leaf okay and so those are great descriptors but they don't cover everything and mine my little group of words they cover what they cover and they don't they aren't ultimate descriptors of everything right and what he's describing here does not ultimately describe everything either it's just another tool we can use to communicate in the discussion of what why where when um you know if you know it it might be 120 days of flowering that might not be something you want to spend you know your hard end dollars on investing on trying to reproduce without having a artificial environment for depending on your location if you live you live in a mediterranean zone you can play with just about any of these things because because if you understand how your your personal environment is um right that's another thing is understanding where you live and how much you can uh minimally adapt to your your micro climates with with a greenhouse or a cold frame right and that's one person's cold frame is another person's greenhouse um but that makes a huge difference you know understanding what these things are growing in whether it was a field or a wild or whatnot or what they prefer and like the kind of soils and what kind of cultural practices were done to the soils and the fields they were growing all that stuff can really add up into trying to reproduce that experience whether that is exactly what you want to do is reproduce the particular um sacred plant experience that comes from a various region that we no longer have this international shipping trades that used to bring the stuff around from various ports um and different medicines and you know you hear you hear people talking about the little fender joint you'd smoke it and several hours later you're just spaced out of your gourd like what just happened to me and it was like an 11 sativa you've never experienced that because you've never grown 120 days sativa even though i think now they might be a little more potent than that some of them i know i know i'm quite certain when the the the malawi gold i offer is considerably more potent than that i don't know that i don't know that the shield of waffy was though when it came down to it um and um maybe 15 tops but that's the one when i had it that everybody wanted so actually magma seeds asked in the very beginning and i told him i'd ask you later but he asked where you sourced your malawi from um there's a guy that went by the name of the illegally alive who i uh supplied uh his fico for his cancer treatments and uh he went full on pushing the legality of um of uh cannabis medically in florida uh after we saved his life um with fico raw cannabis oil and uh he was so damn sick so so i ran a group called the land race traders club and through that group there's about a thousand of us that were uh we had a mission statement that was basically to provide uh medicine to those who need it and reproduce and preserve for those who made it the future and our only deal was you couldn't charge anybody you could trade and pay stamps and um through that group i made quite a lot of connections and we did some other amazing things some other groups spun out of that and we healed a lot of people we saved a lot of lives um a lot of things shizmed off and then but people saw that there was a financial potential for that group and uh we're quite angry about uh a not being able to advertise in that group we're very strict and or be like uh i did do an offering charging postage for years of hard work where i distributed a [ __ ] down a seed for free otherwise the small nominal everything was under twenty dollars a pack and um included whatever it was people got upset and and that that place fell apart and somebody reported for for selling uh drugs which never happened through there and um that's why i acquired that that particular fellow that everyone was hating on because they didn't realize he was like dying in the hospital you know um and in need of love and not people harping on them for not getting the seeds they traded with them and that that's exactly where that seed came from it was labeled malawi gold and the pack when i got it and there's later there there's definitely once you become a public figure there's people who who uh disagree with you with all sorts of stuff and some people become a nominated to you and by no means do i have all people who love me um you reading that discussion day on instagram i'm an [ __ ] to people who perceive me to be an [ __ ] um there's one person in particular who's called into question a particular person who grew that seed from seed 12 and 12 and it produced a wider leaf uh throughout that entire um growth period of growing from 12 and 12 from seed than you would expect to see from a fully mature plant that was grown from sexual maturity stage after it had uh vegetated for a while and then flipped over and as we all know every plant will have a wider leaf to a narrow relief as it um progresses into flower and uh you can see pictures of um franco standing in fields of um malawi gold particularly where you have extremely wide lease down by his calf and extremely pencil thin leaves up by his elbows okay so um this is just a trait that occurs in all plants and as i said before there is diversity in all of these plants and before i even presented and i checked with a group called the uh malawi land race preservation and it was a couple of brothers there in malawi and i checked with them and he said yeah we have great diversity depending on highland and lowlands and to cover all of our geography and weather here that this this uh wonderful country has and it's part of our land race and uh you know i grew it out 120 days and before it matured under the microscope and uh smoke it and it's like holy [ __ ] nothing i've ever smoked before and i went ahead and sent out some packs of malawi gold maybe it doesn't and like you said this this one patient grew it like that from seed 12 to 12 to try and cut out some of that six month period and uh one person who had an amenity to me decided to say this person who had also never grown an afghan skunk in their life or malawi gold in their life started a huge conversation and tagged me 300 times in one day in another land race group declaring that it was not malawi gold but other people have grown it out um can be lydia and um colorado grew it out and uh affirmed in her belief it is definitely 120-day malawi gold with khtv in it and whatever y'all can buy a sack and grow it out and have it genetically tested if you desire but that's that's part of the reality of all of this we really we don't know it um unless unless you went out to the field and got it yourself you don't know um but i went through all that confirmation and dealt with like everybody asking where that came from for you're the first person in two years now since i've heard anyone bring that up and then uh i've blocked mike on every platform i possibly can because i just don't need it um someone wants to pay for the genetic test i i got some of the downstairs i'll send it please do um it'd be neat to find out if it got the hybrid at some point or whatnot but uh there's something else i'm going to work on very soon with stan craig i i'm not sure if phil stan craig is kicked the bucket or not i know he was sick and i acquired sort of the same group of people from him malawi gold that he had inbred down over 12 generations into something closer to 60 days maybe 70. and um soon hope to open that up and and do a concert comparison of the two of them um but but definitely at some point though the particular malawi gold i have was bottlenecked away from that general population right and um so if at any point you know you look at it you say that doesn't look like the malawi gold i've grown well it probably isn't um and that's the nature of it this is definitely an inbrey cultivar that i've got not i i can't fathom it being anything that was close to being a wild or or garden variety from malawi but it does still retain specific flavor notes that meet the criteria the flower structure from what i've seen meet the criteria yeah it's a it's a great question and thanks for bringing it to the forefront appreciate the opportunity to teach and learn yeah what's your nature social media though is like anyone can say anything right i've never known that but it ain't what that is right that's what we call a troll but i have an opinion troll i have a pointy red hat a beard and a red shirt sorry what is it uh is it too late for you and your daughter to go skiing it's only you know what 120 yeah yeah i know you know she doesn't get out for another hour so if there's questions and stuff people want to have discussion i'd love to if if that's all we've got for now i'm i'm um i've got plenty of work to do that's all i really have in my notes that i can think of i hope i didn't offend anybody because i know i always do but i i think it's funny because my my biggest takeaway from what you said is we all have different definitions for things and that's okay you know as long as as long as we clear that up at the beginning you know we don't get into arguments and fights we just like hey this is what i'm talking about this is what i mean what do you mean we're you know that's um i had somebody on on one of my little soil presentations of natural soil tell me hey you're going to bring some bugs in to your garden at some point like yeah but that's the point and then you look at his page and it's like salt grower never organic it's like well yeah i guess i wasn't talking to you was i um but that's what i do is i teach organic and more this more basic rudimentary cannabis uh history science love stuff and try and make it uh go from we're all in this from the scientists to the end consumer right and in that word sativa means a very different thing all along the spectrum and saying i'm better than you because my meaning of the word sativa wasn't proper in the context you put it in just doesn't help so someone pointed out uh we have four ironically 420 people watching right now perfect so why don't why don't we end on that and we can out we can always come back later uh cool i got a whole lot of [ __ ] to pack up and hopefully some patient people on the other end uh cool i get i got some seeds to go out too and uh all right well thank you everyone and and yeah we'll we'll regroup with uh indian land race exchange uh possibly next tuesday possibly tomorrow not sure quite what day uh maybe we'll try a different time slot to make yeah you're still awake yeah definitely appreciate you all thanks for listening and watching and having a great discussion and grow on all right thanks everyone",

message from the browser saying dr bake and you should probably not have that on your roof anymore and he's totally right this thing's ready to pop it's also dry not something i expected but these need water so that's great they will perk right up i didn't realize they got a chance to dry out and this let's find a home for him that's not endangering our other plans oh my this looks good see how this is on water probably also dry yep perfect huh this got dropped yesterday i hope it didn't get damaged now this needs water so that's perfect we'll make up some flower food we'll do the the early flower food we've been kind of going back and forth more lettuce oh yeah this looks like it needs this is our uh kirklog and this definitely needs water too so that's perfect timing this we did not water yesterday i'm gonna water it today could probably go one more day but since we're making that the soup up i bet it's actually about ready these got watered yesterday and they're loving life so right on super this is our light depth device and look at all the water that we kept off the plants last night by having them covered that's great for mold protection because man there's a lot of mold around here right now we had a wet month or so okay so this is gonna get watered as well and i'm gonna just move this to my bedroom so i get pollen all over my clothing instead of no there's really not much air motion in my room so i think maybe i could just collect the collect a paw in there um i don't know where else to put it to be honest and it's going to open up in the next four or five days i'm thinking looks pretty right hey i have the opportunity to go uh volunteer today on the uh senior citizen club sailboat and i'm gonna do so so i'll take you guys along last time we saw a whale that was pretty cool here's our cocktail i warmed a little bit of water up in the microwave because it's freezing in my reservoir i'm going to add half a cap of ph down that's specific to my water half a cap of cal mag the recommended which will be about a t spoon of this some sweet and half a cap of my surfactant which helps the soil and nutrients wet or the the water and nutrients wet the soil love this stuff it's become very hard to find i don't know if i added too much ph down or what but that's not the color i want not really and unfortunately that means just dumping this out because you can't really ph up and down at the same time because you get you might get precipitates from that too i've done it before but so unfortunately i'm gonna dump this out i'll feed a plant or something and redo this and i'll ph at the end huh so that's that's no ph adjustment and that's really where i want to be that yellow tennis ball color so i need to keep an eye on using this this is obviously swinging my ph uh down so i'm gonna do nothing there glad i at first i thought it was just the coloration of water because this kind of makes it look like kool-aid when you're done all right so we're gonna no no ph adjustment baby tray upgrade fancy seems like this was want to slide off the roof okay we're going with fancy janky or fancy janky all right filling that up spawned me to have to fill my reservoir again because it emptied out and this is the filter i use it's for carbon it's a carbon filter rather that removes chlorine and it also has a ceramic insert um that's something i thought about making uh one of our drawing gifts let me know if you think that would be a good idea i'm still looking for a drawing gift for the month and these are like 35 bucks but i don't know if you guys would use them or not so let me know what you need someone suggested a fan it's kind of on the high end range but that would be a great gift maybe we can do that in april that's our kool-aid so these little these are going to shoot up because they really haven't been watered um maybe but once and that's all that well no actually that's in a two that gets another cup this is also a two last time we we watered these plants we just watered them so they're going to be loving some food that's a three so that just goes third cup this is a seven all rather five which five pounds of five gallons of soil i guess it is a five almost fad drinking the kool-aid these are plant-happy plants happy plants okay did i kill the lemon haze sprouts no they're alive oh my goodness both are live um let's see these lights go out in a few hours they look totally healthy i'm turning the lights all the way up i turned them off i turned them down for the first day but i'm feeling it buddy and these are just what they are so as long as i don't let them run dry i'm not sure what i'll get out of them these are some triple x bag seeds from arizona okay cool these have survived the first days that looked fine i see this one it's it's right there so it's not sticking his head out i'm not doing anything this one looks good it hasn't shed the seed yet and it's taking like a uh it will that looks okay this guy i don't see so i'm not sure where that one is okay we're happy we're not gonna do anything in here either and these lights go out shortly this guy um it needs a trim and that's on uh on the books but not today so what does getting ready to go sailing entail well the first thing i have to do is look at the wind which is changing a lot today and there'll be a small craft advisory by the time we're packing up so we need to be aware of this wind direction change the other thing that's really important is the tides so you have to look where we are in this you obviously at low tide you could ground a boat but the more important thing sometimes is how steep this tide swing is so today we're gonna have a about a five foot tight swing and if you were to go out right in the middle of this 11 o'clock we're actually going out at 12 which will be here um the the bay is emptying into the ocean if you will so there'll be a lot of current flowing out toward from the bay into the ocean so you need to know you need to be aware because on a sailboat a lot of times you're tacking back and forth and so the current will take you sideways as you're trying to make your way out of the channel if you're sailing out and you can end up um you know you just need to know which way the water is going because it moves the boat a lot you can get a several knot several mile per hour uh tide going easily um or a tighted swing so okay so that's good to know so we have uh emptying tide and when we come back in um it will be just after low tide we're gonna go from 12 to four today there's a little map of our uh of our harbor and actually north is this way so it's really kind of sits like that so i'm gonna leave the camera sideways um this is the inlet to the harbor right there and our boat's up here somewhere but all of this water that goes way back into this uh estuary all that water comes in and out of this entrance um every tide change so that water is all moving so when you leave the docks for instance you need to really be uh you need to be conscious of the water moving underneath you um because these boats are literally like big clorox bottles honestly and uh they get blown around by the wind when the sails are down and they get pushed around by the water so anyway so i'll kind of call it out when we're leaving this part here there's a bunch of rocks and stuff it's pretty and then there's a pier here and another pier this is the oasis five our other club boat which is identical is out already so super honored and privileged to be able to go out and spend some time with these people too so that was really cool this is ron and bill and fran sailing with us today and we're heading on our way out the harbor entrance i forgot to point it out when we went out there's the first pier we got about 15 knots you got a boat right there one coming your way incredibly keeping up with us at six knots riding our wake on a canoe that's incredible what do you think fran it was wonderful a little rough but wonderful all right that's what we like to hear the guys were great hey guys i hope you like that i'm like i said super honor honored and privileged to be able to donate my time and spend time with those um awesome older people and learn about sailing and teach sailing and spent time on some big boats i could never afford so glad i could take you guys along hey guys that's our episode for uh today i hope you enjoyed the water as much as i did it is super windy still like and subscribe you guys always kill that and um we are still looking for suggestions on another um giveaway for the month water filter is an option so uh feedback is good don't forget about our spotify station that is going great if you guys are interested there's a link in the description and we're looking for photos to go with this new theme song from yesterday's episode so uh send us a photo or a video clip and you're entered in our 420 drawing um we'll have a drawing for patrons but we'll have a separate one for just people who send us a picture that we can use for a little intro piece okay guys take care love you guys [Music] subscribe", "xH6S2lG8mgE": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I'm going to be showing you guys how I slicked down my natural hair and this is something that's been very difficult for me to do I try so many gels and none of them work because my natural hair is just so hard I've been asked about the texture of my hair and I kind of didn't want to answer that question because my hair is still growing out in the texture my change later on and I don't want like the natural hair please the continent video and be like your hair is total 4c you're a liar a liar but like at this point in my journey I literally feel like my hair so 4c like guys my hair is just so coarse and combing it it's so freaking hard like I've broken so many combs like oh the struggle is definitely real anywho let me stop rambling so I'm starting off with freshly washed hair and before you attempt to do this you want to start off with your hair as clean as possible so after I washed my hair immediately I started to comb it out and like pick it out because I didn't want there to be like any curls because when I wash my hair II like curls up at the bottom and it makes it really hard to like comb it out so I kind of just got rid of all the curls or try to anyways now I'm going to spritz my hair with water and this is just regular water in this bottle and it's just gonna make it easier for me to kind of comb through my hair and then after that I'm going to part it on the side I want to part it on I'm painting one side down with some bobby pins because I still haven't gotten around to buying those clips yet but if you have the clips those would probably work better I'm going to be using this Murray's pomade and I'll leave the sack name down below and I'm also going to be using edge control and I am NOT going to be using any gels in this tutorial because gels kind of like curl my hair up and it doesn't lay it down at all this is how the Murrays pomade looks like and it has a really thick consistency almost like I would say like beeswax which was what I was trying to find but I couldn't find it in stores so I just decided to get this and it was blowing two dollars and forty seven cents at Walmart so I was like okay that's cool I have been watching a lot of YouTube videos because I was trying to find a video that somebody can actually show me how to just like down my hair but every video I watch it would be like so misleading like the title would be like oh how does like down 4c hair and then I'll click on a video and then it'll be with somebody who's like creating their natural hair and then slaking it out or it would be somebody who's like using a texturizer or like their hair powder would not even be like it would be like so like silky smooth and you know those kind of hair texture are so easy to slick down so yeah I just wanted to kind of make this video just to help anybody out that I can who's having trouble will finding something to help them on YouTube that will actually select down their hair the key to disguise is you have to work in tiny sections at a time so I'm taking a little bit of pomade and I'm also using a little bit of the edge control and I'm just going to apply that to the root of my hair and then worked at an opposite tip and then I'm also just going to part my hair off the cone and then work to answer another little section and I'm just going to use a comb to kind of sleek that down and I'm using this brush it's not a hard brush I actually wanted to use our hard brush but I bought this brush and it actually turned out to be salt which I feel like it's so much better because you really don't want to like be using like a really hard brush you like slick your hair down I know like that's like the first instinct like you want to do like use a really hard brush but it's actually better for your hair if you use a soft brush I'm just showing you guys how to is laying down and I am just going to start working from the back section of my hair because I realized that'll be easier just to kind of like late the back down and then just keep going on so I'm just gonna start laying the back section of my hair down and just take my little bits of off the pomade and the edge control and just using a little bit of water just to keep my hair kind on the softer side and I'm just going to use the brush and the comb to slick it down [Music] [Music] after I'm done slinging my hair down I know it looks kind of white but that's going to go away once I tie everything down I'm just taking a little bit of my front hair out and just kind of making little swirls just to style it and then I'm going to spray it all down with this got to be glue spray and then I'm going to tie it up now the one mistake I noticed I made was I was so concentrated on tying the front up that I actually didn't tie the middle part really good so the middle part wasn't like laying down as much as I wanted it to so when you're doing this don't forget to take the middle part okay guys so I like my hair and laid down for about an hour or so and I just took the head wrap balls and just make sure everything was laid down and this is the final look I really hope I helped one person out today and showed them how to lay their natural hair down because I know that's something like that's really hard to do you're like gosh if you liked this video don't forget to give it a

rat and this little rascal that spread the black plague through the Middle Ages and dumped us into actually the dark ages now we're fortunate that roof rats in this area they are technically disease-free we have three reasons to really dislike professor one they're nocturnal of neophobia which means they're out at night and they're very quiet and cautious so we technically don't know they're there number two they reproduce like mice one female in a Tippi neighborhood unchecked could produce nine hundred to a thousand offspring in one year and number three they're very destructive they like to chew on wires they get into hoses one of the biggest costs are when they get into cars - on the wiring harnesses but they also can get up into attics cut off phone cable lines and do a lot of damage roof rats are very tenacious and they're here to stay they can climb on just about any type of wire line they can go up wood masonry you can give them a place they'll come in what attracts roof rats is a couple things the citrus is always one that is identified and as the nights are getting longer the rats are really kind of start to party coming out of the summertime so you have longer nights it is cooling off and they're starting to look for for those different things to feed on and citrus happens to be those little orange and yellow canteens hanging up in and trees so that provides a really good juice drink for them they're still looking for food and whether that's pet food bird seeds those different things that they're on the prowl for those the information comes out through the county and through the city to know exactly what to do with roof rats and it's really only four things it is seal up in your home and make sure it's in good order number two manicure the property gets the hedges and trees trimmed up and number three therefore you detect rats put out the correct order I mean the recommended poisons and traps and number four you have to talk to your neighbors what we want to do is we want to cut trees that interlock back so that they their canopies do not touch we want to cut trees and bushes and those type things back about three feet from a roof line and then we want to be able to supervise any kind of powerlines any things are coming to the house make sure those are sealed citrus itself pomegranates those things we want to pick that fruit as we use it and then if we're getting hollow fruit on those on those trees then we want to be able to set eight stations at those freezing we've had people say oh you know I don't want rats and they'll cut down the citrus tree but they didn't they didn't remove the rat they only lost their fruit tree so while we know where the rat is at that that location let's set a bait station but it's either poison or trap it and get it off the property and then back those those the rodents off to to our property lines themselves when we determined that there's ruff rats either in the neighborhood or that we have them on the property and the number one thing we want to do is use what we call the pubs this is the bait stations that hold the just one bite poison what this is is a little rat dining room that that the rats are gonna go in eat the poison come back out and then in four or five days they die still the best way in the cheapest way to deal with roof rats is the conventional snap prep $3 snap trap that that you can buy at any hardware store and these work especially well in attics one of the best ways and to protect especially our pets is using a shoe box if you want to cut a hole on one end so the rat will go in the shoe box is a really effective way to use the snap traps and it makes it very safe number one we we can talk about the snap traps number two the poisoning with the bait stations or the house favorite rat zapper the rat goes in gets electrocuted and it's an instant kill no blood no guts anything else they're here to stay but we have ways to be able to to control them and actually keep them off anybody's property when they're willing to do the recommended methods and guidelines that we presented", "KFmQcQNqviY": "so everyone says they want to build and gone off and guess what one of my friends have done it they've built three apartment blocks one main house in the middle and then two five o'clock so each site so I'm gonna find out how they did that the challenges that they face and should you build or should you buy [Music] there's no way you can build you're not in this country I just felt like I just never felt like that was my home I always felt like a company home here so this is one of their apartments that they're going to be renting at it's finished I think there's just a few things for them like to do and it's a two-bedroom apartment the living room honestly that fuuu is amazing and what's so nice about this place as well as the weasels are massive most of the time in town though you find that people make quite small windows but here is like flooded with light and then open kitchen which I love in my head as well so thanks so much for letting me come to your home and see your real estate business here so amazing so what made you decide to build in Ghana or regionally obviously my background in memory to Ghanaian so it makes sense if I come to Ghana and do something you do not stop question would you do because obviously my whole life I lived in rental most of media so going about things not to myself you know let me come to Ghana so become to come every year like every designer like anybody to us so when I started coming my highest I seen things what people are doing and the realistic internal or something that it's not no not even like older people talk about younger people I talk to myself let me also come here see what I can do which I mean so much came to Ghana and then I started doing a little research about where can I get land what to do and all that stuff so that's the main reason why I came to come and after performing research and I realize that it is a big boss police I can obviously make a lot of change when it comes to real estate all the stuff I see they're doing it's pretty simple they're not enough in lecture for the outside as well as well so people are brought yeah so that's woman as it comes O'Connor cuz I don't matter [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] have you find rocky road building these properties yes not every single step I'm not gonna I'm not gonna sit and say that look is a shrimp right I'm not lying obviously if you have a dream you wanna follow through your dream and you believe in your dreams you keep going it doesn't matter what happened you keep going there's been a lot of headaches with work workers register in the lungs permit you can name it like modern and many things every day is something it's not them turning up is something going wrong is yeah it's always something so how do you manage that like within yourselves and also control peacefully like together how does that work in a relationship building together we disagreed about we argue a lot we you know but we we also motivate each other line in the same goal we have the same vision so far if he if he is trying to do something and I'm trying to let him understand this is though this is how we should like no we should do it this way you know but it's also bringing always more ideas go is brainstorm like every night can we improve what can we improve what can we change what do we have to do tomorrow okay this guy didn't turn up when is he gonna turn up you know so you just have to communicate a lot have a lot of patience for patient because go crazy obviously sorry to say they don't understand the meaning of time I wanna turn a pasadenian 10 o clock is going on on my way and even that's not again - doesn't even work for days and you need this work to be done so there's no no it's just like ok I have this stuff to go to enough to attend to and yeah it's been sometimes it's very difficult because you also we don't have a deadline that we have to finish then and then but sometimes obviously attendance is renting the place and you want the place to be painted and everything done now the pizza has not troubled you know we have to be fun to come back you know it's delay now Spa is we're still gonna get there regardless you know so sometimes you just have to not take it personal and bear in mind they're all these people are working for they're older than us so they're looking I thinking you guys are still gonna and you're so young come talk to me by bus we have to know how you like you know what I mean especially with and they keep telling them go to this go to that it on a setback traumatize I have to talk to me please go and tell him because only the way you see the message is different the way the work is done this way she goes there should be not upset cause are you guys told no time and you're not done like before I check I'm like you go check yourself make sure if you are feeling yourself everywhere before you come and tell me about you know it's just something I got used to it as well and I'm some more we are going the less I get upset about it you know I'm just like no we're just doing and what will be will be by like the Tyler proper say like I have to say we're not to sit with him each town like now he knows how we want things to be and who has improved a lot you know sometimes sitting down we show him YouTube video as well like you know we can do it like this or you can do it like that or I can get you this too so sometimes it's about they have experience and what they do but they don't have all the tools because when I'm sure he's like oh wow you know I can actually do it like this it's much easier then when I'm doing you know if you do something and it's wrong I told you you're gonna come on your summary so you better make sure that's right so now that we go to understand when you're doing something they realize this might be about like academic or policy how do you think I should do this now good and that's how you should be you know it's clear to see from Lela and Phillips experience it's definitely not easy building in Ghana but look at these beautiful properties I've watched this build from scratch through Instagram their handle is at pan V estate let's find out more from Lea and Phillip so do you feel that you need to be one say all the time all the time there's no way you can build and you're not in this country let's focal our people don't understand you can some people are in America then this thing they're building in Ghana we don't like your money try that at the beginning at the beginning I tried to their contract to handle everything from in London relaxing nothing when you swing they keep telling mom anything this money this money and then when we started doing it ourself well I do what does know you know but obviously something on everybody's into yeah if you have the money why not how save up the money you can stay wherever you are even being Ghana and be maybe it's a private Caicos and let them do it because you know if you don't mind but if you mind in if you're doing a project like this you're definitely on my side every day there's not even least coming for when the during a recent under three times even even have to come the kids you go out bring food for lunch and then you know we stay and yeah my price for people that want to build in Ghana if you wanna put in Ghana you have to if you don't have the time and you have the money fine it can be done but if you're in between you have a girl money and have a good time please come back stay here in Ghana and what you're buildin or what you can do is you come in different phases so let's say for instance your heads you here for six weeks so you plan ahead okay the six respond I'm going to be doing this that's what's all my friends from London so you can six 360 and you can we're gonna be lame look what you can't that's what you do you need you shut everything down you get back and work then you work out you come back again you next day that's what some of my friends are asking down and now they're passing know their houses that's the best way I would recommend to anybody but do not ever think for once let me stay in London keep sending money Western Union and it's never you'll come back into their own house and your house is not even ready you're going to be like you have to join in but do them one join even though you're not here but nobody is like taking care of your child yeah I know nobody's gonna take care of each other baby yes this building is like our child we thought we're still on there I mean people can also look at me like you no more let me learn from this guy's cause for the mistakes so it's easy for me to tell someone of Judas and realize you're gonna be trouble so what is your biggest tips for people that want to build in Ghana do it in stages no rush don't let no one pressure you take your time get your drawings giggle first of all get your land gay or don't impairment these are the two most important finish that takes about a year okay well if you have a lot of money can obviously do the needy it will be very fast so don't serve it yeah get those two out the way before you start so when you start out no ethics customers will come in to step in your telling you you can't work and so on and so on so and then the third finish just compound just come back to it stages no rush even if it takes you five years to stages you're going to have a lesson or headache than trying to foster infants up and then next time you realize your money is all going down the drain for the good money saved yeah and then [Music] there's so many shows in Ghana and research you know I shower heads right you have rainfall showers here how are you going to tell somebody who has never showered with the rain with a shower that you think exactly should fix us this awesome point you know you have to research you how to educate them sometimes as well because they can do the job it's not they can do it but you just have to show them how sometimes so you took yourself YouTube YouTube like anytime we're facing a problem even electricity swimming pool whatever it is at what a pressure how to pull the water from the main pipe to the house all these things you can research it and you can have knowledge to also say if somebody comes and does something that we used to do in 1950 you know you realize that hey know there's this way coming let me show you so that's also thing like commit yourself to it because obviously you're gonna live in that house or your tenants are going to live there you're gonna make money out of this so make sure you put everything into it so where do you encourage people to come back from the Diaspora to Ghana to live what's your experience being my experience has not been obviously absolutely like 100% easy but I love it to be honest I love in a combine I would always recommend tell people whatever background unions it's not just about construction whatever you do in London you can do in Ghana just do something that you like don't think oh we don't do this because I'm gonna get money out of it I'm on the wrong path when it comes to money when I start off you're gonna hate it and then we go back do something you have a passion for it and it doesn't matter how many times you fall down who worries about causes it's passion what is passion nothing beats that were you born here no I was born in Switzerland alright okay I was born in sister but I I experienced on a lot like my parents took me to find out though I was in school here and but I just felt like I couldn't leave the room of life going to work you know even if we have a nine-to-five job in Ghana it's not a nine-to-five job you know what I'm saying you can still say oh you know exactly you know and I just felt like I just never felt like that was my home I always felt like I come home and I feel home here and I want my children to grow up knowing where they're from you know I want them to know the language to speak the language and they can still decide hey this is not for me I want to live in Europe and they can always go back yeah I've done my part by teaching you everything you can do whatever you want after you know I it's not being easy at all don't give up okay you move to Ghana you make this decision don't have ever in your back of your head like oh I can go back yeah this is otherwise you you'll be for sure you get four straight so do you get upset and my frustration is there every day me personally I fits in very well focusing you guys that make so already you know I was already let them keep them alone in Christ you face a lot of bad you just have to control yourself and keep going but it gets at the same time for like people that are mixed at home it's like you're not at home here you know there's nowhere that a year like it's the home so it's like what do you want to go up with you know it's potentially like racism in the UK or here you maybe mix them in another way but it's not their single have thoughts at all and I feel more at home here I feel very at home here but I feel like racism do you know now obviously now that all this people coming back home oh no the problem is also that most mixed race or white people come to like party behave like I don't know you know they don't come to connect the dots and that's why I talk about a lot like when you come to God I try and like connect the dots like the way you called us here like hey let's do this or whatever you're into your into your nurse or your taking care of children like just do what is best for you and just do something try and make a difference it's not just about coming to just party all the time and I think they also but yeah because we the young people now aware the future of Ghana especially do it ones abroad so you go come back when you come back you're gonna help gonna people have more pasta because nowadays technology is everywhere all you need to do is product it from such things and there's nothing you can happen Europe or London America back and I'm gonna have more like more technology no he looks didn't people says terrible countryman we still want boxing away yeah yeah I feel like it's just such an exciting place to be because there's so far that the country can go where it's like in the UK or what you thought yeah what can you really do you know they make a really big difference and content so yeah like love them for doing it well done for like building things amazing hi thanks so much today okay yeah and I'll put your details like

and today I'm getting a lash lift well I did get a lash lift as you may be able to see these are my natural lashes just lifted and curled to perfection this is my first time doing it so I did record it so you guys could see the whole process but I want to make this video so you can see how it's done and so I could explain the difference between getting a lash lift versus getting lash extensions I have also gotten lash extensions before which is where they add or glue on individual lashes onto your real lashes making them look longer and fuller with lash extensions I did love just being able to wake up looking like full glam at all time I'm gonna have fake lashes on without actually having to put them on but it is more expensive you do have to get a fill every two weeks you have to make sure you use oil-free cleansers and makeup removers and I just really wanted to rub my eyes and I couldn't and I kinda bugged me but I might do it again because it just did look amazing but this time I wanted to do a lash lift which is just lifting my own natural lashes so if you're someone that already has long lashes you might not need to get extensions you could just get them lifted and it makes them look more full and curled I got my lash was lifted by lashing up with Mellie who was in Granada Hills California I think she did a really good job and she let me film it so I could show you guys the whole process so that probably do let me show you exactly how it's done [Music] no pain so first of all we're gonna start off with Olivia hot it's like the best product so before we get started we're gonna use our Ella remove this takes off any oil and makeup residue on there this is what we use to hold up her eyelashes and we're going with a large we are going to and we're gonna go ahead and hold down [Music] fly back to the top of the rod I like to do it section by section [Music] sure that each one [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] is the setting lotion so this is what's going to really hold the curl take all the lashes off the rod using a wet q-tip [Music] so here are how my lashes look now that they have been lifted but a little complementary extra thing that Melia likes to include in her lash lifts as they lash tint so now she's going to tint my lashes making them a little bit darker and a little bit more noticeable and the service has included when you get a lash lift with Mellie [Music] [Music] well there you go that is exactly how a lash lift works I am loving it so far the best way I could describe it it's like waking up already having mascara on your lash line they look fuller and longer and then if you want to actually add mascara and makes them look even better and I'm glad that you're able to do so or add fake lashes if you want you whereas if you get lash extensions you can't use mascara and it's not recommended to add falsies on top of it giving lash extensions lasts about two to three weeks depending on how well you take care of your lashes in between and then you got to go back in for a fill for about half the price of whatever you paid for your full set wear eyelash lift is much more affordable you get your lash tinted and it lasts six to 12 weeks if you want to eat your lashes done by lash it up with Mellie just Paul her and instagrams at lash it up with Mellie and to slander her DMS and book your appointment to get a lash lift is $50 and you want lash extensions it ranges from 65 to 85 dollars depending on what type of set you want but she is gonna give you guys a little discount if you mentioned that you came from me so there you go that is exactly how a lash lift is done although it looked kind of like intense or painful it did not hurt if anything when she was putting on the like whatever the cream stuff was that part did burn my eyes because I have very sensitive eyes I've learned that even these type of clear eyelash glues also burn my eyes whose thereby our Dell and Andrea I can't use these because they would just like burn so bad like just from like the smell of this like makes my eyes water but I personally can't use any of these like clear gel things on my eyes even back when I did get my lash extensions so I mean I powered through I just used a fan to cool things down then when she wept it off everything was fine I didn't have any type of like allergic reaction or anything it was just kind of burning in the moment but if you do use clear lash glue or your eyes aren't sensitive you'll be totally fine it gave any other questions about getting a lash lift or extensions make sure leave a comment down below or if you enjoyed this video in general make sure you give me a thumbs up and subscribe I post too every week once on Friday and went on Sunday and you can see more of me on instagram at Miz biank Rene I'll see you guys next time thanks for watching Bianca Rene today [Music]", "7wMYISJQ68g": "[Music] hey woodworkers of YouTube what's going on a mark from woodworkers source great to see you again so I made a series of decorative boxes for my three girls and I'm gonna show you how it finished them here's what's up I use paducah for the body and white oak for the splines and lid Pro Duke has this natural orange color it's really unusual really awesome stuff so when you've got it freshly planed or cut it's really vivid orange but what's not so awesome is that if eventually darkens and loses the orange everyone's always asking is how do you get that color to stay and the answer isn't very dependent but in this exposure to light that speeds up that change I've run a couple dozen tests on different finishes and this recipe that I'm about to show you it does about the best you can hope for seal it with two or three coats of d waxed shellac and then you applied no fewer than three coats of general finishes high-performance with water-based topcoat do actual a core in this case a product called seal coat really does a nice job of locking in that natural color and this water-based finish is crystal clear and contains UV protection and that will help keep paducah looking good longer than any other type of finish so to throw a curveball at you I also filled the green with a black grain filler so this step is really just garnish it doesn't do anything to preserve the color of paducah it just looks really cool on the wood so you're ready let's do this I just made an ordinary rectangular box with an open lid and then drew the curve on the sides and use the table saw just to slice off the majority of the waste as the sculptor Michelangelo said I saw the angel in the marble and carve until I set him free same concept [Music] [Music] I finessed the shape of the block plane until each side looked right and then I started sanding so this thick foam pad on the standard contours to the shape and I just sanded with 120 grit and then a vacuumed off the dust so at this stage is 10 for the grain filler this is water-based material works a lot like drywall mud and the trick to using this on wood is to keep a spray bottle of water around and give it a squirt as it dries out so you smear it onto an area of the project you give it a squirt or two of water to really loosen up then you just work it into the grain here I'm just going to use a blue shop towel to swirl it in that works great for projects with curbs and things on a flat project I might just use something like a bondo scraper an old credit card or something to scrape it on and then if it starts drying out I'll just give another spray or two of water and then I wipe off the excess trying to go across the grain and then just move on to the next section all right so I know exactly what you're thinking right now that fool just ruined a beautiful piece of wood and I know what you mean it looks like I just bathed this sucker in motor oil but hang tight it's gonna look great just a minute when a dries leaves this gray haze pending on the humidity and hair it could take as little as about 30 minutes or so for the filler to dry well enough to be sanded you can use a random orbit sander when it dries to remove the bulk and then you just do the rest by hand and now you may have to do some touch-up spots here and there with a little more filler especially on the tight curves where it's really easy to sand it out but at this point I do my final prep sanding working through each grit I go from 150 180 to 220 and for this job that's about as fine as I go now stand for that first coat of dewaxed shellac or seal coat pause real quick one thing I didn't show you is that I finished the inside of the box prior to assembly so that's a part that I'm not going to get into here but just know that finishing the inside of a box is a lot easier to do prior to assembly than it is after because those corners are real tighten up pain to get into I like to apply this stuff with a cotton rag balled up soaked and seal coat and then wrapped up in another cotton bag and it makes a really nice pad then I also thin it down a little bit with some denatured alcohol so it lays down a really nice light coat and then there's a little bit of mineral oil mixed in too and this helps keep my applicator nice and slick because shellac dries pretty fast and it can drag amid some streaks and that mineral oil really helps a lot so work my way around the project by doing two quick coats in one session [Music] then I just left that dry for about an hour to clean off the mineral oil residue all it takes is a quick wipe down to the naphtha you should do that because the mineral oil residue rises to the top of the finish makes it kind of slick and you're the next layer is not going to stick so you got to get that off you use a solvent called naphtha [Music] so before applying the topcoat finish I like to give it a good scuff with a synthetic finishing pad I'm doing this just to work out the imperfections like streaks dust nibs bumps just working those out to get the smoothest finish possible you really need to do this after every coat along the way I know it's kind of a pain I know it takes a lot of effort but you won't regret the result that you get from it to apply this top coat you've got to know that starts to drive pretty quickly so use a foam brush to lay down a pass and I try not to brush back and forth willy-nilly since it kind of dries fast it's really possible to create more streaks or more bumps trying to brush them out than you would if you just let them clean but of course sometimes it is necessary to take a small risk here and there to level out a spot that pulled up as long as it's still wet you let that dry for at least an hour then you scuff it smooth wipe off the dust and then put on a fresh coat then I repeated these steps for grand total of four coats whatever project you're working on you're really gonna make a judgment call somewhere along the way as to how many coats your gonna put on I'm gonna touch it you look at does look nice does it feel nice - I feel like I need another coat whoa wanna do another coat that kind of finish you just stop when you're happy [Music] [Music] you can see a lot of streets while this is still wet but once it dries the finishes love it off pretty well it's not perfect but it's pretty well level scuffing takes care the rest [Music] since scuffing really kills the sheen I've got a polished finish to bring back the semi gloss shine and just like sanding I work with those synthetic finishing heads going from a medium to apply into an ultra fine path that really smooths out the finish remove scratches and almost brings back to Sheen who are wanted but to go all the way I've got to use a liquid polishing but it's really important not to jump into the polishing right away you want to wait like 7 maybe 10 days let that finish really hard enough the harder it is the better it will polish I actually waited seven days to polish mine but you can wait longer if you want to or if you have to you know light gets in the way you just can't get to it again wait longer it's not a problem [Music] so with the blue disposable shop towel I applied a little bit and then I just swirl it on it for like a minute or two and then I start working with the grain back and forth and eventually I'll grab a fresh shop towel and give it a nice deploy and I just do this one side at a time I try to tackle too much at one time it just might take two or three applications on each area to bring back to shine to right where you want it but it's really well [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]", "btdZtAWnFpQ": "[Music] African weed is where the features at is the number one project we're working on right now that's what I'm wanting to work on is spraying this year I have a bunch of exciting crosses I made from Africa working in BC we've only kicked one out so far flattery we pulled at random two years ago in Washington want to cross out and it's called milf and it's out of this world it's a four-way cross of some Africans I have breeding 40 a CV and it's like a fruit explosion in your mouth we've got the breeding times on it down to seven weeks to flower and every time I've grown it in awe has two crops it was the first one to run out and everybody asked it for it so as soon as we can get some more of these Africans out it's gonna change a lot of the game because they have different buzzes they have different cannabinoids in it they've really in their own niches and they are adding some really exciting new crosses to the mix if that one type who only out of the 15 crosses was that good slobbering ticket to the other 14 African genetics is another one in places where it's not so much to this indigenous which there is in the junction there were they all collide places where it's spread naturally not to man but through the slave trade during the religions through the Crusades cannabis is spread around the world it's a medicine we've always used and so in places it's revolve initials it's low and breeds rope type Highland breeds drug type certain places in the world with mixtures of certain and endogenous conditions push these strange to do things they don't do nowhere else of watch genes replicate like I've seen the auto flyer gene in for African strains now they have nothing to do a ruderalis and they hooked it a [ __ ] of that so there's a lot of really cool things that we're just discovering they're going back and looking at through our world places in places where people's each cannabis is medicine because they had no other choice and they've families have bred this first generations now and they have their own strengths and we need to mix them into the foe before we pollute them with our genetics [Music] you", "n3XvtZWPvUA": "hello my dear friends in today's video we will dive into one of our favorite themes which is repurposing plastic bottles in particular plastic caps so first up we need one plastic bottle cap lighter and toothpicks the toothpick is sharp at both ends so we cut one end with scissors after that's we hold the cap with the help of neighbors not to burn ourselves then we hit the bottom of the cap with a lighter try to do it evenly then we need to force the toothpick with a cotton first through the cap so let's see what we will get now take the scissors and cut off the top that's L we get such a header or a dispenser so to say we can use it to work with glue or engine oil and easily grease small parts who are for watering the most finicky plants this header may be even useful at the kitchen you may fill the bottle with cream and paint on a pancake with it so the next idea is an extension of the first one it will be especially interesting for fans of crossbows mini weapons and so on

"hi everybody welcome back to sunshine soap and candle company I know I'm not wearing my regular pee goggles but they broke in this is what I had on hand and macey first so today I'm going to be making an eczema bar of soap I've made this bar before it's really popular and they put a few tweaks on this recipe today and I thought that I would show you how I make this bar because I think I use a lot of really nice ingredients for the skin so I'm going to start out with showing you what I'm using I am going to be using 100% olive oil and I infuse this olive oil over low heat with chamomile tea so it's chamomile infused oil we're going to be using local orange honey honey has a really amazing benefits for the skin it's naturally antibacterial it's calming and it's also a humectant so that means that it's going to draw moisture to the skin I'm also using some colloidal oatmeal and the coil oats are very calming to the skin I'm going to be using some turmeric and this is also really really good for the skin because it has a high amounts of anti-inflammatory properties to it and it's also going to add a natural orange yellow to my soap I am going to be using a blend of orange essential oil in tangerine essential oil both of these essential oils are calling to the skin and then I'm going to add some interest to the top of my soap by putting on some dried chamomile I would use this bar on my skin my face and if you're prone to eczema this would be a really nice bar to use okay let's get to filthy actually going to go ahead and add in my oath first because sometimes they get and it clumped up and they just want to make sure they're nice and blended before I get going okay they're stainless nice and blend it up into the oil now because I'm using 100% olive oil soap it does take longer to trace so I mean it probably won't bore you with all of the blending process here I'll just go ahead and pour the lye in and get started and probably fast-forward you through this part you I actually forgot to show you a really important ingredient here this is actually probably the star of the show I'm going to be adding in some organic carrot puree carrots are excellent for the skin they have lots of vitamin A and they're super calming they're great for the face and they're really just a nice additive to put into a bar prone to sensitive skin so I'm going to be adding this in as well and not all of this but I'll be adding it about to emphasis into my five-pound loaf okay I'm going to be splitting off a little bit of a catch just to add maybe some swirl of natural color soap into the loaf actually going to do Bell Labs about cut that's it okay okay I'm going to go ahead and add in I'm going to go ahead and weigh out my carrot puree so I know exactly what I'm putting in there so I'm looking to put in about two and a half ounces of carrot puree that's one out to two and a half here we go okay going to go ahead and add my carrot puree into the soak that I'm going to be putting in the turmeric and all the additives that I'm going to leave the plane so plain because I just want it to be white so let's go ahead and add in turmeric first I should turn the soap an amazing color turmeric is a very good for inflamed skin and lips seem to a color that turntable wow that is a really gorgeous okay now I'm going to go ahead and add in my carrots there's gonna carrot when today okay and then my honey and I essential oil here goes my honey I'm going to go ahead and app essential oil at the same time so if it's starting to thicken a little bit so go ahead and get that all in there at the same time [Applause] [Applause] scrape the sides and get that all off in there we're still have a priest sent race so what I'm going to do is go ahead and mix up my white soap and I think I'm going to do I think we'll go ahead and do it edge it sit in the pot for all of us [Music] [Applause] wondering if we want to give us a little alcohol anymore so pretty soon all right okay I'm going to go ahead and use another stick blender and bring this white soap up to a little thicker of a trace to match the orange [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and keep into this [Music] [Applause] [Music] we porridge in Laurel getting ready to pour it in my mouth [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] okay I think that also I can fit into the mall here I'm just going to do a little chop trick girls [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] there that should add a little texture to the crow and I control that crisper I'm not sure how much don't weight is going to show through I'm here it might just get absorbed sometimes when you use more into point of oil [Music] [Applause] [Music] for white so during the communication [Music] and of color it orange but we need to be a lot of that white fishing it means a lot of the way that works but either way I think it's going to be a really beautiful so keeping pigeons out all the way orange more if we get to see some of that subtle white swirl all the way through it that either way it will be really pretty I am really excited to use this car and add hopefully soon some more natural all natural soaps to my products line okay I have a question for you guys I really like adding new things to my soaps and using interesting additives like carrots and honey and oatmeal so I'm going to put it to you what would you like to see my soap with next you can put it in the comments box below and just let me know and maybe you'll see one of your ideas pop up in my next video I'm going to go ahead and take my chamomile and I'm just going to sprinkle it right down the middle I don't want to over take I just want a little bit to add interest it smells really good you can kind of smell the carrots mixed in with the orange which I think it's already a really nice combination so also a name for this soap I haven't really thought of yet I don't know if I want to call it carrot so or I'll have to think of something clever okay there you have it friends that is the making of my eczema slash facial sensitive skin bar stay tuned for the cutting [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] long [Music] you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]", "3jsUgrYBp-g": "vaginal discharge is really common it can happen at any age but it's more common after puberty and it will vary in amount consistency color smell depending on whereabouts you are in your menstrual cycle and also depending on whether you are pregnant ovulating sexually aroused it changes all the time but what happens when the color is completely different to what your usual vagina discharges or it's just something that you're not expecting in this video we will be talking about the different colors of vaginal discharge what do they mean are they normal and actually can you just treat yourself at home and focus on self-care or is it time to just ditch that and go and see your doctor hi ladies i'm dr simi former surgeon current gp and cosmetic doctor welcome to my channel where we discuss all things skin and women's health already done a video where i talk about the different types of smells that can be associated with vaginal discharge and you can watch that video here in this video though the main focus is about the color of the vaginal discharge so the first color that i want to focus on is yellow green okay this is not normal my alarm bells are ringing and i'm thinking to myself s t i the sti that characteristically gives a frothy yellow green vaginal discharge is this little guy here so say hello to trichomonas vaginalis this is a microorganism or a parasite that causes the sti that's called trichomoniasis this is usually caught by having sex without a condom with somebody that is infected with trichomonas vaginalis comment down below if you've never heard of trichomonas vaginalis because when i mention it to my patients most of them have never heard of it they've heard of other stis so chlamydia gonorrhea genital herpes but they've never heard of tv which is really interesting because it's the commonest non-viral sdi in the world more than 270 million cases of trichomonas vaginalis occurred in 2008 and that was more than the total combined numbers of chlamydia and gonorrhea cases i'm just going to let that sink in 270 million and the thing that's a little bit worrying about it is the fact that some women don't even know that they've got trichomonas vaginalis so 50 of women are affected don't have any symptoms and of course if you don't have any symptoms and you're having unprotected sex you don't realize that you are spreading the infection to other people when symptoms do occur though they're really characteristics so as i've mentioned you get that frothy yellow green vaginal discharge it can smell quite offensive as well and there can be other symptoms so for example burning and stinging when passing urine soreness around the lips of the vagina and itching around the vagina as well if you have got these symptoms you would need to go and get yourself checked out in sexual health clinic in the uk we call these gum clinics but most countries will have something similar the good news is that trichomonas vaginalis is treatable treatment for this is actually antibiotics which both you and your current sexual partner will need to take as well as your previous partner or partners in the last four weeks also once you've had the antibiotics you'll need to avoid sex for at least one week whilst you're taking them the other sti that can give a yellow discharge is gonorrhea so again gonorrhea is another sexually transmitted infection that in women can be what we call asymptomatic i.e it doesn't give symptoms so you don't know that you have it so 50 of women don't have any symptoms if they've got gonorrhea and this means that it can go untreated for a long time in the women that do have symptoms though you can get this yellow vaginal discharge and get abdominal pain or pelvic pain there can be burning and stinging when you're passing urine intermenstrual bleeding can also cause pain during sex pain during set's actually really common so much so that i've made a video about it for you here and i discuss all the common causes i also give recommendation and tips for how to improve the condition the next discharge i want to talk about is red or pink this can be normal or abnormal it depends on the circumstances so for example if you are having a red or a pink discharge around the time that you're expecting your period then this could just be completely normal it means that there is blood around and that's what's causing the red and the pink color of the discharge you know what i mean you know we've all been there you go to the toilet you wipe and you look at the tissue and you're like yep she's coming and i'm going to be wearing black knickers from tomorrow towards the end of the period a lot of women though find that the discharge becomes more kind of like a dark brownie color and this is because the flow of the blood is so slow and the blood is hanging around for much longer in the vagina it's becoming oxidized and this is giving that brown or dark red tinge to the vaginal discharge this is nothing to worry about you don't need any treatment and it usually clears up when your period has completely finished another time when you can get a pink discharge or a red discharge is shortly after sex i'm talking about kind of within the first 24 hours sometimes even within the first 30 minutes this can be due to the fact that during sex there's friction so you can have tiny cuts and scrapes in the vagina which bleed and then cause the vaginal discharge to be like a pinky or tinged color sometimes some women experience a pinky discharge or red discharge or just frank blood in between their periods so they're not expecting their periods let's say for another few weeks but they're getting a discharge that's looking like their periods about to come so this is called spotting and in medical terms we would call it intermenstrual bleeding so bleeding in between your periods sometimes intermenstral bleeding is a sign that you need to go and see your doctor so have a look at my video about seven signs that something might be wrong with your period where i give more information about that so there are some circumstances where having a pink or red vaginal discharge starts to ring my alarm belts first example is if you're expecting your period and you've also recently had unprotected sex so i'm talking about sex without condom and then you get this pink or red vaginal discharge around the time when your period would normally come that is bringing my alarm bells because you could be pregnant so this tinge of pink or red that you're seeing that you think might be the beginning of your period could actually be something called an implantation bleed what happens with that is that your uterus has been preparing itself to have a period so the lining is nice and thick and it's got lots of blood vessels and it's nice and plump and then along comes a fertilized egg and it attaches itself to this nice plump lining and it burrows itself in and this causes tiny amounts of bleeding which you may then see as a pink vaginal discharge and you may think oh okay cool my period's coming soon no you may not see that period for another nine months or so because you're pregnant so if this is you you're in a situation where you're seeing a pink vaginal discharge it's not your normal period you're a little bit late for your period and you know you had unprotected sex the best thing to do is get a pregnancy test so you know whether you're pregnant or not the second one that rings my alarm bells is if you are already pregnant or in early pregnancy and you start noticing a blood stained or a pink vaginal discharge this could be a sign of an early miscarriage so in this situation you definitely want to seek medical advice urgently the third example is if you have entered menopause so if you're a woman who hasn't had a period for like a year or close on a year and then suddenly you start getting vaginal discharge that's pink or tinged with red even if it's not frank bleeding that is a worrying sign because it could be a sign of endometrial cancer so please go and see your doctor so that you can have the appropriate tests and have the diagnosis made and have early treatment if necessary the next one is cream or white vaginal discharge if you have a thick clumpy white vaginal discharge this is most likely going to be thrush a thrush is a yeast infection and it's not that the yeast has suddenly come and infected the vagina the yeast is resident in the vagina it normally lives there anyway but its growth is kind of controlled because there are other bacteria that are competing good bacteria that also live in the vagina if there's ever a situation where those competitive bacteria that are living in the vagina are killed off such as when you have a course of antibiotics then they're used to like it's time to come out and play and they over grow and this is what's giving that kind of white cottage cheese like discharge actually i'm not sure who was the first person to describe this discharge as looking like cottage cheese but it's a really spot-on description so i love it maybe i don't love it i'm really sorry if i've put anybody off having cottage cheese for the rest of their life this is not the only type of discharge that you can have with thrush it doesn't always look like cottage cheese sometimes it can look like cream or double cream oh my god i'm literally using all of these different food analogies that's probably putting people off food so again really sorry if you now no longer want to put cream or double cream on your dessert but thrush can look like that not all women are aware when they have thrush so some women can have thrush and have no symptoms and that's quite common so there have been situations where i've had to do a gynecological examination on a patient and i've put the speculum in and i've had a look and i'm like oh it looks like you've got flash and the woman's like oh i didn't realize that i had rash because she didn't have any symptoms if you do get symptoms with rush the common ones are volval itching or burning or stinging and sometimes the lips of the vagina can actually look red and swollen it can be uncomfortable to sit down it can be uncomfortable to have sex so this is another cause of dyspareunia painful sex sometimes if there's just small amounts of thrush and it's not causing you any symptoms it doesn't necessarily need to be treated because it can clear up by itself but there are some situations in which even if you don't have symptoms if you're found to have thrush we recommend that you treat it and one of those conditions is during pregnancy so we treat thrush with anti-fungal or anti-yeast medication and this comes in the forms of tablets pessaries and creams a quick note about the tablets and the pessaries please take note because this one goes in your mouth and this one goes in the vagina so you don't want to get those two mixed up cream or white vagina discharge can also be normal especially if it's not associated with itching or burning or stinging and if your usual vaginal discharge is cream or white and it doesn't have an offensive smell and they're only small amounts so it doesn't always mean that you've got thrush if you have a cream or white discharge the next vaginal discharge we're talking about is gray characteristically this is a common type of discharge that you get if you've got bacterial vaginosis so bacterial vaginosis is not a sexually transmitted infection it's classed as a sexually associated infection and what all that's saying really is that you don't tend to get bv if you've never had sex and it's not caused by having sex but it's associated with women that have sex the main thing that contributes to having bv is a change in the ph of the vagina so the ph rises it becomes more alkaline maybe due to for example washing inside the vagina with certain soaps douching using perfume products all of these change the ph of the vagina and cause an overgrowth of a certain type of bacteria which then gives this gray discharge it's usually not associated with itching or irritation although some women can experience that as well the other characteristic thing about this discharge is that it has a fishy smell some women also notice that the smell is stronger after they've just had a shower and washed down below with soap or after sex if you have this kind of discharge please see your doctor because it can be treated the way that we treat it is with antibiotics either as tablets gel or as a cream the final color of vaginal discharge that i want to talk about is clear so this is your normal vaginal discharge and it can have no smell or odor or it can have a slightly acidic smell and it varies in amount and inconsistency depending on where you are in your period cycle if you are ovulating sexually aroused or breastfeeding you can have more of this kind of discharge the discharge changes in consistency so at times it's more kind of stringy and stretchy and watery and other times it thickens up and it can be a little bit kind of snotty or it can be more runny and stringy and a bit more like egg white this doesn't need any treatment especially if it's not associated with any itching or burning or irritation of the vulva now that we've gone through all the different types of colors that you can get a vaginal discharge i want to talk to you about what you can do at home to help yourself to reduce your risk of having abnormal vaginal discharge or when to just go and see a doctor let's talk about self-care to reduce your risk of having abnormal vaginal discharge practice good personal hygiene so what i mean by that is make sure that you are washing the vulva daily so wash the outside of the vagina avoid douches where you're washing inside the vagina because this changes the ph and can cause you to have bv and the discharge that's associated with bv avoid kind of perfumed soaps bubble baths vaginal deodorants femme fresh or feminine white all of these can increase your chance of having that great discharge that's associated with having bacterial vaginosis some of these can also predispose you to having flush i know for some of you you're going to be like i don't need to be told this but not everybody knows but when you've gone to the toilet and you've done your pee wipe from front to back because what you don't want to be doing is transferring all of the bacteria from the anus towards or into the vagina because that can give you an abnormal vaginal discharge the next tip is practice safe sex so in the past when i've said this to some women they've gone yeah i'm practicing safe sex i've got my contraception i've got my pill no that's not safe sex that will protect you from pregnancy i'm talking about protecting yourself from getting an sti and the only thing that's going to do that is a condom so as well as your usual pill or implant or whatever contraceptive method you've chosen you also need to use a condom to prevent stis such as trichomonas vaginalis wear cotton underwear so sometimes this one seems like a fluffy one you know like oh wear cotton underwear everything is going to be nice and fresh and down there it it kind of is but it also kind of isn't because synthetic underwear is more associated with kind of sweating and moisture down there and that can encourage the growth of certain bacteria or yeast to give you thrush so this is why we recommend wearing cotton underwear there are some instances when you just need to ditch the self-care and go and see your doctor so those instances are if you are having bleeding in between your periods regularly if you're having a blood stain discharged after menopause or if you've got unusual vaginal discharge such as that green yellow discharge that i've mentioned other instances are if you have a discharge that's associated with a fever or feeling unwell crampy lower abdominal pain then you really need to be seeing your doctor so that you can have a proper assessment and a diagnosis of the cause i hope that you have found that video really informative and please don't be embarrassed i say this a lot in my videos when i'm talking about women's health because i think that we don't like discussing certain things because we feel that we may be judged don't let embarrassment stop you from taking control of your own health and going to see your doctor for most doctors there is nothing we haven't seen or heard so it's quite difficult to embarrass us and i think you're often more embarrassed about having to tell the story of what's happened if you are having an abnormal vaginal discharge that is your body's way of telling you that something is up so go and seek the right help if you found this video useful please share it and of course comment below i love reading your comments and i'm happy to
