{"wr3fy69_iTo": "hey y'all trevor here with right of the leaf and today we're going to be diving into another strain from the violet tourist we have tried that sage and sour just a couple of weeks ago so i thought that uh with the popularity of this strain specifically we dive in because the quality of that sage and sour was quite high the black cherry punch three and a half gram bag from violet tourist is going to be one that uh we'll have to compare against our edison review that we did just a little bit earlier in this year but with that you guys let's go ahead get our intro in here because we got quite a bit more talking and quite a bit of bud to review today cheers and i'll see you when we get in here welcome back you guys and like i said in the intro we're going to be diving into the black cherry punch indica dominant strain from violet tourists we have picked up and smoked the sage and sour strain from the same lp and these are actually the same growers that put out the queen of the bud product so if you tried their california pre-rolls or their toe pads their blue topaz which is a slower cane strain it's grown by the same company as this violet tourist flower will be or the super flowers they call it but before we go into any more of that information or really dive into this review in um full force we've got to cover exactly what this review is going to be going over so you guys can either skip to the part that you want to watch or know exactly how it's going to proceed now we start out with the information that's on the packaging whether it's the bag or the container that allows you guys to know exactly when the bud was packaged if you're smoking along with me to compare to see if it's the same batch or if it is going to be one that is a little bit different different batches do allow and offer a little bit of a different overall experience and the handful of times that you guys have picked this up and you've either had the same batch or a different one and let me know down in the comments i really do appreciate it so if you're smoking along side this review please let me know how this bud scores for you with this now with the actual review we cover the information on the container then we move over to usually and hopefully the license producers website which today we aren't able to use so we've gone to our next step down the line which is going to be either the alberta cannabis website or the ontario cannabis stores website both of these shops provide the information that is most directly linked to the licensed producers so it is very likely the best information that those producers are providing for those companies because the alberta cannabis.org and the ocs or the ontario cannabis store websites they are the only legal online sales option for the province of alberta and the province of ontario it's just the way that uh these provinces have decided to do their legalization once we finish off there we move over into the actual review we got one step left before we start smoking and that is to crack open the container and take a look and smell of this bud we scored out of 10 for our looking aroma pretty self-explanatory there now the next two steps do deserve a little bit more explanation a little bit more depth but we go into that more so when we get to them first one being our vaporizer where we're baking our bud versus burning it it goes in the ceramic heater here we run it through three temperatures specific terpenes play the factor on why we choose those three temperatures but i do go over full details when we get to the vaporizer and then our bongs we have a very similar approach as a vaporizer with our bongs where we light it up with three different intensities of heat as well as just different ways of uh starting our bowls up and getting that cherry in there but we will go over the full details of that when we are on that part of the review you guys then to finish up the smoking side we go a little bit more classic with either our elements paper or a regal cigar they both get smoked through the pipe being first and then we smoke our way through the joint talk about the high and each individual point of this review gets scored out of ten eights are what we're looking for for that higher score 48 out of 60 is what we're looking for for the beautiful garbage if the bud is able to maintain eights all the way down she gets a 48. if she doesn't well we're hoping that we can make up some of the scores where the other side lacks but with that being said you guys that covers the entirety of what we're going to be getting into so now let's actually cover the information on the container before we go over into the website and get this review rocking the way we like to so violet tourist super flower black cherry punch it is going to be an indica dominant strain it's a three and a half gram dried cannabis bag thc total of 21.4 percent a cbd total of 0.06 a little bit on the higher side for the high thc mark but again nothing really potent on that cbd side here we've got a package date of the first or sorry you guys the 14th of january 2021 and a price point of 37.99 so the violet tourist has been putting out a really good quality flower from what i have experienced through the sage and sour now let's see if the black cherry punch puts out the same overall output you guys because i'm uh i'm quite excited for this but before we can crack that bag and get our beautiful urban scale intro in here let's quickly read off the information that the alberta cannabis dot org offers up to us it's brought to you by the burnt so brnt group violet tourist black cherry punch is a high potency terpene rich indica dominant flower that features visually stunning violet tones with a piercing aroma of fruit subtle floral background notes and earthy nuances the violet tourist super flower back cherry punch is a three and a half gram bag it is grown by cadre cannabis the violet tourist is just going to be your brad name let's scroll on down quickly cover the terpenes that are all and sorry the terpenes and the flavor options that the website describes so citrus hoppy and floral are your flavor profiles your terpene profiles are going to be lemonine at 24.0 percent with a citrus flavor alpha bisalbolol which is going to be floral in flavor and at fifteen point three percent and then you got carafeline which is leaning on the hoppy side of the flavor this time at twenty point two percent and the other terpenes build up the rest merisneen and linolol being the two primary ones that the website has to offer but with that you guys that is all the information that we have available on this strain you know exactly what that means it's time to get into our beautiful herb not not into our beautiful herbage well we're hoping it's beautiful garbage and it's time to get into the urban scale you guys see on the other side we're smoking on some black cherry punch [Music] welcome back you guys so let's go ahead and dive into this bag of black cherry punch from the violet tourists so first impressions are a very sweet very fruity aroma holy [ __ ] like extremely fruity and sweet flavor i am gonna want to weigh this out you guys because if you look at it we got three nugs and one i don't even count as a nug because it's just i can see where it broke off of the main piece let me switch the camera on over and let you guys take a little looksie at what we have to offer here before we put it up on the scale see you guys in a second see as we slide in here you guys can tell we've got just the two big nugs and this this piece i'm thinking it fell off right there either right there or right at the base of this one because you look we've got just two massive massive nugs we got a nice zero gram on here the first nug is going to be 2.9 the second nug will get us up to 3.39 third one will put us at 3.55 so we're just over that eighth on the weight you guys but now when it comes to overall color you can see the purple tones coming into the top of that bud got nice even pistol and crystal distribution throughout it looks really really nice the bigger bud definitely has more color than the smaller but still it has me quite excited we are definitely smoking this larger nug than over this one i'm gonna save that guy for later but let's go ahead get these girls busted up while i uh talk my way through what i'm thinking i'm gonna give the score okay guys let's go ahead put this big nug this big purple nug back in the bag it bounced back really really nicely when i give it a squeeze it has a little bit of a break and um kind of a crushing to it but that's that's gonna happen when you get these big pack nugs like this it's definitely something that uh that could happen just with the packaging and it's really the inner portions of this nug that's gonna make the determine on whether it's a really fresh smoke or not so i'm looking forward to that the aroma that i'm getting off of this butt is absolutely unreal you guys it is so potent and so rich in its overall experience and um off put and the amount of crystal on the inside of these nugs is unreal you guys i i honestly want to bust it up because i have a feeling that this bud busted up is going to earn at an extra point and that's there's certain strains that i will give the benefit of the doubt and judge it on a busted aroma because when the nugs are just this large and um this well packed the aroma is a little bit of an undersell until we bust it up and i'm finding that with my home grow as well the buds are nice and densely cured and well packed you don't get a really potent aroma but when you bust it up and those terpenes have a chance to off gas and really become aromatic it does well and this train is another one of those it's got kind of a baked good um experience to it too like almost um like a bakery with doing like a fresh buried like cherry biscuit that type of experience you guys all very enjoyable very exciting definitely a nine out of ten for the look and aroma the size of the buds the quality of the buds look great the actual aroma when it's busted up and ready to go is just as incredible and exciting as well you guys so i'm gonna go ahead and roll up our joint and uh get ready to start smoking this through our vaporizer and then eventually through our rigs thankfully to uh to the power of editing this joint roll is only going to take me a second and i'll see you guys when we are packing up and explaining our bombless cfc vaporizer cheers let's get into this hail and just like i said thankfully to the power of editing we are back and throwing things around while we dive into our boundless cfc vaporizer so what i'm going to do is i'm going to turn this on i'm going to get it started warming up on its way up to 175 degrees celsius the reason we start out at 175 degrees celsius is two primary terpenes the limonene and the maracinine lemonine like its name is going to be based off of the lemon based flavor it's going to have that really citrus acidic sharp flavor that lemons are known for the maraschini flavor is going to have a little bit more of a range to it it does have a little bit of an earthy flavor it does have a little bit of a woody touch but the primarily primary experience is going to be a green herbal experience there is a mango tone that plays as well so you do get that juicy fruity flavor but it does lean on that more acidic side similar to that lemonade so those two play very well together when you have a combination of the two you can get more of a lemongrass lemon wood citronella overall experience or just a raw rainforest herbal experience so we start out with that let's take a couple hauls talk you guys through it before we bump up to 205 and go into those details you guys cheers initial experience is really light it's got definitely that hint of a cushy tone that kind of damp earth flavor to that kush tone but there's a sharp fruity sweetness to it i can't really put a finger on what i'm tasting but it's got with that earthy cross i'm getting more of a rich berry cherry that kind of an experience you guys now when we bump up to 205 from this 175 the flavors that i'm experiencing here should get more predominant 205 is really where your creamy rich earthy flavors start to become nice and potent nice and strong you guys a little bit of the extra temperature allows a lot of the other terpenes to boil off and start to actually render more flavor and more overall effect 205 you get your creamy your chocolate your cushy your earthy sometimes your cherry your more berry flavors which personally for me lean a little bit more on that cream side that's where the 205 thrives the rich potent flavors this is usually the temperature that i start to find about you guys with the 175 being light hinting towards that kind of cherry rich earthy flavor 205 is going to be nice and tasty if it carries along that way you guys but the only way to find out is by pulling on it and finding out so let's get to it okay goes on the more wood side it does lose that kind of cushy flavor a cushy tone that i was enjoying at the beginning it does kind of hold on to that little bit of the fruity-esque flavor that sweeter flavor but it's by no means exciting or really overwhelming it's just a light kind of rich creamy buried flavor with just hints of a wood tone to it now 220 that's how we finish this vaporizer off the reason we finished off with 220 degrees is beta-carotene and the thc boiling points they both are activated and start to boil off at the 220 degree range the heaviest effect from the thc as well as the more woodied and peppered experience that the beta carefully has to offer let's get to it and see what we have here i'm expecting woody flavor i don't know what uh what it's gonna do but let's find out folks definitely wooded it's got a little bit a little bit of a pepper bite which honestly caught me off guard but it still holds that kind of rich sweet or sweeter flavor i would say a rich flavor but i would say a rich sweeter flavor and all in all it was enjoyable you guys it was enjoyable enough for me to really be able to sit down and and find the flavors through each of the levels that actually were nice but let's go ahead dump that out so we can move on the line move on down the line to our next chunk of uh reviewable content and that is going to be our bongs what we're going to do is we're going to run it through three different temperatures first and foremost hepwick this is the lowest ignition source temperature that allows the bong to really melt and boil and burn up that bud and get all the terpenes and as much of a potent flavor as we can experience through the rigs hemp wick first way we experience it most milked and slowest way to uh to smoke it i find for getting that bowl to snap secondly most common way straight up clipper lighter bic any uh any just lighter from your pocket that's how we take our second rip and typically is our most common and that's why i like using the beaker and then finally we got our tower cyclone rig that gets hit with the jet lighter that really does cherry up and pop up the the flavor in these strains but it's not the most common way and it's definitely not the uh the smoothest way to smoke some of these strange eats each way have a different um overall experience and flavor to uh to have so that's why we like uh diving into it this way so we really give this bud as much of an opportunity and a chance to present itself as flavorful and uh enjoyable as possible you guys but with that being said i flapped my gums long enough let's get to smoking this bud cheers and i'll see you on the other side [Music] so [Music] [Music] okay guys so i realized that i forgot to score the vaporizer before we moved on so let's go ahead and do that a 6 out of 10 is what i ended up scoring the vaporizer overall for its experience and its flavor it had just enough flavor there to really spike my interest but it was just kind of all right all in all and overall in in uplifting flavor but and uh it just it didn't carry enough to really have me excited it piqued my interest but that's about it now moving into our bongs we're going to give it a 7 out of a 10 for the flavor and the overall experience for the bongs the the flavor in and of itself is building right now but it's kind of reached where it would cap and it's just holding and it's just it's building up more the transition of the flavor from the sweeter creamy flavor which is that berry cherry kind of an experience that that i'm finding like any any strains that say well berry experience creamy creamy with the fruit flavoring like that's that's how it comes across to me the cherry falls right in with there with the with that berry flavor now overall it did have a nice sweet rich flavor through each of the bongs but the key selling point for me is whether it's gonna have that nice strong earthy almost cushy tone to it that pushes through on that end this side that like that undertone that really kind of tops up this flower and really puts it over the edge it had that on that very last hoot and it had it for a very light very short amount of time but if i could have experienced that through all three rigs we'd be giving it an eight or higher but the fact that i just got it with the jet lighter is a little bit disappointing i'm curious to see if a big big big bowl packed into our uh nice glass beaker bog and with the clipper lighter that'll make any difference because that does like to uh accumulate quite a bit of heat and almost simulate what the jet lighters like when it comes to the end because that that very base the bowl gets quite hot when you like the heat circulate in there and build up and burn it's way down but with that being said you guys we're gonna move and transition on into the regal i have i have some interesting thoughts on this i i really don't know where it's gonna go with the flavor if it takes that sour flavor and kind of runs with it and goes on the more creamed sour almost like a creamed creamed diesel experience would be almost the best way to to describe how i hope it goes um or it takes that wood side and puts it into a nice sweet earthy wood combo either those would be ones that i'd be quite happy and quite impressed with but we're not going to know until we light it up and start smoking it so why the hell we're still talking i do not know let's get to smoking cheers i will give it a 7 out of 10 for the taste from a pipe you guys honestly it took more of a creamed wood flavor like a sweetened wood flavor and it's almost using that sour side to just make it more like a blackberry like more that type of overall output for flavor and it's it's enjoyable you guys it's quite nice and it was relatively smooth through the pipe and it stayed smooth now that i'm sitting here all in all it's an enjoyable experience 7 out of 10 because it did complement the flavor that was there before and just accelerate upon it and improve upon it you guys so not much else to say about that bud but not bad not bad at all now let's go through get our case from a joint the first couple dry halls through here see what we have to expect before we light up this uh little joint and start smoking and scoring cheers nice rich cherry flavor just incredibly fruity you guys incredibly fruity let's uh spark it up and see if it smokes the same welcome back you guys so for the taste from our joint i'm going to end up giving it a 9 out of 10. honestly the overall experience and how smooth the smoke was is absolutely incredible one hundred percent in the most enjoyable way i've smoked a strain it really does have a nice strong potent cherry flavor that just sits there and builds and builds as you smoke your way through it it's the joint that you guys saw i got about three holes in and i just sat back and just kind of closed my eyes or let my eyes hang low and just kind of [ __ ] chilled out for a bit really really enjoyable strain nine out of ten for the taste for joint it just didn't it doesn't have enough potency or real flavor to get me excited to give it a 10 but it has everything else the smooth the a nice strong flavor but not strong in the ways that i would like it smooth easy smoking just nice butt for rolling up into a joint and smoking just not perfect when we come to the high god damn if we didn't get the same thing just about perfect has a nice strong easy body high that hits right away and then just kind of leaves you and then comes back again like it it hit the body hot hits right away really intensely and then you get the wave that floods from your body like it slams your body and then it waves up into your head and then it kind of finds that that equilibrium right that balance between the two then it holds there so i've got a really nice body ease and relaxation my backs not tight anymore i've got the nice relaxing neck muscles like everything that's sore from doing a lot of the moving around and rearranging that we did isn't quite as sore anymore and it's feeling a lot better and more enjoyable to sit here and smoke through the strain now the mental effects it's a heavy like a very heavy mental drift you guys it's taking a lot of effort for me to stay on focus and stay like zoned right in and it's really one of those strains where it'll be good before you wrap your day up like i'm i'm probably gonna need a shower and a cup of coffee to kind of reset myself um after smoking this you guys all in all very incredible strain nice and potent definitely one of my top tier indica strains that i've that i've found myself um the bubba the super skunk i would put right along this level um the mac one's kind of a tier above this but it ain't far you guys raider kush tier above this white heartbreak more on this level um close the the quadra this level like some really really high level strange you guys um would be on this level a good a really good gorilla glue stuff like that the moby dick crumble not moby dick crumble uh white rhino crumble from verse originals the moby dick crumble from from rolling chirps like some of my favorite continuous continual smokers are uh are right along this level of high and i think this black cherry punch is gonna be become one of those it's not one i think i'll be pulling out during the streams often but i think it'll be a good one to kind of wrap the day up but um with that you guys i think it's a good time to wrap this video up with the last two nines for the score with the high getting a 9 out of 10 as well 47 out of 60. one point shy guys that beautiful garbage we almost made it again almost made it again um but we uh we're just a little shine and that's okay i'm okay with us having some buds that are punching right around that that 48 marker but not quite getting there then at least this gives you the people who are waiting for that beautiful herb it just gives you something to give a shot right because personally anything 42 plus if it's got a component that you really are looking forward to trying like the ogen strains those were all 40 plus scoring strains they didn't score 48 but they were still really high recommendation strains are ones i always go to and recommend if people are looking for a specific type of flavor or a specific effect and that's the thing is 40s plus in my opinion 42 to 43 if you want to be a little bit on that pickier edge you're going into a really nice and enjoyable experience when you get that 46 47 48 plus you're getting into some some top quality top quality flower right you guys so i'm looking forward to seeing how the next batch of bud does because we've got some 15 grams of strawberry cough we're gonna be reviewing it's at a nice and uh low thc point though this time so i'm curious to see how bonafide did with it and uh we've got a green apple 510 vape cart that we're having to do on thursday but with that you guys let's wrap this one up it's

leaf and today we're going to be diving into the black cherry punch three and a half gram container from edison i'm really excited to try this strain out i've heard it's one of the tastiest ones that edison has put out so with that we are definitely looking forward to high scoring the bongs a high score in the vape and hopefully we get a nice strong push to get our regal cigar here a higher score than the six and sevens that we've been get racing we have been getting recently oh obviously the tongue is starting to stutter i think it's time that we get into this review so we can start smoking because that's typically the best way i help get the communication nice and clear i'll see you guys on the other side of this intro when we dive into the black cherry punch from edison cheers welcome back you guys and for those of you who are new to the channel welcome to checking out one of your first reviews from readyleaf the way we do it here is it is going to be a lot longer of a review than you may be accustomed to but we get into a lot of detail and that's a part of the reason why the length is what it is now i'll give you a quick overview of what to expect over the next roughly half hour of this strain review first and foremost we cover the information that we have on the three and a half gram container or whichever size we are smoking that day before we move on into hopefully the license producers website if not we typically use the ontario cannabis store or the alberta cannabis stores online website before finally falling into either leaf me or a lift and co base for our strain information that we uh like to cover and get an idea of what we're gonna dive into and what sort of flavors and aromas and experiences we're gonna have when we spoke the strain shortly after we cover that information then we get into the urban scale and that's the actual rated portion of this review we started out with a look and aroma which hopefully is self-explanatory for you guys we take our look we smell our bud and we score it out of 10. finally after that we move on and start smoking our vaporizer gets ran through first three temperatures we're looking for different terpenes i go into detail with that when we get to that part of the review to follow up and match the idea of the vaporizer we have our bonds those we do three different ignition sources so it provides a little bit of a different experience every bong and each bong is a different size and shape so that as well allows the bud to really develop and hit in a different experience with each individual bong rip following that like i said the regal cigar for our taste from a pipe and then elements has been my favorite paper to use with anything on the market so far and we're we're gonna continue to use the elements paper for our taste from a joint and then before we give our order overall which will be based out of 60 our sixth component is going to be the high you can't smoke without discussing the high because that's really what people are looking for when they're diving into this outside of the the enjoyment of the flavor when you're actually diving in and smoking that strain now with you guys being educated and up-to-date on exactly what we're diving into let's start rattling off this information so that uh we can uh really enjoy the potential flavor that the strain has and the smoke sesh we're about to get into edison cannabis cos black cherry punch this three and a half came in with a thc total of 20 percent it is an indica dominant strain it has a cbd total of less than 0.07 the package date is going to be the 12th of december 2020 and the price range is 23.99 for my shop it may be a little bit higher maybe a little bit less but overall for uh under 10 a gram that is a damn good price this is one of three new strains that edison has released they had their slur cane their ice cream cake and the black cherry punch as a three i have had the slurry cane before we're diving into the ice cream cake this friday and uh the black cherry punch is the only strain that we didn't have lined up to uh review so i thought this would be the best way to bring in these three new strains now we have edison cannabis co pulled up on our laptop here i'm going to quickly cover the information they provide for us before we get into our meat potatoes portion of the review black cherry punch our new black cherry punch indica is a potent pick with 20 plus percent thc sweet and floral undertones balance its fruity flavor and aroma its crown shaped flowers are medium in size with emerald green and purple buds that are crystally rich with trichomes this strain is grown in a micro climate conditions that are inspired by the mountainous environments indica thrives in and like every plant in edison black cherry punch is packaged with our dual boost humidity pack for preserved freshness so the strain is going to be a black cherry pie crossed with a purple punch which both of those i can imagine being really ripe sweet tasting strains the flavors are going to be cherry sweet and floral so it'll be comparable to that lolo mont as the uh the hash plant strain that they have here and your top terpenes are going to be lemonine beta-carothylene linolol meristenine and beta-pinene so that keeps us on that sweet floral side with a little bit of spice and a little bit of um of pine with that kind of almost minty experience of that pinyin and it carefully coming in at the end of the terpenes but with that you guys we've got all the information we need to dive into the strain we get to get in give it the look and aroma score before we wrap up our joint and uh actually get to start smoking i'm looking forward to it i hope you guys are as well let's get the fun part of this review in and started chia gel [Music] so pull off the the cap will take out this humidity pack and uh honestly you guys the buds look not too bad so here get it up on the rolling tray that i have from robinson will pull you off and we'll give you a little look so here you go this is going to be the buds that we have in this three and a half as you can see there are some smaller ones the larger of the three and a half are going to be right here decent crystal you do end up with a alright orange pistol shooting throughout the buds do have a nice bounce back when you give them a squeeze overall i'm quite impressed with how these buds turned out you do end up having a little bit more color leaning into some of these buds here let's uh you know what we're going to pull out the white tray give you guys a little bit of a look in comparison to this one here welcome back you guys so i have been hearing what you guys have been saying you want a little bit better view of the nugs let me know what you think of uh us continuing to do like that where it's just a continuation of our review and uh we keep it rolling that way because i do think that's going to be the uh easiest way to keep this just its natural flow without having to come back and re-record stuff so honestly the light color of these the uh overall aroma that i'm getting off it isn't overwhelming isn't really that exciting uh a seven out of ten because the buds are really fresh and they look really nice for the color and the crystal coating the aroma just doesn't have anything to excite me right now you guys and that's exactly why i can't break into those eights nines or tens saying that let's put the humidity pack back into this container bust up this bud and get into our urban scale with the smokable portion of the review and our vape i'll see you guys over there cheers hey guys so let's get into the vaporizer i have it on i've got it cranked up and getting ready to dive into the 175 degrees celsius that we start off our vapor views like i said in the introduction we go through three different temperatures 175 is our first limonene and maracinine are two terpenes we're aiming for with that temperature so that's going to be your lemon your more citronella lemongrass that type of flavor because with the meristening that tends to be a little bit more the greener or potentially mango style flavor you could get a really green blend of experience with that citrusy flavor of the lemonade or more that maracinine mango acidic base flavor you guys honestly i enjoy the strain when it does blend off like that and this 175 typically is the more citrus side of it afterwards 205 degrees is where we move towards that's going to give us our richer more creamy experience flavors our chocolates our cheeses our cushes our earths and uh you do tend to get a hint of the wood and pepper but that primarily gets displayed at 220 degrees with the thc boiling off as well because the beta carefully terpene likes to pre most present at 220 degrees celsius you guys and with that we are boiling all of our terpenes our flavor makers and our thc and cbd off because we are baking our bud not burning it this is a ceramic oven that's baking not burning our bud at 175 degrees celsius let's dive in and see how the meristening and limonene terpenes show off at this time cheers nice light flavor it would stay on the humid side i would say and is kind of a sweet um floral flavor but nothing really exciting nothing really getting me excited or really looking forward to turning up the temperature and diving into it it's just i could take it i could leave it but uh we're gonna go ahead and take 205 for a rip and see if we will uh have the same experience with that you guys cheers okay so we do go a little bit richer i am getting a lot more of a pine flavor a little bit of a richer heartier sweet flavor more berry-esque i wouldn't necessarily say cherry but more sweet berry flavor enjoyable it's got its points it's it's enjoyable you guys now at 220 let's see what's presenting here honestly i'm not expecting much i'm expecting a wood flavor with a touch pepper and a little bit of kind of a leafy green aftertaste and that the taste from the vape's gonna end up with a six out of ten because it's not remarkable see if my prediction is right i was bang on the money folks except for a little bit more pepper than i was originally expecting primarily woody does have that kind of creamed sweet to it but more than natural sweet where it means more that berry-esque flavor it's all right you guys it's a six because it's without a little bit of a plus um but nothing nothing i'd scream home about nothing i'd lose my mind about it's just nothing too exciting six out of ten's nice and accurate now with that being said you guys we're gonna move on into our bongs we've got our uh envy straight pipe here and our hemp wick that's how we run our first drink our clipper lighter by itself is how we run our second rig and the third one gets a there you are straight up jet lighter near the end because all three have a different cherry all three have a different production of flavors and all three have a different experience that it puts off with the bud sometimes you end up getting a harsher smoke with hepwick where other times the uh the jet lighter just leaves you hacking it's hard to tell until you actually smoke it and that's what we're diving into now you guys straight pipe beaker cyclone that's the order the lighters are hempwick clipper and jet you know what we're getting into i'll tell you the score when we're done all three cheers and let's smoke this [Music] [Music] so okay guys i'm gonna give the taste from a bong a seven out of ten the biggest reasons why it's gonna get a seven out of a ten and not anything higher is because the flavor was a major lack for me i didn't find much of an experience the bong it was really light it had a kind of hint worthy flavor until the very last rip the jet lighter was beneficial to uh to this strain and i think maybe transitioning from the bowl that i'm using right now in this bong to our deeper instagram bowl the one that i typically snap this one's a third of a gram to a half a gram i typically end up packing in here so the flavor that i get is a lot stronger of a representation than i typically find in here good example of that lemon garlic koji we reviewed last week with a six out of ten for the taste from a bong if i had smoked a bowl out of this probably would have bumped it up to a seven potentially an eight because it had a really nice potent almost more spiced ginger flavor but still really enjoyable to sit down and enjoy really enjoyable to sit down and enjoy well i [ __ ] hope it was enjoyable to sit down and enjoy this bud at least get you baked we'll talk about that at the end of the review guys but seven had a ton for the bong seven out of ten for the bong primarily because it was a smooth experience the overall flavor wasn't strong until we got to the jetliner you guys when we got there it was more of an aftertaste like i'm getting more of kind of a stone fruit like berry cherry like that richer creamier fruity flavor with a more of a crumble kind of that less crispy pie more soft doughy spice that's the experience i'm having right now and it's not a bad one it's what i'm enjoying actually a fair bit with that we've got the regal cigar well the regal slam packed up let's go ahead and spark our way through the pipe and see how this bud presents itself in here cheers you guys and let's dive into this 6 out of 10 is what i'm going to end up giving the taste from a pipe it honestly increased a nice little sweet balanced flavor off of that sour wood but it didn't really push its way through you guys it didn't present itself as a unique experience and if it can't i can't break the 6 out of 10 for the pipe it's enjoyable it has a nice smooth draw definitely is a sweet to the sour that the pipe tends to give off but if it's not a really strong or potent flavor you guys it's not gonna earn itself anything higher than sixes or sevens consistently now with that being said i've got my clipper lighter we're gonna dry haul through our joint here see what flavors we can come to expect to uh taste through here before we actually light it up and start on smoking cheers you guys i'm getting kind of that artificial cherry flavor similar to what you'd get through a kool-aid like those squirt added to water kind of experience where it's not really that strong super sweet but more of the flavor towards the hint towards and almost like those um watermelon rock candies on a stick the cross between those two is really the flavor i'm getting but let's uh spark up the joint and see how it tastes you guys cheers okay guys taste from a joint it's gonna end up getting an 8 out of a ten this last third is starting to break down a little bit we're starting to get a little bit more of that spice we're starting to get a little bit more of that carefully kick in it's still a nice smooth experience it's got a nice even smoke to it it's just the peppers taking a little bit more control than i would honestly appreciate and i would i'd really like it if it balanced out and got a little bit sweeter more of that cherry experience that we got right at the beginning because it tasted like cherry pie filling for the first half this joint and then you started to get that little bit of spice in there which was really crust experience and now it's just going more peppered which it's not a horrible experience it's just not my favorite and i can't score it higher than the aid because it that that pepper experience is taking away some of the enjoyment of smoking it and then a 9 or 10 won't have that now switching over to the high i will end up giving this a nine considering i don't know how it's going to last if it's one of those strains that'll as soon as i'm done the review i sit down and i transfer the audio over and i'm burnt out or i'm feeling it wear off i usually regret giving it a nine um but this one i can still feel building it's like it's still building from the bongs which is a big benefit if i kind of peek at the peak with the high at the bongs i'm disappointed you guys now with that being said i definitely did not peek at the bongs i'm smoking the droid i can feel it still kind of creeping along i can feel that high coming in a little bit slower than uh than some of the others hit and it's nice it's nice to know that i've still got a little bit more to go after i'm done recording this and that relatively clear head but strong um emotional ease so like it's emotionally relaxing so i'm not stressed about [ __ ] i'm not but i'm still able to focus i'm still able to think through it whatever i want to is huge but it just gives you that ability to take that it's taking that deep breath for you continuously is the best way to describe it um and then the body ease and relaxation is really nice it does make my eyelids a little bit heavier but not necessarily tired just squinty and there's there's some strains that do that and there's other ones that aren't quite as bad but this one's definitely a squinter kind of a strain so with the not in and the eight for the final two scores a 43 out of 60 is how this one ends up which isn't bad five points out of the beautiful herbage it's it's reasonable for it to be where it's at first for edison honestly that's really nice high score it's definitely something i would recommend for the price point as well um and honestly you guys it's it's not a bad strain it's not a bad strain whatsoever i just i wish it had a little bit more flavor to the bong and i'm thinking switching over into the bigger bowl is going to make a difference the joint was really nice i wish that flavor consisted all the way through to the end but the end wasn't horrible it just wasn't my favorite and that's the best way that i can describe it you guys and uh with that i think we're gonna wrap this one up today i hope you guys enjoyed i hope you're looking forward to tomorrow's live stream um and uh we'll be back with some more content y'all uh for the time being if you guys made it this far and haven't

soil friday night early saturday morning it is now wednesday so let's see how many things that is four days in sorry about the long pause four days in four days it's a quick update on what i do in the morning and in the evening when i come in with these seedlings um let's go what we got first okay first up we got that gelato 33. i mean at 33k which is gelato 33 across with the acapulco gold she still got her helmet on she popped out of her helmet over here we got our blackberry no black cherry punch it's black cherry punch see she busted through back here we got that auto purple bust through i don't know crate trade genetics maybe i did the germination wrong i'm talking to a friend some seeds like to go directly into the dirt we'll redo them let's see and then we got the other auto purple if crates don't come through we will be popping a couple more over here we got some clone like i see it before it's a little dry in there purple some water in there but yeah that's pretty much it we're about two or three minutes in this is your boy gmo and uh like i said i'm gonna show you what i do is basically what i do is uh take a half a gallon of water and i put um about two meals and maybe one meal of the seaweed extract and uh according to this cup right here as you can see everything is dry with an exception of that autoflower over there is not that dry but everybody will be getting about 20 meals 20 to 40 meals and i i use this syringe right here and then i just put it in there pull it up i said about 40 meals per plant each twice a day i'm talking to see them standing on their own and i can uh put some some real water into the soil to where it ain't [ __ ] with their roots [Music] and that's pretty much it basically the circle oh yeah you see none of that damn my bad do it again yeah so y'all see exactly it's for that and then i take it and then [Music] just like that and if you guys are wondering i'm going in a coco core mixed with a uh dang i just dropped the seed husk in there i'm going with coco core and coco core and uh fox farm 50 uh two to three meaning i'm doing two gallons to one gallon of two gallons of cocoa to one gallon of fox farm floor [Music] it is a black sheer red punch uh oh make a mess so [Music] want to hit these empty spots back here where it should be seeds that hopefully that'll help because the soil is not moist we want to keep it moist we had tap roots and we put them in that we did [Music] i'm not going to give her any water because she is still yet moist and according to my man chef anna with the pot you do not want to do nothing for 10 days other than mist for this over here i showed you guys before i just pretty much lift up this stone and what happens is i lift it up right yeah i check this i know i got something going on cause it's not coming out [Music] it's just taking forever and i really personally think it's got a lot to do with um it has a lot to do i think a lot of us have to do when you're not seeing any roots this [ __ ] is the fact that it's just not really warm as you can see my temps are 77 [Music] so i gotta figure out a way to get it warm in here and get my humidity up and i just spray that off there and i'll just put this top back on it click it in and put it up against the wall but yeah that's it youtube i made a seven minute long video about watering these plants it ain't

following tips and take up little space in the garden compared to plants such as tomatoes or cucumbers they can even be grown in containers if gardening real estate is in short supply such as that available on a patio or deck 1 start seeds indoors bell peppers can easily be grown from seed started either indoors or sewn directly into the soil if conditions permit if you live in an area that experiences cold winters start seeds inside 6 to 8 weeks before the last predicted frost for your climate zone plant two to three seeds per container and thin out the weaker seedlings after a couple of weeks to transplant seedlings outside pepper plants need outside temperatures to be a steady 70 degrees or warmer to flourish when ambient temps hit this mark move seedlings outside plant them about 24 inches apart in an area that receives plenty of Sun this provides ample space to grow but puts them close enough to help shade each other in the hottest Sun choose planting spots with nutrient-rich well-drained soil 3 mulch around plants mulching around garden plants is a beneficial step that many people often overlook a thick layer of mulch over the soil surface will help to keep weeds down retain soil moisture and keep the soil cooler over the roots you can use commercial bark chips pine needles grass clippings or even straw as suitable mulch 4 provide adequate water pepper plants will need 1 to 2 inches of water per week for maximum growth notes bonnie Plants this amount may need to be increased slightly when the weather is extremely hot and dry water at the base of the plant to avoid saturating the foliage 5 apply fertilizer to promote growth for optimum plant growth bell peppers will need to be fed to replenish nutrients lost from the soil wait until the plants blossom before fertilizing them to encourage fruit production fertilizer applications prior to this will promote vegetative growth instead of blossom formation 6 treat pests accordingly insect pests can cause a significant amount of damage once they infest a vegetable crop keep a close eye on bell peppers to spa infestations quickly early treatment can help minimize damage and resulting yield loss common pests in bell peppers include blister beetles aphids cutworms mites and pepper weevils staff at a garden center can help identify pests and recommend appropriate treatment options 7 harvest fruit when ready peppers are ready to harvest when they reach the size and color you'd like a wonderful aspect of bell peppers is you can harvest them even before the fruit is fully matured random fact green bell peppers are immature orange red yellow or purple bell peppers when harvesting the fruit from the plants it's better to cut the stem 1 to 2 inches above the fruit instead of pulling off the pepper that helps avoid damage to both the plant and the fruit", "bBAXF-wbeDc": "[Music] hey everyone it's clint from canadian cannabis culture back with another review uh today we're looking at cherry punch by black market so this one here is sitting at 22 percent thc uh cherry punch is an indica dominant hybrid which is bred by crossing cherry ak-47 and purple punch cherry punch is said to have a musky berry aroma with an earthy flavor and a soft and sweet berry finish black market hand trims and hang dries their plants and it says on their website that their buds are meticulously cured black market is cultivated in bc and alberta i believe uh indoors small batch and they're sisters with uh cannabis company tenzo and if you're looking to invest in them they're both under the parent company gtech holdings which i'll have on the screen okay so let's get a look at it here shrink wrap these jars are actually super cool basically just for the lid you just kind of twist it to the side and then it pops right off super easy got a really nice smell right off the bat definitely get you guys a good look at that okay now that we've learned a little bit about cherry punch by black market uh the last thing i got to do is test it out for the rating so i'll go do that and i'll be right back [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right everyone after testing out the cherry punch by black market really impressed by this one i think it's the best uh that i've got from black market so far not that any of them have been bad but uh this was definitely my favorite had a really good taste uh definitely like a bit earthy uh but definitely had like that buried finish so i really enjoyed the taste the effects on it were really good not like super overwhelming but definitely does the job well um super smooth um the only knocks on it i guess would be the ash was uh was good uh it wasn't super dark or anything but it wasn't like super super light either uh and the burn on it was just good um it wasn't like uh trying to go out or anything like that but it didn't burn like super well but it didn't burn bad either so overall really good and i forgot to mention the uh the package date on this one as well which was uh august 17th uh 2020 so i'm going to rate this one in 8.9 out of 10. until next time guys", "UwnPMt7dmOc": "hi this video is from capsule t.com studio and today in this video I'm going to show you the fruit knee at now this is the first series for this knee up and we are going to do to fruit many arts in this series now on your screen are the things that i have used for disney at so for the first design what you have to do is apply a base coat on electric green color and all your legs with tangerine yellow color draw the shape of papaya on the name flip the papaya leave a small oval shape at the center of this entire now with yellow color make small strokes all over the papaya for that shady we can give a natural look to the fruit make very small cluster of dots with maroon color at the center of this to hire at the center where be happy left a small oval state and alleges around the center on the yellow portion also now apply a top coat for them sheep and prediction of your name up now tweet the same design on all the nails for the finished look and you are done with papaya they are now coming over to the second design this is watermelon slice design except for the design apply a base coat of oil sheen color of all your names and make a conical shape with red color starting from the top of the knee now apply forest green color on top of the conical shape in a rectangular form you can see in the video how I'm doing it now to market the green and the red color with the help of fine white line you can use the nail art pen to drop this light now with electric green make small strokes on the forest green color for the beautiful shading now take me back then and make small black color seats on the red pot apply a top coat to protect the nail art and this will also achieve to this name up and simply repeat the design on each nail and you are tan with a watermelon slice design made up well

is going to be ASMR I'm just kidding this is the loudest [ __ ] review we're gonna do whoo marijuana reviewing that's what we be doing so today's weed is some of the loudest weed you can get in the legal market right now today we're looking at black market cherry punch this is coming in at where is it now I can't remember this is coming in that twenty eight point eight nine percent THC here it is right here twenty eight point eight nine percent THC that is the strongest cannabis in the legal market to date if I'm wrong correct me but I've never seen anything over 26 so getting twenty eight point eight nine practically 29 that's good to see I'm excited for this one yeah my friends at spirit leaf West Kelowna let me know that this black market cherry punch just rolled in and said you got to come and get it we heard it strong as [ __ ] I'm gonna see what it's all about cherry punch is a hybrid they took ak-47 and crossed it with purple punch to give this a nice well-balanced hybrid super pump let's just get into a purple punch has a very purpley color that's what I should be expecting here something purple you know let's just [ __ ] see let's look at the package a real quick cuz they all want to know what pack state is May 16th and we're are June like I don't know a 3 June 8th so we are three weeks old not you bad that's some of the freshest [ __ ] on the market right now three weeks old so I got this stuff as the best I could get it in its best form that it's possible to come in here this little jar 52:19 for 1/8 of cherry punch glass container big fan glass container I'm also wearing my nice shirt today I put the nice shirt on for some premium craft dope-smoking straight up let's get in here got the handy-dandy scale crack that [ __ ] open that is pungent pungent is all I can say right off the start it's kind of ripping through my nostrils if you will all right okay there you have it it's three point five three point four seven that's where we're settling at that's bang on you know a couple hundreds off you can't judge anybody on that that is a three point five eighths good we're there all right here it is so super caked it's Trico me it's got a very good keyer sponginess to it that is right for smoking beautiful weed though beautiful look on that marijuana the other purple punch I've had in the past has been much more purple but that's different phenotypes that's how it is all right there's the eight focus that's looking pretty good that's looking pretty good I'm gonna take this top nug right here I'm gonna put that in the grinder with this other piece right there oh here we go twenty eight point eight nine percent THC that [ __ ] excites me that was a little rhyme it's very pungent usually when dealing with a higher THC strange we're also getting more terpene profiles out of that which makes those strains more pungent little more like smash in the face don't be a little bit's and smoke meek I'm strong that's what it's saying Rolie Polie Olie here we go I'm [ __ ] hungry to you right now whoa smoke super earthy right now I don't have too much to say about this coming into it right now there's not a whole lot of ripping flavor it is just [ __ ] heavy and that cough that I got right now that's a good cloth that's what I want I'm smoking some dank weed but as far as taste goes it's not fruity it's not florally it smokes like an earthy but robustness to it it's very pungent when it gets in your mouth it's saying hey man I'm [ __ ] here and i'm not air-eye thick ass smoke that's gonna bug up your brain today I'm definitely gonna smoke the entire thing I'm definitely gonna smoke the rest of the eight so for 52:19 in the legal market for twenty almost twenty nine percent THC you gotta go and check it out this is that dank dank stop this is the stuff that you show up to a friend's house with and be like yo I got some heavy ass weed and they're like yeah right you got some heavy ass weed that legal market don't produce no heavy ass weed and you're like well now they do because black market just came out with some dank ass heavy we flavor profiles coming out now getting a little further in get nose oils building up and making that whole flavor smokey nice but man it's just so heavy no I like my tongue is tired all right let's do this oh oh man black market cherry punch strongest weed out there twenty eight point eight nine percent THC made weight three point five graph also glass container I like that well I like that I could reuse this upon opening there is a floor Lee knows there was a purpley punch knows that's for the smoke it is heavy it is dank earthy finish it all the way through the ash is beautiful look at the ass there it is again white freakin ass that's what you want a smooth clean smoke of cherry punch something that's been in the black market for quite some time we all know about it we all smoked it but to be able to get this in the legal market nobody has anything else like it nobody else has anything as strong as it right now so definitely highly recommended for $52 you know that's what it is and that's a pretty fair price for some [ __ ] that you can't get anywhere in this legal market we're still gonna work on the price but it's 52 bucks this weed is getting into the eight point ones big fan of this weed I'm gonna smoke the rest of it I'm gonna put myself to sleep eight point one [ __ ] yeah black market did it again [Applause] [Music] I'm your neighbourhood Weed Man but you like that [ __ ] stroking up your neighborhood Weed Man right", "MmVJyM83LNA": "okay today I'm going to make a beer that I only brew for Thanksgiving because it's one of the only times you can get fresh cranberries at least where I am so this is a cranberry blonde um and I actually usually serve it on Thanksgiving which it's really nice because it's light and fruity and kind of counteracts all of the heavy foods you're eating so the malts in this guy is 5 pounds of Pilsner 5 pounds of tiro and 1 pound of white wheat so it's super simple and just really light body with a nice creamy head from the wheat and let's get started [Music] I set my mill at about the width of a credit card I use my subway card and it looks like it's about there from the last time I smelled but if you want to change it on this monster mill all you do is loosen these and then the rollers adjust with this Turner okay so I grind my stuff really fine because I'm doing the brew in a bag so it's almost on the verge of flour but very chunky flour so doing that I'll get a lot of I'll get a lot of yield um from this mall so I don't have to use typically as much as you would if you were doing um like a normal match like in a cooler or something because the screen holds back all the grain so I don't have to worry about loitering okay so I usually brew on the floor but you know camera angles are weird when you're on Florida's teeny kitchen so I have devices aim to be able to brew on my stove but with my electric system I'm just using my stove as a tabletop basically so what I'm going to do now is fill my kettle with seven gallons of water I'm not doing a sparge today because I'm a little sketched out about heating up water on my stove while I actually have like my electric kettle on the stove with its insulation and everything so I'm gonna do everything in the electric kettle today and we're gonna see how the conversion rate goes usually I get about 80 um when I do the sparge but uh we'll see I haven't I think I've done I've done some batches when I first got the system without a sparge and it was it was pretty similar but you know I was just being creative I guess so let's get this thing going so we mounted my control panel on to the wall and this is actually like the best thing ever I have not put my tubing on yet I should probably do that but I'm just gonna throw the water in no and so I'm gonna put seven gallons in which is what I usually do you all together usually do a 6 gallon mash and then on one counts large but we'll just do it all at once and I'm hoping my I have enough enzymes to get all the mash converted but we'll see [Music] okay so I'm just gonna turn on my heat and I'm gonna set it to I set it to let's see wait 156 my strike so 156 will be my strike water temperature and 152 is what I want my mash temperature to be at but since there's so much more water than usual I think it'll probably drop it down 152 if I can put in at 156 for water in this beer I went and got ARRA water from my local grocery store and the profile I'm gonna use in brew father is just a balanced profile so I'm going to add some salts but you know nothing to like push it one way or the other just kind of give it like rebuild what was lost in the RO process so I'm adding 3.6 grams of calcium chloride 2.2 grams of Epsom salt and two point three grams of gypsum I'm also in the mass going to add two milliliters of lactic acid because I have more water in my match than usual usually I can get away without using any lactic acid but I think that the dilution is going to end up making the pH higher then I would usually have it so I'm just gonna hedge my bets and throw in two milliliters of lactic acid especially because like I don't have a ton of gypsum going in here like if I were to have eight grams I would probably not bother but I'm a little worried about my pH I found that I get a lot better conversion when I do have a pH between 5.2 and 5.5 so I always try to hit it okay I'm gonna add my salt to my water we are at 134 degrees right now and I've got my pump on because it seems like when I pump the water it just kind of the thermometer reads it butter um so I've got my thermometers pretty on point right now and we're just gonna add this and the water coming from the top we'll just mix it together I'm gonna add my lactic acid now alright we are at our temperature for the mash so strike water temperature um so I'm going to go ahead and mash in and then take a quick pH reading [Music] all right so it's been about 20 minutes I'm just gonna pull this guy out and drop it into a bucket and then throw it into my compost bin because I already have a bunch of a dog biscuit domain set my nicest rack this lid so it can heat up a little faster but I'm gonna pull the lid almost completely off probably completely off actually once it starts boiling I've been I sent a bunch of beers off to competition and a lot of them had DMS come back as an off flavor so you can get rid of DMS by just leaving the top off when you boil and I didn't have a problem with it before but I don't know if something about what I'm doing now is giving me DMS so I'm just gonna take it off and see if that fixes the problem perhaps I am I'm using with touka if you've seen some of my other recipes you know that I'm a big fan of it it's supposed to be super fruity kind of like fruit punch II um and that's kind of how I like this beer to taste it's kind of like a cranberry fruit punch um and it's just really nice and easy to drink and it was well with Turkey so I'm gonna do one ounce of Masuka in the 60 minute and three ounces in Timnath in the ten minute I'm also going to add some yeast nutrient so I'm using a fresh pack of yeast so I want to make sure it's got everything it needs and a wolf black tablet to persist precipitate the Hays in the boil so I'm going to put the yeast nutrient in ten minutes and I use about half a teaspoon and then for the white block in there too just so I don't forget it so I cleaned out my screen um I'm going to boil with the screen in because I'm putting a ton of cranberries into the actual boil so I want something to catch them because I won't transfer great if there's a bunch of cranberries clogging up the screen that's in side connected to the valve so it doesn't boil great with the screen in it but it boils fine I guess I really wish I had one that was like half the size of this because the boil tends to come up through the sides but uh I haven't had a problem really with taste or anything so I think it's just a personal preference okay so here's where the cranberry part comes in so I have three pounds of fresh cranberries I tried this with frozen cranberries and it didn't turn out the way I liked it so you're free to try it but I haven't a good experience with it so I only make this once a year so we're gonna do three pounds of the cranberries and then I use half an ounce of lemon zest these are called pink lemonade lemons um and I only use them because they grow in my front courtyard you can use any lemon these are just fun because they're pink inside so I'm going to I'm gonna speed process these just real quick just to break them up they're gonna go in the last five minutes of the boil so we don't need to sanitize them because the boil is going to kill everything on [Music] so one thing to know about using fruit in the boil is a lot of times depending on the fruit they have know exactly what it is but it's called pectin and it'll haze up your beer it'll look like a smoothie when you're done so you can I use this you can use this inside its just hectic enzyme solution um and it'll basically break down the lip pectin and it'll give you a clear beer this sphere turns out clear when I make it and if I want to use this it looks like I threw like milk in it I'm really tempted to just throw this lemon into the food processor with the cranberries but I'm always nervous that the flavor isn't going to come through but this is gonna take me forever [Music] okay so about three tablespoons is five or point five ounces well look how beautiful it's like we're making Thanksgiving dinner okay so we are boiling now so I'm gonna do my first addition Hawks this is one else of Machuca and I'm just gonna throw right in because about the screen going on there all right so setting a timer for 50 minutes because our next additions at 10:00 we're going to do three ounces of Machuca and then like the we're flock talent in the yeast nutrient and then at five we're gonna do all the fruit okay so we're at our 10 minute mark so I'm just gonna throw in our three ounces of Machuca or flock doublet and yeast nutrient and in five minutes we'll add the cranberries okay so now I am going to throw in my cranberries [Music] so now that I have my cranberries in the boil I'm going to hook the two bits running into the lid into my work in and then a word out I'm going to hook up this tube and just drape it in directly [Music] okay so our boils done I'm gonna turn off the heat and turn on the pump and as well as the water that's gonna run through the chiller gotta make sure all your valves are open don't run your pump dry that's a bad idea okay so it's down to 105 and I'm liking the color that's coming through the tubes so I'm gonna pull the cranberries now sanitize these in my hands before I get in there um should be okay still but so there's a lot of cranberries and liquid in here still it's probably about that life um so I've just got to let it sit and drain this is the problem using her screen I should have used like a less fine mesh or something because it was like extremely difficult to get out and I have fallen back up so I won't be doing this again if I'm working on the stove typically I can get it out if I'm working on the floor but I've got to come up with a better solution for that okay so we're at 74 degrees now so I'm going to transfer it into and as test your bucket it's called a 14.2 first thing I'm gonna do is take a blitz sanitize it and you know dump out the sanitizer whatever so I've already sanitized this but it's always good to give it another go right as you're about to transfer I'm gonna drop my plug just throw the tube in the button it we're gonna bump back on [Music] so I'll check this in a couple hours and see if it's down to temperature and then once it is I will pitch just one packet of Dusseldorf all east it does really well just with one package [Music]", "g9zPW-OWRTY": "hey what's up everybody we are getting ready to harvest all of our plants really really excited to pull all these down I did let them go quite a bit longer than I normally would have let plants go and that is because we pollinated some of them and they got pollinated a little bit later than I probably should have pollinated them which means I had to let them go a little bit longer actually an extra like 15 maybe 20 days ich habe outfit an extra 15 days I'd say then I wanted them to go so like two extra weeks but that's so the seeds could ripen up so I just want to show you what we got going on in here talk a little bit about what we're gonna do and then I'll do a kind of a recap video once we get to the actual dry trimming but let's go ahead and dive in to these plants so you can see they're kind of falling over they got kind of big this is the lemon Royale from swamp boys we got these from seeds here now calm I think I still have some on there this is a GMO TK skunk crossed with lemon tree so this particular plant is stinky didn't get huge but I mean it got huge but the nubs didn't get super huge they're kind of smaller like little I don't know this little grenade but it's almost these things stink this is I don't know it smells it smells almost like garlic mushrooms and onions sort of it's very very strange so this one got pretty big basically when we go to dry turn these are what we're going to do before we turn these we're just going to come in here and I'm just going to be popping off all these leaves so that's what I'm going to be doing tonight you can see that you know everything leaves on it so I will be putting them all or taking all these families off cleaning those up later so it's gonna take a while for this plant here then over here we have the life star from bog now this life star this is a Scentsy star crossed with bogs lifesaver and this particular plant did get pretty chunky you can see we got some pretty chunky buds in here it's been flushing a little bit long so some of the leaves are starting to die off but not the buds so we're good to go here nice and frosty this one smells it smells like a sensi star with a little of candy so really digging that one pretty excited for for that smoke that's a nice sativa even though this actual plant looks kind of indica right another one we got over here this is another bog right star same kind of thing a little bit more you know compact even see this particular plant was actually you can actually see on the leaves we got a little bit of thrips on this one and this particular plant actually took most of the thrips for all these other plants which was really crazy and thrips just do a little bit of leaf damage nothing terrible but when we got him it was just a little bit close to harvest I wasn't able to spray him all right I could have sprayed him but I didn't want to spray anything because we're gonna be smoking all this and who cares I'm gonna be trimming off all the trips anyway so it's not a big deal this one's nice and frosty is you can kind of see in here smells like this particular one does smell like an earthy candy in this particular room by the way I kind of wanted to mention cuz everybody's asking we're using the California light works solar system 1100 and you got two electric sky es 300 you can check those out at school of hard knocks comm /ik electric sky and then also we got the smart V controller right here this is our atmospheric controller controlling everything in the room we got a full video on how that works but you can actually use our coupon code s Soh and ten to support a discount at smart B controllers comm so I just wanted to point that out shout out smart be for shooting this thing over this thing has been awesome for this grow as well as these lights have been great too alright cool so this right here this plant is nuts this is a black cherry cheesecake this is one of the three fee knows we had this is the smallest one it definitely turned very purple and I mean you just see this the leaves are almost black on this thing and the nugs are just absolutely stunning everything looks great on this plant there's some green underneath it's just a crazy crazy-looking plant this is one of the plants that we actually had a male up so we made some crosses with this and I'll talk about those in a second but this plant smells like almost like a high C or a Hawaiian Punch it is crazy so this one you can see not the biggest this was not the winning Phaedo but female for us but just these buds under here I mean you can see they're straight up pink which is very cool pinkish purple it's these plants were just insane so this wasn't the one that I'm gonna be keeping I'm torn between the two that we'll see in a minute here but as you can see this plant didn't leave any staking and it held itself up just fine until I just knocked it over but this is one of really looking forward to the harvesting and smoking this is another lemon Royale pretty much the same as the other lemon Royale this one was just a little bit bigger and got some hues of purple in it this one doesn't have quite the funky smell it's got a little more lemony fruitiness to it but you can see just looking amazing here all these lobes sorry about that all these leaves are definitely gonna be coming out tonight when I'm when I'm getting all this trimmed up right so we got that we push that off to the side over here what we have right here this is probably the biggest plant in our garden and these are all these are all a little bit dry so they do look a little bit droopy no problem because I'm gonna be chopping them all today so whatever ice didn't water and oh they all that would dry out a little bit this is the cheddar sparkles from the mad farmers they personally gave me these beans after we didn't interview with them you can definitely check that interview out but these are just huge these things are massive I mean here's my fist it's it's almost as wide as my fist here these things are extremely dense and these buds are nice and purple everything here smells like a sour sour candy it's got like a little bit of candy coming through because this is a lavender crossed with Clementine and yeah you can smell a little bit of lavender it's got a lighter smell to it this is must be a very medicinal plant really really looking for or to this this plant was just beast as you can see so let's go ahead and get that thing out of the way but yeah I mean these are just massive this is another lifestyle you've got right here some got a life star right here this one did sorry this one did get pretty big as well very similar to the other ones as far as the actually this one smells probably the best out of all the life stars definitely got a little bit of thrips on this one the life stars seem to have attracted the Fripp's which is strange right all of them kind of did it's just something genetic about it which honestly kind of saved the other plants which is nice very excited about this one in particular just chunky chunky nugs as well so let's give these black cherry cheesecakes now these things are the these are like the star things in my garden right now super super stoked on these and basically what you see I've been flushing this one for quite a while amazing amazing colors and I always kind of get some of these dead leaves off because like I said have been flushing them so you can really see these this one has actually been pollinated with our watermelon skittles males so we took this particular plant I will let you know where to get those seeds shortly as well as be announcing the the seed naming or the straight naming competition but you can see right here this this is the one that was very very purple um this thing smells nuts it smells like and you actually see some of these seeds in here like right in here you can see some seeds popping out of here these buds are just filled with seeds they're gonna have a lot of these seeds water mouth skittles crossed with this black cherry cheesecake is gonna be phenomenal we've got an awesome name for it will be the long outs and that pretty soon here but I mean this is just a beautiful plant and it smells just like like Hawaiian Punch so this was you can see the difference in the plants like the other one over there there's shown a little earlier is more purple this one's a lot taller and this has just like crazy yellow orange pink craziness um I mean like this particular branch right here you need to see the different colors on it I mean all the leaves the leaves just look amazing on this it's like like fall it's crazy I have never grown a plant like this so I'm very very excited for this to come down and to see exactly how this smokes but this thing like I said we cross this with watermelon skittles or we hit we hit this plant with our watermelon skittles mail and I'm very excited to grow those seeds out as well here's another one and you can see this one didn't eat any staking at all like literally holds itself up super strong plant solid rock solid buds all the way down frosty frosty frosty here was the other one of the black cherry cheesecakes right here inside of there we go so black cherry cheesecake here this woman had thick thick nuts you can see kind of the difference between them this actually didn't get enough light down here so whatever ignore that but I was kind of dwarfed but you can see these are nice and thick a little bit more leafy but if we remove some of these leaps in here some of these families you can really start to see how frosty this one is and I mean look look at that in there it's nuts looking amazing this particular phenotype or expression smells phenomenal honestly I'm blown away that the smell I like the color of this one a little bit more but this one has a little bit more pungent fruity smell so we also hit this one with our black air start with our round watermelon skittles male and you can see it this soon some chunky notes honestly I think the other one is gonna be a little bit bigger of a yield err so uh you know I'll be running both those seeds and the water dog skills mail that we hit him with which is a very frosty watermelon skills mail and we also hit them with a couple other things as well but the wireless feels the one most excited about the long enough skill with black cherry cheesecake crosses but you see these things are just looking amazing super purple just down to the core purple buds I don't think there's any green on these buds at all when I break them apart I mean we even look in here that it's like straight-up pink on the inside which is crazy and it smells amazing so we got that then we have one of my personal favorites and this one went a little too long to beat these seeds were taking a little longer to develop which is no big deal there but this particular one it's just like June they're dropping trichomes right now this particular plant is our Las Vegas lemon skunk and the hoops thank you oh jeez sorry this is our Las Vegas lemon skunk and that usually this finishes in about 40 days we almost let it go double what it normally goes cuz we're letting those seeds grow in here this thing is insanely frosty and and like just gleaming it's like it smells just like lemon candy so we actually hit the Las Vegas lemon skunk with our black cherry cheesecake mail and with our watermelon skills mail so we're gonna have some of those seats coming through as well and then we have our watermelon skittles right here there's two different we know this these are both massive I mean this put out just some giant nubs this smells very funky I don't even know how to describe it they say water Don Terps I don't necessarily get watermelon I get some some muted melons almost like some rotting cantaloupe almost it's very sweet extremely frosty and I just got some hair on it but whatever but we're gonna basically we hit our this watermelon skittles with the black cherry cheesecake mail that we had and you can start to see this is kind of turning a little bit purple as well down in here getting a little bit purples but steak very very green and same thing when there's watermelon steals over here this one's turned in a little bit more purple they smell very very similar and honestly the only difference is this particular one here on my left now am i right it's quite a bit bigger or not even quite a bit bigger they just put out a little bit bigger knobs on the top little you know like like this full size as opposed to half this full size I don't know they all turned out amazing though so yeah that's about it for this so all I'm gonna do tonight is I'm gonna come in here I'm just going to be pulling all these families off it's gonna take me a little while but no big deal to be chopping all these families off then we're gonna have all these plants hang them upside down to dry and I'm going to be harvesting the seeds and we selectively pollinated them so I'll be harvesting the seeds and also harvesting the buds as well so keep poster keno stay tuned whatever you want to say there stay tuned I'll let me know where you can get these seeds we've got a lot of people asking about them so I'll definitely let you know where we can get those and besides that actually here's one thing I want to show you all check this out this is crazy this is one of the kind of a random thing I just saw right in here and this has a seed in it we actually were able to pollinate a chunk or a little calyx on a leaf and get a seed format so that's crazy this is that a lemon or I out here so we all see if the lemon stuff with a little bit of lemon or oil to kind of do some crossing with that but yeah that's about it for this I'm gonna go ahead and start trimming it'll probably be here for hours and hours and hours because it always takes forever and yeah that's it for this one we do have more seed to harvest series coming out very soon we're going to be moving all the seedlings back into this room and be sure to stay tuned for that so that's it for me thanks for watching and thanks for everybody who participated in the name match strain game or whatever we're gonna call it I'll make a video on what the winner was and the winner will be getting the free seed packs and will be announcing where the seeds are gonna be for sale all that good stuff very shortly here as well so thanks for watching bye for now", "Jar5eX3_pQA": "what's up desert buds it's Rob here and today we're smoking up some flour and we're gonna be reviewing it also jamming us some Red Hot Chili Peppers um so today we're smoking on cherry punch this stuff is I'm pretty sure indica hybrid and I really like this drink this is from move and the dispensary move their weed is all done by a company called altmed and we actually have we actually had a really cool experience at the dispensary because we're gonna collaborate with a real budtender on our channel um I didn't get his name he gave me his YouTube channel his SoundCloud and his phone number so prophecy lane you know just a little flash you can't have his phone number but there's other info in there so it's real prophecy lane go subscribe on YouTube he's a real budtender he talked me into the strains that we got today and we're gonna be reviewing one hurt video so we've got four videos coming we have three flower videos and a concentrate video and that one is gonna be really exciting so let's get some of this out guys you love move so I referred my friend name and it was his first time and he got buy one get one up to a quarter so he got a half ounce and we what happens on it so I got a quarter for free or I got a quarter for $25 and then a free eight so that's pretty cool um I'm gonna show you guys a packaging here just because it's got like the ingredients I added oh there it is a strange hairy punch and there's the ingredients that were in the soil so the guy who was making the labels was probably stoned cuz look it's all cut off like right there barely reading okay nice this is what the flower is looking like and it's really stinky like right off the bat and I'd smoked a little bit already so there should be more nugs there but yeah this stuff is pretty alright look in let's tell you guys how it tastes how it smokes you know how I feel from it Sherlock pipe here this is actually from Ernie November shout out to Rapid City smoke shop this thing was like thirty bucks if you're one of my best friends you've probably smoked out of this before yeah I've had it for a while but um let's get some cherry punch in the grinder here hope you guys liked the video so far you know keep liking and subscribe and share with your friends and like I said we're gonna get a real budtender on the channel here um just go check out move anyways you might meet him he's got the best sales skills that I've ever seen before you know my dad's pretty good car salesman but I think this guy's a good salesman um yeah he ups old me like the most platinum stuff they had and it was okay so that brand drip that we reviewed before that was $40 a gram and the quality of the concentrate that I got this time was equal I'm serious equal if not better and it was $24 a gram because Sundays they have 25% alcohol concentrates so that was a good deal I think I'm gonna be getting some more wax from there for sure but let's get this out the grinder let's see how ki fee these nugs are so my Keith grind all right Keith catcher is empty and I had a coin in there and we're tossing the coin around a little bit and yeah there's nothing in there so this bud isn't to Kiki I mean I it looks really ki fee but I'm sure I could have broken up a little bit okay we gotta change this mom there we go some Creedence Clearwater Revival [Music] shout-out to you guys you know I thought this was kind of a silly thing to do smoke weed on YouTube tell you guys about it but I actually got more subscribers and actually thought I would like out there we'll keep it coming keep it coming [Music] it's a good taste right off the bat my face just got warm just like all rush just went down my legs and it just feel really good right now this is a this is a good strain oh man I only took one hit off that and I have like the chills like my whole body just feels good we're gonna be like oh man I barely open so there's no percentage on here have you ever smoked this spring bum there's no percentage on here put the bud tender that I meant told me that all the weeds there is top shelf when they get it everything they don't get bottom shelf wheat they don't buy that um so when they buy a batch of Bud it sits at the very top shelf and then as a week goes by it'll go down a shelf you know as a little bit gets old and then as more gets old it goes down and then every time they buy a new bud they move everything down in tears so they have their top shelves there's like the fresh best buds you know whatever in a week those get cycled down and then they have more fresh buds so if you go by the bottom to your bud there it was top shelf to eat so saves you a dollar like you can get a $90 ounce of red velvet cake and this weed smells like red velvet cake not gonna lie but stay tuned guys um we're gonna have a few more videos today so yeah stay tuned", "1Hg8nJz6dVA": "[Music] oh what's up everyone welcome to another cannabis critique today we are talking about dr punch uh this one grown by a revolution we had a little bit of a run of revolution at my dispensary but this will be the end of my uh trifecta of revolution reviews uh this one is a cross of doc's og and purple punch and it came in at 28 thc and i wanted to get into this i get a lot of comments on thc percentage uh the percentage is going to change bats to batch guys so my badge could be more than your batch it could be less than your batch i'm just telling you the percentage of the batch that i received so just keep that in mind i always get comments like my batch was more than this my max was less than this well yeah every batch is a little bit different but for the most part they're gonna be at about the same thc percentage uh per strain but let's get into the breakdown on the doctor punch uh the look on this one was pretty impressive as most revolution flower is it had a great cure job uh it was a good density light green in color good denseness nice softness to the nugs a good good amount of trichome coverage this one really sparkled when you got it out in the sunlight i wasn't very impressive when you just look at it with the naked eye but like if you got it in a sunbeam or something it was really really sparkly had a lot of trichome coverage i gave it a look at 9.5 out of 10. it was very good the smell on this one was kind of disappointing i thought i'd get like some grape vibes from it because purple punch is one of the parents but i got like hardly any smell off of this one at all it was like a little bit earthy and citrusy but a very faint smell unfortunately which is kind of the norm for illinois flower i gave it an 8 out of 10 on the smell the break up here was good not too much to tell you there uh the nugs were nice and soft so they were you were able to break them up by hand and it broke up nicely in your grinder as well yielded a good amount of keef i gave the breakup a nine out of ten [Music] the taste on this one i say is mostly lemony i got a really really lemony occasional uh toke from this one uh and then on the the exhale was a lot of sweetness but every once in a while like i'd hit this stuff and i'd just be like overwhelmed with lemony flavor so that's mostly what i got from it lemon citrus type of vibe and then like a sweetness on the back end again there's not too much of that purple punch grapey type of earthy type of flavor going on with this one which is kind of disappointing but i gave the taste a 9 out of 10. i think the lemon really really came through for me the high here was very much on the indica side of things this one is labeled a hybrid but i'd say it's basically just a pure indica it's very relaxing uh makes you very kind of lazy type of buzz it was a very heavy head high kind of made me feel like like i got punched or something maybe that's why it's called dr punch but like it really kind of wipes you out uh towards the end of the day you really feel this one so i would not recommend uh medicating with this one uh during the day it's definitely an end of the day type of strength and i i love indicas but i don't know this one wasn't my favorite high so i gave the high an 8.5 out of 10. overall i'd say this is a it's a good indica leaning hybrid ideal for the end of the day might help you with pain relief or of course going to bed i gave it an 8.8 out of 10 overall and if you enjoyed this cannabis critique be sure to like comment and subscribe for more", "JYNpNef6lAc": "hi this video is from

reviewing from Walmart as you can see the great value stamp on it energy caffeine and B vitamins that's pretty much all it is I'm using it right now as a pre-workout too cheap to buy a real pre-workout so this isn't really in my opinion a supplement it's really like a micro supplement or like a remedy that you can use meanwhile until you get a real supplement but it gets the job done y'all it's not bad I thought of that I thought it wasn't going to be good at all I just bought a color that goes just three bucks give or take I forgot three something 320 or some [ __ ] but uh nutritional facts serving is it has 24 servings serving sizes about half a teaspoon calories zero total fat zero sodium 10 milligrams carbs zero sugar zero protein zero vitamin b3 10 percent b6 ten percent b12 to 10 percent and the ingredients are water citric acid profiling glycol caffeine sodium citrate potassium citrate sir Lowe's and some other word I'm not even gonna try to pronounce natural flavors turn red 40 another [ __ ] word can't pronounce but I'm a triad Naya synonymy made it whatever potassium sorbate of guarana extract vitamin b6 ginseng extract and vitamin b12 so it's very simple but pretty effective for three dollars better than not having a pre-workout at all but it only has 50 milligrams of caffeine per serving so at half the tablespoons so I take about two I mean half a teaspoon so I take about two tablespoons or two this [ __ ] and that's how I do it you know you don't have to do it like that doesn't that would be at least like 200 milligrams of caffeine that's at least what I take sometimes if I take at least 300 milligrams of caffeine you know or caffeine junkie Menem [ __ ] on pretty advanced when it comes to this I've been taking pre workouts for a long time having been off of one which I probably need to be but I'm cutting right now so I'm not going to be off for one um yeah it's not bad I think the value is pretty good I think it's it's decent you can use it as a pre-workout or maybe of something to sip on during your workout if you like sipping on something with a little flavor works pretty well got a good a good workout you know I felt energy and um that's it I figured I'd share that information with y'all because I felt it was useful so giving something back to the community that's been so good to me so alright that's it for this uh video almost forgot one more thing it squirts out this is how you put it in your bottle you know just squeeze and just you know goes in your bottle like that you can squirt it in your mouth if you want to concentrate it like just get the results I guess quicker because it hit you faster but it is pretty damn tart it wastes you look like a [ __ ] you square your mop and you do that move [ __

as we turn corn syrup and high and potassium sodium tartrate into not wine but weed welcome to wheats guys uh we are here with jesus and all my other homies today to talk moana that's right we're back with wanna uh surely i'm not gonna take the time to link below uh the video where i screwed up reviewing them before so we are here to review them in earnest today they're watermelon hybrid gummies uh this is a vegan gummy from wanna coming in at 20 bucks from my dispensary so this puts this at the uh highest end of the gummy um edibles at my dispensary so a bit of a premium for the wanna gummies um but nothing else too fancy here pretty basic packaging from wanna with their hybrid watermelon gummies we're gonna do it nice and short and quick here so that we don't upset the j-man we're going to pinch here as it says open it up and there are our wanna weed watermelon gummies manufactured by high life farms we've got our wonderful lab testing results and all of our stuff my cameraman is currently being uh pulled away by the dogs at this moment but that's okay here we go here is our watermelon gummy looking really nice and square how wonderful watermelon sugar weed aftertaste not bad pretty good well i am now my own cameraman again um and these wanna weed gummies well if you've had a weed gummy before you know what to expect um a lot of sugar to mask the taste and a pretty hefty cannabis aftertaste but i have certainly had worse uh and haven't had too many that are quite a bit better in terms of taste but it's not about how it tastes about how it makes you feel and for that guys i'm gonna come back to you in about two hours after i finish another whole hell a lot of a hell of a lot of these gummies and once i do i'll come back and i will let you know if these wanna weed gummies are as good as we all wanted them to be ugh anyways say hi stay healthy we'll see you back here in just a bit goodbye welcome back to wheat skies i'm back from paradise on earth or what was it called jesus's cameraman do you remember desert christ park welcome back to wheats guys i'm back from desert christ park or something like that the place with all the jesuses uh where we first tried the wanna cannabis infused watermelon hybrid gummies and these are pretty good gummies uh i'm not a hundred percent sure they're worth the 20 premium uh they are uh sort of better quality than the cheapest gummies for sure uh but whether they're the uh sort of eight dollar premium i'm not a hundred percent but they are definitely good quality and if you are concerned about um healthiness in your gummies excuse me guys there's a dog who's really just insistent go get them get out of my face um so if you're really concerned about your uh health and all that these are vegan uh and they are all natural flavors and colors nothing artificial here so uh they also claim to be artisan quality whatever that means anyways uh good quality stuff still pretty high from these uh it's been about three hours since i had my last one and still i am quite high so that is a pretty good endorsement right there and then anytime we have a product we like this much i'll take that camera person she's driving us all crazy go get just get out of our face just just just kid it's it's going to make it worse anytime we have a product we like this much i like to give a little cherry on top a little something extra that's not weed related so i'm out here in the middle of nowhere in the middle of uh god's country and anytime i'm out in the desert i think you know area 51 ufos sci-fi and we've been doing board games recently so i'm going to give you one of my favorite board games of all time one very cosmic and theme and that's cosmic encounters plays like five six seven eight players uh it is too hard too difficult to explain right here but i can tell you it's going to be one of the best times if you have friends who are into board games if you've never heard of cosmic encounters and you have a group that is willing to um do something different give cosmic encounters a try don't even remember who designed it right now that's because of wanna gummies and these wanna i was gonna make another one a pun but i'm too high so just you know uh know that that is an endorsement and that's going to be endorsement as well for cosmic encounters on your local board game store or online in some way i guess we're still in the middle of a pandemic board games are a weird thing to endorse but um they're an optimistic one and i'm rambling thanks guys it's been a it's been a blast here i'm sorry about the dog i'm sorry about all the jesus stuff you know uh we're just uh we're out here on vacation having a good time here on weeds stay high stay healthy we'll see you soon", "3BWIFVoWhzU": "[Music] hey everyone it's clint from canadian cannabis culture back with another review uh super excited about this one today you're looking at one by flower corp so i've actually only tried their pink kush which is something they really really focused on uh the initial beginning of their company but they do a really good job on it it's probably my favorite pink kush on the lp market so i'm so super stoked to try uh another offering by them so this one is called uh bc black cherry it's sitting at uh 24.7 thc uh new glass jars by the way well done by flower and they got rid of the box as well so all around really really nice packaging vc black cherry is an indica dominant hybrid bred by crossing uh black cherry pie and purple punch buttons are said to be dark green and purple with bright orange pistols or hairs the aroma is supposed to be pungent and reminiscent of freshly baked goods so that's pretty exciting i've heard a couple of strains recently that kind of uh say that's what the aroma is supposed to smell like and the only one that's really come through has been the apple toffee by simply bear so i kind of hope this one holds up to uh those standards as well the flavor profile is said to be uh sweet woody woody base uh apple berries and ground pepper so we'll see uh dominant terpenes are farnacin uh limonene and karyophiline flower hand trims and hang dries to plants uh they have a cultivation campus which is located in kelowna bc uh in the okanagan valley they use indoor purpose-built facilities and they also have a greenhouse on their campus flower has a subsidiary named halogen which cultivates in australia and portugal i believe flowers headquarters are in ontario their head offices and whatnot if you're looking to uh invest in flour they're under the name flower corp uh which i'll have on the screen okay so let's get a look at it here like i said really nice jars uh this one was packaged january 8th so super fresh that came off super easy i love the glass jars for that the close pops off so nice yeah right away uh super super pungent definitely has like the berry smell yeah we'll definitely get you guys a really good look at that uh there's no two-way humidity pack um so not too concerned about it because it's so fresh but maybe in the future a flower should look into uh maybe getting some volvetas in there okay guys now that we've learned a little bit more about flower and their bc black cherry last thing you got to do is test it out for the rating so i'll go do that and i'll be right back [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right everyone after testing out the bc black cherry by flower uh super impressed by this one very flavorful for sure uh definitely pick it up again not a lot to knock on this one either uh the burn on it was uh really really good uh the ash on it was was was really good uh well uh the taste on it was was really flavorful it was kind of like kind of like a light berry flavor maybe a little peppery as well very nice though very similar to other like kind of cherry bursts and cherry bomb strains but this one was probably my favorite as far as like kind of cherry strains that i've tried the effects on it were nice and strong i found them to be a little bit of a creeper uh 10 10 10 minutes or so after uh kind of indulging kind of really really hits you in a good way uh sitting at uh 24 it was really really smooth so overall really really well done flower um highly recommended uh but i'm gonna rate this one at 9.2 out of 10. until next time guys", "95YWZKRXxQQ": "hi guys so this is a VNA here decided I'm gonna say my name more often because lovefool are curious and had to say it and I don't really get on camera that often - I guess I wouldn't say my name of files on camera either I don't know but it's VNA so um today's bust the hell is going to be the imagine this I top and you guys probably have it if you've been a crafter for a long time I think it came out like in 10 years ago 12 years ago I don't know it's a 2010 ish around there maybe a little earlier than that but um so this thing I I couldn't find it anywhere I mean if you can find out eBay you know that's probably your best bet but I might have some links to other items that I'm gonna use so we're gonna try and make a card or something so if there are links that there will be affiliate links I might use my Artie's egg wash which I really got for martiza for review basically so I'm not reviewing it here so I'm not gonna have an opinion but I am gonna use that and just full disclosure I could receive that for free for a review and so that's that but uh yeah so I knew exactly what this was and the reason I even thought about using this thing is because when we are memory keepers came out with that button maker and they wanted like $100 for it I was like eh you know I was thinking about getting it but I hurry had this I topped I had never really used anyway on top of that the I top was like you know 20 30 bucks whatever it was it was inexpensive because it's a little tool I'll show to you in just a minute but then yesterday HSN's thing today's special was the coop which is kind of an odd name but for 300 bucks and I didn't pick it up cuz it wasn't something I was interested in anyway and I really have something like that the design runner that xyron had put out so I was looking everywhere desperately for that I thought okay I'm gonna try it out today to show some of the things you might run into that co-op ones I'm not gonna buy it and sometimes I do pick up things just because I want to try it and maybe give some tips but that one I knew for sure is gonna be the same issues I thought well made for 300 bucks they worked out some of the kinks we remember kippers did from the xyron one and no it looks like it still has the same issue so what I'm gonna say just real quick in case you ordered it and I don't want you to be frustrated cuz if you really go back and look at the demos you'll see that sometimes it wasn't quite right or it's crooked because you have to roll it at a certain speed for it to come out nicely if you go too fast it's gonna be real spread out and long if you go too short like slowly the letters or whatever you're trying to print out the little figures whatever it is that you're trying to you know print out well like stack on top of each other so it'll be jumbled so you have to roll it as a certain speed and maybe you noticed during the demo some of the colors were like if it was blue some red started and then it went to blue and then it kind of did some funny things with the color mixing I don't think that was an issue so much with the designer I guess it depends on what you were using but I think I don't know black I don't remember anymore because it was so long ago I know I have it I have a feeling I put it in deep storage because it wasn't these tubs that I have here but we haven't come across it right as we're going through things and you know you're doing that with me and I'm like where could I put it and I also I don't know I'll find it at some point but by that time probably won't even matter anymore the other thing is as you're working with it you want to keep it straight if you want whatever you want to be put out to be straight so to fix that design run or later came out with this like like a big ruler and it had like a channel in the middle so you would run your little design runner through that channel and then you would know it's straight but you stopped to put your ruler right now that and so apparently they're not having that yet they do have that ribbon pool thing but that's isn't that's a little different so if you want it somewhere on a certain card or a certain thing you really have to pay attention to all those things so I don't want you two guys to be frustrated I have a feeling I remember how I felt about it and why I stopped using mine and for being an investment like that definitely just know those are the things that you want to keep in mind as you're using it if there's something else I'll think about excel was thinking about the different things that and I even saw them doing it and it's so funny because Suzanne had done a thing and and yeah it was like a half print like only half of it printed in then and when let's just start it over again and she I told my husband I said see it cuz he was sitting with me like that's exactly what the thing would do you know and then he's like what and I had to rewind it cuz I'm like you know what you see this saree wound it and then he saw there whatever and I said it's funny because Suzanne even said the word I'm not gonna say here cuz whatever I might have kids watching but CRE w Edie she's oh I you know that okay well I guess unlike TV not that that's the worst word I say worse words in her life but what I'm saying is I'll say it on my videos over TV but I thought it was kind of funny so let's move on if you have any questions about if you ordered it and you have some questions that you might think I can't answer please let me know because it's basically the same as a design runner so this is the imagine Asst I top and I have it in this little bag and I remember I got this bag free and an expo and it's a three birds bag you can see and then I was like I just brought it out so I knew exactly where this was I have it in a box down here and I was like what was this it says clear stamp cleaner so I guess I was probably trying to use this as like a carry-all but stop and then you have all these little Brad's that it makes this one says twist daddy's oh yeah oh that's right so these grow onto barrettes or like things like that they had different things you can screw it into so it's kind of paint I don't really care see the little barrettes and the screws in there and I don't even know if I have the breasts to screw that into but we will see I'm not sure what this is oh you know I do know what this is plenty of these other ones just down in here oh these little cassettes ice 2/12 who knows in college we would record client sessions or just class so I had a little mini recorder and these were go in there and you know what sometimes I have a bagel recorded on here so that's kind of I hold on to that would be really cute if it Oh Tim Holtz distress tool alright on but that here I do not have any idea what this is um I think it has to do with this machine it might have to do with this I honestly don't know oh it's for this how the heck is that what this thing does can you switch it out I have no idea it looks like it's the another cutter but for this thing and this thing cuts a little circles that you can put in two buttons this play why I have it all together here anyway there's other pieces here that will bring out I have all these guys I do have some of the hole punches so that all you do is punch the paper instead of making using the template to cut it out though maybe we'll use that oh and I was just wondering I'm like why are the templates there right he all right so this has all the different size templates that you would need if you're gonna do it by hand which I'm not but that's what those are for all you do is just trace on your paper and then cut it out by hand right but I do not have the puncher I think for the medium-sized one so maybe somebody that's a good thing that I have this stencil still more punches so see this is a small look how tiny this is well there's a magnet daddy it says so it has magnets for somebody's I have that so it was kind of a tease - but like organizing going through my stuff a large Brad this is the one I really like and then I have the top for that because it cut these out or to make it work you need the top so basically let me go back if you have this already that's great if you have the we r memory keepers one it's very similar so for that one just punches now like this and that one's interesting because if you go to HSN and sold out and it has bad reviews already and you guys re no - what we r memory keepers I feel like you know I love buying all their gimmicky things that when I passed up like I said I had this I never used it so I was like well you know I'm not gonna use it but I have heard from you guys that you love it and the reviews on HSN are like this thing doesn't work or you just really bad so it's just something that you like and you picked up from them ki I think of you nice to go and leave a review a nice one because you know maybe feel are doing it wrong I don't know I do have some of the Brits there you know yay all right well only a few so I guess that's all I'm gonna do forever what else is in here a card pack oh look at that I used to keep it nice and simple oh my gosh I'm a crazy person this is nice I like that I don't remember doing this at all I probably did a video on my old channel for this thing but look at this I have another large head here I probably picked this up like at Hobby Lobby or Hobby Lobby Michaels armor one time they had clearance it all out or maybe Tuesday morning but I already have a head here so that's good and I have plenty of seeing how much I thought I was gonna get into it for some reason there's ribbon in here Oh embossed powder okay so as I was going through this oh this is the part of the kid it came with because they see the way it's packaged and I was thinking about I have other things that do the similar cutting oh my gosh and I just found part of it so these guys go with this this chatterbox thing and I don't understand how I switch it out to this that's just I guess I have to figure that out I'm sure there's a way to get there has to be unless there's no way you're gonna punch it with your own head I have no idea why I have this maybe the other one broke and then I kept I have no idea it seems like it's interchangeable is what it looks like I have some squinty Brad's they store my hair with like the ho okay um let's just finish going through this stuff since it's here oh how pretty is this look at these they're like little toppers okay and then whatever this is okay that's one more of those Oh more of those okay 300 these are I think Anna Griffin stamps super old maybe pay one they're just these stamp sets for some reason I have separate here all these borders and another set oh my gosh cool those are my stamps and I think that's actually there's a bucket here that's a zipper pocket that's just full of the things that go along with this so these guys go with this you punch out you put your little paper and then you put that little yellow now epoxy on top so when I was going through this water reminded me of is the epiphany crafts things that I've shown you guys that I have tucked away over here so maybe maybe if this video doesn't go too long I'll pop open I'll use that some way too just to remind you and show you and I don't know if these are even sticky anymore I guess oh they're still sticky but they're yellow so I don't know okay that's back let me grab some paper and some fabric will do a couple different things so here's the large Brad one look how big this thing is and then the but the paper isn't even soon sorry that big I don't know why this machinery so large but again I have this one I have this one so I don't have the medium sized brad is what it is that's missing all right I will be right back I'm so sorry for the ambient noise I tell you these people it's 650 something because I came to sit now is like 6:45 and they're out there doing the one writing for my kids window alright so I think what we'll do is we'll start with this small guy that's gonna be more of a pain because little and then I'm gonna do a fabric one on the medium once remember I said on the medium punch that way that makes that easy and then I will use a large one too so for the little guy I mean he is tiny so I found this pattern with paper and this is regular it's very thin this other thing you gotta experiment and it's kind of a pain but I'm gonna try to cut it right here and see if I can get some of these little I try to get smaller flowers in there and so one thing we can do and I haven't done this in a very long time but I do remember this is let's say your little water on here you just get a little just a little just a little bit there's a little bit of water on there okay not too much just trying to make it a little so it's a little more pliable and so these guys they switch around so this is what you need for the little guy this small you know rubber piece and in the small area and for the medium guy you would just pick this up and turn it before now you can also pick it up and turn it to get it ready so what you need is your little cap right and I'm going to sit it on here and then you can set this on here too now if you're gonna do that it's not easy to turn it back so I normally just put that there switch it back okay try to keep that in the center and then you're gonna put your little piece of paper in here and I'm just gonna eyeball this - I'm gonna give it a little squeeze just so I can kind of see where I'm at that's not bad okay and continue squeezing hope I don't rip the paper and the hell want to be very delicate with this one because this paper again is very thin so it pushed it in there and you guys can tell me if the the we r memory keepers one works similarly I haven't paid any attention to that so I have no idea but I'm just gonna you can use your hand there this is so small I'm gonna push these little pieces in just give it a squeeze to you don't have to push in too much but I rather push it in more with my hand so I have more control than to just let the the topper push it in that makes sense okay I'm gonna turn it back and then this time we canter this out and then we take our little Brad the Brad piece that goes in its to be honest I don't know why people you know this isn't around anymore but I mean I have my suspicions okay so that's again placed in there nicely and I'm gonna do it very gently and it kind of went so I think we're good and I'm gonna pull this up thank you guys I don't know why I didn't use this more but because that's pretty darn good how cute is that little Brad I know they had some that didn't even have a back which is what I probably I prefer so I don't really use Brad's much if you think it's too like pinch outside where you can kind of see like this is pretty good you can just roll it along something that's a little more firm and kind of flatten that out but that's pretty darn good super cute all right so there's one bread and now we're gonna do the medium-sized which is already on here so I'm just gonna pull this up and turn to our medium size I'm gonna use this more often especially now that Miranda is a little older Wow before she wasn't existing but now I'm like now that she's older it's not like I bought it she wasn't around okay this is some close nut cause mark I always want to say close smart crafters companion fabric I don't know I'm using the medium size right where is it you know it's not that big so like the Rosewood I just off all away so I was thinking about using something smaller like this part but you still need a good amount of fabric I don't know if this is gonna work out how I'm envisioning I might have to cut deeper into the fabric yeah I need like this which I hate to do but oh well I'm assuming what you could do is get your temples it's out the templates I had shown and that way you know that you have this big enough but I'm just eyeballing it because you know why not because this has to go around this and then kind of push in so I think that's probably in the fabric and we can trim it down a little bit right now it's gonna look crazy I know that okay so we have our medium one now this time I am gonna leave this out like this and I'm gonna grab my fabric you see you see I didn't cut it any perfect circle or anything and then you can eyeball like do you want that little guy on there that's cute and I was I think it's big enough for these three to kind of be on there kind of nicely maybe low more this way okay so as you can see I'm tough holding it I'm gonna turn it back and as I'm holding I'm gonna give it a push and then you can turn this out and you don't need all of this fabric okay so I'm gonna trim down you need enough to catch though so don't turn me down too low and the fabric is pretty thin it depends on what you're using I guess okay I think that'll be okay I'm just gonna giving it a push just to start it off again and then we're gonna take our middle piece you guys this s you a lot of fun so again people fer frustrating cuz like the paper you use it didn't quite fit or if or not that didn't fit but like if you didn't do it quite right like this part right here is kind of scary to me but okay let's push it in and you know you don't want to waste stuff right that's what I would happen people would let me see why is this here we go oh that one popped up look at that and it's like perfectly rounded and everything I'm not to try to find more refills cuz you know I only have a hundred here well cuz this is never gonna go bad you know okay so then we need the larger one so the larger one all you do is unscrew the ends and I'm gonna unscrew wide and put this one and then unscrew this one this people just didn't have the faith what do you guys think happened with this I just didn't take off like I said oopsie I'm trying to do this wrong yeah that's what I thought I figured it was righty tighty lefty loosey especial it backwards so you do have to rotate this one a little bit differently and I will use my punch here oh my gosh why is this sword open and then I have this paper sitting here from the other day when I made that cute little raccoon card so see this isn't stuff yeah there we go it has to be I can see through and see that little strawberry right in the center otherwise I would do some like this but then it all curve around pretty much all of it so you can pick what you what you want and if I couldn't get close enough to where I wanted I would just trim my paper down to where I can get close to right again I'm gonna spray a little water cuz that worked well and I remember that being a tip so there's lots of things maybe that might even help you with your we are memory keepers one if you have it not to to it but just a little a little moisture and I'm gonna put this on a card I hope this one but the little guy I guess and with me to switch these around and that I guess it isn't the biggest deal you can just pop that in without it being switched out towards you cuz this one's really tight the space in between and if you wanted to layer this and make sure you have it where you want it you can kind of stick it to your base does that make sense let me put like a little piece of glue or little piece of tape so that you can stick it down but I'm just eyeballing this again from the top here and trying to make sure does that look that looks good right and give it a little push now this is interesting I'm gonna turn this one out because that was had a lot of stuff in the way okay and I'm doing a lot of caressing of this I think you know I don't think the we r memory keepers one works like this does it because if it's just the thing that you go like this I don't think there's a space for you to kind of manipulate it at least I don't think there is so again there we go put that one in oopsie turn that back and there you go so see how it's sticking out right now I'm like how do you there's no real good way to turn that out there you go it's just gonna hit that's all me it's just a brad point all right and that one's a little more obvious how we did but it's not bad so cute if you fill up space of air in between here that's weird yeah you know I'm saying Kanade okay um let me get a card base going and we'll try to use these and suck of those putting this stuff away I just want to show you this little chatterbox thing in case you might still have it again same thing I'm just gonna punch something maybe those guys right there okay hopefully this comes out this is really weird oh okay I see it they let it fall in here and then let it fall out the back and then you would put that in here but see this one is too big I'm gonna miss you for the smaller one I probably have another thing and then you would have that so it has a stick stickiness here so you would put this on the back do you have the little sticker right oh ma che and then that's how you would stick this to whatever surface you're gonna use and then you'd pop this little epoxy on top and you see it's pretty yellow and it does yellow the button so what I'm thinking about that is that means if you have some huh alright let's let's get this going okay so I am going to use just a piece of stamping card even though really wanted to use watercolor card but that's a payment start with this and I'm gonna make this a obviously on top of my card so I'm gonna cut it at four by five and a quarter leave it's hot in here already I think you saying that everyday and I guess I can't believe it by now I know Kathy out here she's in Phoenix Arizona and she's like oh you know so hot I'm like I can't believe I'm like wait I guess I can believe that this cuz it's Arizona okay I want just a dry brush and I'm gonna use my quash let me get those things together so just get some of these even have the pin backs for the larger one so cute I would like to see if I can find some of the flat backs the ones I don't have anything so maybe you have to I have to get on what's that place you bay there pearl wire I guess alright this is my glasses kind of not available here I have it justice placed here I'm just gonna use a dry brush for now and then get some of this washed down that our teas egg wash and I want to make it kind of chunky and fun so we'll see what happens yeah anymore cuz I'm using a dry brush and I really wanted to get on there OOP and these little tubes are very small but um I mean they have a lot cuz they're still going I don't want to be even either I just went like I don't want to everywhere I think that's happened of the day when I was making any samples I didn't really bring it up enough you know I left a lot of edge something like that she's kind of messy but it has texture and it's kind of all over the place it doesn't have the obviously I don't want it to be perfect I like the way you look dryer darn it see what happen sometimes you overwork it I like the way it looked when I was a little bit less there you go picks them up okay I'm gonna hit that with a heat tool and then we're gonna do a little more with some drops and then we'll put together some kind of card that's super super dry but dry enough to move on to the next thing mmm use that why and hopefully this works and not um yeah I would say this more like a silvery black the best at doing things like this what I want to do next I have this brush ins really really loose no this is a good one to use for this but we'll see oh there's some red ink on that and let me see something real quick yeah I don't know if it's even gonna spread the way I want it to there we go so here I'm like is this on top or this on top cuz I always forget so basically you're gonna smack your little brush and I wanted more in this area because I'm gonna put some other decorations here so that's fine just a little bit and I want some bigger drops if I can get some bigger ones this is very small like skinny there we go brush next I just want more over here than the other spots there yeah that's fine okay I'm gonna let that dry and then I think I'm just gonna grab like maybe hopefully I have a butterfly like in my Anna Griffin collection here and put a little button and maybe a little swirly something I don't know and yeah things here and I'm gonna try to see if I have to stick these down with the Brad if I can just lay it the Brad part out I don't have to use it you know saying I think I see the little silver part but you know what maybe if I bend it really well yep there we go okay yeah that's better I just don't wanted to poked on my paper like normal I think this one might have to go though cuz this is oh yeah I'm just gonna bend it back on itself I just don't like my opinion paper so much and maybe it'll get like all warped and stuff so I'd rather do this that's better and now that actually gives me a better idea of how I'm gonna style this thing I do have this little extra piece of frame that I had from a long time ago project is just a frame I cut out with tape all right a piece of tape on top there you know I want to do like your bow three and then this is always kind of open over here that's okay I know these are all very different things and there's still a lot of room around here I just I like the way that looks so that's why rolls you but you know what I'm gonna go ahead stick us down I didn't stick it down because I thought it has to use these Brad's but I don't have to punch him through so I will grab a card-based knob here so just a black piece of cardstock eight and a half by five and a half scoring at four and a quarter or just folded by hand those out of the way here and I'm gonna really stick this down again it's a little bit warped because we put stuff on there oh you know what when I was looking for that other stuff I found this little guy Michael I should use this up this is something that's still available and it's cute so for now it's purple it's the blue arts glue glue the lighter throw so I'll have a link to that if you want to check that out but I figured why not and I'm gonna use the orientation this way and there we go I suppose the glue that's in here you can just remove this and put it in a whole new cartridges high-tech and it is a dot matrix type glue I don't know if you can see that so it's not a full strip just a little dots dots dots all right put this here I'm gonna orient that first before I go any further because I'm gonna do a stamping I think um I hope I said this was busted out I'm pretty sure I mentioned at the beginning but that I did I actually say the worried the busted out it is busted out oh my gosh I can't hold I hurt my teeth um I told you guys I used that to unclog my glossy accents that same pin that's in my little precision tool and I guess it's sealed it shut like whatever the heck glossy accents is some good stuff right we all know that you can use it for dimensional you can use it for I was just gonna mention if you do have epoxy stickers that yellowed like that you can just use glossy accents use fled the area with it try do it carefully so you don't get bubbles and if you get bubbles you can kind of poke them out but it's nicer if you just a nice flooded area so I am going to clean this all right and then now it's just sticking things down oh no I'm going to do a stamp and where is it that's deaf I want to use is from this Jane Davenport set called free spirit and I'm just gonna do this shine light and I'm just gonna do it black so it echoes the black from the card base where is my know this is very shimmery and kind kind of I'm not sure I'm gonna use it distressing just for funsies because I don't want to be perfect anyway if it doesn't turn out perfect but I would probably do like a fast drying ink next time or something like that or maybe even a pigment ink no he just shows up that's so cool shine light and you know I saw this and I thought it was a cute sentiment so I wanted to use it and then I realized I'm like oh these moths I don't think these are butterflies they're moths so I guess it worked out real well and this is from these guys are from a set from Anna Griffin let me see if I have sorry I have everything to sit and friend me on my stool here quotes and flowers this Anna Griffin set here alright and I'm probably I need some 3d glue gel at some point here let me see this again whereas I putting these are you forgotten like that it's basic it has a lot of going on it's think it's kind of cute I was thinking about putting another flourish or something in the back and I didn't do that but I'm just gonna go for this the way I have it set up right now but if you I add a little more of course you want to do that do what you like I'm just gonna use this three blue gel it's almost done somebody asked me how long this lasts and I'm like hold the first jar our first tube I opened it lasted me months for to use it up I don't know why this one I only opened a couple weeks ago and it's pretty much I'm almost done using it so I like my 3d glue gel there's that one and this one yeah it's just a little dimension and if you have this thing I think it's well worth bringing out and hopefully if you have the we r memory keepers when it gave you some tips that might translate to that I don't know the epiphany crafts again I'm pretty sure they're yellowed it's a bit much of the same way like I showed you that little chatterbox when you punch out what you want it so for that one you put it all together you put your little epoxy your paper and in one punch it glues the epoxy to your paper and and puts it on like a little base if you want to do that if you don't want to just use a little clear epoxy they have like these little bases that it pushes into so on one step you would push it all down if you guys want to see that let me know I'll do it for another video cousins already long as it is but thanks for watching guys and I'll see you all at the next one bye now [Music] you [Music]", "GmHZUdgorbc": "[Music] you [Music]", "_4lVc9btH3g": "what's going

pens pipes whatever you gotta do to get feeling nice and right nice and medicated this morning believe it's a sunday morning cheers everyone very tasty flower this morning let me get my notes standing up for me so we can go ahead and talk about this strain there we are off the rip very very tasty so i just got a nice uh [Music] say uh like sweet gassy flavor to it go ahead put it down for one second so i can show you guys the nugs here oh [ __ ] there we go had it on tight some very very dense no buds there's one right there we got a few left so there's only about uh about five or six in here i think there was uh four big ones and two small a couple more and these are very very dense well-trimmed nugs uh they did very good on the trim job on this flower i will give truly that we got the last one in here there you are now it doesn't look like much but no i mean they're decent sized nugs there's probably about two grams between the three of these nuts they're that dense go ahead and uh get this closed up and we'll keep talking about this strain and keep puffing on the hip wrap very very tasty flour cherry punch is a satima sativa dominant hybrid it is a 43 strain for the eighth over there from truly florida the lineage on this strain is cherry ak-47 crossed with purple punch and those two strains come together to make cherry punch the white structure like you guys saw are very very dense nugs um they're like a light green color to them um very frosty uh with i would say red and purple hairs like it's definitely got some uh some oranges and purples in there whenever you grind up the bud and as you guys saw they're very very dense very frosty looking uh buds the trichomes come off on your fingers as you're uh as you're touching them no matter if you're breaking them up or not you know just me uh you know bring them out showing you guys i'm sure trichomes are coming off my fingers i can tell very very frosty almost white looking [Music] flower thc in this batch is coming in at 20.9 thc so almost 21 it's total of 734 milligrams in the entire eighth there's no cbd listed uh at least on the information on the jar i don't know if there is any in this batch truly didn't care enough to put it on there if there is but i am uh definitely feeling this flower already i'll tell you what i was saying earlier the taste on it is i would say sweet gassy but it's definitely got a little bit more in there like a peppery or a piney flavor on the end and that definitely translates through with the smell the smell on it is uh very sweet berries and then it's got that gas in there at the end and that gas comes from the gassy smell comes from uh the ak-47 and uh the sweet berry flavor almost comes from the purple punch so i would say both strains translate very well as for the feelings as for the the high it gives you [Music] i'd say it's a very euphoric um starting out very frontal head high i would say you definitely get that head head buzz that uh sativas are known for but it soon settles out mellows in to the rest of your body that's why uh it's a sativa dominant hybrid i would definitely say there is some indica uh indica effects in there not just straight sativa but i would say it's uh majority sativa you definitely get that head buzz and that uh very uppity euphoric happy high but it you still get that you know full body effects it's not just hearing uh cerebral definitely feeling it between my shoulder blades as well as you know in my legs you know it's definitely settling out very very creative high [Music] [Applause] i would recommend this flower to uh start your day or um you know if you got something that you need to do very creative wise whether it be uh you know you're not creative with something you need to focus i would say you know whether it be work or if you want to you know listen to a podcast or something something that doesn't need a lot of uh what's it called something you could focus on but that also doesn't need a lot of i would say attention but at the same time you know if you're working obviously you need attention but no this this strain is definitely good for that i would say this is definitely a nice euphoric uh creative focused high like i said i this isn't going to put you out in your ass or make you sleep or anything you're not going to want to watch a movie or anything on this flower it's not going to do that to you i'm definitely going to record this edit this get this video up very soon this uh flower very productive uh strain that's that's what i can say [Music] i thought it was gonna be a cherry pie in purple punch cross but it is cherry ak-47 if he was cherry pie he'd be more of an indica dominant hybrid but it is uh in fact sativa leaning after i uh researched into it [Applause] well very enjoyable indeed i went over there to uh true leave 64 their 64th location uh over there in puna gordon florida nice location uh it's one of the newer ones i've uh been to a few now i think i've been to about 10 locations in the state now uh true leaves and uh all very nice including this one nice uh helpful staff wasn't very busy at all i think there was a two or three of the people in

great day everyone need a couple more rips cheers cheers guys have a great day", "8iTwtorg1q4": "[Music] today I'm gonna be showing you guys how I make my own DIY DIY juices I'm gonna show you the places I get my product from what kind of measuring devices I use flavors that are out there and just kind of you know how I make things so let's get down I will show you guys how I do this alright guys so here's where I go one-stop DIY shop calm pretty much this is where I get all of my concentrates this is where I get all of my measuring equipment and also where I get my bottles from reason being is the prices are really great their shipping is fast if I make an order it is usually there two days later there's been one exception this last order I made did take a couple days extra but I did make a pretty big pretty good sized order but other than that all the other times I've ever ordered from them I have always had it within two days their shipping has been great they are very very good as far as our customer service goes and no I'm not getting anything for Preston that's deep people it's just I always thought it was cool because they give you like a little law they give you some gloves they give you the some measuring devices I throw some candy in there and there's always like a personalized thank-you card and stuff like that I just think that's cool as far as I know this company right here is based out of Minnesota anyway show you what they got on here so pretty much I go right over here DIY flavors and let me zoom in here see if you guys can see us a little bit better and the two plate are the two companies I like to get my flavors from is the flavor Prentiss and Lauren gourmet I have just found for myself I like the flavors they have you might like some other ones they have but for me this is what I use so I pick Lauren gourmet and I get the 1 ounce which is 30 milliliters and right here you pick the flavors you want now they've got a lot of great flavors now some of these other places have a lot more flavor the ones that they do have from Loran are very concentrated they're very you know pretty spot-on on their flavors that's why I usually go with them no stay here okay so Apple five dollars and fifty cents for a thirty milliliter bottle and that thirty milliliter bottle will usually last me about a month on making four ounce batches so five dollars and fifty cents for a month's worth of juice you know and there are some other flavors I put in there with it so let's say I show you one of them actually let me let me finish this part here first and I'll show you what I'm talking about so there's the juices that you can get then you go to empty bottles and you come down here and you've got your glass dropper bottles a 30ml glass dropper bottle black dollar 25 now those I use I've got a few of those and I use them for like if I've ran out of juice and I haven't had a chance to steep it yet I'll throw it in one of these because you want it in a dark place usually when you're steeping and I'll run it underneath the hot water for a while let it cool down and shake it up really good thrown under the hot water again for a little while shake it up really good and then I'll start vaping on it and it steeps as it sits in a bottle but mostly I throw them in these four ounce bottles just regular plastic bottles 96 cents you know a piece for the 4 ounce bottles that's what I make my batches and throw them in there steep them and I'll show you how I steep my juice and it works pretty well from what I've been able to tell so far and in regular 30 ml bottles natural dropper bottles white cap this is what I get they've got half ounce which is 15 mil 1 ounce 30 mil and in your 2 ounce which is 60 ml I get the 1 ounce bottles 80 cents apiece now you figure okay so you've got 80 cents and a bottle you've got five dollars and 50 cents per juice concentrate and granted these are all things that you're pretty much going to spend one time in a and the last order I made was $50 but let me show you what I ordered and you'll kind of understand why it was so much I got a syringe with blunt tip and a blunt tip needle it was an 18 gauge syringe a bottle of ethyl maltol which is a sweetener it's a crystallized sweetener and that I've got one two three four different flavors I got six of the 30 ounce dropper bottles I got four more the four ounce plastic bottles and then I got two other flavor concentrates so that was a pretty good order come out to about $50 now that $50 order is gonna last me probably at least a good month and a half maybe even two months now you figure when you're buying you know most most places you go to when you get a 30ml bottle around here it's about $12 for a house blend of 30 mil bottles now these I go through in about two to three days you know sometimes more than that just depending on how I made them but usually about two to three days on a 30ml bottle now you figure I'm gonna be using two or three to three of these a week so at most I'm spending $36 a week just in juice take that times for your over $130 a month just in juices I'm spending $50 that lasts me a month and a half to two months so I mean it's pretty good pretty good savings not only that but you can I mean it's it's cool just making your different flavors now the way I do it like here's my french vanilla deluxe and this is a flavor Prentis flavor that's a 30ml bottle and usually what I do is I take and I make a one milliliter test batch when I get a new juice and that I haven't tried yet and I'll mix it with a 20% I'll mix it a 20% blend with my 70/30 VG PG concentrate with no Nick just you know just my fillers and then my concentrate just to see what the actual flavor is gonna taste like and then I kind of go from there as far as oh this would probably look good with the Apple or go get with like cinnamon Danish or something like that and I love the desert flavors I love the cinnamon I love the apples I love the you know Kennish not real real sweet but the little sweet aromas you know it kinda like baked goods when you walk into a house and somebody's making cookies or something like that kind of those flavors those are the ones I love so let me show you okay here's my four ounce bottle one of my juices I have steeping and this is actually a cinnamon redhot that I made for some friends of mine that like these and you know I try to save me some money or whatever and we go to split so that's one of them there but today we're gonna make now let's see let's do how about an apple cinnamon french vanilla blend that sounds pretty good now I'll show you how to do that here in just a second but that's one-stop DIY shop that's where I go to get my stuff other place I go is Amazon he'd be surprised I mean you know a lot of people go straight to the source to get their candles and stuff like that but I have always had good luck getting my stuff from Amazon I mean here's a hundred-foot roll of 28 gauge Kanthal six bucks for honor front roll I still have my first hunter foot roll that I've probably got at least 50 foot left on there and I've had this for three months hey you know I'm saying so I mean you know you know good a good supply for cheap that's gonna last you you know that keeps you from having to go and buy per foot you know and spending more money I'm just trying to save you guys some money here this is also where I get my cutters from as lost where I get my cotton from you know they've just you can't beat the prices on there now as far as my flavors and my recipes and stuff like that where I usually go is eliquid recipes calm which I'll put a link in the description and these this is my page here these are the flavors I've got and I've got three apple turnovers because it took me a while to get to the flavor that I wanted you can see I started into some and then here's January and I finally got in January kind of where I like it at so you click on here here's the ingredients in there and it shows you 48 milligrams 50/50 PG VG we blend on the nicotine juice that's 48 milligrams per milliliter mm and how much it takes and this is making 118 milliliters which is equivalent of 4 ounces you know my 4 ounce bottles so it tells you seven point three eight milliliters of your nick juice five point seven five of your PG 78.92 one of your VG and that's a 30/70 blend and then your flavors in my Apple 7 milliliters 7.08 caramel two point three six milliliters salmon rolls seven point oh eight milliliters Dutch apple pie five point nine milliliters and then sweetener which I was using regular sugar sucralose sweetener at the time when I was making it three point five four ounces and that's how I was making my ankle turnover blend which you know I came out pretty good decent oops get out windows 8.1 still trying to get used to it anyway so cop here and go back to my page and let's work on a new one let's see my brother likes ry4 so we're gonna go to create recipe let me get back up here see if I can't show you exactly what I got going on here so recipe name let's just call it our wife or we're gonna make 118 milliliters but first before we do that what I want to do is I want to make a test batch just to see how how much I actually need to use and all I have is four small bottles anyway is these 30 ml bottles so that's what I'll use is a 30 ml bottle and I have my blunt sip syringe go up to five milliliters it's set up at 2.2 milliliter increments in between and this is usually what I'm going to use the only thing it stings about this bottle is trying to get your VG through a needle lie down here trying to get some VG through your needle yeah pretty thick stuff it doesn't like to pull through there so sometimes I cheat and I use just the regular syringe without the needle on there so let's grab our ry fork concentrates which is right here give it a good shake always shake your juices up so at a 20% blend making one milliliter you know you're gonna be at point 2 milliliters oh and these are PG they based juices meaning that concentrates are blended in straight PG let's get all the air out of here and we'll get down to 0.2 milliliters I got there drop in our bottle start with that then go to our PG now this bottle and see if I can zoom out here this bottle propylene glycol 32 ounces I think I paid eight dollars for this bottle and I got this from Amazon and I've had this bottle since December and I'm still got over half a bottle left honestly but here we are gonna use probably about 0.2 point 3 milliliters and we get the air out of here so go point three which is right in between the two lines I'm not getting real real scientific on my filler blend part but I'm just trying to show you guys how to do this and then he was my VG now this stuff I do go through a lot of because I mean most of mine are 70/30 on my VG so this is my second bottle since December but still like I said I think this one here I've spent eight or nine dollars on and this one's 43 ounces aren't all sorry I think was $13 for 43 ounces and I have not much left but I just ordered a gallon of it the other day so I got a gallon coming now this one here is a lot thicker so we're gonna take our needle off of here and just go straight here and this is gonna be about point four point six where we add here about point five actually let's push this down hmm try not to get me on my computer right there okay and this stuff is thick it's like a heavy syrup okay so there is my blend my test batch blend put my lid back on here drop her back on here and as you can see there's not much in there so we're just gonna give it a good shake which is not much left at her but not much in there to shake around so all right now we're a sticker in my marquee let's see how much juice I got actually this one's got some stuff in there you think this out real quick take our ry4 blend yeah I put it in the marquee just because it does show flavors very well and I'm gonna put the whole 1 milliliter in there because I want to saturate it I want to get a big dose of this flavor find out exactly how she's gonna taste too much okay so what I'm getting from that is 20% a little too much now I could probably take that turn it down quite a bit actually we're gonna take that down to about probably 10% when I make this mix because that is pretty strong a pretty strong concentrate but that's why I do one milliliter test batches no Nick juice just to find out what it is that I need to mix in order to make it taste right just be prepared for some nasty tastes every once in a while cuz whoo boy tell me what that was pretty pretty strong show you what I'm rocking here in my marquise if you can see that that's got a single nano coil suckers putting out Wow okay anyway so on to the next that's the ry4 um so that's for your nicotine kind of flavors if that's what you're into is nicotine but what we're gonna do is I'm gonna make one of mine one of the ones I like to make so let's just call this Apple one over coffee french vanilla orange bag that will swirl learn how to spell there we go okay so I'm making 180 milliliters desired strength 3 milligrams of nicotine on this one for me 37 BMX on the pg/vg my nicotine strength is 48 that's 48 milligrams per milliliter and that is in this nice big bottle here come on there we go it's mine on here there we go now this is 500 milliliter bottle 48 milligrams 50/50 blend you can get whatever kind of blend you want from this company here I actually cannot remember where I got this bottle at I want to say it was $28 for the five hundred mils of the Nick juice now I will tell you as a precautionary keep this I keep this in a plastic bag sealed plastic bag I keep it away from everything because I do have kids you do not want kids or animals getting around this stuff and you yourself when you're mixing it you want to make sure you're wearing gloves I mean I would even go as far as st. Pat protection just that's how I say it it's out there do I use it no but I'm gonna tell you to anyway this stuff is very strong it can get you very very sick it can burn your skin and the right dose this stuff can kill you if so it is very potent be careful with it use precaution and always always always keep away from children just like it says but yeah pretty potent stuff but that's what I use I think like I said that was $28 when I ordered it and out of all the batches I've made you can kind of see how much I've used so far and I've went through quite a few batches so this stuff will last you forever and that size so let's get back to making her juice now we're gonna add a flavor mmm and the nice thing about this is it actually has a lot of the manufacturers flavor blends already in their database so whenever you start typing a flavor um it'll ask you you know okay is it the flavor from will ran is it from dks is it from the flavor Prentis or you know whatever so let's do let's start with the french vanilla french deluxe oops and here we go they're perfumery apprentice oh you can't see that I came here we go sorry click on that and we're gonna do this at and like I said I want to keep my my flavor totals between 15 and 23 percent depending on the flavors now these flavors I know pretty well the french vanilla comes through pretty well so I'm only going to mix that at about 3% and I don't know if I said this or not but these are all pre diluted in propylene glycol and it even tells you on here it's the flavor blend with propylene glycol and it'll ask you here is a PG VG or other and most of the time it's PG and most of these flavors that you get so it already takes that into consideration whenever you're doing your your 30 70 blend and what's your 1 so we're going to add another flavor here we're going to add apple and this is from Lorraine oils so your Lauren flick and this one we are gonna mix had about 10 percent this is a great flavor too by the way I love their Apple next one we're gonna do I've got two that I really really love these two I can vape on my on their own and they're just great me turning some light on for you here the flavor print is cinnamon sugar cookie and DX Danish cinnamon Danish flavor this one oh my god by itself is so good and the problem is it makes you hungry yeah anyway this one has a great flavor to mix with pretty much anything sweet any kind of dessert flavors this one goes great with now the cinnamon Danish this one here is more towards the cinnamon side not a lot like if he would imagine a cinnamon Danish it's it's one of those flavors that whenever you first try it like when I tried it by itself it really didn't give me that flavor but mixed with these other flavors it comes through great so the cinnamon sugar cookie let's start with that one you guys can't see what I'm doing here there we go so how much sugar cookie scroll down the page here and that is the flavors apprentice and let's see this one here we're going to do about mmm let's go with 8% and actually that's where we're gonna stop now as soon as I did that drops per milliliter yeah mine's more like 25 drops per milliliter on these and you can set your recipes as private on here like if you're trying to get it right you don't wanna put it out there yet because it's not quite right set it as private and then you save it and you can only see it in yours so here we go and tells me what I need already set up ready to go so we got our Nick juice seven point three eight milliliters PG six point nine three milliliters VG seventy eight point nine one French vanilla the Apple the cinnamon sugar oh there was something else I forgot to mix in here dang it add a flavor need to put my sweetener in there ethyl maltol and this is an other now this one we're gonna mix it 3% dupes try it again 3% now this one's kind of funky because whether it be in a crystal it's not like you can just put in your syringe and drop it into your bottle you actually use a little scooper spoon to drop it in there and I usually go on this one if it's at 3% I do three scoops whether or not that's the right measurement it probably isn't but that's how I do it so sue me if I'm wrong whoo okay so I'm up on my flavor a little bit I'm at 24% that's okay on this one because I already know how this one comes out and I love it so that's what we're gonna go with so then it gives you like I said here's your Nick your pg/vg your flavours to total 118 milliliters or four ounces if you want to do it in drops which I don't recommend except for on some of them were it just takes a couple kind of like oh my or to go cake batter cake batter flavor this is from compel at capella Wow this stuff a little goes a long way and it's the same with cinnamon if you do any kind of cinnamon blends I might tell you a little goes a long way test it before you mix it because just a few drops of this stuff will turn any of your recipes you'll taste this by itself I'm not saying it's a bad taste it is a pretty decent taste but it comes through pretty strong and so does the cinnamon the cinnamon you add it to any of your juices at man it comes through hard so make sure and you know start small really small and then add to your liking and then down here it tells you a three milligram strength on your nicotine your pg/vg ratio 30 70 your flavor totals 28.3 milliliters or 24 percent of your mix is flavoring and in a drop per milliliter and if I wanted to share this recipe there's my URL for this recipe and I can put it on share it with you guys so we're gonna save this and there we go she is saved so now we're gonna make it it comes the fun part alright so let me reset here let's move the computer way back here okay then we'll come down here to the table here's my bottle zoom out say hi bottle alright so the first thing I must start with the nicotine I usually put in last because I don't want to if I spill it whatever cheese Li good idea I leave it for last so let's start with my PG concentrate 5.7 milliliters like I said make sure you give it a good shake get my blunt tip syringe needle here so we know five point eight seven so we know we're gonna get five any kind of thick juices stuff that's needle just hates who actually goes just sick so I couldn't do my point eighty seven let's get air out but can alright so let's go to five point eight seven ish in the bottle all right there's the PG mm-hmm all right now the VG I'm actually highlight I'm gonna save the VG for last and I'll show you why here in a second because 76 milliliters whenever you can only do six milliliters at a time it's a pain in the ass so I usually just pour it in over all of it until I fill the bottle cheats but oh well all right well let's deal with Cu I'm talking about their island especially doing it on camera you suck at this so my apple 11.8 mils you get it to where you guys can see this there we go now we're gonna get the air out of this okay take this down to five milliliters for the first drop so there's five now I'm making a big batch cuz that's you know I've been doing this for a little while now for a few months and I've kind of know what I like so I'm gonna go ahead and I'm just making a big batch I wouldn't recommend if you're starting just starting out on us make small batches because you're gonna make mistakes you're gonna try things and I didn't quite like that but now you're stuck with four ounces of it so make small batches and now my french vanilla how much I need 3.5 for French vanilla it's really good too by itself even I mean that one comes through really well that's why I'm doing only three percent of it okay let's get the air out of here measure it up so 3.54 now I do have a little it goes by 0.1 milliliters and usually I just stay with this because that other one's a pain he has to use I just kind of guesstimate on the last part of it if I'll sell it I'm gonna be different because they'd want something little more consistent because I'm not gonna say that mine I mean mine usually are pretty consistent cuz I'm going off by a hair but and then my cinnamon sugar cookie stuffs good 9.4 for it sucked up in there started about 5:00 and then 4.44 left and since on the syringe it goes to 0.2 millimeter and milliliter sorry increments I'll just go a little bit past the four line let me get this air bubble out of here okay so that's it for the syringe and my liquid flavorings now it's time for my immortal which is just a crystallized sweetener that looks like little sugar zoom in on that there you and I'm gonna put three little spoonfuls okay that one alright now let's get to the nicotine 7.38 good shaking this is a glass bottle and actually one second my very different this one doesn't have the needle so we need 7.38 so we're gonna get five out of this one two and I'm going to show you the other one that I use that goes into 0.1 milliliter increments and show you why I say it's such a pain in the ass I need point three eight milliliters now so here's what we got it says little guy here in 0.25 no liter if I'm not mistaken on this one so point two five point five point seven five one milliliter so 0.25 so we'll be right about here ish in the middle and you see I get all the air bubbles in there so I say it's such a pain yes so you just push it out and take it right around where you want it to be say right about there okay put the top back in this thing like I said be very very very very careful with that and make sure you wash your hands if you're not wearing gloves after you're done doing your mixing so here's what I got so far this is my flavour my flavors and my nicotine so far that's quite a lot and very very very pungent so now let's put our VG in there like I said this stuff is very thick and by the way ladies this stuff is awesome for your hands and your arms and it's a great moisturizer too and I'm just going to top this thing off with VG all in just FYI the VG and the PG that I get they are USP grade make sure that whenever you're ordering your stuff make sure it is food grade and it'll say USP grade or you know 99.9% pure or whatever but you want to make sure it's food grade alright so there is our batch now I just gotta find my lid all right so you're gonna notice it's pretty clear and the longer you let it set and steep the more the colorings gonna it's gonna darken up a little bit sorry give this good shake for about 20 seconds and get it all nice and mixed and then I'm gonna show you how I steep my juice and the reason why I do it this way now some people will say put it in a you know a pan with water in water simmering and leave it in there for a little while whatever I think like 10 minutes or something like that then you take it out I don't like putting plastic bottles and simmering water or anything that hot I know they say I think these plastic bottles are like BPA free or whatever but I just don't trust getting plastic to the point where it could melt and get into my juice and then I make that into my lungs I don't like that idea so what I do is I just use hot water from the tap and I fill up my sink let it sit in there until the water starts cooling off then I take it out I give it a good shake I fill the sink back up again with the hot water put it back in there let it stay in there until the water starts cooling off again give it another good shake and then I just throw it in the cabinet and let it set and probably once after about a day or two I go on in the cabinet take the lid off that's it for about two hours then he put the lid back on and you're gonna realize by doing it just with a hot water even and giving it a good shake it's gonna be pretty well steeped as far as flavors go you're gonna get the flavors you know you can even vape them and pretty much if you do the hot water trick with it you could pretty much vape this right away and they have great fate you know good flavor and all that good stuff but to let it steep and you know really rich enough you want to leave it set and I usually let my bottle set for about three or four days you know at the minimum before I start vaping on them but kind of give you an idea I made the same mix already you see the difference in the color that's from letting it steep and your flavors really meld it together I mean it this is a good juice for me anyway that's my own personal my personal blend that I like anyway so yeah I mean if you want to start DIY juice making sorry let me through my bottle at me here okay if you wanna start DIY juice Megan it is simple and it's it's really satisfying you know especially when you get a flavor that you're just like oh my god really good I love this flavor or if you you find a flavor that you really like it a shop and you're you know and like I said in some of my other videos I know not everybody is made out of money they can't just go out and afford to do this stuff if you're coming off of smoking you know and you're spending thirty five to fifty dollars on a carton of cigarettes depending on how long that carton lasts you and you're trying to go to vaping because it's cheaper now it's not really that cheap when you get into dripping and realize that you know this hobby is pretty dang expensive any less you start doing stuff like this you start making your own juices you make your own coils you know build your own coils kind of like that Delta - if you don't get the RBA and you want to rebuild that quill you know you ain't got the money to go get coil heads - twenty-five dollars for five of them you rebuild it you know you save yourself that money you quit smoking the cigarettes you get that satisfying feeling satisfaction sorry I'll figure it out higher in a second how to talk anyway you get that satisfaction from vaping you know to keep you from smoking that's what it's about quit the smoking find the flavors you like stick with it I love doing this it gives me that satisfaction when I crave this is what I crave now and I actually don't vape as much as I used to I mean I was vaping non-stop all day long and seemed like there for a little while and going through a 30 ml bottle of juice almost in a day day and a half and now my you know I slowed down a little bit I just take a vape here and there you know just to get that flavor and that feeling again but anyway I'm rambling sorry but that's how you do it and that's just for the flavors I like now there are tons of stuff out there you know like here's the strawberries and cream my wife loves the strawberries and cream and I tried getting fancy you know um I had this with this and this and this or whatever and it come out tasting and that's so great the strawberries and cream by itself was enough you know and that stuff that you learn over time by doing is you learn what you like you know you learn what works you learn kind of what kind of things to put it in to give you the little smoother creamier flavors like the Bavarian cream I have this I could add this to this juice and it gives you that I mean just kind of like a smoother flavor I mean it's not so sweet and oh it's a word I'm looking for rich it's just it's this kind of smooth that I have a little bit and gives you that creamy mmm you know really good player but that's you know it's all on your taste and what you like and like I said this one right here that stuff is potent yeah I was going for apple cinnamon and when I added this in there by the time I was done I made cinnamon red-hot literally I mean it tasted like you were eating a cinnamon red hot I can't vape cinnamon I just can't I mean it killed me the first time I tried to take a hit on my Marquis oh my god I thought I was gonna die mmm but luckily I got a friend who loves that stuff and she puts it in her tank she vapes it she loves it so I got some way you can use that juice now but your family into it get your friends into it and go in on you know these things together and you're gonna save yourself tons of money and you're gonna get the juices that you like you know if like I said the way I started is there was a brick and mortar that made this Apple Apple Danish what was it called Apple turnover and I loved it oh my god I loved it but it was $12 bottle and I just couldn't afford $12 a bottle every two days so I tried making my own and it took me a month to get the flavor close I mean it wasn't spot-on but I actually got it to where I liked the flavor that I made more than I liked their flavor so a little something I just found and I liked mmm but anyway so just give you an idea so here's like I said here's the one i steeped here's an empty 30ml bottle top top that you shouldn't shake get all nice little air bubbles and stuff in there pour and enjoy it's like a drink commercial shaken not stirred yeah no that's all right though I'm okay anyway and there you go 30 mils ready to go take it with you make up on so you don't have to carry this around now I'm not gonna lie when I go to friend's house or whatever and I'm there for a while how'd you take this with me just to make sure I don't run out or if

"A24ihP6BzP4": "[Music] [Music] the prostate check out 26 there's been a bad fall in all three more chance in distant - we need to expose our [Music] [Music] well good evening good afternoon deal why they're under why we're going live what's going on something has come to my attention and we must present this to ensure other people can not be ripped off when there is a severe ripoff happening in DIY D remember we always say together let's discover and that includes not only discovering the best eloquent the best places to buy a liquid from the best concentrates the best experience and sometimes we're not always going to have the best experience I get it and that an experience I prefer to be handled between consumer and vendor however there are some extreme cases and unfortunately and princely I'm going to expose to you today a very truthful case of one ripoff merchant and if a few others come out of this one tube to obviously start drum cause drama or anything like that but I am certainly one about fairness and equality for all and equal chance to be able to DIY and and yeah so I'm going to talk a bit about that today as I see using the truth obviously I need subscribers we've got this notification so thank you for being subscribed to this channel and hopefully those who don't captain life this will be so cool to watch I think during the replay but thank you good subscribers you said dick and yeah oh sorry let's get on with it all right so when I start it turns my attention only roughly about 24 hours ago that there was a unscrupulous vendor that's been roaming around I don't know if I want a look at some other investigations and I uncovered that this particular person has a lot of other businesses so I don't know and I questioned the practices on any other businesses because I just haven't got the information at hand yes only look here's the thing and this is why this report mention just show the detail shortly he's getting why it's what he's getting away because at the moment there's kind of not much illegal that he's doing but there is a beat there is a beat and look you know I might to sound cover some stuff here that I maybe I didn't even discover all yeah because it's pretty decent all right okay so grain I'll get to the point just a second all right so let's have a look I'm going to screen show the questionable vendor have hand and this will all make sense okay it'll all make sense okay so it's brought to my attention that this particular vendor loan has a vape Ossie please first notice please take note this is a non-secure it's not a secure website so there should always be alarm bells whenever you go to a website that is not secure okay so let's firstly have a look at what greets us at this page shall we PG and VG liquids sells all sorts of different stuff they look mainly I want to concentrate on how it's affecting dear let's have a look at this guy's and girls how fair is it that somebody who may be unsuspecting maybe a hundred percent unsuspecting pay $22 90 $22 19 for 125 milk guys that's about 4 ounces in America for those who operate analysis so for 4 ounces of page a $22 90 and there was no distress stop the sheriff or a mile I pop out the chart I've done before the stranger so welcome you sort of keep up with what's being said and have that on a separate screen in front of me yeah thoughts or opinions or experiences with what I'm talking about okay so let's start off with $22 9125 mill well put it get any worse could it get any worse on them let's have a look let's have a look at some dear wire suppliers shall we some DIY supplies actually before we go there let's go back let's go back let's fly to concentrates some flow to concentrates now I've just let you know it doesn't make a clear what the branding is of any of these floated concentrates it's clear enough we see on the screen when I try and zoom it up if I can I can hopefully my making me be clear hey check this out guys just so you can make sure you can read it that's 1/10 middle of flavor concentrate of 30 dollars 35 like here you say pen sometimes flavor concentrates can be expensive I agree but not $30 deeper concentrating specialists fly the concert rain I don't even think it's me that astronomical price later $26 regardless we're not talking about medicine flower guys what you'll find is this guy is actually quite the mixer quite the mixer you can find him found by Posey they are named Li and you'll find some there's standing like talented recipes let's start with the vanilla her nature shall we you know often in jail that's just boost that up a little bit just so it's easier to say we've got funny 2% melon or 12% you know that I mix what the [ __ ] is I mix those who I should know I mix is basically a cheap Chinese brain it's like the cheaper side of things saying if you like it's it's pretty cheap chinese stuff look i hadn't used a lot of I mix so I can't comment on its quality but we're talking about a flavor concentrate for argument's sake smelly at 12 percent you need that much concentrate now so we're not talking about a super concentrate so we're not gonna get particularly fantastic value good look let's be fair you're not actually comparing melon let's like let's have a look at melon can we even get to the melon key choice oh there's a bonus 30 mil for $36 55 brilliant it's an incentive to buy more and I can't even get to his melon so I thought looks like that's all he's got in stock he must be selling hates and that's what I'm worried about so here we have a vendor who to the unsuspecting I the unsuspecting person sadly and is possible sadly they may come across this recipe this site by a Google search or wherever in nature's to promote himself and obviously Exhibit A promotes himself is only allow you've got an exciting recipe that looks simple you're gonna look for you maybe we're advisors so there you gonna go straight to his website which is linked in the title of his name 35 concentrate you know I've got quite a little bit of devil's advocate for a moment though this guy he does give free delivery free delivery so let's cut him some slack the hand it'll cost him maybe ten dollars actually know that eight dollars to deliver that product to me so bring a 30ml bottle down to about twenty dollars worth twenty dollars hmm so there you go that's just one just one small example here's got some exceptional deals and then some exceptional offers available and I don't normally share for these sites and make no mistake between my sarcasm [ __ ] second I'm saying is avoid sites like the plague like this that it is price counter price Garden to extremist forum let's have a look at this fantastic deal why starter kit DIY kit for babies I want to do a little mixing on their own it consists of 16 items can you count the 16 items 1 2 3 4 5 6 10 11 12 come on come on he's he's coming he must be counting the bottle tops as well because I guess you've gotta count the bottle tops the pretty exceptional value all that for thirty two dollars sixty by two kids of forty five dollars 25 and there's some more exceptional value now let's have a look at it let's do the messy in all reality we've gone three three no bottles 330 ml bottles and some colored taps honestly through an eBay Aliexpress Amazon wherever you go laughing a grands testimonials on that side you know what don't look at that be quite interesting let's say you pay the extreme end of a dollar fifty bottle there four dollars $50 each for those at seven dollars fifty eight dollars fifty ten dollars fifty but what else do we get look basically at the extreme ends you've probably got about fifteen dollars worth of stuff at the extreme end of pricing comparatively featured on 60 exceptional value don't forget it's 69 is apparently 310 your body's 330 Mills yeah look for yourself if you like do there so a liquid oh yeah that looks the best is still yet to come going so fantastic don't do a liquid scribe these guys do no nonsense e liquids and deluxe e liquids you can even write your own order and tell him what flavors you want in your he liquid which I think it's just amazing let's have a look at some of the no-nonsense e-liquid showing what we got there oh look at that turn the bottles for only a good low price of $19.95 whoa only one flavors are refreshingly fizzy : I didn't see any mws 23 didn't say anything else I don't think you're gonna get much a refreshing fizzy fizzy keep him on fizzy does anybody know how to do fizzy call tactically it I don't know anyone yet so you can maybe help me out with that that would be fantastic but I don't know anyone who can actually do a fizzy be liquid so $19 85 with exceptional values 2495 for a premium e-liquid when other words made from some of the best products available on the market that may be a recipe might be at least five flavors or so and quite a lot of delicate work or imported from overseas of them as a premium e-liquid would be the only reason you've paid $25 for 30 mils to really treat yourself but watching there you go physique like the trapeze in the vitamin vibrant this is this is some unbelievable exceptional content here BB 8 6 2006 I come out of Australia Australian home is Australia's Australia obviously but look to mock sailor could see this is the night nonsense nonsense you know this is this is the nonsense still the same price still the same price for cherry cola Chuck Berry there's some exceptional value they're exceptional so there's some other things that kind of really disturb me here okay page verification page verification I'm sorry we have to ask firstly why you [ __ ] you sorry for asking for age verification you enter the Sun we enter the site with no pop-up screen checking with age verification know what think Christ that there is no apparent nicotine sales done by this son think Christ however it gets better make sure you're 18 years old like this twelve-year-old looking guy I mean would it be even maybe look I kinds of cartoon but come on come on does that represent someone who's over 18 is that the image of vaping that we want yeah so faithful z.com do you this is you know and he's got the nerve to have an area about the law which I've gone through before and he refers to other people's articles which really is not fair to refer to other people's good solid data information we need up this sort of [ __ ] on this site and you are ridiculously over priced now you be the judge this is having let's pick on a basic a leaf mod hey let's have a look and see if it's good value on that he's [ __ ] kidding the icon a leaf for a hundred and fifteen dollars look I'm not all over the prices of mods but I do know that a model of that type of Canada in a leaf chances are that's not going to be more than eighty dollars Australian anywhere else so if that's not a price couch I'll be surprised but no don't don't just take one example I take just one example let's have a look at the aspire range what $99 for a built-in battery fantastic comment out there in the churn say there was a star there was in students don't even want to going to say much more than let's have a look anyway let's have a look let's see what exceptional exceptional value could be provided on batteries and chargers vtc five at least sir and a half a half decent half decent battery for twenty eight dollars ninety they're going price is between 12 maybe 15 dollars at a gouge serious come on all stick style now this is kind of interesting I remember saying this one see this one the inspire pocket for 1500 a month a great write little starter fantastic these were cut a little bit bigger of a couple years ago now I saw these on a Chinese clearance and I swear to God if you hasn't bought from this clearance down he's just not making as much profit as he should I've sort of been cleared out because eight dollars us and might have been eleven dollars us the $69 90 no more to pay delivered to your door what a deal honestly at the very most station be anyone's $30 no matter where you go so yeah Sep tional exceptional business look Derek go into the page in VG I'm sure you can have you fun and check out this wonderful site look the good news is the good news is is very very contact able very contact able let's have a look let's have you look at the contact section drop us a line drop us a line there you go on the form below or you can just click there and I'll go straight to his phone number in there fantastic in the call if you like a very approachable guy which is very important when you're people in the child the cold is a free plug if you were seriously that is the oldest looking guy on the sign that cartoon figure probably looks maybe almost 15 don't know why just kind of almost eyes are to the time that's what it is all right look what is one important thing we must scrutinize which I think it's sort of kind of been pointed out before let's have a look at this this person these people have gone out of their way to put pen to paper like a finger to keyboard something like that and giving their testimonials you know the problem is that these people are probably in isolated areas or constant from Sydney really you're not my argument these people are the liars all from isolated areas or they're just not real testimonials because hope is not in Western Australia so look what I can confirm food grains my investigations have brought him down to Port Macquarie in New South Wales so total acquiring New South Wales is where these guys located and certainly one hell of an interesting business but look don't just give up there I will make sure that I put the link out there in the chat so you can check out some delicious attempts of recipes on ELR as well that'll do public service of public service there we've got a calling to care for each other because they plaintiffs exist I don't know why they are stealing our oxygen markets because think this is like if the government want to start charging an oxygen tax please start with these sort of [ __ ] nets but dioxygen starving the rest of the world full of oxygen oxygen leaves that shouldn't really exists but again I don't mean to be mean horrible or whatever to anybody but I do mean to be fair and equitable especially anywhere else I am in life to be honest there's nothing there's no honest way to do business like that you know but you can't deny somebody making smart move but not being anti-competitive and we're talking about people's lives here potential life-saving technology and maybe getting in to try and save some money and deal y-yeah anyway it's obviously trying to make profit from the gullible yeah absolutely groans so yeah look I guess I don't want a gap line all day but I think I've been doing a disservice by not making this public or easily be more publicly accessible information and just to be a little bit buyer beware if you've got a friend who may have seen your deal why and they may be talking about deal wine or something like that do they're not ready yet just maybe just popping that quick line to say look when you do let us know all referring to maybe our web site or DIY or dial or any of the other good dump websites and informational sites about DIY so that they can be a hopefully linked up to some decent companies as to where to buy stuff and where to get started because really at the end of the day look and the end of just the day for that matter that's where we're in the bathroom you're dealing way down under is sharing exchanging the best possible information where to get the best possible deals between and we don't just rely on me to do we do it as a collar and you know that's together that's discovery thing you know we're together you know how do the fun mixes to stop and stand offense thinking's look any other little DIY questions while you've got me otherwise I'm gonna get the [ __ ] outta here [ __ ] out of you that's the Christ we will see how we go let me how long this guy's been operating but from all indications I don't think it's been too long look he's been training we've got some training evidence with some evidence of been listed as a business from the year 2000 so the 19 years it does have many other business outlets some include entertainment industry [ __ ] just stay there and just be a stand-up comedian nobody laughing maybe some improvement area of an industry because the information from defamation I'm just showing you the facts Isaiah and hey if you guys agree with me that it is price gouging that's great and you know price gouging is an opinion and that is my opinion anybody else's into it into the crime into the contrary Jerry how I just asking well we've got me a will mention that look I did trial a show for a while there for a few weeks and I'm called QA and look this is show that I would have actually liked it was actually rolling quite well and then I sort of interrupted on life matters life stuff got in the way unfortunately those opportune moments when I wanted to go live with those so was a good opportunity unfortunately I'm gonna have a chance to be able to do a structured time show like that don't get me wrong hashtag Nixon was me mates with Mediterranean as long as I can hold on to that that'll always happen when I said they know USA's and Standard Time Sunday morning Ozzy Eastern Standard Time and we've certainly be having another fantastic show this weekend another under-the-radar episode where we'll talk about other people's recipes and lots more look I encourage the pipes make sure you joined and also to their wagon under comp and if you can contribute and be a member and help support is to people things keep the lights on so to speak that'd be awesome too but not necessary I'm yeah but I can't keep doing the Q&A show unfortunately every week unfortunately I don't do this for a full time job I do this for the passion and the love and the enjoyment of DIY so Jim what did you miss I now have to start again long gone from the start are you ready guys ok ok sorry Jean you'll have to watch the replay look basically just a ripoff they could be anywhere could be in the state's at the be trades it could be anyway we should stand and rock that would be probably the best place for ripoffs like that I think the main thing is we just keep on looking after each other trying to promote the good ones I ain't easy [Music] I think I think he can keep the good people where that should be and I think it's just about community and you know and that's why I did change the slogan with the first word bein together because ultimately I think that's what good community does obviously stick it together so you think the thing you're never gonna ground everything and that's ok but at least we couldn't sort of do something we've discovered the center anyway [Music] so don't forget this had NR USA stand standard on a 7 pm-9 am Ozzy Eastern Standard Time just just enough time to recover from your said I know right so no excuses morning Eastern Standard Time hashtag mixing with me mates all the other details regarding we can find this hang out with us in discord all that sort of thing you'll find the page on our website and DIY down under calm with a links below then we'll just just take a Twitter and that's all we can do right and done it sugar the good people let it be afraid to shout out the good people write other people's reviews of recipes you've tasted them go look them well that's my little random going live exposing unscrupulous business for the right reasons so whatever we do let's stick together and that's discover understand you're all beautiful [Music]", "GlfKlBf6QCQ": "what up and welcome to another edition of canon media where we are bringing to you honest and unbiased canvas strain reviews so today we are going to be reviewing reconcush by a dna now this is my very first time trying and reviewing any of the dna genetics as well as my first time trying reconcush so if you are like me and have never tried reconcush let's go ahead and talk about it this is an indica dominant hybrid strain it is an 80 percent indica to a 20 sativa that is a cross between l a confidential and candidential so that is a brand new strain for me i've heard of la confidential before and on the uh dna genetics website it says it's a perfect blend of two parts la and one part cantaloupe so um i'm really excited to try this stuff out this stuff is testing out at a total thc of 22.42 and total thc a so i'm guessing that's the total cannabinoids of 26.6 percent now that is really should be some very potent stuff this stuff was harvested on the 16th of november it was packaged on the 10th of december today is christmas day uh december the 25th so we are only two weeks outside of packaging so i was expecting this stuff to be really really fresh and fragrant and all of that good stuff so before we get into this review i want to go ahead bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out then we're going to go ahead and take a look at it together okay so what did you think of the recon kush let me know in the comments below um now the one thing i'll say is i was kind of bummed out that when i open this jar there's no seal just this inner seal and i have got to be honest there's basically no terps in this jar and this is like so funny it says this on the jar there it says award-winning genetics except no imitations puff tough our terps don't lie our terps don't lie where are the terps what what terps are lying because there are no terps here and i gotta tell you guys that i did grind up a nug of this and no more terps came out like there's literally like no terps in this at all i mean i had a subtle bit of sweetness um you know after i ground it up but boy even that was uh reserved and pulled back now this one nug that was in this jar one of the nugs was it's really nice snug it's just a very very nice nug it was packed very nice i mean it's very dense there's trichomes on the outside and the inside i mean and this is a nice size bud it really really is unfortunately the rest of the uh the eighth you guys see there it's just these small little popcorn buds that was what it consisted of and that's really unfortunate um and you know i do think this stuff was machine trimmed which is going to affect the rating for me it just based on the bottom of these nugs it just it looks like it was run through an auto trimmer and that really messed with the integrity of the bud and this stuff isn't cheap i mean i got this as a freebie as a first time patient um but it says 40 on the bottom of this jar i mean that is not cheap medicine and to open up a jar that it's really just popcorn nugs and then there's one nice bud like they should all be like this one nice bud um but boy i'm just wondering where are the terps in this because honest to god i mean for me um i'm really lacking the terps in this now before i got started and opened this jar for the first time i went ahead and threw dna genetics on the penny pinchers test i mean this is a jar for 40 bucks it better be right with three and a half grams in there so let's go ahead get to the penny pinchers test and see if we can catch dna genetics penny pinching from there sac so let's go ahead and get to the penny pitcher's test now okay so the time has come for the penny pinchers test let's see if this recon kush by dna genetics weighs 3.5 grams like it's listed here on the package so let's go ahead we'll get the scale turned on i'm going to go ahead and put a dollar bill on the scale to make sure that this weighs exactly one gram and that we're all ready and calibrated here perfect let's go ahead and get our cup put on the scale and let's get that tared out now okay you guys see this package has not been open i'm gonna go ahead and open it up now and let's get the bud dumped in here and see oh my gosh hold on a second three 3.42 grams that is a hard fail on the penny pinchers test by dna genetics shame on you dna genetics what a travesty 3.42 like you weren't even close almost 0.1 off dna genetics that is honestly unacceptable i can tell you this i purchased this from seoul um flower in the scottsdale air park i'm certainly going to be calling them uh immediately following this interview to let them know about this uh penny pinch from you dna genetics and honestly that is just so sad it's so sad that um you know you you aren't even close here on this penny pinchers test but regardless i'm excited to try this stuff even though i know that it's basically just a bonafide copper state farm flower you know this was definitely the nug that i saw in here was one of the nicest looking nugs i have seen so yeah that is definitely um you know a good step in the right direction it was covered in trichomes and i like that now today i'm going to be enjoying some of this recon cush out of my air riser extreme q desktop vaporizer i've got this set to 375 degrees fahrenheit this is the bowl that's sitting right on top of the heating element there now i want to smell this and see like a nice subtle sweetness with a little bit of creaminess and definitely that pine that evergreen cushy pine is coming out um now that that bowl has kind of been warming up so i'm happy to see that some of the smell is getting released by that vaporizer warming up the botanicals now i'm going to take my whip the end with the screen in it that one's going to go sit right on top of the bowl that's sitting on top of the vaporizer the other end is another male end that is going into my scientific inhalations triple filtered bubbler i have got some distilled water brand new distilled water in the second chamber brand new organic cotton filter in the third chamber that'll filter out any potential remaining impurities that did not get purged and flushed in the final stages of growing the first chamber there is where carbon would typically sit and prevent ash from reaching the water but since i am vaping today that's not going to be an issue for me so if you guys are ready i'm certainly ready let's try out some of this recon kush by dna genetics and see what it's all about okay so first rip did not really produce any vapor i'm gonna dive in for the second rip i'll probably do three on screen with you guys so we get at least two that have some visible vapor okay very light thin vapor pretty smooth it was kind of that subtly sweet with a little bit of like a fresh cotton linen almost like a little bit soapy but it's very subdued and very subtle let's dive in for that third rip which will hopefully be the second rip that has visible vapor to see how this flavor develops okay so i can actually feel that coming on at the very end of the rip really thin thin vapor just some subtle sweetness i'm getting a bit of earthiness a little bit of creaminess there a tiny tiny bit of pine a little bit of musk but it's very very subtle i mean like as soon as it hit my tongue now it's gone i was kind of like trying to remember all the flavors that i was getting um i'm really curious to see what happens now throughout the rest of this bowl to see how the flavors develop here while i'm puffing this so while i'm finishing out this bowl i want to bring this stuff up on the screen because yeah i'm getting some creaminess so i want to see how that develops while i am finishing the bowl i want to bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out under the magnification of a 25 times macro lens you can get a little bit of a better up close and personal view of this recon kush so here it comes now okay so you are looking at the recon cush by dna genetics and wow this stuff has that classic christmas tree bud structure it's that light lime green coloration thin orange hair scattered throughout those are very resemblant of those hairs that you typically see on og kush phenotypes um this stuff in particular was trimmed right up to the bud no excess leaf material on this butt at all in all honesty i mean it's trimmed so tight that it almost looks indicative of an auto trim job um i will say though that there are a really good amount of trichomes on this butt and you know being that this is dna genetics which um you know is being grown at the copper state farms facility this is definitely a lot better bud than we are used to seeing comparatively speaking to you know the regular copper state farms bud so definitely a good uh representation of this o.g cush phenotype okay so what did you think of the recon kush by dna genetics let me know in the comments below honestly i gotta tell you that under that macro lens this stuff really is not bad looking at all it's it's pretty darn good looking herb for the most part i think where it gets me um was just that uh that auto trim machine you know not being hand trimmed that just really crushes it um but there are definitely some good redeeming qualities about this bud and there's definitely areas where it needs some work and i want to talk about those with you guys so i want to start by talking about the looks bag or jar appeal of this stuff but before i get into this i want to go ahead and give you guys my rundown how i do all of these strain reviews is out of 10. so on a scale from zero being the worst 10 to the absolute best i break this stuff down to four different categories the look smell taste and potency or how effective this medicine is i'll sign up to 2.5 points each in each of those respective categories we'll tally up the total at the end and then i'll give you guys my final rundown and thoughts on the recon cushier by dna genetics now i will tell you anything seven or above is going to get my thumbs up dank stamp of approval anything seven or below will not and if it does get seven or above i will tell you if i'd go back and pick this strain up again so um let's start again by talking about the looks or bag or jar appeal of this stuff so i'm gonna bring it up on the screen one last time for you guys to look at then we'll go ahead and get into my final thoughts okay so you've seen it multiple times i don't think i really need to harp on the looks too terribly much here i think the thing with this stuff is for me where it loses is that i think the actual size of the trichomes themselves could be a tiny bit bigger it is really really covered in try calms i'm not gonna lie about that but the auto trim the trim on this stuff it just looks this is like the quintessential look of bud that's been run through an auto trim machine the other thing is is the fact that the majority of the jar consisted of these popcorn buds you know the the pic the butt that i had in the picture was the nicest looking nug and that's the one that i broke off the uh buds from um to smoke today and i i really i'm telling you i bet you if this stuff wasn't run through an auto trimmer it would be a perfect 2.5 out of 2.5 but because the inside of the bud is riddled with trichomes i mean there are trichomes all over the inside of this bud but it's a 2.0 out of 2.5 for me from the looks now the smell there's just no smell here and even after i ground it up there was just a subtle bit of sweetness a little bit of like spicy there's definitely a tiny bit of the pine from like a kush but that's really it and it's so hard i'm like going searching for those flavors even um maybe a tiny bit nutty um but the smell is just not there and it's not like it smells bad or anything like that but it really needs a lot of work in the smell department it's going to be a 1.0 out of 2.5 for me in the smell uh let's get to the taste now you know this bug did not have a really a lot of terpenes in it it just didn't but it was smooth so the actual process of puffing it was was smooth and it was sweet and there was a little bit of creaminess there and kind of that nuttiness that i was explaining before a tiny tiny bit of pine um in the flavor department but it was soon as you had some taste it was just gone and it didn't like die prematurely like it went to flower uh you know burnt flour too prematurely or anything like that so the flavor did hold it was there but like there's just not a whole hell of a lot of flavor so it's only going to be a 1.5 out of 2.5 in the taste and honestly i think that's being generous i really do think this is between a 1 and a 1.5 in the uh taste department now in the potency right after i finished puffing this i was like it's an absolutely a 1.5 1.5 1.5 however as i was started back in to do the review and just before i cut uh to show you guys this bud one last time i was really noticing my head getting hazy um i was kind of and i am i'm struggling for you know to find the right words usually i know exactly what i'm going to say i'm ready to go i'm flowing but this has really kind of put me in like a bit of a haze and a cloudy haze like i wouldn't be doing anything that needs your uh you know utmost concentration and focus because if you're trying to do something like very meticulous with your hands or something where you really need to concentrate uh and you need that extra brain power this is gonna suck that brain power right away from you so this would be like you know going for a walk or doing something where your mind can just kind of wonder but to be honest it's not really an uplifting strain i mean i'm pretty chilled out this is definitely staying true to that eighty percent indica 20 uh sativa so i'm really honestly i'm kind of i'm enjoying this medicine it did get me medicated it didn't get me like all the way knockout but like this stuff absolutely is potent and it's no surprise i mean if it's testing out at 22.42 anything i said it a million times anything 20 to 21 22 you know and up is really gonna be some potent medicine so yeah it might not be the most potent i've ever had but i'm definitely going to give it the benefit of the doubt in the potency department and give it a 2.0 in the potency um it's really it's effective and it's very hazy it's very cloudy this stuff is not uh something again you want to be probably doing before work or enjoying before work so for those of you who have been paying attention it is a 2.0 in the look it's a 1.0 in the uh uh smell excuse me a 1.5 in the taste and a 2.0 in the potency this stuff is going to be a 6.5 it was so so close um to getting my dank thumbs up approval but it is just not there and i mean listen for 40 dollars for an eighth you could spend an extra five ten bucks maybe even and get some really good high quality medicine i don't think this stuff is on the level i do think the effects are there and you know it for as fresh as it is it's pretty damn dry this stuff crumpled up really really um fast when i ground it up so yeah i don't know you know i wouldn't probably go rush out for any dna genetics um but as an ftp for like a freebie this was definitely a good freebie and you know it's really um some of the best state that i uh excuse me some of the best flower i've seen out of that copper state facility so i'm kind of shocked um that the dna genetics is definitely uh you know a nice step up but yeah really lacking in the terps really lacking in the uh the taste so uh let me know what do you guys think have you tried the recon kush let me know in the comments below and then let me know what you want to see me review as well and until the next one please take good care of yourself and one another and i look forward to seeing you guys soon peace", "TDmISpUqBaw": "yeah alright another video from JP's herb museum here's my collection met

McNasty here hope all is well if not I hope you get well and stay well and the thing one thing is I really do hope that I really do hope all is well and if not I hope you get well and stay well I've been saying that for some years now man because I really do believe it and I really want everybody to be good good spirits good mental health good physical health to some clients out there I know I know I know I know and I'm working on the issue and to those to those that don't know what I'm talking about my issue is with these rooms I've been running different strains and I've been doing mostly testing strains and at times that I should be flowering out for bigger yields to take care of more people but I've been testing a lot of strains and now I have narrowed it down I got rid of about seven strains out of my entire operation to to really narrow it down to what I want to do and what I want to use for future crosses and everything like that this room is a 10 by 10 room and I'm using about I'm using about I would say about 5 by nine about five by nine feet of canopy I got about 10 18 18 plants in there and a five by nine I'm using 2000 watts of just regular HPS bulbs I had metal halides in there for a minute somebody said are you doing it too late and some are trying to tell me something we're not showing [ __ ] like this and then it's like they still want to say something but you really can't say anything you know it's none you can say this wrong imma show you a lot of things in here I'm off try to focus more on my line on my citrus splits because it's my [ __ ] and I'm not trying to pump you up or anything how did this whole ruin the most beautiful plant to me in here is the black cherry punch but that has a lot to do with the size of the bud as you can see and the color of the color purple and green I mean it was more beautiful on a plant than that nothing it's not more beautiful internet having purple and green on your [ __ ] plan that's why people always try to use strains and everyone a half color because it's a bag of peel that sells a lot more it does better and when you see your strains okay maybe I'm the only person let me come to go through this okay so say say you look at its strength all these strains are like it's so close in genetic makeup is ridiculous because there's been so many crosses and bad crosses that a lot of things resemble each other so when you find something that doesn't resemble anything you can use you sometimes most likely have a winner you know so with something like this right here this is black cherry punch but well something that looks like this put in a bag you're not gonna have any complaints as long as it tastes good and gets you hard it doesn't have to be the strongest it doesn't have to be the most flavorful but you could look at this plant you can look at it and already taste the fruit flavor in your mouth you know it's gonna have that fruit flavor in your mouth right so that's what color does to me when I see color I think of like a fruity tasteful flan and I just want to know like do you guys feel the same way about that like when you see a I gotta say you see like a green green plant you know it's like a Kim dog oh gee some kind of gas you know me some sour or some kind of gas I'm kind of it's gonna had a door it's gonna have that weird fruit taste like not a bad not bad as weird but like a different kind of fruit really bad at coming up with sayings for that type of [ __ ] you know like the Strawberry Shortcake ray you see it's green but you also see it door can you see it turning purple so we know it's a fruit the fruit in it is strawberry so but all the strawberries they're gonna turn a little color this VIN emoji I don't know what the [ __ ] let me look that up real quick because this vin emoji right here has the color but it smells nothing like fruit it smells like straight gas it smells like that Oh Dida that she's looking for [Music] okay so the vin emoji this is a beautiful plan may have come from home on both seeds it's the indica dominant cross between poison OG and rare dankness number one so has an aroma of skunk pine lemon diesel but it still has the purple and that fruit is whoop dilemma so all purple like to me i really think that all purple implants is gonna have that fruit taste that smack your lips you know that point you know I'm saying and this right here coming up is these citrus splits man you said your split starting to get a little color and I was coming from that sherbert line that's coming from that daddy at a sour bananas sherbert you know you got the banana and the sherry got a look you got flavors in there gonna be a [ __ ] to trim so I'm not really looking towards this Fino as a keeper I really like I really hope it's not a keeper because I don't want to be trimming that type of [ __ ] I know that sounds crazy as hell but I can only be honest with myself I hate trim it I do not like sitting there playing with the weed and chopping it all up because when I see like like these three okay you know this is one plant these ones is one of the ones that I think is going to be a keeper just because of the frost production the smell the aroma the hardiness like he got hard and this is his final week probably like the final ten days I probably let it go one more week so not this Sunday but next Sunday for a whole total of 70 days I'm pretty sure that's gonna be 70 days you just got 56 that's yeah that's gonna be a total of 70 days I'm gonna try to take this whole room 270 days because I think that's what it's gonna meet no snot sees or anything right there don't worry about that that's the little hair it's like a little bundle of hairs really close to each other a little bundle of orange hairs like a little group meeting saying like damn [ __ ] done now how you feeling I'm hot too and we should stick together you know I'm saying but look at look at her this is this is citrus bliss this is what you're getting if you got your packs man if you got those tester packs I gave out you bought some from the website which I do encourage everybody to do the support goes a long way for the channel and keeps me motivated and sharing things and look at it so this is like some of the citrus blitz had a little purple in there also and you know we can only wait and see what's going to happen I'm actually going to stand out for these to be tested at the end of the harvest I think look at it see which one's really catch my eye and I really like and then send those are fast testers so probably will have about eight out of ten or seven out of the ten strange fee knows that I'm running for testers [Music] yes oh the citrus bliss is really like it's really amazing oh I'm honestly happy about it I didn't get a chance to run into a lot of splits yet just because I've been doing so much other [ __ ] and I ranch a lot other to death past few years I've been a lot of 45 so I kind of know what structuring what I'm looking at but this was something totally new to me so that's why I'm more infatuated with the citrus bliss and once you smell it you'll understand exactly what I mean that smell is like it's something that if you had a whole bag of you'll just keep inhaling like you you want to rub that [ __ ] over you for Cologne and it's a beautiful smelling plan look at her it's glassy man I stopped in perfect health and what I'm saying about the some guy said I had Powder Mill doing 1 minute and 32 seconds saw the last video order video before last I'm not sure and I told him that that was my cell phone light flashed I was my cell phone flash you know cuz the flash was on the cell my cell phone pinpoints it on certain areas so he just caught a little glimpse and he caught a glimpse of some frost I was running along the side of it and he's like that's p.m. and I'm like you know just calm down brother you know I mean out of all this good good good sexiness in his room you try to pick a single point in time and tell me that I got p.m. when it's my video in my room and I know that is nothing going on in my room that was really that was really shocking to hear I didn't like that man like that at all so I told him about it so he text me back and said yeah it's right there is frost on the Sun its p.m. on a Sun I look at these leaves right here look at all these trichomes on the side of that [ __ ] leaf man that's not what p.m. grows deme okay that's not what p.m. grows p.m. grows in the middle of the main stem like the middle of the main vein on the leaf that's what p.m. grows that it congregates they're not on the sides you see something on the side of that leaf that's [ __ ] frost man stop Hayden alright stop Hayden ask a question don't just say it's there and argue me about it this is mine it's mine this is my platform this is my channel no it's my [ __ ] I don't like that you they respect my [ __ ] but just don't get on here I'm serious about it I'm really serious about my crash this is what I think of day in and day out this is what I fascinate over this is what I obsess over I'm really serious about my [ __ ] nothing you but you see that girl hat right there she had a wig on that [ __ ] was flaring out like Donald Trump hit it man citrus places a frosty [ __ ] but the most beautiful planet here I would have to say is two of my citrus bliss phenols and the black cherry punch no matter which one in house did a great job with this I can't be biased about it they just want they just masters that they [ __ ] I love running the genetics hard as [ __ ] hard as [ __ ] man these buds are super dense and they still ready to go and I'm ready to go too so until later peace", "oPcQs0-r2_k": "[Music] what I've got here this is a butt of something called cherry punch and it's from the care company and we've been looking to try new things from the Cure company and I found this at the cannabis cafe down on La Brea and it was I was down there with some friends and I picked out three flowers and this is one of the three this flower has 20% THC and as I went through those menus I really picked this because I want to try more flowers from a cure company cure company did marathon OG and that's a top ten flower in LA Nipsey Hussle wouldn't be proud if he was around that flower is all that just fantastic but today this is about cherry punch from the Cure company and you can see that it comes in this jar and it says cherry punch hybrid and care company exclusive and also it comes a nice gift box if you wanted to give it to someone that has all the information on it says all the THC amount and this flower has 20% THC but we know it's not all about the THC sometimes a 20% flower can just knock you on your socks and run some of those have 22% in there just to kill her but today it's about a cherry punch and you can see I've got it set to 3:30 I've got a bunch of vape in the straw so let's check out cherry punch by cure company so this is one sweet flower if you like sweet this is almost so sweet anyone would like this it's not over sweet for me you know a lot of the flavor flowers have an orange it's too orange this one I would say it's sweet like a cherry it's really sweet and this flower strong too and it's got a nice clear head and it's a cruiser and I like this flower and I'm giving this flower and 865 it didn't quite make the 9 but I'm recommending cherry punch if you want to try the Cure company cherry punches a winner this is the doctor if you want to see vapour cup you can see it on paper cup calm I'm telling you if you get this item you will just be so satisfied everyone that gets it spills like that they're like it's a game changer and it is this is game-changing technology it's like going from alcohol to a

"okay so once again jake salesman blue caller outdoors today we got a new load a new gun and an aftermarket choke in it stay tuned stay tuned okay so we've been testing the rogue 410 today this is a 410 three inch 27 32nd ounces of nine shot traveling 1100 feet per second now this is not a new york legal load rogue only offers nines at this point in time as you guys know this load just hit the market jebs the owner jebs designed this so we will be putting this through jeb's chokes as well today i got my little toy gun out here the rossi turkey as you guys know that you have this there ain't nothing to it mine is the polymer receiver hammer it's not all steel so this thing weighs like three pounds we've shot it with the factory choke today and now what we're doing is just installed my pattern master code black turkey this is a 383 constriction and we gauge pinned it so we know it's right there i have this gun set up as a budget setup i got a forty dollar fee archie red dot on here i have one on my 20 gauge actually this is the newer version so this is a true budget setup so we're going to put this rogue 40 yards if we shoot the left target we're trying two pieces of cardboard wide because we've noticed the height it's not very open you get your flyers in the width so we're gonna try it for this test and see how it looks and then if we don't like it we'll go back to the four but so let's get right to it i got my red dot pretty much dialed in uh i haven't shot it with the code black turkey so there might be some difference because as you guys know with reflex sights different loads different chokes they shoot differently so that's why you always sight in with what you're going to take a field choke wise and load wise so you know you're dead money it's all about being ethical as a hunter so here we go we've got the sandbags today i know these things kick hard but we just don't need the lead sled for them you know what i mean we gotta break in the shoulder sometime you know what to me so here we go let's kill that turkey at 40 yards left target we got the rossi turkey cold black turkey from patternmaster 383 and we got rogues ammunition they say to leave the pack we're testing if that's a good decision or not let's get it also before i shoot i sighted this in with lead loads and it ejected fine i've shot two straight turkey loads of this gun both of them jammed right in the chamber drop a comment below if you guys have a rossi is this a common thing or will it break in i just i need to know more because if i'm going to take this to kentucky i want to make sure my shell ejects so just drop a comment below let me know if that's something you see or if that's not an issue for you maybe i just got to break it in i don't know so drop a comment below but whether this ejects or not we're killing that turkey let's go there we go zoom it out see this is exactly what i'm talking about it gets jammed in there just like that it's three for three in a row now i just not a fan of that at all just drop a comment below let me know if this is something that you guys have been seeing and uh we'll figure it out but let's go check this pattern out i aim to touch right because my red dot was shooting right and this just proves my point with the pattern master in it shot dead true to where i was aiming so now i know my red dot's good to this choke and this load so that's why sight in with what you're gonna hunt with that way you're truly sighted in let's go check this target okay so this is my first time shooting the rossi with an aftermarket choke at 40 yards my first impression of this which we are going to test this side by side is my stevens with that code black turkey blows this rossi out of the water granted i have not shot the rogue out of the stevens that's coming shortly but just knowing what my stevens does with all the loads with that code black turkey it's not a comparison between the stevens and the rossi we will put them side by side like i said but man that's stevens it just shoots good i'll tell you so let's look at this pattern so as you can see my core is actually a little low and a little right like i said you got to sight in with what you're hunting with i do think we should have went with the four cardboard to get to everything because i know there's hits down here we will be reverting back to the full coverage of the pallet for this we just figured that knowing what our 410s can do with our chokes outside of outside of the rossi we don't need the four but with the rossi and the code black turkey i uh at least with the rogue this is more open i mean granted guys this is your core you do have a lot of hits here it didn't shoot bad it'll kill your turkeys at 40. if you bring this up you're killing them but just knowing how that steven shoots i look at this and it's it's a letdown when it comes down to pattern and your guns the relationship between the choke and the gun and the load it's got a jive right for it to shoot good i don't think something in this setup didn't jive we're gonna be testing that rossi with the cbt with a lot of loads so we'll see we'll see what load it likes and we'll roll with it but as far as this once moose zooms out to the full pattern here you can see i got a lot of flyers over here there's nothing in there i know i had flyers down here but it most of the pattern is right here it's just more open than what we're used to seeing so something in this relationship didn't quite get along but needless to say you put that dead money you're killing turkeys with the setup it's just not the best that we've seen out of a 410 it's just not but we got a lot to test with that rossi it's new to the channel and we're going to be testing this hardcore we'll find what she likes you know that so as i said rossi's new to the channel we're going to be testing that thing in depth we're going to be putting it against factory and the pattern master with a lot of loads we're going to be testing the rossi versus the stevens with a bunch of different choke combinations and load combinations we're going to test these 410s hardcore i want to see if the stevens just flat out shoots better than the rossi or if the rossi's just got to find that right setup so this is just a start we got a lot more coming with the rossi i i'm still thinking it's going to shoot all right we got a lot of tests with it so it's too early to tell but guys if you haven't yet make sure to smash the thumbs up button if you're new to the channel welcome to blue collar outdoors this is what we do here it's honest no [ __ ] testing nothing in the outside can tell us what to say here as you can see here i shoot for pattern master and that's not an ideal pattern right there i mean it'll kill you turkeys but i want better so i'm going to find that perfect setup with that pattern master in that rossi it's just not the rogue we'll figure it out but guys subscribe hit

podcast when you're lying in bed for five days chris so that's why we had to skip it but while i was uh recovering in bed you and the gear the gang at plant life uh have been very busy especially with some new stores yeah that's right dino i'm actually down in calgary right now i'm here to help support uh we're opening a new store in southeast calgary uh in the mahogany uh area uh it's a big beautiful store uh opening on january 27th uh pretty exciting i'm pretty pretty pumped to kind of see uh i guess this would be my first uh plant life store opening um got a great staff already great manager there um super excited to see where it goes indeed the the plant life stores uh popping up all over the place and that is good to hear and i'm sure more expansion on the way uh in some other spots and and i'm really excited to be able to take a look at this cultivar that we're doing today black cherry punch an indica dominant hybrid and uh i i i'm excited because i like uh the uh the lp that it comes from it's a figure so let's talk a little bit about figure and especially who the parent company is uh with this uh this cannabis company that in my opinion seems to be on a rising track yeah no doubt dean uh so the parent company is uh pixis international uh and they're a global agricultural company with uh over over 145 years experience of delivering value added products and services to businesses and customers so very dialed in on the agricultural side of things um figure is their their cannabis uh region uh part of the company there and it's uh figures a handcrafted homegrown cannabis company um they grow cannabis with the the character of of fifth generation homegrown farmers and the integrity of a fully verifiable source uh to market tracking system so it's pretty much it's a combination of a farm wisdom crossed with modern scientific rigor uh it's very cool to see um and i'm a big fan of seeing the kind of the the farming industry get into cannabis i think that's it just feels right uh finger was founded in uh in 2017 uh by then president and ceo edwin jarrell uh in charlottetown prince edward island um so they're out of pei and uh it started out as a small family venture and uh and that turned into the big cannabis beast that it is today um presently the company is run by their current ceo harvey carroll and uh harvey comes from a background of 25 years of experience in the the food and alcohol industry and he works out of their head office in toronto wow so uh some pretty solid growth uh to use uh the the term of uh the industry um this is a company that you know as you've mentioned kind of started small and now is you know really taking off so tell us a little bit about you know the history of their growth and and kind of where they're working out of now yeah for sure dean so yeah this company uh figures start out with four employees uh now they have upwards of close to 200 employees some seasonal employees depending on on harvest and stuff but i mean four to two hundred that's that's some serious serious growth um the facility in prince edward island is called canada's island garden and it's uh it's over three hundred thousand square feet uh it's six football fields pretty much just picture picture them right next to each other so a whole lot of growing space there um they use led lighting which keeps the energy costs down and it's good for the environment they use rainwater which is recycled a computerized system to monitor the data and they also use natural air ventilation too we grow in hydroponically too which is uh a real nice way to soillessly grow your cannabis um they also have a smaller uh facility in simcoe ontario it's about 20 000 square feet and it's named uh the gold leaf farm and um recently the the company they they added an option uh to to for expansion of upwards of seven hundred thousand square feet uh because they acquired the 20 acres of land adjacent to this facility so um right now that's kind of their small facility for right now uh with the you know [ __ ] if they need to expand uh they've got the room to do it pretty cool uh that's that's awesome i love those stories of uh somebody starting small you know not that if you have the resources to start big that's a there's anything wrong with that as long as you can maintain that and unfortunately we've seen a lot of companies that haven't been able to do that and these guys are going the other way starting small doing it right and building properly and they also have uh i guess a unique labeling system with their cultivars don't they yeah dean they do so when figure first came to market uh they were uh a number system so you would come in the number seven the number fourteen the number eight uh and they kind of represented different cultivars uh it wasn't on the packaging you kind of had to like look into a little bit um i think that they kind of they heard from from people saying you know what we want to know what we're smoking we want to know what the cultivars are uh and they pivoted they switched and uh they switched over to the the curated collection of the go series um and so there's you know five different i guess uh vibes on on how you want to feel uh and it's it's uh easy there's a chill there's steady which is what the black cherry punch is under that's under the go steady uh there's also play and there's elevate those are a couple of sativa dominant ones um let me just say it's kind of nice to see the different vibes uh but still see the cultivar there as well i feel like they kind of got that one right a lot of a lot of lps are you know going with just a vibe only uh i like they've got a vibe and there's a i guess a family of cultivars within that vibe i could not agree more i mean it's like they saw what some people were doing and they were doing a pretty good job and they perfected it because they have the vibe but then the actual cultivar that maybe you're familiar with and you're like oh yeah i know about that but maybe i didn't know about this one so you're right i think they're i think they're as charlie sheen once said winning on uh this one uh quite a bit uh with with that system uh so so bravo to that uh with their their different vibes and their different collections and also bravo to them for the figure fund tell us about that yeah this is really cool uh so every month figure they take nominations um uh for a bypoc uh owned business uh bypass the black or indigenous with people of color um so by pac-owned businesses once they've selected a business uh to support uh they will purchase products or services from from that company and and actually have the company distribute it to the community around them so uh very cool initiative uh i think it's a lot of good in inter promotion too i feel like um the companies involved are gonna uh you know benefit from that in in the the time to come uh and they do a new business every month too um so it's super super cool to see uh i'm a big fan of you know cannabis companies we know they make money um but it's nice to see them you know giving back or supporting the communities i uh i think that's awesome too um and you know as we were kind of looking at the uh the website you can just see um there's a lot of good information on it they're doing a lot of really good things so so bravo to these guys for sure but when it comes to the website and you can check it out at www.figr.com they have something very cool um i'm not gonna say they're the the only ones or it's like the the the first ever uh with with products but i've i haven't seen this uh with cannabis products so tell us a little bit about how you can actually track uh you know i'm i'm holding this in my hand i can track exactly uh the the right almost every detail about this batch chris yeah buddy it's crazy so it's it's called the scentsy uh track and trace system and it's something that uh you know figure offers to to make them stick out a little bit compared to the other lp's uh each figure product comes with a lot number it's right on the front of the jar and on their website uh there's a spot right on the home page where you can actually put that lot number in there it is uh and you can you can choose on the right there if you've got a numbered product or a go product and it'll actually uh bring up a whole lot of info on that specific batch of the canvas that you got in your hands um you can see how it was grown uh where it was grown uh they even have a coa so certificates of an analysis are on there uh and it's got a full breakdown of of the terpene uh profile in it uh as well as uh you know pesticides tests and um just like a full full deal of info this is like one of my favorite websites that i've kind of come across in the canvas industry for for information i think they they just nailed it yeah this is the best website i've seen uh hands down i i think that for information uh we were looking at some of the colors uh everything uh you know i've i've talked ad nauseam about uh you know cannabis companies trying to stand out in a world where you're not allowed to do any promotion or advertising really colors are a big thing in doing that and they they nail that but you can't just have all sizzle and no steak and they have the information so bravo to these guys check out the website and they even have an app where you can scan uh your lot number and stuff so uh to me it's the best website for a combination of uh the information but it also is visually very appealing and we haven't always seen that we've seen sometimes how websites have one but not the other and and this is very eye-catching as is the cannabis uh that we're going to get to right now so the history of black cherry punch uh lay down the lineage on us for sure dean so it's across a black cherry pie crossed with purple punch uh so two two real delicious delicious cultivars they're crossed in to make a super delicious skin uh very tasty yeah uh within the black cherry pie we've got black cherry soda crossed with a uh 501st og uh and then the the purple punch is a larry og crossed with the granddaddy perps um so a couple of ogs in there and then a couple of real kind of uh flavorful fruity cultivars so it's a really good mix so the the 501st og and the larry og are are those two um you know coming from the same family tree sort of thing that have just been you know something else added to take them in a different direction um yeah i mean og kush is is is in both uh for sure um but i mean it's it's the both kind of have very uh different kind of uh processes on on how they got to the laryogy and the the five hole first all right well i i know this is one of your favorites because of the gdp in this and i know you love uh gdp if everybody if anybody's ever looking to get chris uh any kind of cannabis gifts just come to me because i know some of the favorites and i know gdp is one of yours it oh my god it is it's uh that's one where um when a lot of people come in and they they ask me a question in store you know what's i want to relax i want to feel good i want to have just a nice chill evening like um they're not too educated they don't know to to too much i always try and let's start with the gdp it's not too intense uh just a super amazing cultivar uh created by one of my cannabis heroes ken estes the medicine man um so just just legendary stuff there uh but uh yeah i was just gonna say about like uh uh the the gdp is amazing but uh the the black cherry punch that we have was was initially bred by um the elite cannabis breeders in-house genetics and they're out of the usa uh and they've got uh 63 unique cultivars that i came across on the seed finder website there wow really cool names uh that i i've never heard of before uh afghanimal uh blue nana uh cherry gorilla uh daddy map um and there was there's even one called customer service a cultivar it's called customer service uh it's it's a girl scout cookies crossed with an allen wrench well hey you can't you you could fix anything with an allen ranch so uh that uh that works out and uh i love that i love afghanimal i i think i might have to i think i might have to get like name my next cannabis accessory and afghanimal or something like that i think that is absolutely uh awesome uh okay so this is 23.4 percent and we'll tell you where that kind of fits on on our level but what's in a name do you think chris so with the with the black cherry punch it's a genetics name uh we've got the the black cherry pie so the black cherry and we've got the purple punch so you got the punch um i think two with the the black cherry uh is is is a flavor name with the sweetness of it um but that's that's pretty much kind of just the basic genetics and flavor name dean alrighty now we get to the look and start with the packaging a standard tub but at least it's not white i think that you know stands out if you're you know in a store and you're looking for something to display that's going to catch people's eyes a little bit more it was sealed there was no humidity pack so i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna grate if you have a humidity pack you get bonus points uh if you don't uh it's unfortunate you should but i will say despite there not being a humidity pack this was in great shape uh it was in phenomenal shape the only thing i worry about is you know i have purchased not this company but uh different types of cannabis that have been uh a year and a half old and i'm not saying the humidity pack is going to make it great but it could help having said that this stuff is in phenomenal shape chris yeah big time man um i got some stuff last week and the week before i'm a big fan of the uh um what i've seen uh really really nice uh well-tripped nugs um some smaller size which i am totally good with uh no leaves at all just real dense nugs uh color wise we've got you know the darker green buds for sure with some purple flecks in the bud and and some some real nice bright orange pistols um kind of my my favorite thing about the look though is the the dusting of trichomes i think it's it's quite frosty uh looks super nice um yeah i was very impressed when i when i first cracked my my first jar of the figure black cherry yeah it uh it's in great shape uh you know feel wise like when you touch it it's spongy and sometimes i get a little bit leery when i see small buds and no humidity back because they can be dry and this one sponge perfect it was it's sponge worthy to quote seinfeld it was absolutely awesome and um in the trim job as you mentioned the trim job is just you know some of the best like you know you're going to take some stems out as you're going but there was like no leafs it was just uh it was you're one of the best trim jobs that i've seen in quite a long time so bravo to them um this is a terrific shaped cannabis uh this is what this is what when you pay the money for your cannabis and get home you are totally satisfied i don't i don't know how anybody could say anything negative about uh this uh this batch of cannabis in my opinion mm-hmm well sad dean i i completely agree with you uh yeah like i said i've been a big big fan i've gotten quite a few jobs already and the pre-rolls two are nice as well they come in a real slick um kind of tin packaging awesome i'm looking forward to that all right let's talk about the terpene profile with uh black cherry punch yeah for sure so we got limonene that's our dominant terpene and that's going to be kind of a citrus fruity uh aroma and flavor uh kerryoffalene is number two and that's uh black pepper and spice and then we got linalool as number three and that's kind of a floral lavender uh flavor and aroma there so um cool thing about the chirps for i guess this this particular uh um know your buds is uh like we we know specifically on the batch that that that you had there uh these are the dominant uh terpenes yeah yeah you can look up uh as we did uh from from the batch and uh i'm just gonna list them off uh so as we mentioned limonene is point three six uh percent caryophyllene point two two linoleum 1.8 and then mercene is the the fourth one at 1.3 so it's amazing it gives you lists like this is total transparency and this is what the consumer wants right um especially people that are very new to cannabis and maybe don't know anything that it was other than it was illegal and maybe shady and uh well this pulls back the curtain right this shows you everything that this is certified to be and is and this is what's going to bring other people in and speaking of new people give us a run through of what a terpene is for maybe some of the new listeners and viewers we've picked up in 2021 yeah for sure dean so terpenes are they're aromatic oils they secrete from the cannabis glands and they make your cannabis uh smell or taste a certain way so when you got bud like uh you know lemon skunk or something super citrusy uh limonene is gonna be um probably one of the more dominant terpenes in there um with terpenes there's you know the smell and the taste and the flavor uh there can also be some some effects that you can kind of uh receive from from terpenes now everyone is different everyone our bodies all react differently to cannabis as we all have different biologies but um there are some generalizations where you know some i guess limonene for example is is known to be a bit uplifting whereas mercy could be a bit more sedative a bit more heavy bit more into the couch um but again those are generalizations i mean uh terpenes and cannabis affect everyone differently uh but with the terpenes is comes into the into play the entourage effecting and that's thc cbd and your terpenes all combined together to give you the desired effect of the cannabis yeah and we're finding out more and more and they even have the the uh the cannabinoids listed on uh those coas on the website so uh great information from you and great information from figure as well so what did you smell when you uh cracked open your batch the first time so for me initially earthy and spicy uh right off the hop uh for sure uh and then and then i definitely got like a kind of a sweet almost candy-like uh smell i'm kind of trying to realize it if maybe the name is kind of giving me a bit of that placebo effect like thinking of the um coke bottles like those black cherry cola bottles uh but i i definitely got earthy spicy and sweet for sure um yeah i uh the first thing i thought of when i opened it and i kind of think i'm a little bit uh the same with you kind of maybe um influenced by the name a little bit but i smell black forest cake and sort of the cherries that that go in that right away i will tell you though after the grind and i think that's also something that's important for people smell your cannabis before you grind it up and smell it after because you know things get molecules get released and things like that but i got a real real strong floral uh smell that wasn't as prevalent before that was really really there after the grind so i think that's also another you know we talk about putting your cannabis under a light and looking at it a little bit uh smelling it before and after the grind i think can uh can bring out some different flavor smells as well too yeah i uh that's become i guess a part of my my ritual now dean uh it wasn't before uh now when i when i you know prepare a joint uh i will smell my grinder uh because you do get some some extra extra notes in there once once it is ground up so highly recommend everyone check that out do it on your own uh you will notice the difference all right what about the taste test what do you get from this so taste test for me uh it was definitely earthy on woodsy um and on the exhale it's kind of like a citrus fruity sweetness uh coming out again made me think of those coke bottles delightful it tastes delightful in my opinion dean i think uh i i definitely got the uh the earthy and the uh the sweetness on the exhale uh i'm just waiting for the old uh supernova volcano hybrid to uh fire up and uh i will get another taste at it but uh certainly uh the earthy taste was very prominent um and and i was expecting more of the floral taste and it's it's there but it's more kind of like that fruity sweetness uh that you talk about what about your experience i know you've had a lot of experience lately because you've been a big fan of this but you know what's the what and and as we should point out as you did everybody is different but what was your experience like right so in my experience as super relaxing very soothing on the body um the initial heist is more so on the body to start and then i i kind of there's a steady head buzz throughout um makes me smile a lot i i get i got in a really good mood when i smoke the blackberry punch i find it to be very balanced uh with the head and the body maybe a slight edge to the body but there is some real nice head effects to it um yeah like like i said i've been i've been a big big fan of it uh i feel like i sold a lot of it too people come in asking for something tasty um here's what i like the safety um and it's super smooth to smoke too that was worth i guess bringing up uh super smooth right to the filter uh i appreciate that a lot well i could tell you uh i haven't been uh doing a lot of uh smoking why i've been doing any smoking and uh vaping uh since i you know came down uh with pneumonia last week and this is like you know one of the first days that i've tried this and and you're right and i'm taking very very small because i'm not fully recovered but very uh very very smooth especially in the the vape form so i could totally concur with that and as mentioned everybody is a little bit different but we do like to make sort of some general recommendations of who what and when this might be good for based on our experiences with it so who what and when what do you got so who it's good for intermediate smokers uh don't jump into the black cherry punch if you're new to cannabis uh just the thc levels are a bit on the high side anything 20 plus you don't just want to dive right into uh when it's good for for me it's an all day cultivar i i like it all day uh i think it's best in the evening time uh but i definitely have started some some days off with uh with the black cherry punch and uh you know found myself still motivated i still got stuff done uh maybe a little bit slower than normal but uh you know with a big smile on my face so that was great uh what it's good for is chilling out getting your relax on it's really nice for that uh it's great for right after work uh even right after dinner i i definitely was a big fan of it then um kind of right when you get in you know take your shoes off put your keys on the counter you know jack it off what am i gonna smoke i think the black cherry punch is a really good option for that it just puts you in a right right mood and i think it's great too for for uh watching sports uh i i watched some nhl games uh with it it was awesome um yeah for sure well if you can watch the oilers and still enjoy it because of black cherry punch then there's at least a bonus because there's not there haven't been a lot to enjoy with the oilers uh this year so there's a bonus to that and you know what i think you made a really good point that we should bring up is that you know this is an indica dominant hybrid but it's still something that you can use during the day i think you know there's a there's a bit of a push on and we changed the this segment from what's that strain to know your buds because we're going with cultivar over strain there's a lot of people that want to get rid of sativa indica hybrid i i still think we can have those words as long as we educate people that not every indica is going to make you fall asleep and not every sativa is going to make you talk uh you know as fast as possible or whatever so there's definitely some in-betweens and and it's great to know that this is an indica dominant hybrid that is good during the day yeah yeah totally dean it was uh like start the day off with his independent hybrid you're good i i didn't take any naps i didn't turn into a zombie i had some really good days awesome all right really good days ahead for uh people in the plant life family you guys are excited about it and the consumer will be as well yeah dino we're launching a new membership program soon and it's actually going to be called the plantlife family uh where uh our our guests that come come to the plant life stores uh we're gonna be able to uh you're gonna have an app on your phone that uh and there'll be kind of like a point system there and it's uh just real exciting uh kind of pumped to get it launched here uh i've got to see a little beta version of it and uh it looks very cool i'm excited to like use it once it's up and running and i guess another thing too with our plant life family is uh all of our instagrams uh for all of our stores all the instagram accounts have been kind of set up they're all uh running um and i've been i've had texts from friends been asking me you know if i've had anything to do with um you know the new instagram presence uh that we're that we're seeing from plant life lately and it's it's it's just uh all stores of uh they've all got their their accounts up now and they're posting on the regular so uh if you've got a plant life store that you go to on the regular and frequent uh check out their instagram uh page and uh you know you can see the daily deals and even on delivery days we're kind of letting people know about the new fun stuff that's coming in so uh all kinds of fun stuff happening with plant life dean that is awesome anyway any time you can connect more with the consumer and give them more information all the better thank you so much chris best of luck with the store openings we'll talk next week", "2q7uWx8vclc": "hello ladies and germs i am back floaty lady here smash that like button subscribe to my channel today we are going to be looking at some biodegradable cartridges when i started this journey about four months ago okay maybe five months ago i had to decide if i was going to be committing to needles or cartridges i bought a lot of both and in the end i decided cartridges made the most sense but one of the downsized cartridges are the plastics involved so we recently found out that black claw makes a biodegradable cartridge that we're going to test out on some silicone we also got some regular black claw cartridges so that we can test out some black cloth cartridges because i haven't tried them yet and i should [Music] so we picked up the hella fine and the hella tight three liner from black claw uh what's the difference between these two well the hella fine is going to be an eight gauge hella tight's a 12. um the weld on the hellotite is gonna be down uh closer towards the tip so you're going to get more of a tight angle at the tip and the hella fine is just a much smaller or much smaller needle so it's good for this really small detailed work that i might be doing in my upcoming project and then we picked up some nine curved mags hey that's what we got right now i'm gonna work on getting more but the website does have limited availability i noticed especially on these bio cartridges so we picked up the hello smooth 17 curved mag this is gonna be a standard cartridge so it's a 12 gauge we'll start with this hella fine three round liner companies in portland oregon grimey's company [Applause] and check out the packaging is already gonna be um more environmentally safe even on their regular cartridges it looks like it looks like some kind of cardboard recycled cardboard or something like that pretty awesome yeah so no plastic in the packaging here you can see from black claw either and this is not the bio package this is just the standard hella fine liner so we can't really peek at the we can't really peek at the needle so there it is that is their packaging so we should open one up i guess i love these boxes look at those boxes this is awesome this is a way better system all right let's check it out i'm gonna open up a hello fine liner we're gonna play with on the silicone so here's the black claw cartridge let's just give it a little wobble test i don't know maybe it's a lot of wobble and people want to probably check out what these bio cartridges look like we'll sacrifice one okay similar packaging very cool logo you got the bio logo again on this side so you know file cartridge looks like a different color here i'm not sure if the wobble test means anything but yeah they both wobble quite a bit yeah so we'll check it out does the is there any noticeable difference between this biodegradable material here not really looks like the same thing as plastic there's doesn't seem to be a weight difference it's not in the cool hot pink color here with other cartridge but not like orange but yeah anyway there it is bio cartridge it looks like the weld has like an extra plastic support there right or not plastic no that is plastic well this is bio degradable whatever but yeah it's more than the wobble test i guess um carson hill had mentioned that the weld is really what matters on these things i've got a lot of trial and error with different cartridges so it's hard to know what to look for we're finally starting to understand these things or at least what to look for in buying cartridges so it's freaking awesome can't wait to try a black claw okay we're gonna use the brass grip on the pneuma for this from the nucleus battery got some silicone here some tess silicone so i can do some trial runs with black cloth cartridges before i actually use them on my husband just curious see how they perform on there have a fine needle well the pneuma on the silicone is noticeably better i feel like i can move in different directions and stuff needle seems very steady [Music] i really like this needle i think it's going to be good can't wait to try it on actual skin but yeah it's a very steady needle it's a noticeable difference can you see it um yeah i feel like my line is definitely [Music] i love that brass grip too my hand waited [Music] [Music] our lovely little voltage conversion chart oh thank you so much hmm i just love this nucleus okay well [Music] i got a 28 3.6 stroke cam in the pneuma it's a pretty good all-around cam to use seems like again it's gonna be better to use all the options you have though yeah i'm actually a little more excited to do my silicone project than i was before now that i have the pneuma with the uh with the good cartridges here to um yeah i feel like i have a lot of precision here that it's kind of struggling with before [Music] shy [Music] [Music] [Music] almost went through there [Music] cool little liner this is the closest i've gotten to that feeling with that three round liner needle needle that we had initially i was always like using that one kept coming back to it a bunch of times it's like this one feels good what's different about this one 16 is max how fast can i pull a line probably be better in skin too [Music] so [Music] fun to play it's like real fun to play tiny tiny little thing i love it yeah i really like this needle it's not it's definitely staying in place well something it must be the weld i definitely notice the difference it's also the new meta i'm sure [Music] [Music] [Music] so super happy with the black claws three round liner here uh the hella fine it is hella fine beautiful beautiful work guys i think the weld makes this thing really steady and i can't wait to try it on skin i definitely notice a difference just on the silicone um moving more freely works awesome with my pneuma here even with the wireless battery so anyway let's try out their biodegradable cartridge now for kicks uh the only one we could get was this 17 curve mag but let's try it out so we're gonna put the biodegradable cartridge on here looks like a good fit turns well no limitations there [Music] okay so um i gotta amp up my battery a little bit to start this larger needle grouping here this battery was not enough to get it going so i can try resetting this and turning it to a higher voltage um or i can plug into my power supply let's try resetting this thing first okay so let's see how this biodegradable uh curve mag works out um so we've reset our battery here we have it set at um 14 here i'm gonna turn that back off so this should start a larger needle grouping on the pneuma [Music] still doesn't have enough punch all right well i think we'll move on to the power supply the musa so this is actually a great example of why you should invest in a stronger power supply we want with the muso toku it's our favorite design and seem to have some of the best reviews and we've been really happy with it so far so let's see how the mufo toku starts up this thing [Music] no problem there [Music] biodegradable cartridge here let's see if there's any noticeable difference [Music] wow yeah that's a nice cartridge [Music] feels really solid [Music] nice clean lines when i turn to the side with this thing [Music] so [Music] [Music] um [Music] oh it's crazy how well it's getting the black into the [Music] there's a silicone i think working on silicone is about to get a lot a lot less annoying [Music] [Music] yeah this is an awesome cartridge i think it's really good i'm really [Music] impressed [Music] doesn't it seem like i'm color packing an area pretty quickly here [Music] i had a really hard time getting the silicone to get black though before see it takes a couple passes just like skin but [Music] but it was like i don't know it wasn't getting black before so i have a combination of a lot of things here that we've changed uh so as it turns out it's probably gonna be better to work on silicone with a more efficient power supply i'm realizing that uh a lot of the time i spent on the silicone with some of the less expensive battery packs and pens and things like that i think uh i was probably doing a lot more work than i needed to yeah so that's impressive yeah no i'm super impressed with this curved mag from black claw uh i'm in love actually can we buy more of these when they get them [Laughter] we're definitely gonna get some more megs the three round liner is awesome too definitely a quality product um it's good to know that these guys care about the weld and things like that so awesome thanks black claw thank you you", "MEAWMhjwkYs": "[Music] welcome back I'm going to show you a little update on the in-house genetic stuff that we're going growling this this cycle is Fino hunt that I've been working on so right here back there we got platinum coach breath remix we got it looks like two or three different Pinos of this I'm getting three different smells three different growths this one back here seems to be a little more pushing here this one's longer not really flowering yet a little more stretched out and then we also have this you know that seems to be flour and more [Music] yeah so these are doing pretty good then this is the Platinum couch breath remix we also over here for the in-house genetics got the banana sickle we got two that made it out of the field of soil potting issue potting soil issue this one's a little bit smaller than this one but really good smells coming off of these excited to see how these go then over here oh my god this is the purple punch magnetic scoffs with the Platinum push mints there was no name that they had got a couple different be knows if shorty some long ones a couple different smells in here here's another one so these girls are all about we can have two weeks of the flower doing really well so this is what we got going on over here from house genetics so over here over on this side we got some og kb v 2.1 going on over here got a couple bigger Pinos they're starting to flower and then we also have a couple of shorter Pinos this one was a little mutant you can tell the kind of snake shorter we also got another one over here on this side the stage shorter it's not coming up through the canopy then over here we got another shorter one so not kind of a lot of variations on the ones that did make it out of the ogee kb v 2.1 kind of hard to say but as far as in-house genetics we got one more garlic cross that made it but it's getting buried by these giant plants you can check this one out this is the garlic cross with the platinum Cushman's so this is the only one that was in the mail and it's getting buried it just didn't make the cut but from the rest of the in-house genetic stuff it's coming out really good so stay tuned for another look at another breeder [Music]", "AnNLrGDgxkA": "hey guys i'm roy i'm hanging out here with my friend brandon from in-house genetics and we're going to take a look around to some of the in-house stuff that we're running out here we constantly get questions how do they perform outdoors how are they doing greenhouse boggy boon right now just with their quality hit our standard and in many cases superseded we have about 150 black cherry punch and then about 300 slurry cane so the black cherry punch in my mind has this amazing smell that a customer can smell as soon as they pop the lid off of the jar it's definitely going to hit them hard and the slurry cane has this i mean ridiculous bag appeal there's a couple that boggy boon right now is hunting and i'll let him explain that we popped some seeds of dual og and we popped some seeds of turple and we ran them and we did our final hunt and they looked so good it was impossible to choose a final winner off of our first round so what we did we're going to re-run those a second time and then we're going to do a final final hunt from those final three with some of our retail partners so if you watch us on instagram facebook or anything like that either in-house or boggy boon you'll be able to see the progress of those and when they're coming to market because they're starting right now you", "U0NyIxSNOlo": "okay hello everybody got a couple of different strains and some weed to show you the first one being a hold 35 grams of some white fire OG got my team in to pack in there to weight control to keep it fresh see it's really good stuff so that's that a complete completely full jar there and I got this one which is called cherry punch it's very good as you see it's absolutely lambaste it with trichomes and purple so among the best strain I've ever had here this stuff is super super potent it's upwards a thirty five percent THC here's a bud down here I'll show you looks great that's pretty much it just wanted to show you these two different screens got about a quarter in here and this here's about an ounce and a half it's packed to the brim good chunk of weed right there all right", "63Lnju-_oH4": "foreign [Music] what up what's good guys welcome back to another chronic close-up and man you already know what's on the agenda some more top tier

strain right here like you guys did an excellent job 100 man now even the nugs themselves they just look crazy purple they got everything that you can imagine it's probably about like 45 50 and 8. that's right on par with what type of caliber this weed is it's top tier guys shout out to 1937 man they really knocked it out of the park with this one this is crazy their other one that we picked up too the vanilla berry pie that one's super fuego too man like goddamn i recommend everybody who's watching try to get some 1937 farms the sorbetto i'm not going to tell you where i got this bro i can't because if i like if i tell you all my source you're definitely going to go buy it to go go do some hunting they definitely got a hell of different places i know that so uh evergreen market i know is the one place that'd be carrying them but overall what would you rate this i know you love those kind of lemony terps this is like super lemon candy guys i think this is one weed that both you and i could just absolutely agree that it is it is some top tier 9.7 possibly 9.8 just crazy gas all around it's got the best of both worlds a little bit of lemony a little candy in there even some diesel it's got the look it's got the feel it's got the taste it's got everything about it it's the complete package of fire ass weed like this is true cracked cannabis this is a can of sewer weed right here you know what i mean candy guys top tier guys 9.7 is what i give it 9.7 overall yeah man we got a a bunch of reviews coming you know trying to cook up some more [ __ ] in the works yep so shout out to these guys for you know providing such good weed for us to review and shout out to you guys for watching once again but uh stay tuned for the next one we'll catch you all next time peace out you", "VyKzbAXqI7s": "the - what's going on son you got another room here it's another 18 lighter got two quests - five times sulfur burner it's got max fans on the floor below and it's got all the wall mount fans we just pretty much stopped putting money into these into these rooms far as operating them and all that stuff just to basic essentials this whole room that's like on our 10 days to go this one right here is a another sugar cane yeah Moses is all sugar cane selected by I see and from in-house I believe in Houston etics and then this is a hurricane number seven this one's super fire it's like hamaji of like Hawaii it's like such a pineapple like just a Rome I did some powers of the whole room no matter what strain is in here with it it just just takes it over and it's just it's super dank it's a heavy yield or two that of like there's like 120 Caesar did it was like the number seven this one that we selected stupid stupid frosty and it's it gets even crazier than this and there still has like ten we like ten days left I mean this it crawls all the way down the fans I mean it's it's nuts beautiful fall colors it's got to replicate those seasons start hot in the beds getting a flower start tapering it down these here with old towers this one was a stretcher got some big uns on her server fire also it's gotta run through a couple more tests all Chompy all the way down nice colors coming in I guess you can talk about the oh yes these are all these are all four by eights for bait trees with the net if M there is a guy on here I thought this was mold right here this is obviously nutrient salt you know anything about anything its nutrients salt there but we're all 6x6 hugo's use the net event feeders now these net offenders they come preassembled like this so you can get this tube here in like different lengths it's like four feet what you don't need I think these are 36 inch ones yeah these are 36 inch and they come 24 inch and then 48 and should I believe and these are 1,200 mill drippers so each one of these puts out 1200 mils per hour so obviously if you know what these run consistently right there you have 2400 mills so that's all that means and these comes with these connected here so use a pressure compensating emitters that lets it pump out 12 of those you know about these or just free flow system would be super uneven all that stuff and then you know all these get different I mean different feeds for the for all different strains but uh you know in the veg they get a little a little bit of feeding you could play with it a little more I mean you know it's all it's all different though we really just got up being here and experience it no no the no the block and everything no the strain no what kind of what's gonna do take your notes you know oh yeah this is uh just another room here these are all draw Vitas leaders in here and we have some Rosalie didn't be Lux and the flux bolts those are those are pretty damn nice bulbs they were the owners and stuff it was a nice nice deal on the triumph so that's what we did and we like I'm there pretty good max pants on the floor is somewhere around the floor barber filter way up that's about it guys that's this room here we're about 10 to 12 days down from chopping her down at this one already got a snapper all right I got another ones get right up listen to his flopping all over the place look I got push the comments leave them in the box another snapper this", "9q6vvMDzCtA": "hello everyone welcome back to rose of green i hope everybody had a great holiday season and everybody has a great new year's tonight uh new year's eve tonight and i just wanted to say thanks to a couple new members um michael allen and andy c uh thanks for becoming members of the channel guys i really appreciate it it helps out with everything um today's video i'm going to show you guys what happened with the film plants uh the results to the filming along with uh show you guys the autos but uh we're going to start in here first so you can see down here i got some uh floraflex line and the floor flex three inch rings uh this is because i did plan on going away for christmas but then we got hit with another coved lockdown so i did not end up going away but what i will do is i will show you i got this floraflex line here at indoor growing canada i have the link in the description you guys could use that and you could save if you use that link and if you do not save put in the code rows of green and then you will save with that by using the link so first off i just wanted to show you guys the lines i have run here so it's floor flex line and this is on sale right now actually at indoor growing canada it's a good like rubber flexible line it's not that cheap hard hard plastic that stays all coiled up like that it actually stretches out all nicely and everything else i'll just show you what i did so this is an orbit thing off of amazon i actually prefer them over the floraflex ones because the four flex ones are hard to dial in sometimes if you don't have your lines the exact same length all the way around and uh so i like the orbit one because you could adjust them there's little screws on the top where you can adjust them so anyway i'll show you what i did here i ran it over here down the side over here don't mind the mess and then i ran it into my 25 gallon tank i got a bubbler in there you can see it in there and then the pump is down in there and it's set up on a timer so let's get back into the main flower room here okay so here we are these are the in-house genetics black cherry punch and these girls are just beautiful i'll bring you in now let me show you how nice these girls are show you here we've got a lot of different phenos i thought this one here and that one back there we're going to be the same and this one here and this one we're going to be the same uh they are kind of same these this one and that one back there are the same but these two here they seem to be two totally different uh but this one's just carrying the purple but i'll show you what i mean but uh anyway first let's move in i'll show you guys the frost on these girls just beautiful frost just really nice gear that comes from in-house genetics bring it back here and show you this one another beautiful one and then i'll show you the big difference here with this girl here you can see she's like purple and she's foxtailing again for frost she's uh real nice beautiful in fact and then this one up front i'm like i'm really impressed with this fc 6500 by mars hydro uh it's really growing some nice big nugs uh really nice dense ones as well it's a good um here just how big these are and we still got a couple weeks to go so they're still swelling up and we're just getting started these ones here with the size of golf balls hopefully lower size of eggs by the time we're done but uh yeah all nice and clean down below like i said i planned on having this watering system for when i went away but uh we got another lock down with covid so i have used it just to try it out but uh i'm gonna pull it out pull it out of here probably but uh anyway that's it for these black cherry punch let's move on and i will show you guys the rotten rosie the ones that we filmed and the outcome of that okay so here we are these are the uh rotten rosie and these are femmes and these are the ones that i thinned last time and i'll just get on to show you guys uh how the film worked out so it's where i i thinned it down here so now you can see we got the two tops coming in we got uh these two here and then these two that i'm holding on to and then these ones down here have caught up so it's gonna be actually like six main tops that we have going on here so that they did work we did get the four on all of them all four will be uh shooting out but i have a different problem um as you guys know i'm growing these in the regular version as well actually they're rosy they're not rotten rosy they're just rosy and uh they're in the regular version and i grew out about 40 of them because i'm doing some breeding and so i grew those out and then i crossed them with a different male and then once i got those i picked out the best one uh the best female out of that and then i crossed it with a different strain of male and then i took the um two offsprings from that and then i crossed it again to make it an f2 so i will be growing those here shortly because i'm gonna do uh 110 of those uh f2 seeds that i created and uh we're going to do 10 of them on this channel and i'm going to show you guys how i go about making them seeds again because some of you guys have been asking me to show you everything from the start to the finish so i'll show you guys uh what i use to make the fem seeds and how i do it and go about it as well so one of my issues uh that i'm getting on with with this is why i'm mentioning that is because these stretched a hell of a lot more than just a regular rossi and uh i'm not sure if that has something to do with uh the lights because this is it actually is a little bit more of a red spectrum in these that i'm using at my friend's facility uh but these are the sand lights so it might be why they're stretching a little more or it might just be that this uh feminized line is a lot more stretchier um they do have good structure though as you can see this one here is one of my favorites so uh but i'm really not into all the lengthiness they're a little too long and i don't want to just bend them over so what i'm going to do is i'm going to top these again yes i'm going to lose about a week worth of uh growth because i just filmed them so i'd have more tops but the stretch is just too much so uh what i'm going to do is i'm going to top them i'll probably top it about here and then i'm going to top these again next week or at a later date so then i'll get my four main tops that way these are just too lengthy to do what i wanted to do they're all that one in the back there is already at the height that i would have sent it to the flower at so what we're going to do is we're just going to have a different set of plans and this happens while you're growing uh people sometimes you just have to make a change of plans in order to get what you want out of that plant so that's what we're doing here uh these are not gonna go to waste um i actually have a friend in town here who wants clones of these so that's what i'm gonna do so i'm gonna call this one uh rotten rossi one the one in the back there two and then three and then four so all i'm gonna do is i'm gonna come in here and i'm gonna top it right here and we're gonna make beautiful clones with these so you want to leave a bit of a nub when i come in here you want to leave a bit of a nub just to uh give it some space to grow give those branches a place to uh set this will rot away but it will help set these branches up so there's no failure so it don't split and all that other stuff so all i'm gonna do here is i'm gonna take it and i'm gonna snap it just like that i'm gonna take that and i'm just gonna set it in the water here for now down here and i numbered all of those cups down there as well just so i don't mix them up so that we can we can compare our grows in the end so now here we go here we've got these branches and uh what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna remove these big fan leaves here that will help give more uh light down to here and it will stop from feeding these so much so they won't get as uh they won't keep climbing is uh higher than the others so we'll get a nice even canopy by doing it this way so there's one down i'm gonna go into the back here i'm gonna cut this one the same place leave a little nub uh the reason why you put these in the water right away is so that uh so that you don't suck air up and do uh up into it you want it uh you want it all nice and full of water so let's move on here now to number three we'll do that in the same spot leaving a bit of a nub again well take that i'll bring it down we'll put it in the number three cup and then number four this is the reason why i'm doing this right here is because of this one this is uh one big plant so so anyway i got them all set up down here now and we're gonna take them out and i'm gonna show you guys how i clone these real quickly we'll just do one of them and then i'll get on to show you guys uh the autoflowers after that but uh we'll bring these out to uh area where we have more room to play okay so here we are we're gonna start with number one here so first things first i bring it down here and i'm just removing these leaves here because we don't need them this is gonna be a power clone because it's gonna have the six tops so it's actually gonna be a pretty uh cool clone to grow out but uh i have oh never mind i thought i lost my uh put that back in there for a second i thought i lost my razor blades but here they are right here just use these and uh i use razor blades just because it's easier to control so i take it like that and then i will just i'll shave it down about a half inch on the end and that is just to break the outside so that your roots will grow out of that easier whoops you got to be careful not to snap it like i just did so we'll start again being a little more gentle just like that and i will actually put a split in mine that and then i use stem root number two this is for like uh it's kind of for like a woodier woody type strain but like mediocre and then i just put it in there i packed down around it so there we go there's the first clone you don't need to snip all the ends off but you can i will usually do that in my hand but that just helps promote the root growth it makes uh the roots grow instead of the tips grow and uh it also helps get oxygen into the plant because it can't take it up through its roots because it doesn't have any so now that we got number one out of the way we will get on to number two which is right here and over here again you want to just take off the bottom fan leaves you can actually grab your clone like this and give it a snip like that and then all your ends are cut easily take your razor blade do some shaving we're splitting it then dip it into stem root number two knock some of it off stick it in there and pack down around it and then what i will do is i will just give these a bit more water just to make sure that they're watered in correctly and then i will put them underneath a dome which i'll show once i finish these other two off so dipping right into this with my clones that's not good practice to have because you can spread diseases that way but i'm not too worried about it i have quite a few of these so i'm good to go um usually you want everything to be sterilized and you switch in between your clones and whatnot but uh i'm not too worried about it like i said so that's why i dipped out a container this time but if you want to be extra careful not to spread diseases and guys just put some of this into a different little container to dip your clones in and then throw it out at the end of the day um anyway we'll move on to show you how i have these set up now okay so we're back in here and again i'm not real sure why these things stretched all that much i've been using a monosolixic acid uh it's actually called power si it's just a silica it's a different type of silica it actually brings your ph down for once uh instead of raising it up to like 11 it brings it down to around like six which is perfect or around six five but uh anyway let's get on to the clones what i did now is i put them into a dome here i put the dome on the floor it's off the floor just a little bit and then i missed the heck out of the plants and i missed the heck out of the top here and i keep it really nice and humid in there and about seven days we will have roots from those girls and then uh once i'll give them probably two weeks here then i'll give them to my buddy who wants them so anyway these girls here they're now gonna grow pretty good all the uh shorter branches here will be able to come up the ones on the bottom will be able to come up as well i'm just gonna tuck these leaves here so that we're getting late to everything now we're getting light and they're all looking pretty good i think this one here is going to be a pretty good one so i'm excited to see this one but uh yeah we're just gonna have to take a different angle on training these girls anyway let's get on with the autos and i'll show you guys how those girls are blowing up okay so i just wanted to come back in here i know you guys just finished the part of this but i just wanted to show you how i added in these floraflex things and that's to help stop the soil from drying out i also got underneath it the pads those pads down below they stop the top layer from drying out as well so they work really good for organic soil which is uh the reason why i have them right now but right now this is a couple days since i did the topping and you can see the structure is a lot better with these girls they're not feeling it too much here right now i was just bending them down and messing around i broke back branch i broke the branch back there so i had to taper up but now they're starting to grow pretty good a lot more bushy so it seems like we're getting them under control so i will get back and i will show you guys the autos there now okay so here we are with the autos and these girls are doing just awesome um this one here that's uh moby dick by dynafilm this one here is another moby deck by dynafilm and this one here is a lemon pie auto by fast buds but i will just show you how big this girl here is just how big she's doing as well she's got real big cola's on her and they're just huge and she's nice and dense we're starting to get a little bit of fade in there now with her right on time and these ones over here i'll show you the frost is starting to pack on her and they're a little bit more skinny of buds but they're still nice big colas and then this fast buds i've had to come in here and uh thin her out a bit as she had a lot of leaf just to get some light down into there but all in all they're looking very nice and uh yeah so remember to like this video people i really

wonderful day today's video is going to be on the slur Akane IX growing string review from in health genetics we have some right here as we can tell beautiful beautiful beautiful so yeah if you use the channel make sure to subscribe if you want to help support the channel a little bit more I'll leave a link to my patreon down below all sorts of cool exclusive content we're gonna do giveaways once we got more people on there all sorts of fun stuff but yeah we'll get right into it so this is the slur came from in-house genetics this is actually the i-x grown indoors under my hash propter with the pro hub beautiful flower a couple things in house genetics has some amazing stuff i will give them that but another side note and this is where i'm going to get into this this strain i'm gonna classify as a moderate to advanced growers only simply because it does not seem like they tested it i got there's either five or six pack it was like a hundred and thirty or hundred and forty dollars when i got it i believe and only one yes only one out of the whole entire pack was good everything else per meet in there super crazy unstable so moderate to advanced growers only you need to be really keeping a vigilant eye on this you need to check and make sure you're not getting harmed but if you put in the work some amazing product will come out at the end it's got this specific female had like a really really good yield too so very happy was that actually tell it's got some really nice chunky notes for an indoor grow a beautiful beautiful color I will give it that very frosty as well so I'll give it that as well very enjoyable to smoke I really like it as my daytime smoke so this is the slur k9x which is their slur Akane the slur came it's like one of the only things that I've seen it's really unstable from them so maybe go check out the slur cane which is their slur akane youdo see you might have to be no hunch a little bit but that's part of the fun so that's what this one is love to smoke it's got a really like key key in the face pungent almost a garlicky taste smell to it so really enjoy that everybody really really seems to like it sorry I dropped my nose yeah everybody really seems to like it I really enjoy it you can see the whole grow my beginner grill guide series is where we did this so just wanted to do a quick little thing real fast with this we can go through and do a lot of my strands that I grow like this so yeah moderate to advanced in house genetics start testing your strains if something goes out and you know stop selling it these packs are still for sale really okay and so don't do that in-house test your strains you already have enough money and enough gear that you can pull one thing off the shelf if it's not crazy stable or at least give people heads up that you're going to be spending a bunch of money and you're not gonna be getting what you want so yeah how does the whole pack only one was good everything else hurried probably worst pack I've ever drawn in my life in terms of that so I guess good job in house genetics on that you have successfully produced the most unstable pack that I've ever been able to get my hands on so cool but I do love the smoke I do love the strain at the end of the day was not worth the money but I did take the one stable cut that I had and I'm putting it to my violetta try to help stabilize a little bit and bring a little extra funk to it so definitely stay tuned for that I will hopefully be growing that within the next couple months but yeah I hope you all have a great day I hope you really enjoyed the video take it easy do something good for somebody today", "8PMa2Yi_xvE": "[Music] hey there's your friend Bushmaster here with you we're doing a fun video today I forgot to turn the camera on well I mean yeah because of this this video is sponsored by I don't know that I think that was purple punch nugs oh yeah shout out to our friends of tree stars go get your seeds from them that's where we get our in-house and some other great gear so I'm doing a voiceover because I forgot to turn the microphone on but this is OG kb v 2.1 we had a fail on these we only had two seeds pop build a soil eight all the rest so stoked to try some more of those then we got these two limited packs which is platinum punch remix cross with the platinum cush mints that should be good i love anything with that punch we had really good success with that that's what we're smoking on here in this video and then we got another limited pack which is the platinum garlic cross with platinum cush myths so we got two platinum push mints crosses should be good i'm really excited about this so yeah i'm still talking about them don't really know what I'm saying probably gonna get my anal tool out yeah look at the look at this guy got his little tool out we're gonna start picking out the bags all right well now I'm doing this what I'm showing is like stickers and printed bags like it makes sense for your strainings to be you know like stickers because they changed what I'm showing there yeah if you live on a sailboat that's a point of entry for water so just say some of them one was sealed up arrest them I'm going to show you I can stick that tool in there without breaking it so if you live on a sailboat just beware you know be aware that you should probably have like a little Pelican case or something because yeah water can get in there sailboat disclaimer not waterproof not all of them see I'm showing that that one is sealed so yeah strain identification yeah that's a sticker but the bags are printed good job in house we love your packs we got hoji kbv 2.1 I don't know what the 1 X means but let's see how many seeds we got tear it open [ __ ] come on get into that thing the stewed [ __ ] I don't know what he's saying he's still trying to get into it come on dude are you gonna give that back or what yeah use a tool [Music] he's still not in Jesus Christ dude open it up he's having troubles come on there you go wrong way there you go what do we got looks good looking seeds from here I'm just watching the video voiceover you know yeah they look good 1 2 3 already now so we got 1200 GE kb v 2.1 so what else is there to say dude hurry up yep moving on alright limited we got a platinum garlic cross with the platinum Cushman's see how many seeds we got nice bags in house DME if you see this let me know who makes your bags I'd love to get some nice touching the seeds now you have to move them but we got 10 of those so we got 10 of the limited platinum garlic cross already counted for you it's 10 did drop some more dropping seeds geez go clean that [ __ ] up alright another limited pack let's see Platinum punch remix cross with a platinum Cushman's says ten plus seeds rags so those 2 limited packs are rag seeds are regular and as far as the OG kb that's a fan pack so that's cool so this guy's gonna struggle through just probably drop some seeds we got ten of those so we got ten in the limited packs and 12 are the OG kb e 2.1 so I don't know guess he's gonna put them away now that's it so we got some good-looking seats for min house excited to pop these packs another shout out to I think tree stars cuz they hooked us up with all this stuff awesome company I don't know what else I'm saying about these packs there's nothing else to say but go check out three stars yeah three stars there they are I knew I was gonna throw them out again oh yeah purple punch maybe no more seed reviews on purple pod [Music] [Music]", "pbEgYV5-p0Q": "what is going on welcome back to another edition of our Strang review series a cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene today I am going to be looking at a brand new strain to the channel it is the banana punch bread by symbiotic genetics and we're gonna take a look at it right here on the ice mocha Channel just before I get things kicked off I want to mention that this video is sponsored by seedsman go over to their website if you want to enter hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of seeds from some world leading breeders I will leave a link in the description on with the video let's talk about the background of banana punch banana punch has a lovely sound name to it doesn't it this combines two strains banana og also known as banana cush and purple punch combined together by symbiotic genetics to deliver the banana punch now going back into the genetics a little bit further we would expect both of those strengths to fall more on the body led side but there's gonna be a spectrum as there always is when we consume cannabis speak up to marijuana Mike the grower on this one you can see from he's Brandon I've really liked the branding we'll talk about it a little bit more as we move on to the appearance of this cannabis strain as I just mentioned in the intro called branding starting to see a lot more in this glass jar with a metal lid making it fully recyclable this has got a cool compartment where you can look through at the flowers inside opening it up you can see that it's a nicely presented buds inside so the buds themselves try not to move on to the smell section I'll save that for just a moment by I am getting the smells coming out for the butts themselves a really cool look to it this one nice trim job sparkling with trichomes light colored pistols good development it's got that kind of organic nicely grown bud look not to like beefed and puffed out and just uniform like with PGR influence these buds have got their own look their own individual look to each bud very light in appearance that kind of sparkly right matte and green shade have I ever said sparkly matte before that's weird in it if you look in the light is sparkly if you look out of the light it's kind of got a matte Sheen to it really cool it's complex but no Purple's no blues is just greens and and hints of the orange yellows of the pistil it's a really nice look to the banana punch actually reminds me of the look of the purple punch quite a lot trim to perfection no leaves left on there that covers the appearance let's talk about the smell of banana punch as I was opening the jar for the appearance section the banana smell literally hit my nostrils while the while the jar was still down here it smells like banana with hints of like fruit salad like maybe like pineapple or something like that but the most prevalent aroma is the banana now also sitting underneath that is it's like mother of all berries type aroma that what I used to describe as a coffee cannabis type of smell that is definitely sitting in there as well what smoked a lot of mother of berries and I can smell that slightly in this purple punch I've also smoked a lot of banana cush not so much but it smells absolutely fantastic let's break one of these buds open and see what we can gauge from the inside here we go 'banahna earthy hints of like we skunk that tropical skunk like Hawaiian haze hints not quite but like along the same ilk and it's got kind of like a a dankness to the smell as well it's not just light and and aromatic is also like oh it's also got some of that power creeping into the aroma as well really interesting stuff let's talk about the taste of the banana punch some to consumption methods today as you can see got my bong here I've got my mighty vaporizer that's going to give us a good idea of both the flavor and the smoking experience of the banana punch so I'm gonna grind up one of these buds also let you know if I'll get any more smell prop up there on a smell to it wah but honest meal to it that your night not something I come across as often as the other fruit flavors and honors technically a berry but the fruit flavors that are often prevalent in cannabis are citrus oranges strawberries this banana is out there but I don't come across them as much meaning that this is a nice and somewhat different smell it's what I'm normally standing here reviewing so I'm gonna put some into the mighty vaporizer we're gonna heat that up and while that's heating up we're gonna smoke a bomb of it so if you are getting yourselves ready to join us get those bowls filled get those joints rolled get those fabrics heated up preparation time right about now got the mighty on join me for this one and I'll see you all on the other side Cheers [Music] delivers a very earthy taste to it actually those oh gee flavors coming through the fruity notes can also be tasted somewhat but perhaps not as strongly again as came through in the aroma we see how the mighty treats us because it will give me a much better idea that complex flavor than smoking it through the bomb the smoking experience was enjoyable it didn't feel the need to cuff we have got the mighty you heat it up now let's taste the vapor oh man that's got a really nice taste in vapor 'banahna like eucalyptus or mint or mint feel like something around that area of terpenes is is coming through the vaporizer we have like a really nice banana taste that sits on your tongue as well this isn't aptly named strain I think it's come away a fair bit from the purple punch from my experience of smoking purple punch as I said I haven't tried banana OG but what I can say is this delivers a lovely unique flavor profile like nothing that I've tasted before which gives it good marks from me in the flavor Department from the vaporizer I'm definitely getting a really nice tasting vapor nice and then a lot of stuff I put free unique different and distinguishable enough to give it very good marks through the bum I'm getting a nice smoking experience but not as much of the flavor as I'm getting through the vaporizer it's still tastes nice and as I always say a bong is a great way to get high so I like it from the smoking experience perspective but unlocking that banana no flavor or in the vapor either is a must do if you want to truly appreciate the flavor of the banana punch saying that I'm gonna smoke another Bowl so join me for this and I'll see you all on the other side [Music] it feels like I'm getting some of the flavor notes but the smoke may be burning slightly hotter than some of the cool smoking strengths that I've been talking about recently not in an accurate way not in a way which suggests that it isn't clean or isn't grown as well might even be a strain dependent might be to do with the trichomes some strains are more expansive than others the platinum jelly that I reviewed last time was super smooth actually through the bonk so this could potentially be less move because of that but yeah I'm really liking the flavor anyway let's talk about the effects of the banana punch so as I'll talk to you right about now we've had two bongs and wait some continued into votes um it has now been several minutes since I smoked and vote the banana punch and I am feeling the effects nicely I can tell you that this hits on the body LED side of the spectrum it has got that pleasurable high that comes from the purple punch side of the lineage which gives me a really sort of nice most like cuddle type height if that makes sense to you guys it also has the familiar relaxation that you get from smoking those og strains what we classic you call indica is present you know and it's and it's nice it feels like it's not a strain that's gonna induce anxiety or paranoia compared to other strains on the hybrid or head-high side of the spectrum my mind feels quite calm but my body feels very relaxed I'm certainly feeling this nice body led feeling burn on a punch hits reasonably hard I know I've smoked two bowls of it and had a vaporizer as well so I've consumed a reasonable amount but I'm feeling nicely relaxed for the time of day I like to smoke fresh in these reviews so that you guys get a good idea of how the strain hits me and actually I'm glad that I waited a little bit before filming the effects segment so you could see the effects kicking in a little bit more it's made me sort of happy a little bit on the giggly side very relaxed and just chilled is the best way to describe it and also feels like it could be good on the pain relief inside if that's something that people are suffering with unless something's up so today we've been looking at symbiotic genetics banana punch a lovely cross of banana og and purple punch I've got a lot of love for one of his parents trains and this I must say has also impressed me its impressed me more than the mimosa which is purple punch cross with Clementine appearance-wise it looks similar to the purple punch but hasn't got that nice sort of edgy looked at at Budds I'm sure that differ from Fino to phyno and know this was grown from seed and that there are other seeds that they can potentially grow in the future so some really cool stuff might come out of that pack smell wise I like the smell of this one now again there's probably going to be some variation between phenotypes but this captured the banana wonderfully it captured sort of pineapple notes this tropical xxxx pungency that really delivered a nice smell so I like it is unique good marks from me and the aroma flavor-wise I've really enjoyed the flavor through the mighty vaporizer particularly where I've got those banana notes that tropical nests that earthy sweet taste came through nicely smoking it in my balm maybe a little bit hotter but still smooth smoke just not delivering as complex a flavor profile as I got when I was vaping it which is understandable when you feel terrine it through water and smoking in a bong anyways more for the smoking experience and the power then the flavor fire this consumption method in my opinion and effects wise it's a really nice hi guys I like it for the daytime because it makes me feel chilled and happy but getting pain relieving qualities as well it's what would traditionally be defined as an indica strain but we're going to try and move away it's just hard because in my vocabulary and synonymous with the culture for for the whole time that I've been doing this but we'll try to move away and start describing it in more of a accurate modern terminology I've always in the future when people watch these videos they'll think I'm outdated overall I'm really enjoyed smoking on the banana punch it's a nice strain nice genetics I don't know if I've had any of symbiotic genetics strains before run the channel but this has certainly been an interesting one that is gonna be it for the video guys what I want to know from you is what is the fruitiest cannabis strain that you have enjoyed leave that in the comments and remember to hit that like and subscribe button if you're enjoying our content to help the channel grow that's it for the moment as always thanks for watching and keep talking biggest of the century [Music]", "1wSCMic5Epo": "[Music] hello and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are looking at a trusty lovable brand one that we reviewed a couple of times in the past and like them every time we're gonna take another look at them in this post and apocalypse world and that is the fine folks at cannabis syrup well mostly for buying folks I think they do some review inflating on weed maps that has me a little peeved but for the most part I do like cannabis quite a bit this is the hundred milligram variety cherry flavored I think we've done grape and chocolate didn't change arena in the best so now we're doing cherry again this is 100 milligrams 10 servings of 10 milligrams each of course we're just going to do it in one I've like canvas syrup every time I reviewed them I find them to be quite potent I think that they are reviewed by s or excuse me they are they used to at least be reviewed by SC labs but I don't see it on here right now but I'll double-check that but independently verified doesn't taste terrible I therefore being unfortunately has a bad texture it it's gonna or thickness it's got like a cough syrup like thickness or at least it used to well let's just go ahead and shut up and open this up and and give it the old-fashioned review here alright almost done with the protective loo balloon okay here we go here is our cherry liquid maybe we could just do it in one gulp that's fine now I do have a chaser here in case things go badly but let's not let's hope that doesn't happen down the hatch did I get it no oh it's like robitussin well it's no good it's not terrible it tastes like cherry cough syrup um but it won't get you uh what's the word for when you do sizzurp I can't remember whatever that kind of crunk is or drunk or [ __ ] up this won't get you that it'll get you high but it won't get you whatever it is like doing coding also don't do coding and I'm done oh well glad to be done with it and guys if you've never tuned in two weeks before you're gonna have to wait a couple more seconds to find out how it's actually going to affect me cuz that's the most important part of the edible review how it makes you feel not how it tastes so I'm gonna sit here stew for the next two hours see how I'm feeling and I'll come back to you guys to let you know thanks for watching wait so I'll see you in just a second this cherry is a real peach that was terrible but this is really good another kind of a syrup another winner ten bucks for this I had a discount to think it got up like seven bucks did it taste terrible it has a cough syrup it kind of flavor as I went over ad nauseam but I'm high I'm still high right out of the sort of six ish kind of range five six someone there feeling good like the format like the syrups it's an easy quick discreet way of doing it this might be the last cannabis we review or review for sometime maybe we'll try some of the higher dose ones because I think they do actually have some like two under or not I've tried that 200 milligrams I think they might have 500 milligrams I'm not sure but maybe we'll do some of those but for the lower doses the 100's the 200s that is going to do it for our cannabis reviews we know they're good now we can concretely say that you can pick up cannabis and feel like you're gonna get your money's worth happy to tell them are happy to give them a good review so again this was the cannabis cherry 100 milligrams from cannabis give it a shot if you haven't already I think you'll be quite happy with cannabis when you do that's going to do it for this review here on weeds guys I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a future review peace", "A3ZFodq2bIY": "if you guys clicked on this video makes you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose in the cut welcome back everybody to a brand new video today I got yet again another select wax cartridge I got you guys man you guys been doing these like wax cartridges I went for the hybrid I went for the cherry pie and so a little bit about this it's a hybrid I believe it's more than a sativa science I'm pretty sure because sometimes when it's yellow it's kind of like a sativa hybrid you know so it is cherry pie and I've tried this only like once or twice just because I throw this and I I bought this and all we're having at me and some of the guys were having a sesh so we just kind of threw this some rode oh and man like this man I only have it just a little bit enough just to kind of show you guys look at that all right right there so like always everybody we got to select you guys see that right there we like it that I just like that 83% zero six eighty three point zero six percent THC and it's some cherry pie you guys know was good I'm completely sober right now so we're gonna see how many hits it takes for us to get lit so cherry pie everybody again welcome to another podcast I hope you guys are enjoying these also everybody makes you guys drop a like the comment subscribe 18 another educational purposes like always everybody make sure you guys once again actually let's take let's take the first shrimp so on there's if we got a brand new pen this pen is actually a little bit different the red is actually the lowest setting the blue is like the medium and the green is like the highest so I'm just like wait what cheers everybody see if I could get like a taste okay so it does kind of become like a bit like a little cherry like a little cherry aftertaste like a little punch like a little cherry punch hmm see the cool thing that I like about select cartridges and regarding cartridges is they don't really be adding a lot of flavor sometimes when they be adding flavor that shit's kind of like a bad chemical you know I mean I'm pretty sure it's a pretty bad chemical you know if they were to add some flavor on it might be not too harmful but I mean if you guys are damn [ __ ] you guys are heinous [ __ ] all day you know it's just definitely bad for you but these happens man these are coming these be coming and going like crazy so look at that we got the little select logo um I think there is a couple pink ones bro like that strip tap fake select I feel like nowadays man they could probably make anything bro literally anything for example like again you guys know this I already tried on fake brass not though I seen fake King pens I've seen what other fake it's mainly brass knuckle I've seen a couple fake heavy hitters and it's just like damn people are thinking like man I'm getting the jug but in reality you guys are just can that custom that home that custom made oil could be a little bit cheap who knows some plugs can potentially make some good fire stuff so who knows but let's take another first hit select does not disappoint I mean out of all of them out of all of them I feel like select is top 3 I gotta admit top 3 when it comes to like actually getting lit again select does have like a little meaning like a point 3 cartridge which is like an ax it's in high 90 percent THC and oh my god roll you take a rip of that 1 or 2 a deer man but it's not around like 40 50 bucks just for that little piece of like super concentrated THC it's crazy but a cheers OH I think now I feel like I can probably tell the difference from a lot of wax cartridges like this definitely has select I'll written all over like all of them have like different tastes if it's crazy the raw garden one you can tell right away like bro if I were to close my and I woulda hit a wrong garden and if I were to know if I were to hit a rock garden I'd be able to tell it's like you know chewing out a piece of leaf you know piece of tree piece of bush and that's the leg type I got that it's so weird I'm not I'm horrible at explaining especially explaining a taste but it has like this let me see if let me see if I can explain to you guys definitely I think select cartridge is a lot better than a Moxie but the Moxie does have a really great flavor but again you know that's what a lot of people say you know when it has a good it has like a good candy type flavor and yeah it's definitely not good for you you know because they'd be adding stuff for the flavors because in reality it's like okay if they were to press a certain tree huh you know what there's just so much to it man I there's so much learning to this to this industry you know like I just I just keep thinking about it like it doesn't make sense because sometimes when you don't taste something I'm just like okay cool it's legitly the concentration you know it's literally the oil from the flower you know it's nothing else added to it which makes it just taste like like literally just one single taste which is kind of dough same with raw garden that's what I figured you know Rob garden it always has like the same flavor that same strong flavor with like maybe a little hint of something and you can tell but it depends on the flower like the natural flower you know but sometimes we have like for example I'm not saying heavy hitters brass knuckles and all that stuff sucks or anything like that I'm still gonna cop some here and there but I'm saying like the flavor is too artificial like it's not artificial but it definitely for me I feel like they could potentially add some something to it just so I could get that flavor you know but I could be wrong you know I could be wrong that's just my thought but again everybody I'm not saying to not buy those brands you know because in reality they are you know proved as long as you guys are like like legitly getting them from like the club or the you know the dispensary and stuff you guys aren't really getting them from your local drug dealer cuz your local drug dealer listen to this you guys I talk about this in all pretty much all my wax cartridge videos because sometimes you know these guys they could probably make the wax you know the oil pretty good and you know what hey you got yourself a good cartridge homemade wax you know but at least it's like nothing crazy you know but then there's also other cartridges you know for example like in my experience what I had is like you know I poked out in a couple times and they just turned brown and I'm just like yo this does not look normal yeah it was like a thirty dollar brass knuckle you know like it was definitely fake it was not it was not the real brass knuckles of faith it was a fake brass knuckle but that's one way you guys could see and sometimes let's chop the other sensitivities 1 2 3 I think it's just good 3 oh wait a minute green as the middle one look at that that green is definitely the better wood yeah green is definitely the middle one tastes a lot more made-up fatter cloud and I do see a couple people sometimes like there was this um I had a friend that they came to visit me during my lunch yeah my old job right and they were like eh like you smug and I was just like well I mean sometimes you know not all crazy she's like they're like oh I got a I got a wax pen right I'm not gonna call them out or anything but like yeah I got a wax Maran I was like yeah that's good so they took it out right and I looked at it don't like have a halfway smoke and I was like what is this it was like some off-brand you know wax cartridge right and I was like I like bro you're selling your smug on some fake ass [ __ ] didn't it was just like so black the oil will you see this right here the oil it's like halfway through maybe like they smoked it like right here no no maybe like right there like literally get halfway and I guess what they said was that it just started turning black and I was like dude you know that's like when that's when it's fake and I was like what kind of car is it was like some designer brand not a designer brand I come it was some type of brand where I'm just like - right off the bed I'm just like yeah man you got to turn me little your local drug dealer huh you know my head I'm like why you know 1 2 3 all right let's try it off in the in the max um setting well I have your cloud the taste it's not too gay Don the highest win oh not too good this pen is to spit it's $50 pen don't get me wrong it's a nice pen but definitely not for Lake we tried a couple well we tried a couple um we tried a couple of these select cartridges already I liked select so it was literally like the first one to go to like this is the one that I wouldn't always like gay you know it's really good brand you know but right now the brand that I've kind of uh have been buying lately there's a lot of regarding rocker and is really nice rock garden is a good one but don't get me wrong rock garden and select are way different and they're both good so you know you could either go this router this round or you know cop one of each but definitely switch off you know mine I'm definitely gonna cop another Moxie cart I really like the flavor I mean it's some light resident in a wax cartridge you know and it's it's only $25 1/2 gram this one was about $35 1/2 gram I believe or 25 no no no I think this was 20 bucks I think $20 a minute there look at the thing dude half gram was like 25 I believe 25 um so it's not that bad whatsoever you know I like it it's a hybrid it doesn't have me all slump or like super awake I mean I like that super awake feeling you know the sativa that way I could be very productive but right now it's almost gonna be 9 p.m. so might as well you know just hit some in because and stuff like they're you know such it's pretty good oh one thing that a lot of people do not know and then my dumb ass just remembered especially here right here let's check this out so the directions or suggested serving a suggested serving which is one serving is three seconds so this is one serving I think I went a little overboard at three four seconds but three to four seconds is one serving and there is a hundred and twenty five servings so it's so let's see so let's start off it says right here look one three second draw and close cartridge contains 125 servings so what one three second draw is a so three times 125 so if we were to drag this it would take 375 seconds and if we were to do that and be around six or seven minutes so wait a minute so six or seven minutes of you pump that makes sense because if you're just gonna go sir like four minutes you'll smoke the whole thing hmm six eight minutes of hitting and that's why I love having baby hits - oh okay now that - that was just like a little fact that I just like read from the back a lot of people don't really know but yeah usually it's like a three to four second scene and I'm different once I'm pretty sure it's for all of them it's for the 510 thread the the pens or whatever but um um so three to four three to four seconds is one hit yeah but you have around 125 settings so if you were to take at least one serving a day that's literally a 125 1/2 gram of this but that means you have to be like super lightweight you never had any type of th in your blood whatsoever you know oh and another thing too that I'm just spacing out at this point what at this point pretty much what you want to do is I guess one of my boys put me on actually shot up oil yeah shout out chicken but pretty much when you hate when you have a pen you want to hit it right you hit it and then you have to wait I think maybe like 30 second I believe I freaking forgot but he said 30 seconds or more you have to you want to wait like 30 seconds in between that way it kind of cools down you know because if it's too hot the coils it might not burn right you know you might not get the best like the full potential of the hit you know so you want to make sure that you wait at least 30 seconds let it kind of cool down is that way so you can get like the best you know now I'm gonna try to tell everybody that because he told me that I'm just like dude I see people just rip this [ __ ] blow it out rip this [ __ ] blow it out rip this [ __ ] blow it out past I see a little person rip it blow it out and I'm just like damn maybe that's all the wax is being over burnt and it's not even like I mean at the same time it's it's gonna get burned you know it's gonna file but if you want to have like a perfect hit that's when you have to wait at least like over 30 seconds that's what he told me you know and in my head I'm just like yeah it makes kind of sense but let me know in the comments down below what do you guys think crazy stuff man but I just said bad but man but if you say man isn't but right out it just sounds like Pampa that's crazy so there we have it everybody we have some elite select cherry pie hybrid wax cartridge I hope you guys enjoyed this video make sure you guys drop a like a comment subscribe again this is the podcast thank you guys

fire", "fvpoKgghoX0": "hello everyone welcome back to rose of green i hope everyone is doing well uh in today's video we're gonna go over a few things i'm gonna show you guys the final weight from uh the main lining and uh how we did in that tent with the in-house genetics black cherry punch uh this here what you're looking at is relentless genetics rotten rosie uh like i've told everyone before i've grown out the rossi before actually i still have a plant of the rossi kicking around but uh anyway i'm using that for something special but uh the rosie produced really well and these girls are stacking up just how i wanted to uh we will get into that in a second though first off i just wanted to start off by saying thank you to my new subscribers uh all of my new subscribers thank you for joining all my old subscribers uh thanks a lot i really appreciate all you guys sticking it through with me and i would like to say uh thank you to a couple new members who hit that join button beside the subscribe and uh i want to thank uh trey landing mike david and trixie five thank you all for becoming members um now we will get on with this video you know what before we get into this tent here i'm just gonna bring you right to the weigh-in uh because a lot of you guys were expecting the weigh-in from uh the in-house so uh here we go let's get at it okay so i thought i would share a little bit of this with you guys i'm just doing some trimming here this is uh the black cherry punch and uh it's really nice and frosty it's got some really nice purples in there see if you can see some purples there we go it's a really really nice drain it's nice and frosty as you can see i'm very very happy with this it's very very nice and dense very nice colors and she gets you pretty she gets you feeling pretty pretty good so anyway i will just show you what i am doing here all i'm doing is i'm trimming these up see they're covered in frost so what i do is i just sit here and trim away so start off with getting rid of some of those leaves take a bite off yes i do have trimmer auto trimmers but if the buds not real real leafy if it's got a good calyx to leaf ratio i will typically just use scissors because it does not take long at all sometimes i will wet trim sometimes i will dry trim it just depends um i prefer to wet trim it's a lot easier for me for some reason a lot of people like dry trimming they find it easier it's just whatever's good for different folks i guess and uh that is basically done for myself so there we go i'll bring that up and show you and uh that's about it so when i'm done trimming this up when i'm done trimming this up what i'll do is i will uh i'll do away and let you guys know the weights just so you guys get a final of the black cherry punch um i'll show you again just how nice these buds are just beautiful very nice stuff i'm very impressed with it but anyway let me get on with this and i'll uh get you guys the weights here okay here we are so we're going to do the weigh-in this is a different pheno from this one but they're both really really dang there was actually uh two different phenotypes but uh yeah these things are extremely extremely dank and dense stuff but uh anyway let's get on with the way off here what i'm going to do is i'm going to put this on here and then this bag here weighs as much as one of those bags so i'll put that on there i'm going to tear it and then i'll take off this bag 8.69 so 100 and 70 we'll see 170 small bag okay and now let's get on with this big bag this has got to be at least a pound oh close close close so four 429 so that's not uh um so 599 grams total so we're way over a pound there we did not bad 599 grams that wasn't even growing for yield that was just uh just doing some main lining but worked out pretty well anyway hope you guys enjoyed the weigh-in again really nice awesome dent stuff very impressive very frosty but uh that's the weigh-in for these so i was uh i was pretty surprised with the outcome there i did not think i was gonna get that much it came out to like 1.4 pounds or something close to that 1.35 or 1.4 um which isn't real real bad i wasn't shooting for yield a lot of you guys who followed the whole uh grow knew that i was not going for yield it was more like just a main lining for colas to grow some nice big colas and get all of the weight up top on top of the plants instead of scattered all throughout so uh it just shows you can pull off 1.4 pounds fairly easy without any crazy training or anything uh just a basic main line so um anyway what else we're going to do here is i'm going to show you guys what's going on in here uh then i'm going to show you guys the autos that i did the transplanting and the new seeds that i popped as well but uh first off i want to say something too i know a few of you guys do not like the light reviews that i do on the channel i do do light reviews that does not mean that i recommend those lights guys what you see me grow with is what i recommend so like these sand light i definitely recommend those uh they're just a little more expensive and uh the mars hydro fc 6500 or the fc series altogether is good and then uh that sp 3000 and the sp 6500 those are all good lights they got the meanwhile drivers the new uh they got the new chips from uh samsung the lm 301bs um they are identical chips to 301h don't be fooled by other uh there's other light companies out there who are gonna tell you the 301 h is better it is not is the identical chip there is nothing different with it whatsoever the only difference with it is is that it has a h on the end instead of a b and the h stands for horticulture i promise you uh people are going to try to argue me saying that it's it's better if you look at the website it's got better efficiencies and all that no it does not i contacted samsung myself and they told me straight up uh they are identical nothing different just geared towards horticulture that's why there's an age there anyway i just thought i would explain that a bit uh samsung chips are running the game right now but i'm telling you right now ozram are up there with some of the best uh lots of people don't use them because they're a little bit more expensive of a chip but uh these sand light here these have the high power oz rams in them and they're uh they're awesome but uh anyway i just thought i would get on about those light reviews um i mostly do the reviews just so when people uh are looking for lights they could google that light and then my video pops up so that i get a review of it so they could see what they're buying so i just basically do the reviews to help out like that uh some of them i will recommend if they're real well but other than that they're just light reviews so uh don't come down on me too hard for doing those reviews i just like to mix it up a little bit it gives me a little bit of content and it helps you guys as well of knowing about that light so anyway um uh let me just let me see here what was i gonna tell you guys oh yeah okay so here we are we're on the second week of flower here with these girls and i just want to show you something what you would be looking for so if this was a male you would be coming down here and you would be looking carefully at like say a place uh let me see if i can get my zoom to work uh say like a place like that right in here you would be looking for a balls you would see balls and that would tell you that it's a male if there's no balls you're good to go so anyway these are the second we could flower these are feminized seeds so obviously they're all going to be them i still check them over to make sure that a male doesn't get in there or that we don't end up with a herm but uh yeah so anyway a lot of you guys have been asking me about these here these are matrix okay these are matrix and underneath those those are matrix pads they're by floraflex uh these rings here are three inch frames they fit this matrix uh this is a whole matrix system except for that header down there that manifold there is off of uh amazon i forget the name of it i think it might be by rain bird or something i really truly can't remember i told you guys last time but for all those asking what these are they're the matrix and you can find them in my link below at indoor growing canada use

these for everybody who asks because i bet you a hundred or not a hundred but i bet at least 25 of you guys ask me about them what i use them for is to stop my soil from drying out the top layer so that all my uh beneficial life will live and continue to live and speaking of beneficial microbes that was another question that i got a lot of and this here is what i use i like tribus bloom by impello bioscience uh this stuff is awesome this is my second bottle of this i've been using it for a while now i will not go back i see extremely more growth a lot more healthy plants going on with them and so on but there are also other ones that you get like step little soil has em1 essential microbes and you just use those one to two milliliters per thousand milliliters so per liter and then we will move on to there is microwheel mass microwheel mass is all right this is the sample i got from them i've actually got a couple samples i used them for a while until i found out tribus when i really seen the difference and then there is recharge recharge is by scotty real and uh i don't know if you know the dude grows or whatever anyways you go to recharge canada.ca and just read up about it or go to uh growers recharge or something like that uh in the united states anyway just google recharge guys and you'll find out all about it this is a dry uh a dry stuff that you work with it's full of kelp and microbes and whatnot people ask me how long this stays good for and it will stay good as long as you want just don't let it get any moisture into it so anyways those are the four basic microbes uh that i use but i really like the tribus uh travis does not sponsor me in any way uh they do not give me any free stuff but i will continue to use this stuff because i actually do see results so anyway let's get in here i'm going to show you guys just what's going on so we'll do an overview shot in here and as you can see everything's looking real real healthy no deficiencies whatsoever everything's got that proper green color to it and i guess i'm gonna have to lift this up uh when your pulse meter is down below the canopy it will actually warn you and tell you that uh tell you that your lighting is low um unfortunately it grew out so even here you can see it's getting taller uh that back plant as i knew it was going to be a lot more of a stretchier plant but uh all in all this tent is full once again and you could just see how well these girls are stacking there's a bit of a gap there but i got a feeling that's gonna fill in good uh this pinot here is stacking a little the same pretty much and then this one in the back is a little stretchier which i don't like too too much but it looks like it's gonna do all right and then this girl here stacking about the same uh the phenos are different uh there's a couple different phenos actually this one and this one are almost basically the same then that one there's the stretchier one in the back a little different structure to it as well as uh that one there in the back is kind of just doing its own little thing as well so uh it's more closer to these two phenos than that one but we will see more about that once we get into bloom but anyway let's move on here i'm done showing you guys everything make sure you keep a really nice clean environment guys that will stop you from getting bugs and uh also i forgot one more thing people were asking me about what do i do if i get like uh gnats or uh thrips or spider mites or something guys i'm telling you uh beneficial microbes are awesome her beneficial uh mites are awesome uh don't buy them off amazon they'll be dead by the time they get to you go on the internet find somebody who sells um uh predator mites sorry that's what they are um fine predator mites they'll hook you up with which ones you need for what bugs you have and your issue will be gone within days so i had uh uh what do you call those things uh uh fruit flies and or actually not sorry yeah so i had nuts and i tried the sticky things i tried my safer spray and i just couldn't get them because they were deep down into my roots so what i did is i decided to try predator mites for my first time i put them in all of my tents and they were all gone within three days i reapplied just to be safe about three days later i saved some of them and uh i haven't seen any since and that was uh six weeks ago now so we went six weeks with nothing showing up looks like they're all dead and that is what i will be using from here on out i was never a big fan of them um i i was just never a fan of adding bugs to my grow room but really they're not a big deal they all die off anyways within like 30 days so anyway sorry for babbling there let's move on now we are going to move on into the autoflower tent and i will show you how those girls are doing from the transplant okay so here we are in here with the autoflowers uh you can see this thing is just a giving her that is my uh dehumidifier uh it's a pretty good one it holds uh i think a gallon it is or a little more yeah it holds like six liters lasts a couple days and uh it just produces very well so anyway you can see these autoflowers back here i'm actually just gonna turn this off for a second you can see these autoflowers back here what i'm gonna do is i'm going to top this one right away there we go it's topped and let's see if this one's ready uh yeah we can top it so you just bend it and it snaps i'll spread those leaves apart a bit and these ones i'm not topping it they are uh they're having a little bit of a rough time i'm not gonna lie i did injure them when i transplanted them uh so they will bounce back obviously but that was my own fault i just wasn't careful enough when i did it i'm usually a lot more careful and i really rushed these out because i was trying to upload my video uh for the channel but anyway they will bounce back they're not too too bad they're just looking a little sad and uh these girls here are now topped so we're gonna go with these ones see how they're doing these are the northern cheese haze and these are the sour stomper and the northern cheese haze even came up before the sour stomper and they were much more healthier and growing quicker than these but anyway we'll get it all fixed up i got a favor for you guys to ask um youtube is now shadow banning me again uh they took away my monetization so i really need you guys to like this video for my please i would love it if you could share it as well ask your friends to join the channel we're going to be at 20 000 subscribers in no time so uh if you guys could help me out hit that like button hit the subscribe button and uh hit that bell for notifications so you know when i go live and these down here are the new in-house genetics and these are called hypothermia and they're supposed to be very badass and i'll just show you how i go about watering these i just got this little bottle here i don't even ph my water at this stage really it's just it's already somewhere around seven i just come in and i just give them a little bit of water each i do not get crazy with it because i do not want to drown them out i just give them enough to keep them going and that's what i prefer to water whoops that's not good well you just seen firsthand a man down so we'll just fix that like this here well that was kind of dumb you guys probably get a little laugh out of that i did that live living on the edge that's what happens so we'll give her some more water hopefully she doesn't fall off again okay so that is it i'll have to clean up that mess or once it's totally dry i'll vacuum it up i do not like any messes in my tents as you can see always a clean space to prevent bugs anyway guys hope you enjoyed the video thanks for watching i really appreciate all of you guys comments that you leave you could also leave more comments if you want because that helps me with the algorithm and

conversation and just share ideas and you know half of it is we just talk [ __ ] and have fun and the other half is you know we get down into some serious thoughts and it's a lot of fun not having recommended you know my episode accused one of my favorite episodes I'm gonna do appreciate ya oh yeah you wonderful show I've been watching every episode I can't get enough of it it's definitely my new favorite podcast and I just so much man yeah you absolutely and yeah without any further ado let's go ahead and get into this official highly active slurring changed rain review [Applause] so tell about this lurking in this trance Larry King if you're wondering was bred by in-house genetics and it's a cross of two of the heaviest hitters in the game purple punch and dosey doe so these are already some of the strongest in the game you may have heard of them and they were pressed together by your house to be this train called slippery cane which we got from purple City genetics and this cut in particular is the cowboy way so can you explain what the cowboy credits the cowboy cut means that of all the seeds this is one particular seed that was selected for its traits by Grover called cowboy buds and you can rub up on Instagram and stuff sweet but yeah so this cuts pretty phenomenal in roid out in organic living soil as we always do here at Ivy active farms and without any further ado let's start reviewing this first we have to do the aroma test yes and I do want to say to our pets Larry came before from other Brewers and crazy experiences but I've never had it from my boy caning right here and I know my Candy's met these they're just look like fantastic oh my goodness II did not look this good that smells fantastic it's got a nice light white frosty coat a lot of the orange hairs I don't know the specifics about what contributes to it so penny do you want to get into that like teaching some things oh yeah so uh all that Frost is seen those are the trichomes he's doing up with the magnifying to look like a tiny little skinny mushroom you basically as kind of the shape they have oh what the hell you guys are like long and they have like heads at the top and at the heads of all the cannabinoids and therapies are nice so uh that's when you look after maturity and stuff and that's also what's getting you the nice stone and we like to get from this sweet nice medical buzz and all the medical benefits also it's all coming from those Franklin's recently nice yeah good I'm excited to try it out so if you ever seen really frosted bud you notice it was a little bit better that's why my fingers are still sticky and it's nice and sticky oh yeah that's just I think for like two seconds yeah I'll tell you right now hands now I think hurricanes the frosting is frickin strained I've ever seen as far as the buds for sure I mean it's just ridiculous I'll be honest I'm a little intimidated to having tried this thing yet I tried all the other everything else that I received with this one I've been waiting no dissipation with you I'm so happy you said that because I'm also mean can't even smoke in but for a while you know we smoked a fair amount and slur Akane's one of those strains that just like leave an impact on like your stoner permanent record welcome absolutely it's a it's something you don't go into lightly you know me I have but throughout the day it's good stuff but this one is an experienced hunter well I'm expecting that on the side yeah also be reviewed so far and this harvest has been an experience so without any further ado is a you think about the arrow yeah that smells great it's almost got a wanna see almost like a hints of orange I can I read hints of orange maybe a little piney we didn't and it's crazy it's a strong smell it smells like hash it almost smells with some of those orange ease and fruity I just wasn't really good yeah as I started you ever smell sort of strange like damn I could have a candle about this oh yeah absolutely I think those drains this is one of that super delicious not only is it fruity but it's like big bank and kind of smells like - a little bit I bet those orange serves like you said also some a little bit of berry in there it's just I mean it's got a lot of everything kind of hits every note and here we go the flavor test all right let's do it and see how she delivers something tells me she's gonna deliver granda yeah all right I'm gonna get to those greens sure being on it and you always get the guest opinions yeah very gently and I'm pretty intimidated to be honest I'm excited to see you sir you know you know what I can taste it that's an interesting way to Dan [Music] I do not have lungs like whoa it's interesting what do you notice about that to be honest I actually definitely do think well I didn't have a strong case I get personal for me it didn't taste anything like how it smells that's what I noticed by just a taste it's like it I want to say it's almost very smooth and you play smooth like it it's it feels like air like oxygen and but it doesn't have a lot of flavor to it like I mean it kind of what do you think a lot of thing I definitely feel you it's so smooth that's kind of why I'm taking the degree yeah because I don't think that big agents but I know it's not the highly active organic cooking so around but like you said that organic that I'm so or with he brings out a smoothness to the point where it's like air yeah I said I'm what am i reviews I said it's like better than air technically means oxygen get your social slur Akane no but really that but I'm not that it feels good to breathe in it yeah I just like food like when you eat food and you're hungry like I don't know my lungs are wanting they except it wasn't me yeah I know you don't you don't really drink but least for me it's like having like that that really nice like hundred dollar shelf-life liquor the one you sip on as opposed to getting that like a little cheaper must here one like it's really smooth it just goes down the pipes really nice yeah I really want to aim to the flavour because I feel like getting taste too much as far as the flavor I'll say I got a pretty good pretty good job of that flavor god it's already hitting me man I said okay but as far as the flavor goes it was a very very like compassion a lot of itself very I want to say it was more cakey and gassy than then fruity ok smelled more fruity but I had more of a cakey gas Mexico absolute you mean second time around no I feel a cakey feel almost like just a typical white cake but not really powerful just like incident and I wasn't expecting that because I didn't smell it so much it smells a lot like fruit yeah the thing is it tastes nothing like how it smells if you've ever had some like it I mean it really can taste like top-shelf wedding cake if you've ever had really good wedding cake I don't know if it was just me but I was surprised at how much of that flavor and I think that might be that hashey flavor just a shit-ton of trichomes but my parents are kind of all the trichomes stacking up when you're tasting kind of the THC return something like that I don't know sorry I got distracted by the high-kicking like I'm sitting here and I feel it physically making my head lighter it's it's interesting I gotta say immediately it feels pretty dreamlike like it's the first thing I forgot I forgot what was happening for a second I was sitting here just enjoying it like oh we're recording a video that's right minute and this thing keep some money real quick like it does not take long to do this how to hit you at all that's that's that's true as [ __ ] I was not expecting it to happen that fast yeah which tell which makes me think like does that I hit you right away or am I still gonna get a lot higher I'm about to another good question some of these reviews we've given a review but after the video I have gotten way more stuff than some of these I think the mochi is been emoji both of those after the video I was a summer else I might add me right now they do I've already feeling if every quick I'll also that word oh now mr. berry oh okay all right here's what I'm getting for the flavor bearing on the hinge now literally like a berry pie but that k-keep high flavor on the exhale the kind of gassy vanilla frosting we got going in definitely feel another [Music] definitely in the very notes in the end oh I might be somewhere else' this is that take you to Mars type stuff this is really make if you're somebody who's just like getting tired or not getting enough time I'm not getting high enough yeah you know like you did tolerance is too high this won't mess your tolerance up no matter where you tolerance is this will definitely break that yeah I'll just say I'm like four hits deep and it's already hit me like I'm just comfortable to myself yeah I'd have to say that the it's so strong that the highest concerning legend fear if you're not a veteran this is gonna be like like she wants like you know it's you probably think this is very jean like very strong doesn't take much one hit you let her feel at it pretty quickly I don't know about you you know what I'll stand by that was Hurricane just like I said this will be my second time having this letter came this woman is definitely already stronger than the first plant for her shirt Butler Cain is not like it's not like it's not your your daily like smoke you know before you're about to go be productive like I know this Bishop will hit you hard like like I said roaming yet you hit Steve and I'm already like pretty [ __ ] tonight yeah basically like you saying you wouldn't use this in the morning before starting your day is like that as a pick-me-up you can't microdose with it no there's only one hit and you're there so it's definitely like after work you trying to relax maybe you've had a party II try to impress people something like that or somebody suffering from very strong PTSD I think this would keep a lot of those all out of those I can't remember anything so I think a lot of the bad memories don't fade away I think it would be great for family you know I could definitely see the pain relief because my my body for sure has like this relaxing sensation rolling through it like everything feels relaxed actually honestly stretching sounds great right now I can I get second name and I wanted to test the pain relief a little bit I didn't go her and myself for nothing but last night I training really hard at your concession Thanks I was up doing a lot of flips and a lot of hard landings and I really put my all in and I was hoping to get a little bit sore today and I'd I got a lot sore I got very I woke up in a lot of pain after the training session and all that pain is gone right now I completely forgot about it I forgot that extra class name nice I'm saying this and I feel like I'm talking about a book I read like this is some really take you somewhere else type stuff it's like I've never seen this room before it's continuously growing - the more we talk like legitimately the higher getting yeah I said good man yeah I'm almost waiting to see where it goes but yeah overall I mean this is I think it definitely deserves what are the most potent for sure well one of the most potent one of the most potent but my issue with calling you the best strain is that it's almost too strong man yeah there's the exactly that happens at a point and there's so many different uses there's so many different it's the too good at reasons it's too good at its job it's overdoing it yeah I feel that yeah that's definitely best it definitely has a lot of subjectivity but as far as one of the most potent it's one of the most potent for sure for a share to be hard to find her tomorrow motion I think this would be a great strain for me personally link or something like stretching any sort of like going to the movies playing some video games anything that will keep you seated or like not to mobile for me I feel like this strain would really I would really enjoy that yeah that's really good that's really good way to put it yeah I don't think I could be doing anything that's important I just forget what I was doing in the middle of it you know but when I say it's going to relaxing what a save me miss or I could do something before my relaxing is important not that too important though you know like I'm not doing taxes on this oh yeah like honestly like like you know I like to like do a bullfight before I get to work and everything so you know I'll write down the whole I gotta do it but how about this one man this one is after yeah even for me even for me this is wrong you know what this will be organized oh yeah this would be a great strain for right after a workout that's a really good way to put it oh yeah Oh like Ruxin I'm thinking about it right now just like you go to the gym like or like you go to practice you have a kicking section of people recession you get a really good work done you're exhausted after your shoulders you're dead if you like to take a few bits of this get a little stretching in do you like it also now that you've made some little accent creativity I mean this is great your creativity just the fact that I feel like I'm at a whole new perspective and angle on things that kind of seeing things from only manual and sometimes that could really help with creativity whether it's overcoming problems or just artistic creativity maybe not accomplishing the whole task of getting started and that gave me some really good ideas honestly yeah overall I mean wonderful strain superb own anything else I mean it's strong it's a commitment as the shoes I got to say it's all the boxes as far as growing it goes before I forget super big fielder and super vigorous grower movie hits all the boxes for growing too and obviously super take and try growing these things mugs beautiful or just others hits everything just honestly hard to put down anyway unless you're not looking for something too strong yeah too strong oh and I don't want to like to deter people from you like it like it's too strong don't try it it's a great hi it's wonderful it's a wise thing going to put its lights we're not getting paranoid if you're not mentally wonderful soothing Hannah it's just it's just got its purpose it's it's really good at getting you really high don't get you up there really fast so it's like it's not it's a great time and it's really feeling good creative time anyway yeah super super vigorous guard wonderful wonderful bro you see Brooklyn City genetics the area definitely pick up some slur again because I think she's the best out there in terms of potency in terms of quality and yeah that's about it yeah so until next time don't forget to stay high stay healthy and always stay active peace everybody [Music]", "MvFj26yIVx8": "Oh what's up y'all this your boy Shelton was another episode another fire episode of waking baking yes sir in y'all today we got another surprise for y'all this is cold blackberry soda never had it before blackberry soda let me get it out here you go this is blackberry soda I've never even heard of blackberry sold a little known had a chance to taste it so we don't give it a rip this morning so yes sir let's get into the BlackBerry soda doesn't really have much of a much of a smell I don't know smells like the woods to me really like outdoors like the leaves or some [ __ ] but anyway let's go ahead bust him open aha there we go now has a gassy smell to it oh I'm getting ahead of myself blackberry soda black cherry soda I'm sorry guys you guys not I'll do any editing so but here's what you get it black cherry soda is named after his fruity soda like taste and unusually dark purple color this trend has spawned other favorites like black dahulu and Ace of Spades it has balanced mind and body effects and it's a potent medicine that hits without heavy sedation making it popular among patients treating severe symptoms throughout the day anyway I don't have any symptoms but I want to get a baked let's go y'all let's get into this black cherry soda I keep forgetting the name of it like it's not natural to say black cherry soda or something here we go oh no bad lighter good lighter okay they caught me off guard let me prepare thyself for such endeavors okay y'all I had to take a little short one and get my breathing straight cuz that hit me a little too hard and I know the expansion rate and this isn't that strong so it can't be oh by the way this is dispensary grade two although I don't have the containers that he came in this is dispensary grade this comes straight from the dispensary in Seattle Washington so thanks to the dispensaries in Seattle Washington I'm not naming any names because nobody's sponsoring me but thank you guys now we get down to the real flavors of it it seems like I can't hold the smoke long enough to get a good good taste on it I don't think that I'm coming down with a call because I don't get sick but it does feel like there's something happening here you know like congestion type that's making me call anyway we're gonna tighten up you guys see the merch wake-and-bake ain't yes I'm a youtuber I'm just playing with y'all uh-oh I must be getting high I take a little pause again now if you ever want to get accurate taste leave out your nose while smacking a miss somehow that activates your taste buds and you get a low accurate taste this tastes the kind of gassy like like diesel like like fuel I know you guys have tasted that before this is really actually quite tasty I don't know if I would recommend it because this is supposed to be the highest level of cannabis dispensary grade hi I'm buzzed but dispensary grace you know having that lamb and you guys know if you get wheat from Seattle Washington it's pretty much coming from California I'm not saying that they're not growing their own weed and Seattle Washington but mostly comes from California why would you why would you grow a lesser weed when the best weed is right next door to you well couple doors down with you no no don't want to take your thumb and say I really appreciate you guys subscribing to my channel gosh I really appreciate it thank you so much and like other youtubers I'm definitely have giveaways only I want my baby I want my giveaways to be big like something you can really use you know I'm not trying to give you no iPhone you may already have a phone I'm not trying to give you I might try to give you something like a Playstation or Xbox you know something like that to new ones that are coming out so if I get to like if I can get to 10,000 subscribers only my 10,000 subscriber I'll probably give away a thousand dollars something like that um will probably do it like that every from 10,000 then every 5,000

cause and in helping my cause appreciate you guys so much I really do now let's get back in it that is don't take that back then it's kind of tasty y'all see that I did that without coffin wait a minute so this is a a good flavor of cannabis smells really nice smells gassy I see the darkness on it as I said before it's real tiny you see it's almost beating my fingernail but yeah it's pretty good so let's go ahead and jump back in this I try to get greedy oh my god you know they always say if you choke in a coffin that means you're too greedy they take the too much smoke more smoking less can handle and I must admit that time I really was trying to be greedy I'm trying to get it all in there [Music] you guys see behind me that it's still dark it is 5:30 in the a.m. and you guys you know what this is the beginning of January 2020 this is January 4th 2020 and it's I guarantee at least 75 degrees out here right now it's really hot you guys see me sit right here and short-sleeve it's really hot I mean I'm actually sweating but it feels nice and this is the reason why I moved here for this in the winter my winters here are like 80 degrees yesterday was 82 degrees anyway let's get back here now I'm really starting to feel it I feel it right here so this is this is more of a head high because I you know when people say that it's a head high or it's a body high you really do feel that it fits a head or a body because this is definitely a head hard it's nice though it's really nice this is the kind of high that makes you want to go play some games I'm about to go in here and get on some modern warfare and get out it's tasty I guess I guess it took me to get to it almost the end of the bone this is the first time that I've almost completely finished a bowl with he does usually I can't even finish the ball or I don't finish it because the wheat is so good this is good but it's good on a different level you ever have weed that was so good that you couldn't stop smoking are you high as gas would you still smoking it yeah that's what did I can see this type [ __ ] being up hey you guys for the next couple days I got some really some new we all cannabis is coming in in you guys need to stick around for that one man check out my new or weeds coming new trees coming anyway I wish you guys the most awesome day you guys know that I like to keep my videos

day I hope you guys have a legendary day you already know I'm gonna say stay bait", "CiymtKvrJRw": "[Music] what is going on you [ __ ] bunch of stoners my name is you went to fight one five guys and I wanted to bring this strain review to you all for a very long time now because as you all know the purple punch is a very well known strain a lot of people talking about it a lot of people getting medicated on it at this moment at the moment so absolutely excited that we've got some here today and that were able to bring you a nice strain review on the channel of this beautiful beautiful medicine so if at any point in time you do enjoy this video guys make sure you smash that like button and if you only do the channel make sure you subscribe and hit that notification bell so you can stay posted when we drop more videos or go live so as you all know we've got our piece nice and clean ready to rock and roll we've got some purple punch chopped up here all prepared ready to go also so we're going to take one one rip here to start off the strain review before we get into some close-ups and then as you all know as we do some close-up shots of the notes I basically like to you know just say little background on the purple punch what we do know about it what we like about it and all that good stuff so as you see we are working with the Cheech and Chong beaker today we've got a nice bowl packed clean as usual you know how we roll so hope you all packed and ready to [ __ ] smoke let us know what you're smoking on down in the comments and let's start this off with a [ __ ] nice call Cheers Wow whoo I always start these things off with a [ __ ] bang all right let's get into some close-ups let's break open some notes and let's look at some undisturbed trichomes all right so I basically want to kick off this strain review by mentioning that this is probably one of the most visually attractive strains that I have picked up in a good while as you can see here from some of the close-ups very very bright orange hairs huge white trichomes absolutely amazing stuff here so as you know we're gonna get some close-ups break open some nugs show some undisturbed trichomes and get into a bit of the background and what we know so as we know the purple punch is a very well known strain going around the community at the moment a lot of people trying it a lot of people smoking it now for all of you guys that haven't tried it yet obviously the strain reviews for you so the purple punch comes with a range of complex aromas the closest thing that I can compare it to from smell and taste is blue Powerade absolutely amazing never smelt or tasted anything like this and it's actually kind of crazy to say that this bud can taste and smell like Blue Parrot so very very cool just want to get into some of the effects here so the effects will include relaxation euphoric happy sleepy and up lifting effects and as you all know this is an indica strains so if you are an indica lover definitely recommend it give it a shot let me know down in the comments if you have tried this before and let's get into some smoking people Cheers so hope you enjoyed them close-ups of the purple punch absolutely amazing flower and super effective and when I first picked up this strain no obviously we did the smell and the taste test and could not put my finger on what it smelt and taste like and then somebody pointed out that it smelt like Blue Parrot or like Gatorade or you know like the powdered drinks drink you get the paved mix you put it in a cup and then you mix it with water like an energy sports drink that's what I could familiarize this stream with I have a bit of a mind blank there so very tasty like berries it's it's like a very nice taste of berries so we're gonna take some more berries to the face hope you all enjoyed this strain review guys like I said make sure you smash that like button if you haven't done so already it is much they appreciated I'm gonna take this second rib to the face first ones already catching up with me so this is probably going to put me to [ __ ] bed very quickly let's do this Cheers oh [ __ ] so if you have not already tried the purple punch from your local delivery service or dispensary I highly recommend it another awesome strain review from the ASA I hope you all enjoyed everybody and you know the [ __ ] drill if you can't cope don't mope here is hope smoke dope I will catch you on the next one you [ __ ] bunch of stoners he said everybody much love [Music] [Music]", "3qqP7SXaAVE": "hi tim here i just wanted to talk about one of the new cartridge products that we got called core pods this is the core pod hawaiian haze is the flavor of this one these are a little different than all the other cartridges that we carry and that they're not actually a cartridge they're a pod system so it's going to use a different type of battery than the standard c cell that the rest of our our cartridges use but i really like these they hit really well they have really good strains this one is hawaiian haze it has like a really nice smooth coconutty flavor really smooth hits really strong and it's from the brand core which if you tried any of our tiara grow flower it's the same same company that's making these core pods really high quality i just really like them be sure to make sure you have the right battery to go with them if you do get them but it's definitely worth the investment to get the battery because they're great great price great effect i really like", "uEIKFMlxKb0": "right [ __ ] what it says on the tin let's actually look at the contents of the tin [Music] probably due to its 50 50. percent sativa and hybrid what am i talking about what am i talking about i can't do reviews i can't do reviews i need i need to have some time to think hello and welcome to look at the wrong way [ __ ] sake start again look that way not there because that's not looking at your eyes and it's disrespectful to my viewers look there right in their eyes start again hello and welcome to another episode of strangers my name is rizzler and this is a wee viewer of raw view weed view raw raise the raw i don't know anyway it's me on my phone taking the easy option not much editing not much production just on the mobile phone and making sure we do some reviews because i've got a bit of a back catalog people are sending me stuff to review and i haven't reviewed it yet but time's ticking and also i'm smoking the strains so we've got hurry up before there's no weed left to review that wouldn't be too good would it no it wouldn't be good at all so what is on today's episode you've probably seen it a few times now but yes cherry gorilla now look at this peeps it's in one of these packets that means the weeds better obviously isn't it that just automatically means weeds better when it's all done nicely there's my posing okay i love posing uh let's get it out let's talk about subscribing because if you haven't subscribed to strain games before then how dare you no it might be your first time there if it is your first time here make sure you hit the sub button hit the like button just assume it's going to be a good video like it already and comment and what else is there share as well yeah make sure you share it sharon's carrying people and i'll be most grateful if you could share this link to other people maybe other stoners out there that haven't seen this before maybe stoners out there that have smoked this string before or maybe people that are not stoners and you're going to send it to them anyway i i don't care either way share that video now enough of this cherry gorilla this is by baraleo i think i've got the pronunciation right parallel and it's got the information on here as well which is always good saves me working out what i'm smoking saves me pressing uh cherry gritter on google what what is this strain i'm going to smell it a few times because it is dank now four things to cover when we do the reviews and we view is where we're looking at the uk strains going around at the moment and this is landed in my hand just like that i wish it was imagine if it just raining bud god please make it rainbow one day come on 2020 has been a bit of a [ __ ] and i think the least you can do is make up by having rain of weed please just eating bud might as well like what am i talking about it's a raw it's a raw audition people which means you're gonna get all this crap i don't cut this stuff out you're getting it all unfortunately i'm sorry about that so yeah four things to cover we're looking at the site we're looking at the smell we're looking at the taste and also we're looking at the effects and someone else my dentists are calling me up oh [ __ ] say what do they want sorry about that but actually was my dentist and uh my teeth are [ __ ] thanks for rona virus i'm blaming you china uh anyway yeah it's now got even less time to do the review because now they're just called up to say we can fit you in before i was had to maybe about a month i have to wait to get my teeth sorted uh but now they've had a cancellation and i get it sorted today which means i've only got a few more minutes to do this review which means stop chatting crap let's get straight down to the point let's cover these four things as i said sight uh i was gonna say sound then never say sound sight smell taste and effect we were scoring these out of 10 so the top score will be 40 and nothing's come close to 40. i think the highest right now strain table right there it's about 35 35 and a half i can't remember but it's there for you where will this hit where will cherry gorilla hit before we even look at the categories we have to do a bit of background knowledge a bit of info for you how did this cherry gorilla come about who was his mummy who was its daddy who invented it who smoked it let's find out it's the history so after a little bit of research in-house genetics apparently famous for their micro breeding and crossing of famous strains and also exclusive strains so this is probably a fine example of crossing the cherry uh black cherry with gorilla glue that's all i could find uh also the percentage is actually not as high as probably one would think about 17 between 16 to 18 thc around about 17 average on this one let's have a little close-up look of the cherry gorilla so i always like it when you've got the information right in front of you and this is a lot of information on there so cherry gorilla 3.5 well it used to be 3.5 until uh yeah i started to smoke it uh contains thc [ __ ] good job if you didn't have thc and i brought my money back not safe for kids or pets duh cherry gorilla is a hybrid kind of a strain well balanced in its effects uh gorilla glue fans get their taste for a generic so mix a genetic mix of gorilla glue 4 and black cherry pie breeders this is in-house genetics and gg4 cross bcp look at that just all properly done for us or even harvest on the 12th of july of 2020. anyone got bags like this they tell you when they're harvest because that's the first time i've ever seen that nice little touch and this is a uh love the uh artwork as well really nice artwork also a 50 50 hybrid that's right straight from the middle no mucking around 50 sativa 50 percent couch bong and grinnell 4 is famous for its couch lock so then got half couch lock here and then half is the non catch lock again tells me what it's good for when it comes to the medicine side of things you've got chronic pain smoke this if you if you're depressed smoke this hey you're feeling nausea i've got something for you take two of these and call me in the morning and loss of appetite you'll never go hungry again well actually no no that's the loss of appetite is the fact that i forget that sorry i've had not much sleep but i have not had much weed as well and i'm gonna be smoking some very very soon i promise y'all promise you've got make this quick video yeah right so quick hurry up hurry up it's now into the categories of the i don't know i'm smelling it i should be looking at it it's the site oh i just dropped it i didn't drop it i just picked it up by really a really really weak part of the bud and then the rest just stayed on the floor so i know a lot of people go he's always dropping the bud officially i didn't drop this bud officially the bud dropped itself before it even took off the ground is that even possible i don't think that counts as dropping no anyway here it is we're looking at the sites out of 10 first of all i think why do i keep smelling it because it smells so lovely i can't wait for category number two but stop spinning it okay looking at this right now no let's be serious we're never serious on string killers are we if you want serious read reviews you're on the wrong [ __ ] channel i'll tell you that now anyway sound effects oh there's no sound effects because i'm going raw i keep forgetting i'm raw [ __ ] i've got no powers look nothing's happening ah hold on [Music] i've got a little bit of power okay so let's look at this site first thing i'm noticing about this is the crystals is very powdered very frosty extremely frosty uh and probably the most frost i've seen on a gorilla glue strain or grilling glue cross very light in color very very light in color yellowy light greens here and the shapes of these buds again not big fat round ones they're all very quite thin yeah so as i said the buds are not that fat and big they're all very similar shapes actually um sight on this one going to score up very quickly because we've got to hurry up i'm going to give this because of the frost it does help it out not your hardest of nugs definitely not that compressed that was a bit tired to be honest but still a lot of give so i'm gonna give this a seven and a half for its site average right now just average but don't worry we're smelling it now we've got seven and a half for the site we're smelling it and i cannot stop smelling it it really does have that green more or less gorilla glue smell coming from here can't really smell black cherry i think i've had the black cherry before so i wouldn't know what to look out for or smell out for but uh it is lovely easily slight bit of citrusy fruitness in there and i always find a bit of fruitness from the gorilla glue so i don't know if there's also some cherry going in there as well but mainly uh diesely the diesel dirt these will dirt with a hint of citrusy berry and i know that's weird because berries aren't citrusy but right now that's exactly what i'm getting berry citrus is that is that even legal it's against the law you can't say that i'm going to smoke this i'm not i'm not going to like give this to some innocent person and they can get coronavirus now if i've got the corona it's only me that's going to be affected and i can't affect myself can i so stop sticking up your nose [Music] it's a really nice smell uh not the nicest is in like i've had because i'm loving this because it's dank but there's other dankier smells out there from other strains but i do like the smell so i'm gonna score this up i'm gonna give it an eight eight seven and a half and eight let's go quick we've gotta hurry up let's go to the taste and i do have to skin this up okay i've got the joint rolled up we're running out of time i've gotta go dennis soon let's have a painkiller also i'm just guaranteed that someone's going to knock on my door or someone's going to ring the phone so i'll hurry up people do apologize although this is a complete new format well it's not a completely new format but it's an old format that i'm bringing back again slightly different because i'm using my phone and trying to do it all in one take yeah right as if that's going to happen i'll do my best the main thing is to get these reviews out there quicker than i am doing right now at the moment third category the taste you actually do you know what you can't really smell the cherry when they're smelling it you can definitely taste the cherry on this i'm a fan of cherry tasting stuff as well i had a black cherry alcopop yesterday so i've still got cherry fresh in the brain yeah definitely cherry also you're getting your diesel dieselness from the gorilla glue still quite sweet as well i always think grilla glue's taste is not as a strong point it's definitely more on the effects uh for gorilla glue four it's very dirty strain taste i think this is a sweeter version this is like grilling four but a sweeter version of it i've heard that some people can taste coffee in this again one of them tastes that you think more of once you know about it so now i know there's there's coffee in there or no i know the people have tasted coffee from the strain i can now taste coffee from it but to be honest with you and i want to be as honest as i possibly can if someone gave me this and told me to write down 10 tastes that i'm getting from this i don't think coffee would be one of them but i can see where they come from it is a bit of a coffee taste to this its main taste though is definitely the gorilla glue diesel with diesel edge and then the sweetness from it as well these are nice i mean i do like the taste of gorilla glue some people don't like it some people don't like a lot of people i know do not like any kind of diesel strains they think they get headaches from them and they don't like the taste of them as well that's not me i actually do like the taste of grilling glue and i think this tastes better than grilling for yeah definitely screw it up i'm gonna give this a high one actually for the taste better than the sight better than the smell the taste of grilling glue to the taste black cherry cross gorilla glue form which is black cherry get that right so i can't do it i've gotta have some takes i've got something it takes gotta do it again where was i let's begin black cherry definitely tasting the griller glue from this however i can't remember what i was gonna say i completely put myself off i'm gonna score this high we had seven and a half for the site we had eight for the smell for the taste of it i'm gonna give it an eight and a half really happy so we're going up half and half and half does that mean when we get down to the effects we're gonna give this a nine find out because we are now covering the effects the effects what is it doing to me right now well i've spoke this a few times uh prior to this review so i know the effects already i'm not going to give the effects after smoking it for a few seconds that would be stupid but i know the effects are definitely uh a mixture of the two the black cherry and the gorilla glue the gorilla glue 4 is usually just pure up couch luggage not going to be moving it's gonna among you out and you're getting that massive body gloopy feeling dripping down from your head all the way down to your toes uh i know from smoking this i've smoothly during the daytime as well in fact i've actually waken baits with this and i've carried on as normal um probably due to this specific probably due to its 50 probably due to its 50 50 percent sativa and hybrid what am i talking about what am i talking about i can't do reviews i can't do reviews i need i need to have some time to think pick up anyone that does do these reviews and does it first take because that is a lot of hard work and experience i think you have to be experienced on talking so much without these things happening i just can't do it i really can't do it but yes the effects 50 50. would it be giving me 50 50 on the effects i think so because yes couch lockage definitely i could feel that nice warm gloopy gloppy stone body stoneless feeling from head to toe but i have been very creative on this i have been doing lots of editing i've been doing lots of work lots of housework on the house i'm a housewife believe it or not yes so this does not stop me during my um daily chores uh if i was smoking critical four yeah i wouldn't be doing [ __ ] or i'll be literally on the sofa and pissing my pants and [ __ ] myself i wouldn't be that bad but yeah you know what i mean this it feels like i'll be having enough energy to get off the couch and go to the toilet so this would stop me from pooing myself so if you're pouring yourself on gorilla glue four just get black cherry a mixture in it and get the gorilla cherry you'd be fine to go to the toilet you'll have enough energy to wipe your own bum so the effects [Laughter] on the effects on this is gonna score again another another higher one and you know what i'm not doing this to keep the nice pattern going like that but i am going to give this a nine for the effects we've gone seven and a half we've gone eight we've got eight and a half we've gone nine i've never had that happen before on a weed view and i promise you it's not on purpose it's the way i feel this is very good uh my eyes look at my eyes my eyes are getting heavy already i can feel that already and that's a good sign to say that this is working only 17 roughly thc oh and someone's at my door hold on and hopefully no more interruptions let's finish this off yes so even though it is um more of a body stone this i still am getting quite uplifting effects i wish my eyes were uplifting they're not they're down lifting um here they are getting really heavy my eyes but yeah very uplifting still i'm still talking quite quickly and my speech would be affected with the gorilla glue on it just on its own but the black cherry is definitely keeping me going i'm guessing black cherry must be a sativa or a hybrid gorilla glue's a hybrid this is 50 50. i can't remember the last time i had a streak down the middle sativa indica hybrid how about yourself let us know in the comments section i also find from gorilla glue it's not really a happy strain to smoke you're not really like oh really happy and cheerful it's more i'm like down now well i still feel quite happy and um yeah just get about my daily strain which is good best of both worlds so i'm really liking this for the effects as i said i'm giving it a nine it's gone up try and let this up in fact let's not do that i've got a little bit of power i've got a little bit of power and here is the score for cherry gorilla also known as cherry gorilla glue um but yeah cherry cherry gorilla or cg if we quit cg probably not but yeah cherry gorilla loving this really liking it there's the score sorry it's going all over the place but i am trying a new format to get these views out there the wii views are one of my favorites to record but they also one of the hardest to edit as well so this one hopefully not too much editing should be out very soon hopefully get it out with the next day or two it is wednesday today it's a weed's day so it wouldn't be nice because they always film my reviews on a wednesday but they never come out on a wednesday unless it's like two or three years after that wednesday then they usually come out but yeah hopefully i can get this out today so wednesday the 20 is it the 30th i don't know what's the [ __ ] date wednesday the 30th september is it out did it go out today let me know in the comment section below actually you don't need to let me know in the comment section below because i'm the person that uploads it so i will know as well if i make me on deadline or not anyway i'm walking way too much this is cherry gorilla cross with black cherry and gorilla glue 4 great great hybrid smoked it before let us know in the comments section did you enjoy this video or would you prefer the other weed views that take quite some time to make if you did like it let us know in the comment section below my name is rizzler this is strangers i'll see you later bye you", "ESQcy20OCyY": "[Music] what's going on dickweeds today we're gonna try some black mamba never got from can abysmal oh my [ __ ] aim wow that's really [ __ ] strong let me grab a bun to show you guys let's take it up to the board check it out eh it's really dark looking you see little crystals on they're all over the place everywhere Hey there's little crystals everywhere well what a strong smell I see some hidden red hairs looks almost gray in some areas there's a little bit of purple down there I don't know if you guys could see it or not there's a lot of different colors going on in there but they're all it seems like all the colors are hidden under a gray hue hey a gray hue is that what you call it a great you I don't know whatever anyway pretty nice-looking eh I hope you guys got a good enough look I hope you had a good peep hey I hope you had a good peep I hope you had a good peep anyway I don't know if this is the middle hopefully it is whatever um I'm gonna grind this [ __ ] up and uh like always we'll get the show on the road Hey there it is all grinded up this is an early morning waking Bank featuring Black Mamba from can abismo [Music] [ __ ] line I got some gummy worms and a cold can of coca-cola hey it seems coca-cola pears laced with every strain of weaves if there is at least that's what I think [Music] anyway um anyone let me shut the light off I think there's too much light here that's better I don't think it changed much did it not enough light coming in from the Sun anyway um the smell it smells real nice hey it smells real good it's got a pretty strong smell though if you're trying to hide it from your your parents or somebody you're not gonna be able to it's pretty strong it's not very smoky it is that first when you blow it out but it kind of it kind of banishes hey it just vanishes it just [ __ ] disappears the taste I'm not too sure let's do another bong toke I'm not too sure what it tastes like to me the packaging says pungent sweet and grape I don't think I've tasted any of that stuff but then again my taste buds are a little [ __ ] hey um there might be an after effect of the grape you know what I mean but not grape it's kind of like if you had something that might have been great flavor but you had it a long [ __ ] time ago and the taste might still be a little bit you know a little bit of a lingering taste there there might still be a little bit of a lingering taste but not really grape is more of the after effect of eating it you know that kind of the fruity taste but not I do not explain it [ __ ] I'm not good at explaining those things and sweet well that would go along with the grape their the fruity taste and pungent I mean what the [ __ ] plunge it means so huh [ __ ] pungent hmm and effects yeah let's talk about the effects here it's this happy relaxed and sleepy I feel pretty [ __ ] happy I'm feeling really relaxed but the sleepy part I'm not feeling because I've got a pretty high tolerance a it takes a lot to uh you know to put me to sleep so maybe by the end of the day you know maybe at the end of the day I might be sleepy but right now I just [ __ ] woke up so it's not gonna put me back to sleep for a whole day it's gonna take a long time so yeah if you don't smoke it a lot I could tell that it probably it probably put you for a nap but I smoke the [ __ ] every single day you know what I mean I smoke a lot of weed so it takes a lot to make me sleepy hey just sayin let's see if there's any uh let's see if there's a refri a bonus toke hey there's a little bonus tok hey a little one I'm gonna fill my bowl back up we do another bong toke but before I do I hope I hope you guys can see my rating system here Donna still hasn't made it bigger for me says shitty decent and oh my [ __ ] and right now the black bomba I would give it somewhere in between decent and oh my [ __ ] it's right in between decent and oh my flock I would definitely buy this again I can live with this strain if if this was the last strain left on the planet Earth I don't think I'd complain I don't think you guys complain either or [ __ ] I think I sent that wrong a [ __ ] what I meant to say is I don't think you guys would complain either I hope I said it right that time see you can tell it's good weeds I'm [ __ ] up all my words anyway let me fill my bowl back up um it's got that nice gray look to it ain't it's not exactly green it's more of a I guess you'd say like maybe a military green hey a military green would that be like a darker green like a grayish color almost I think so maybe not [ __ ] anyway that's what it looks like though it's a dark green with with you know let's play it like I was saying earlier if you upgrade over it it's good camouflage weeds you wouldn't want to drop it outside you probably wouldn't find it again I don't know if that in that [ __ ] even made sense let me just fill my [ __ ] Bowl I like the way it grinds up it gives it a nice fluff hey when you grind up a little bud it fluffs up and you can tell that it's gonna go up you know it's gonna go pretty far like the pile I showed you a few minutes ago when it was all grinded up that was that was only three little buds make small little [ __ ] and a fluff trade up so I like that when it grinds up like that you know it's not too dry it's not too moist it's just perfect enough to fluff up for you you know it's fluffy hey [ __ ] I hope that makes sense to you guys I probably [ __ ] this review up eh let me start again I could probably do this better this smells strong but it smells really good and it starts off smoky but the smoke vanishes hey like a ghost on scooby-doo and [ __ ] vanishes it just disappears the taste a little bit like grape maybe sweet a little bit and pungent I don't [ __ ] know off to look that word up I'm not you're a pungent means I don't use the word pungent ever the feel and whatever happy relaxed definitely I'm definitely happy and relaxed huh too sleepy yeah I could feel that that's a thing but just like I said I have a high tolerance so it's not going to put me to sleep but it's going to take probably a day of smoking this before I get tired but if you don't smoke it a lot just probably a nap in your afternoon or even in your morning or probably within 20 minutes after you smoke it hey just saying am i rating I gave it between the decent and and all my [ __ ] you know it's really good and you should go and get yourself some you don't know what you're missing this is my first time ever having black mamba and I think I'm gonna add it to one of my to one of my [ __ ] hot I'm gonna add it to my list of favorites because I think this is one of my favorites now I like this one I drew [ __ ] but the toad twisters are coming out now hey [ __ ] anyway I really like this one this strain I hope I find some seeds in here probably not I haven't seen one yet [ __ ] I like to cross on my own hey I'm having a hard time finding good seeds though maybe it's just me but I could almost smell a hit the chocolate in there damn maybe not maybe I'm just gonna creating for chocolate and that's probably what it is but I think of smelling chocolate probably not but I think I am no well anyway sorry about the [ __ ] sirens under the Timmins Ontario so that happens all the time there's always something happening somewhere Hey we she goes anyway Oh [ __ ] um I don't even remember what the [ __ ] I was talking about I think I answered everything though I hope I don't know if you really get the munchies or not because like I just started smoking it and I was just eating the gummy worms because they were here thirsty it makes you thirsty but I find every strain makes you thirsty I used to smoke dirty cigarettes and they made me thirsty Hey just saying that's the wait for the THC infused Coca Cola to come out if it ever comes out or maybe it didn't come out I don't think it came out yet but it might us probably not [ __ ] I don't know I have to look it up [ __ ] hey anyway um yeah might have another bonus token here a little bonus toke a [ __ ] ranks Don is supposed to be here later on so she'll be doing a review video also of the Black Mamba I think you guys all seen the label earlier if not rewind the video and take another look hey take another peep hey good then come back to watch the rest of this [ __ ] yeah Donna's gonna be here in a little while well in quite a little while actually not for nothing later on I don't even know what I'm saying [ __ ] this weeds real good right now it's early in the morning it's like seven o'clock and Donna won't be here till a boat like four or five closer to supper so if you're waiting for her review all day long and you're wondering where it is it's only Christian won't be here till later on it'll still be up later on today just relax you know relax um um I'm just look good I'm just full haha I can't talk the Black Mamba [ __ ] up your words I'm trying to say I'm just filling up my bowl well it's full hey yeah I still got to go and take a shower scrub the old meet cigarette [ __ ] it's supposed to be hot as [ __ ] today it's like in the thirty somewhere up there I'll probably take the black Mambo t'side and sit in the Sun and do some fog talks and it'll probably hit me harder hey um I don't know what else to say it's really good I know you guys you guys are saying hurry the [ __ ] up in the [ __ ] video already I want to go down to can abysmal and get some black Mambo before [ __ ] sells out well go ahead stop the video right now go to Canada bismal order up some black bar but I tell you spell it hopefully you can see it for those you that don't know how to spell get a pen write it down hurry up head over to [ __ ] chant abysmal pick yourself up some Black Mamba Hey [ __ ] rights it's really good you won't regret it you will not regret it I know I don't regret it is this what it feels like when you're bit by a black mamba I don't know I've never been bit by a black mamba go down to can abysmal and get yourself bit by a black mamba hey I don't even know what that [ __ ] made sense [ __ ] anyway one one bogged oh hey one more for the road a road toke hey and it's smooth this [ __ ] a bomb I don't know about a joint

cross between the granddaddy purple and the Durban poison and the effects include relaxation euphoria creativity and up lifting effects and the smell and taste is a very sweet and earthy sort of herbal smell and taste to the strain very very nice I could refer it or say that it is similar to sort of a garlicky sort of smell very interesting as I said first time ever trying it so super stoked

oil in there golden uh yellow oil in there nice uh translucent this particular strain is a half gram cartridge over there from move florida like i've said 50 for the half gram black mamba is a indica the lineage of this parent of this strain the parents are unknown but thought to be uh gdp or granddaddy purple crossed with black domina or black domina and i think both those strains uh accurately represent this at least the uh granite purple of course it's very similar to that granddaddy perp uh with effects as well as uh taste particular thc in this batch is 430 milligrams per half gram cartridge or 86 percent and uh 1.8 cbd in this particular batch i'm glad move actually put the uh stuff there on the package i know it's backwards but black mamba they're up top 430 milligrams 0.9 and that's it's half grams 1.8 but yeah you got your vape pure there this particular batch was harvested and packaged uh this was june 8th 2020. now that we got that out of the way guys let's go ahead and get another rip in before we get some more information and uh go ahead get that out of the way we got your blunts your bongs your joints your vape pens whatever you do to get it nice and right get nice and medicated with me let's go ahead and get this cheers everyone the particular blood structure of this strain is said to be very dark green hard dense buds with purple and dark green leaves uh sugar leaves on those i definitely agree with that i've never seen the buds of this particular strain but from what i i can taste in the pictures i've seen online i definitely agree with that according to leafly it helps patients with stress insomnia and pain definitely agree with the insomnia uh the couple times i have medicated on this i've only done it a couple so far but um very sleepy definitely had it definitely holds true to those uh og uh what's it called og uh what am i saying og gdp genetics there they say this strain had me feeling clear-headed mellow i would definitely say it's a nice indica to have a conversation on or uh listen to some great music you definitely enjoy it we're gonna go ahead and get another room here guys cheers make sure you check me out over there

definitely it'll give me a nice nap or perhaps watch some uh some tv clutch up on some tv i don't know yet for fifty dollars can't beat it i like this a little better than that blueberry one i previously reviewed if you haven't checked out that blueberry cartridge review definitely go check that one out like just like this pure i believe i did that last week and for fifty dollars for the half gram here on that medical market that's not very not very bad competitive wise i should say for the price i mean i think the cheapest distance cartridge we have right now is either the 30 ones over there from one plant which i don't like or the 35 dollar ones pop azure cartridges over there from liberty health sciences i believe i believe those are the two cheapest but um yeah i think it's worth more to pay for those better terps as well as i think it's a little better quality distillate as well go ahead and get one more rip here cheers everyone i don't know if i said the smell and the taste on the strain um i would say it's sweet fruity and peppery in my opinion and that would be for the smell and the taste uh the taste the fruit in there i can't decide if it's citrus or grape in my opinion maybe a little bit of both but it reminds me of that granddaddy purple in uh no contest i would say i would whoever guessed that on the genetics i would say is pretty damn close i want to say this is named after that basketball basketball player kobe bryant that passed away i'm not sure though because they did call him black mamba don't quote me on that though this is a little bit stronger of a cartridge over there distance-wise 86 percent i'm liking that as well i think that last one i reviewed was i want to say 75 i'm not mistaken really good i've been enjoying this uh truly battery as well i've been only had to charge it a couple times i think i've charged it i wanna say twice now in the three weeks i've had it maybe four weeks the only thing i do hate about it is that magnet there on the bottom that metal piece is very strong with the mechanism there inside i think you can see that you gotta pull pretty hard i can't get a grip on it with my fingers i mean look how big that is i can't i can't get a grip on that i gotta use my shirt or some kind of cloth but besides that i like it all the same especially the little window here you can see how much product you have left it works out a lot you got just over just over half there all right in conclusion definitely enjoy this uh pure black mamba cartridge over there from move florida and uh definitely recommend it to indica lovers as well as people that enjoy i guess granddaddy purple you know or moved products moves dislike in general it definitely holds up to uh products and the consistency of uh what moves putting out over there go ahead and get one more rip here everyone and get out of your hair this is weed funny signing off spoke with me so good for your mama have a great rest of your day everyone cheers have a great day everyone sweet 27 now peace", "TgNJkTx6L1M": "[Music] listen to the beat again drank it but with concentrated smoke another suite against their delivery pilot trying to make some hot [ __ ] Oh was good with it she's avoiding a lot of cookies again for another strength tasters cannabis reviews episode and today we're going back man we're throwing it back with some classic gaps as I say it it kicks in we're doing a review today on noble Farms cherry pie cherry pie being the classic strain this is like one of the first strains I ever grew cherry pie if you haven't had it it's a super gassy sweet flavored strain that like probably was the like one of the first strains to lead to all the exotic strings that we have now like this was this was one of those strings when it came out everybody was raving about yo you need to get some cherry pie literally I remember 2009 2008 member whenever cherry pie first came out and it was available in California to buy it record but not wreck shops medical shops I drove all the way to San Francisco 7:00 in the morning and bought like 10 cherry pie clothes and I was like my first real borough I grew a bunch of different stuff granddaddy purple cherry pie whatever was available back then but that was I bought it at burners club - that was a funny thing I bought it the THC which is the hemp center that was a burnished Club way back in the day but yeah man this cherry pie right here super fire from noble Farms hello affordable I got the [ __ ] for 35 dollars and eight and it's way worth it as soon as I opened it boom kicked me right in the face with that sweet gassy smell new right away just because I grew this before I smoked tons of it I knew right away okay that's 100% cherry pie done right smells good looks great - tastes [ __ ] amazing cherry pie is across a lot of granddaddy purple and Durbin poison both of those super sought-after gasps strains so putting those together is what brought this [ __ ] beautiful bun to fruition and yeah man this uh this one right here is tested in at 23 percent THC zero percent CBD yes fire its fire like for me I give cherry pie on the on the rating scale like specifically Nobel forms I give there's like an 8.5 because it looks good smells good tastes good and it's affordable could it have been more gassy and more sweet absolutely you know it's a hybrid strain so it's not really like super into kendama knit like I like or super heavy you know that's kind of what I'd look for what I'm trying to find a weed that I like but if you're somebody who looks for a balance a balance strain that's gonna give you a little bit of both I would definitely recommend this and for the price link you can buy two weights to this you know for around the price that you're gonna get 1/8 of like some exotic [ __ ] and I think this is [ __ ] it's not all the way in the 90s but it's it's right there it's gas so I would [ __ ] with it but yeah man [ __ ] I'm definitely gonna look for more stuff from noble Farms I first time ever happened them first I'm tryna I was over there at Green Theory on a bell red and one of the budtender said man you gotta try this stuff right here and uh I grunt cherry pies I said you know let me take that chance see if they got it and then very pleased with noble form so eight point five noble Farms cherry pie oh yeah make sure you guys keep an eye out and go look for that and once the game man there's been another quick review from strain tasters cannabis reviews support a lot of cookies [Music]", "sINnYmma-9s": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary today is a classic ass episode which means edible review but this is not a company that is new to us but it is new to us in the world of edibles uh that is because it's from moxie the folks over at moxie uh we've actually reviewed a few products from them um i know we've done a couple of carts and live resin where they have a different branding mx by moxie there but now they are in the edibles game with the classic cannabis infused gummy uh it seems like if you are a weed company and you want to branch out from whatever your starting project product is you go gummies and that's what looks like it's happening with moxie uh this packaging is pretty uh nice it's uh kind of like a aluminum can little puck here uh pretty substantial actually uh this little tin is not cheap i'm sure uh but you got all the stuff you want to see on it uh we've got our lab testing results here on the side uh and then we've got uh our dosage instructions which these are uh 10 milligram gummies they're 10 10 milligram gummies in here for 100 milligrams in total uh and these gummies cost me 17 bucks at my dispensary which puts them at the ever so slightly above average price point for a 100 milligram gummy in my neck of the woods uh it does say on here that uh moxie has won 90 plus industry awards neat uh i always find those things to be more annoying than edifying or clarifying uh if you're not gonna tell us what awards you've won uh why should i believe you anyways uh we need some more uh you know packaging regulations here but uh that's neither here nor there let's get to the moxie good stuff i did not actually mention what flavor this is it is the member berry flavor or strain i guess i didn't realize there was a member berry strain before this it does show member berries on there uh i don't know what k i assume member barry got its name from the south park episode which minor rant here boy south park uh on the air for 24 seasons now i remember back when people were making jokes about the simpsons getting along in the tooth back around it's like 15th 16th 17th season uh and now we here we are with south park uh at its 24th season i think there was even a time where south park mocked the simpsons for being uh so long in the tooth that is not to knock south park it's just crazy how long actually and resilient that show has been around anyways member berries uh i don't actually have never seen the episode i don't really watch south park anymore still appreciate what those fine folks do but um i do remember hearing on the internet for about 24 hours people saying remember when a member something like that remember barry who knows uh i assume it tastes just like berries uh let's go ahead and get into this edible here this is 17 thing of gummies uh with my experiences with moxie have been good uh nothing to write a home about like um totally fine makers of cartridges uh and i've had some of their wax before too in non-cartridge form and found it to be totally unobjectionable uh nothing stand out but nothing uh to be suspicious of either all right well here is our here are our gummies rather got a little moxie logo on them uh 10 gummies in there i i guess the idea that every gummy has to be five milligrams everything has to be five milligrams is becoming irrelevant that was a law but i see everything lots of things now uh packaged as 10 milligrams so uh getting lax cool shut up siri she keeps thinking i'm talking to her uh anyways here is our moxie member berry let's give this a shot hmm wow very pleasant very pleasant starting taste um kind of a chewier gummy i don't really need to tell you what a gummy gummy's gonna taste like it's pretty fruity to start uh but there is actually a very strong cannabis aftertaste i mean it's not grotesque most gummies don't get uh offensively bad you've got enough sugar in there to mask the taste but there is a pretty strong weed aftertaste here so if you are very sensitive to it watch out fine for the first two or three seconds and then there it is actually about five alarm weed taste there you got a couple of seconds uh before it really hits you wow that is powerful that is one of the uh more weedy tasting gummies that i've had uh in some time i wonder how they infused uh if they did something different it looks like uh same process as far as i can tell just a very strong weed taste uh that does make me a little optimistic that these are gonna be pretty potent uh there's not necessarily a total correlation between oh well somebody just subscribed apparently that's what that noise was um there's not always a correlation between taste and potency but there sometimes is so fingers crossed that these member berries are going to be as potent as we hope uh for me guys i am gonna eat all 10 of these it's probably going to take me oh i'm going to do over the next half hour 45 minutes or so and then 90 minutes two hours after i have that last one i'll come right back here and let you guys know the most important part about the edible review is it gonna get you high and i've got really really high hopes no pun intended for these with that aftertaste until then guys thanks for sticking around we'll see you right back here in just a bit oh there it is bye welcome back to wheats guys it has been about uh just over two hours since i had my first member berry uh cannabis infused gummy from moxie and that is a really sticky inside of a container there a lot of residue anytime i'm talking about residue it means i'm pretty high uh so these are pretty good gummies these are um i would say um on the good end of average the high end of average they're uh good not outstanding not the absolute best i've ever had uh not the best test tasting gummies by a long shot but they are certainly going to get the job done uh for anybody who is familiar with 100 milligram edibles um 100 milligram gummies uh if they work for you these are going to do the job they are just a total uh thumbs up in terms of quality uh really the only thing to talk about here uh is gonna be the taste and price uh the taste didn't offend me that much uh i quite used to a pretty bitter cannabis aftertaste and uh there was that potency you want with the with that uh taste but it is a stronger cannabis aftertaste if you're looking for gummies with no weed taste these aren't for you uh and that these were the only other thing to mention is that these weren't the cheapest gummies these aren't the cheapest gummies available at my dispensary um so i would not necessarily buy these myself because i know that i can get just as good of a gummy for a cheaper price at my dispensary say a um punch edibles or a buddha's best they have a couple of different gummies at a i at my place for sometimes uh like five bucks cheaper than these so that is a thing to consider uh it really is just going to depend on the price at your dispensary because there is nothing again in this package that's going to say uh it's worth a premium over any other gummy um but you know totally perfunctory and good i'd say these moxie may not have moxie but they have gumption gumption what a weird word speaking of gumption no speaking of moxie let's do a little cherry on top we're gonna do something with some real moxie uh and cherry on tops by the way anytime we have a review that we like we like to give a little something extra that's not weed related uh and let's do something with as i said somebody with some moxie now normally i have a policy i don't like to uh give any cherry on tops for anything that i've actually finished uh because you know i like to it's a wheat thing we we do the entire experience but i've been enjoying this book so much i'm confident that even though i've only got about a uh i don't know a couple dozen pages or so left to go i'm confident that i'm still uh if enjoyed enough to give it my recommendation and that book is a nonfiction book by the author maria konokova uh former writer for the new yorker called the biggest bluff uh she is a fantastic writer and a psychology phd from harvard uh who uh decided to take a break from writing and instead uh spend a year training to become a poker champ after having never played poker uh she just decides that she wants to see what it's all about but really it's a book about how to make good decisions how to avoid making bad decisions why poker is a good analog for decision making it's a pretty fascinating stuff she's an excellent writer it's a really cool concept again the book is the biggest bluff by maria konakova uh that is an excellent book from an author who has a lot of moxie and somebody who has a little bit of moxie is moxie and their member um edible i almost forgot that's what we were talking about but that is what we were here for pretty good from them really good from maria and that guys is gonna do it for everything here on wheats until we see you for our next review or whatever it is stay high more importantly stay healthy we'll see you then goodbye", "DrxGuBejbZY": "happy Monday everybody dr. Leslie Apgar coming at you live from greenhouse wellness we're doing our medical Monday today got the lovely Sierra behind the camera if you need anything if you have any questions don't hesitate to just write right in and Sierra will let me know any of your comments or questions today we are talking about our featured strain and our featured special it's good all week long and I know some of you guys have already put this in your shopping carts and that's awesome because when it's gone it's gone we're talking about ak-47 okay a key 47 is sort of a sleeper people don't realize how powerful this strain actually is it's a mid range it is great for all kinds of things I'm going to get into all of that first I'm going to tell you a little bit about exactly what is in a k47 so the THC is 13.3% and what people don't sometimes realize guys is that THC is a very very very potent molecule and it is potentiated or made stronger by the different terpenes that are in the plant and this strain has a lot of cool terpenes that are gonna make that THC a little bit stronger but I'm going to talk a little bit more about that CBG it has a little bit as 0.2% it also has a trace of CBD and CBN okay now as far as terpenes it has some awesome terpenes it has alpha and beta I mean so it's gonna be really good for concentration and focus it has mercy in which as everybody knows increases the permeability of the blood-brain barrier makes it more potent it's what's in mangos we talked to you guys about if you need to potentiate your effects of cannabis you have some mango before you ingest it you're gonna have a bigger effect it also has carrion which is funny enough good for bone growth Terpening everybody well not everybody but most of you know that Terpening is good for cancer so that's a good one for if you're fighting cancer signing which is an anti-inflammatory anti-bacterial and anti-fungal and then it has limonene which is always the great mood elevator it's also good for the gut so it's really good for inflammatory bowel disease eucalyptol which is also called see neol is an anti-cancer anti-inflammatory and antibacterial so that's great so what people describe with ak-47 is a very mellow feeling relaxed but still able to concentrate and get things done and able to focus so great when you need to get some tasks done great if you have chronic pain or inflammation inflammation or inflammatory conditions it does not put you down it lets you still be functional which so many of our patients are asking for for a daytime strain so it gets your creative juices flowing but it allows you to keep concentration going and it's just great for pain so our special to 8th of ak47 plus a gram of ak-47 Keith for wait for it $99 ok and like I said I know some of you guys have already taken advantage of that and it's in your shopping cart the other thing I wanted to let you know is that we're all out of the Larry what was it Larry og shatter that went really fast but happily we have a few more of the Deadhead OG 1 grams or $40 so get those before they're gone guys because I know we only have a little bit left and then the last special was to remind you that if you bring a friend and this is again up at the end of the week but if you bring a friend with you or you send a friend in who is new to our dispensary you guys both get 20% off which is fantastic so definitely take advantage of that so any questions there cierra awesome anything else you think we should touch on today no you covered it all okay so guys just please understand that this is a fabulous strain I promised you I would tell you a little bit more a little bit more about the THC and what's cool about our special is that you can use the ak-47 eight as they are but if you need to amp up if you've got really severe pain or you need to have a potentiated effect or an exaggerated effect that's where the keith comes in and you can add that and then now you've got the ability to titrate your flower or your experience to exactly what you need which I do love so it is a fantastic sale and it's also fantastic medicine because like I said you can dose yourself appropriately and get the best effects that you need to help you with your inflammatory disorders your chronic pain great for mood elevation for anxiety great for inflammatory bowel disease okay guys so please take advantage of our special and we will see you next Monday bye guys", "3wD0KpsGIhI": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats and it is tincture time guys one of my favorite things to review here on your marijuana review show uh we are taking a look at a product from select we've reviewed quite a few things from select in the past they're sort of the jack of all trades of uh marijuana companies we've reviewed carts i think i've reviewed um disposables um they're in a lot of different uh markets select they're selling a lot of different products and one of those is the tincture and they have a pretty uh wide tincture line now have had it for a while with a whole bunch of different kinds of dosages and mixtures between thcs and cbds and different potencies and yada yada yada so this one here i purchased at a dispensary in long beach for 50 i believe um and it is a pretty good value for what you get inside of this box and it is a little confusing i'll show you here um so this is a one to one tincture uh one to one thc cbd one milligram for one milligram however that's not actually true uh it does say there this is the unflavored 500 milligram thc 500 milligram cbd well actually there's a sticker up here clarifying it's actually 600 milligrams thc and 513 cbd so you get a little extra great who doesn't love that uh and then uh as i said this is their unflavored i think they also have like lemon and ginger other things uh and on the side we've got our dosing uh sort of guidelines um they recommend that each full dropper is 10 milligrams which is a single serving and they say this whole uh tincture bottle has 60 droppers in total which makes sense for 600 milligrams of thc um so we've reviewed a lot of tinctures here i really like tinctures uh they usually work pretty well for me and i absolutely love the form factor uh we'll be doing this one sublingually like we do with most of our tinctures under the tongue which means it actually comes on quite a bit quicker than if you were just taking it like any other edible uh the effects can start to hit as soon as about 15 minutes and really get going at about 45. um so uh let's go ahead and get this open i was looking okay so this is uh an mct oil based um tincture i was wondering what their base was and it is mct oil which is basically just coconut oil so it is coconut oil but just a specific uh chain of molecules i guess um okay so let's open her up our one-to-one drops now i'm not particularly a big cbd guy uh it's not something that is especially um helpful or useful for me i i don't really um uh get a lot of benefit from cbd uh more power to everybody who does i'm i'm glad you really enjoy it uh i don't dislike cbd it's just it doesn't seem to have much of an effect on me but i will definitely keep an eye out uh because this one is almost equal parts cbd in here as well we'll see if that makes me feel any different than the normal thc review uh so like all of our weed reviews we're gonna do uh or excuse me tincture reviews we do uh 100 milligrams not the whole thing and not just a single dropper i like to do that as our baseline for pretty much every tincture so that would mean 10 full droppers of this is going to be our dose we'll see how that goes uh i'll probably do three or four two or three four on camera with you and then the uh remainder that i will be doing the next you know six seven i will probably do on a live stream i've been doing a lot of live streaming thank you to everybody joining in um and i'll probably do uh a little bit more there so i hope to see some of you guys join in for our live streams anyways i'm going to shut up now and i'm going to go and open this up and get this process started smells like nothing at all not a thing okay i'm expecting this to taste uh very neutral uh as mct oil tinctures normally are uh not able to get the full milligram it's only about the 75. got to keep that in mind i have to do uh maybe closer to 13 drops in total uh hung ahaha [Music] um [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] okay that's all i'm gonna do um i i there are uh various opinions about how long you should leave it i usually go for about a minute or two and that seems to do the trick pretty well uh and as i i suspected largely tasteless just that vaguely kind of coconutty oil aftertaste um but it's so un you know it's just it's it's really uh it's not a big deal at all i took three droppers full and don't even feel like i uh need to rinse my mouth out or anything um so in terms of the uh unflavoredness of this tincture it is really unflavored um so we've done our first three or two and a half worth droppers there i've got another you know we'll say 10 to do because i wasn't able to get the full one dropper uh and as i said i'm gonna hope to do some of that with you guys on a live stream uh before i wrap this review up oh i think i forgot to mention uh like all of our wheat's reviews after i do my 10th dropper or so uh about two hours or so after that i'll come back here and let you guys know if this select one to one cbd thc tincture is as good as i am hoping until then stay high stay healthy hi guys i am back about three and a half hours after our first journey with the select one to one drops 600 milligrams of thc in the very specific 513 milligrams of cbd that's not how much i did i did about between 100 and 150 milligrams would be my guess which is probably between 80 and 120 milligrams of cbd and a lot of you got to hang out with me while i was reviewing this we did a little bit of a live stream and i appreciate everyone who tuned in uh and to all those who were there you probably remember that i liked this quite a bit this is very good um an affordable tincture i see it for about 50 bucks normally which is already a good deal for 600 milligrams of thc then you get the added bonus of that one to one cbd double-year cannabinoid goodness um so normally the cbd stuff doesn't really do a lot for me i'm not a big big big huge user of cbd or even sort of i don't really get the uh too much of the positive effects uh i respect it as a product it's just not super effective on me but i did notice it here um the the the high i'm experiencing is way more relaxed even than normal um sort of very very pleasant kind of experience less cerebral than normal for me not really neurons really aren't firing quite as much but i feel very at peace so i'm going to attribute that to the almost equal amounts of cbd in here so this select one-to-one unflavored drops it gets a really really big thumbs up for me i like it quite a bit my dog's thinking about barking but she's not going to she's not going to she really wanted to um so yeah huge thumbs up for me and before i bounce here guys i want to share with you a little cherry on top a little something that you can enjoy that i can share with you that isn't necessarily about wheat in this one you may not want any weed before you check this out because it might be a little too much i'm going to recommend a couple of books from a japanese uh illustrator it's manga i'm sorry i'm a nerd i guess it's only the second one i've ever read so don't judge me too harshly um the artist and writer is a guy by the name i apologize if i'm mispronouncing it junjie ito um and the two books i want to recommend from him that are utterly grotesque i mean truly some of the most shocking images i've ever seen somebody uh put pen to paper but i mean that in the best kind of way uh they are depraved in the most uh wonderful kind of cosmic hori sense of depraved uh and those are guillot geo again probably mispronouncing it which means fish in [ __ ] japan um and uh the other one is uzumaki which means spirals and it's all about spirals and i think adult swim is gonna do some kind of adaptation i've talked a lot about genji ito don't mix the two that's my advice definitely try this and definitely give junjie e2 a shot if you're a fan of gross stuff but keep them apart all right guys well that's going to do it for this review here on wheats really like the select give a huge recommendation my boy genji whatever however i'm sorry i'm still very high so thank you so much for watching guys stay high stay healthy and we'll see you for the next review i'm hoping my dogs aren't going to trip they might we did it [Music] you", "vvOrD3iny_8": "[Music] so [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another delta 8 video uh this is another delta 8 hemp video i actually completely forgot i still had tincture i still had another one of these products to make a video on and uh what better way to have some apple juice but these are tinctures and with tinctures they actually are droppers or like you basically put it underneath the tongue and let it absorb into your system but i've seen people put it in drinks as well and i'm very fortunate enough to have the pineapple express one if you can tell from the intro uh it also says the amount per serving is 30 30 drop wait serving size 30 drops wait serving per container 30. okay so those 900 drops is what they're saying and then one serving which is 30 drops is 33 milligrams of delta athc so yeah let's see this i've only tried a few tinctures and they're mostly very i would say it's a very alcoholic taste because i believe there's like i don't know was it glycerin i don't even know what it was in there but i'm sure there was alcohol in the last tincture i tried definitely was not good at all so we're just gonna open this oh it shows okay so this is at about 75 milligrams i'm smelling it smells really nice so 75 one milliliter is 30 drops so we're at 75 so that should be about should be about 22.5 milligrams all right 22.5 milligrams here we go kind of tasted like bubblegum it's a very minimal taste at best but since it's the only thing i put in my mouth like i can taste it but like if i were to put it in this i feel like i wouldn't taste it but we're gonna do that um but no not bad i was honestly expecting a much worse taste so let's do another let's do another 75 in here so obviously the effects aren't gonna [ __ ] just immediately take over you know so i will be filming again in about an hour or so uh but yes i wanted to get a shot of me pouring this in here how many shots let's see seventy-five another 75 [ __ ] it we'll do another 75 all right so how many was that so that's about 70 milligrams of delta eight thc in there i think i did over 100 plus milligrams on this stuff so i'm excited to see oh [ __ ] you can see it's just is that chill in there what the [ __ ] so just like that's crazy there's like a layer on top yeah i drink mostly it well that tastes like pineapple and apple now pineapple and apple juice that's crazy good so i'm gonna get back to you in about 30 or 45 minutes to an hour i do have a fast metabolism so it might be a little bit quicker than that but overall you know another good way to take delta athc you know there's gummies there's actually dabbing it there's cartridges and now there's tinctures as well and for those of you who you know i think i feel like like some people don't like to um medicate you like normally you know smoking flower or vaping or dabbing or anything and they want more of a i wouldn't say a better way but a more i don't know how to say it but it's just you know you just put it underneath the tongue and you go about your day that's about it you know what i'm saying and uh you you set it in your mouth and you forget it basically but other than that yes i will be filming or i will get back to you in about an hour or so so [Music] all right guys so i am back uh it's been about 45 minutes i mean i do feel somewhat of a buzz but i honestly feel like what i take like 100 milligrams i think my tolerance is a little bit higher than that but i definitely do feel it i definitely feel it around the eyes and everything um as far as like the drink goes i drank most of it because it tastes like just apple juice now and uh as you've seen from the earlier clip it was just sitting on top i mean yeah it's still it just tastes like apple juice but you can still put some of this in here [ __ ] it so we're gonna end it off i'm gonna take some more but i definitely do feel it and for how little i took you know i didn't take that much i took like what 80 milligrams or something or so [Music] okay i'm gonna take some more real quick before i end it off but i definitely do feel a head change oh but yes uh definitely i would i would definitely recommend it for the people that um don't want to smoke or vape or dab or eat edibles because you know that's a lot of uh sugar you know all those gummies like that one video i did recently there's a lot of a lot of [ __ ] sugar especially in the morning but this is a more subtle way of dosing and uh and yeah it's just a great way to to get some delta into your system and it's legal link will be in the comments below if you're interested but other than that hopefully you did enjoy this video cheers to some regular apple juice i mean there's a slight pineapple but not as strong as it was when i just put it in there but yeah hopefully you did enjoy the video peace out [Music] do [Music] you", "FZvZS5Lc6Mg": "hey guys it's Florida MJ 4:20 here and today I have 1/8 of white Buffalo from true leave in Panama City Beach Florida let's check out the THC it's twenty two point nine percent THC with 1.1 percent cmeg and 0.2 percent THC V for a total of twenty four point two percent cannabinoids that's not bad at all check out that seal like I'm so want to do it's a good seal on there Oh looks like we got some decent or at least a decent bud in there see what it smells like oh wow interesting it smells very sweet it has a very almost cherie sweet smell on top of maybe lime or maybe a limey Sour Diesel kind of flavor take a look at these bad boys so I just opened up man that smells good I just opened up an eighth of Girl Scout cookies that was all oh man it was all minis and look at this this is not all minis check that out that is beautiful it's got a nice purple to the calyxes it is well coded and trichomes there are some less dense spots but overall it's a nice thick coating of trichomes it's not up there with like the pictures of the Mac one I've seen I know if you guys have heard of that the Mac one that one plant brought out that is ridiculous this isn't quite on that level and it doesn't have that same price either so let's see white Buffalo is a sativa dominant hybrid strain it's a cross between la Romulan blackberry Kush Bay 11 interesting I've heard lots of good stuff about it there's supposed to be a pretty powerful and euphoric sativa so I'm excited to try it out let's go ahead and weigh this up and see how much we got sounds like a little doggie boys having dreams over there giving us little buff Wolf's alright silly boy alright Oh 4.1 I did it guys I did it I got a four point one oh my gosh I went over four grams this is like winning the lottery I hope you guys can see that right there go ahead and zoom in pause it 4.1 bingo so wow that's pretty cool I actually did it so hmm this is normally fifty three dollars for this eight and I had ten percent off discount because of my truly points so it came out of 47 seventy so forty-seven seventy-four 4.1 grams might actually be a decent deal once you do the math I'll have to see but if you can get 20% off with by stacking with a sale or if you could stack with your own truly points twice like they sometimes let you do then you get it down to 40 to 40 which makes this a pretty dang good deal if this is how you get it now I just open gross Scout cookies at 3.5 grams so there is definitely a possibility that you don't get it now I do like to see the decent size bugs instead of you know the little small stuff we've been seeing lots of but let's get some close-ups of it alright let's bring it in for some close-ups here check it out a nice covering of trichomes on these things heck yeah it's really good this is definitely the level of coding that you need to have if you're gonna be charging this much and not like those Girl Scout cookies tiny tiny mini nugs that had my last review going even closer still and you just look at it looks really good just covered man still not quite on the level of the Mac one trichomes is because that was just ridiculous like you look at those pictures and you could barely even see anything under the trichomes but this stuff is really good too there we go it's definitely got a ton of trichomes on it very nice some shots from the back see how it looks over here all right I think it's time for me to vape some of this stuff up before I vape it I'm gonna break one of these open okay that these are very dense super dense kind of like the star killer berry dance buds oh it has that burnt rubber to it when you open it up you break it apart um it does seem dry not super dry it does seem a little dry all right I'm gonna get all chopped up get the vape loaded and see how it is I want to taste the flavor on us it's got a very interesting aroma to it and you know I really like these strains where you break them open and you get a strong pungent aroma out of it I've had a lot of unfortunate strains it seems like where there's just not much smell to him and I was actually surprised that the Girl Scout cookies was like that I've heard so many good things about it just didn't really have that much of a smell to it to me this it's almost all chopped up that looks like a good amount get this pack these away doesn't need to be packed tight but just firmly enough so that it won't fall out everywhere man that was very pungent flavor to it when I inhaled it into the bowl get this preheated hopefully we're gonna get some big ole hits hopefully I won't Koff my lungs out on the table hopefully really um nice punchy piercing aroma like up at the top of my nose top of my I don't know what inside of there and yeah it's got kind of like maybe a little bit of a lime flavor to it and the sweetness is still there too it's really interesting they're trying to think there's a little bit of another flavor come out and I can't quite name it that's what I'm trying to think of here maybe a little bit of that Sour Diesel kind of flavor Oh oh man look at that okay Wow that's kind of intense all right I got that camera adjusted a little bit man these are some nice hits off of this really impressive you guys know any other direct draw of apes like this that give huge clouds but you don't have to hold down the button on them these cool give those a try that's our orany nice hit off of that one still getting vapor off of it and it's now really man it's almost got a berry flavor to it the the vapor coming out through my nose it's pretty yummy it's very sweet it's a nice vape for sure definitely a pleasant you know change from the unexcited aroma of the Girl Scout cookies for me see how this is soon yes I got plenty of vapor in there and it should I mean you guys saw the trichomes all over that stuff there we go oh my goodness oh man I think that's one of the most ridiculous baby hits I've ever had Wow dang the amount of vapor you can get off of this white Buffalo is ridiculous this makes me want to find some white buffalo minis for reals I'm gonna put this back I will not be eating it that is for sure that's for dang sure I will not be needing it man this is really crazy this is so so strong very nice the interesting part is is how strong it is without being like a heavy body feeling to it like that good for during the day if you need to get stuff done it was feels way stronger than the Girl Scout cookie you did and I took two big fat bong hits off of that this I mean look at how small this bowl is in the vape man this is good stuff this White Buffalo seek it out it's so strong my face feels amazing oh I got to blow my nose guys man this is one of those strings that makes me afraid to try for big hits because of how big they are holy cow I think your mom is strain honey man those clouds are just so big and thick give it another try another decent one not like those two big ones I had but especially not like that last one ah I can't wait to see those on film okay I can't wait to see those on screen because man they seemed so huge like I can barely I barely had my eyes open the whole time be when I was coughing because the hell intense it was I mean it was just like hold it hold it nope it's coming out it's coming back dang very effective stuff and you know it's not that kind of like you know tired groggy feeling which I like I really like it so both below the hype is real I think it is I mean I was probably more excited for Girl Scout cookies that's such a pipe strain you know like I mean that's that's one of those strains that's like been around and everybody wants it and white buffalo I've heard good things about it but man I'm surprised I it's that's way more my favorite out of these two at least from the batches that I got still getting decent hits off of it even though look it's just such a small bowl this stuff is great it's all those trichomes you can see on it this kind of feels like weed mixed with coffee already like you don't even need the coffee still getting hits off that little thing I'm gonna have to do a comparison where I find I could put some of this nice nice stuff that's got a lot of trichomes on it next to something that doesn't and show you the difference and how much vapor I make can make a huge difference yeah these are some dense notes dense very dense nose very dense smell nice nice effects really nice effects if you are looking for one of those clean sativas this is it right here I have to say I'm not happy with the price on them 53 dollars I will probably never buy these again I'll probably only buy if it's a concentrate or like I might buy rosin of this on sale and I might buy the minis of this if they have minis of it but I'm not gonna pay 53 for dang the effects are so good you know I wouldn't give this a hard pass like I did on the Girl Scout cookies because these are actual tiny little things in here you do get some decent buds and they're covered pretty nicely so this one I'd actually say is kind of justified you know I mean I think it's too expensive still but 4770 with 10% off I mean that's the price of Chee relief and then 20% off if you can stack that that's 42 bucks for it and if it's 4.1 grams you're paying like what $11 a gram I a little math and if you get minis of this you're only paying seven so you know really wait for the minis I mean and that goes even lower for the minis too if you're if you get the minis on sale which you know if you're getting these on sale you get the minis on sale so it's even better deal so yeah it's a really nice babe super super nice strain this feeling right here is is really great it's unique it's really nice a little bit on the expensive side though thank you very much for watching guys I hope you have a good", "v-3NEe1QCtE": "[Music] ratios with CBD and THC our hot topic right now combining these cannabinoids in conjunction in different ratios can definitely kind of fine-tune the experience and fine tune the benefits that the consumer feels in in the infancy of CBD research and even marijuana research as a whole I really kind of stick to three different ratios which is gonna be a one to zero ratio THC the CBD very little CBD very high THC which is generally gonna be for your recreational consume where for someone looking for psychoactive relief and then you've got a one to one ratio which is the best of both worlds it's almost like a hybrid you're gonna get the physical symptom reliefs from the CBD you're gonna get some you know cerebral or mental symptom reliefs from from the THC and then the last one that I would say is popular is going to be a 0 to 1 ratio of THC the CBD which is gonna be as low THC as possible and as high CBD as possible this is often found in hemp however there are how cannabis strains coming up with very low THC very high CBD sometimes it'll be called like a 1 to 10 or a 1 to 20 but for all intents and purposes I'd say you've got you know three points in the spectrum of high THC no CBD one to one balanced and then no THC high CBD you know your high THC obviously psychoactive your one to one are gonna be kind of the best of both worlds and then your your high CBD low THC is gonna be preferred by those people that don't want to get high those people that have to you know function on a higher level or don't want to have any sort of inhibition mentally while they're going about their day but they also need some relief from whatever symptoms they they have whether it be mathematically or if they just want to take the edge off you know or if they just want to like you know deal with stress better or just be a little bit more loose you know so little no seam here THC is gonna be very low psychoactivity high th easily very high cycle activity and you know I read one somewhere I don't know if it has any merit but that you know sativas are generally defined by having a high THC and a low CBD ratio and indicas will generally have a little bit more of that CBD as well as a high THC so in my experience as you kind of raise the CBD you're getting less of that racy cerebral effect or any more of that relaxed body effect and eventually as you kind of phase out the THC you can almost diminish the psychoactive effects completely I think that the future of marijuana is going to be extracting THC extracting CBD extracting CVC extracting cbn extracting THC B and then combining them all into a product that has very specific ratios for specific symptoms or for specific desired effects it doesn't necessarily have to be medical doesn't have to be a symptom or an ailment it can just be someone that wants to feel a certain way it wants to feel more intimate wants to feel more uninhibited wants to feel relaxed or stress relief so as we better define these other cannabinoids and we find processes to isolate them and then recombine them in specific ratios I think that's where you're really gonna get this prescriptive effect of marijuana where it's less subjective and more objective [Music]", "Mgi3pwDKhDA": "a new season is here and it's time to paint your nails with a fresh new design these strawberry nails are juicy and cute there's a perfect and easy design for this summer start off with a base coat to protect and strengthen your natural nails next you'll need to paint your nails with a strawberry red color now it's time to paint some white leaves coming down from your cuticles the reason I am painting the leaves white first is because the green will really pop and show up much brighter on top of it you need to paint about four to five triangles and then fill them in let's turn those leaves green we're going to paint over the white leaves we drew with our green polish I like to trace the Leafs first and then fill them in don't worry about getting polish on your skin during any of these steps if you do you can just easily remove it after you're done with a q-tip and some polish remover it's time to add our seeds strawberries have yellow seeds and we are going to draw them with a toothpick I like creating mine and Rose try to space them out a bit and keep them rather small finish off with a top coat to seal in and protect your design and that's it you're done I hope you enjoyed this easy and cute tutorial for strawberry nails I hope your summers filled with sunshine art and love see you next time", "q_wvaUKzxpw": "[Music] hello everyone it's me the cannabis reviewer it's the fifth week flower stage for my ladies welcome to my 2020 2021 winter grow i'm growing cream caramel and orange sherbet cannabis plants if you didn't watch it go back and watch the video where i just made the nutrient mix now it's time to feed the ladies so in this video i'm going to show you me feeding them again show you how well they suck up everything but you're not going to see how good they look that is gonna be in another video on a weekly update so sit back relax and get ready to watch my ladies drink some fox farm nutrient mix with rainwater be right back all right we're back and that is the mix i just made as you know if you watch the previous video and there it's been bubbling now for 10 15 minutes maybe a little bit longer so now it's time to feed her put feed the ladies so we'll come down here zoom in real close so we don't show accidentally show any of our ladies ladies that's on another episode so we'll start with this one first and i'm telling you what they're thirsty so you'll see what i'm talking about let me shut down some of my fans and make a little bit a little bit better okay so we'll pull the air bubblers out wipe them off and then we'll go ahead and get started we're gonna go ahead and feed them uh two pints on the bottom [Applause] two and a half pints on the bottom a half pint on top so we'll go ahead and start with the first pint and watch how thirsty she is [Applause] watch that one down and here's number two and this is another second pint i'll clean up the mess after it gets done but look at it just drink it down we've got big bloom we've got grow big we got tiger bloom we got mimbe bimbe and we got camg plus in this and it's been ph balanced the 6.1 now i have five plants to do that is for sure but we're only gonna do two of them here in the video all right now we're down to where we need to be for that put the lid on that now watch how this works you first as i always do you first put a little bit in just to get the soil uh like get it soaked into the soil so it don't run to the sides of the pot so you let it soak in without soaking in and down definitely happy with my grow you watch it it'll soak right down in we'll let it sit for a little bit i'm doing the scrog side i'm not doing the other side but let me tell you the other side is looking really really good here i'll do it this way maybe give it right on down right on down i got i'd have been doing trimming as i go i haven't been overly trimming these too much though like i have in the past i did do it some trimming before i watered them i cleaned up a little bit more on the stems because those leaves are dying off and we don't really need them and i also removed some of the small popcorn very small popcorn buds as well but uh you know there we are we're we're soaking in everything's looking good i mean the bottoms are already sucked up i mean hell we're doing great let's go to number two show you what she can do how she drinks go ahead and get that set up start with the first bottle there we go watch your drink number two and she just sucks it right on up i can tell you that three gallons are definitely the right size for the pots for me for my grow there we go and while that's doing that we'll go ahead and get up here and let it soak in real good give it a little bit of time this has definitely been the best way that i have found so far to feed my plants i've been really pleased with being able to do the bottom feeding like this and then supplementing it off the top it's really helped and really works really well i can't wait to see what kind of yields i end up getting with my ladies for sure i can't wait it's gonna be great but yeah you know you add a little bit of water let it sit and then it's just gonna sit there and soak on in and down hopefully not to the edges but down through the center and feed those nutrients to those beautiful beautiful roots won't be long i'll be adding co2 and that's going to be an interesting thing right there by itself i'm working towards it slowly but surely we'll have it all put together definitely going to try it we're going to use baking soda citric acid and water that's the plan and i've got a i bought a uh old gas canister off uh the internet and we're gonna try to use that and then you know pieces of uh piping and [ __ ] try to get it put together as cheap as i can that's the way i flow all right though so we're done we'll do the other we'll do the others by the by themselves because there's plenty plenty of time you watching this that's for sure so appreciate it everybody for checking out my feed and how i'm feeding it i appreciate that please like subscribe click the bell share

and in today's nail tutorial there's a bunch of different freak nail designs for summer I love all of these designs because they're super cute bright and fun which is perfect for summer let me know down in the comments which fruit design is your favorite so let's get started by using a base coat over all of our nails to protect them and prolong the life of our mani the first design is the lemon begin by painting your nail yellow once that's dry use a small paintbrush and a white polish to draw a piece of a circle over your nail you may need to go over it a second time to make it opaque then feed a few lines inside the circle to create the lemon slices if you have any room left over on your nail you can go in and add another one too and there you go all done next up is the watermelon design begin by painting your nails with a bright green polish once that's dry swipe up or polish down the middle of your nail and give it a slight curve fill in that side with the coral polish again if it's not opaque just add another layer to increase the opacity next use a dark green striper and join tiny strokes together to create some quick stripes make sure that you don't have too much nail polish on your brush while you do this then separate the coral from the grain by using a white striper finally using a dotting tool or toothpick add three black seeds to do this dot down and lift up a little bit while pulling the coll\u00e8ge outward practice on paper first if you need to and that's it up next is the dragon fruit design begin by painting your nail white once that's dry use a black confetti polish over the nail for the seeds usually these polishes have both black and white confetti in them like this one but you won't be able to see the white ones because they blend into the white background so it's no problem keep adding layers of seeds until you're happy with the results and then use a pink striper to outline the whole nail take your time while you do this and have both hands rested on the table also feel free to maneuver your hand into different positions while outlining different areas of the nail just do whatever feels right tada next up is the Kiwi design begin by painting your nail alight grain once that's dry take a white polish and wipe the polish off both sides of the brush like so then press the top of the brush down on the middle of your nail to create an oval like shape next use a white striper to head thin lines coming out of the oval all around the nail again change the position of your hands whenever you feel like you need to when that's done use a small dotting tool or a toothpick to add little black dots for seeds in between all of the lines I like to add between one to three seeds in each row this is my favorite part of the design because it really brings the design from not looking like a key me to looking exactly like one and second and there we go the final design is a strawberry because it wouldn't be a summer fruit guide without one so begin by painting your nail red and then use a dotting tool or a toothpick with green polish to draw triangular shapes coming down from your cuticle for the leaves make them interesting by varying the sizes of the leaves then fill them in using a stippling motion next use a white polish to add small random dots over the red part for the seeds and that's it just finish off with a top

"Nu2XMLKU-Z8": "hey guys welcome back to my channel my name is Alana jacqueline and I'm your friendly neighborhood patient advocate today we're talking about medical marijuana I've been a medical marijuana patient for about a year now and I've had a chance to try plenty of different strains and different methods today I'm gonna talk about some of my favorites from a dispensary called Tru leave and I also have some products from a dispensary called fluent I'm not gonna get too in-depth right now on medical marijuana the background the laws or the process just about these products today which ones I liked and how they work the first product I want to talk about is the vape cartridges I use the indica strain indica is really well known for being a very relaxing body and mind high so it's really good for chronic pain and I also found that using the vaping method really was the fastest and strongest way of getting this medication into my system so the indica that I use is the nine pound hammer the other one that they have is called granddaddy purple but I don't really see much of a difference between either of them just from a patient perspective they both tend to have the same sedating effects and pain relieving effects the next product I want to talk about is their oral teacher now I have two different kinds here both are indica but they come from different dispensaries this one is from true leave with the tinctures it does take a long time for them to have an effect and they certainly don't hit you in the face like the vape does the effects do last longer and it's great for more internal pain I use it for any time that I have a really bad stomach ache or GI flare that's definitely my go-to I really didn't like this bottle this tincture from fluent dispensary it seriously tastes like there's tobacco in it and it's just disgusting but I paid a lot of money for it so I guess I'm just gonna have to do with it for now the next product is a topical THC lotion this of course is for topical pains it can also be used for arthritis joint pains and you can rub it onto the surface of wherever your pain is I have a had a great deal of success with pain relief from the topical lotion unless I have a bruise or a cut that's open and I want to put this around it not on it or in it it just doesn't really do that much for internal pains like joint pain even though that's what it's recommended for the last product is truely's true clear syringe this is some powerful stuff to use this you would hold the syringe under hot water for about 30 seconds and then squeeze a little bit of the solution onto a cracker you eat it and then well I don't know if this is for everyone but at least for me it takes about 6 to 8 hours for the effects to kick in so once they do you are feeling it very much and I really like to use this if I know I'm having a procedure or any kind of painful doctor's appointment or something like that in the morning or the next day I'll take it at night and know that I don't have to worry so much about the pain or the anxiety about the pain in the morning I hope this gives you guys a better idea of what's at the dispensary in true leave and let me know if you've tried any other products from their dispensary or other dispensaries like this one stay tuned for another video coming soon about different CBD and hemp products that are not prescription and subscribe to find more videos like this one thanks so much for watching", "MYm4aObYLo0": "what is this Maybach Music all right it's making my eyes better and it's legal I could walk

feeling fruity I hope so because today's video is for a colorful fun easy delicious fruit manicure that is perfect for this time of year I hope that you enjoy it and give the video a thumbs up if you liked it and for a full list of all of the colors that I'm using in today's tutorial don't forget to check out the description box down below so starting with our watermelon nail is swiping a light green color across the tip of the nail then I'm going to use a dark green polish on a small dotting tool and we're just going to create stripes across the nail and you want to make sure that these stripes are actually kind of bumpy and not perfect because the lines on a watermelon are not perfect at all and then to finish off at the top of the nail I'm just going to take a white nail striper and outline underneath the green portion to add the final touch we are using our small dotting tool with some black nail polish adding some watermelon seed free in the first row and then two little seeds underneath that moving on to our cherry nail we're just taking some red nail polish on a dotting tool and creating large circles and remember the cherries don't have to be absolutely perfect because they're not in real life so don't stress about that then using a brown nail polish on a nail striper we're just adding two stems and you want to make sure that the stems start a little bit down inside the cherry then using our green striper we're just adding two little Leafs and the final touch is to use some white nail polish on a dotting tool to create a little curved line which is going to give our cherries a nice little shine onto the strawberry nail I'm just starting with a red base going in with some pointy lines you want to make sure they're as pointy as you can draw them just kind of going back and forth and then you're simply just going to fill this in and to finish off the nail we're just taking some yellow polish on a dotting tool and adding our cute little strawberry seed now onto our pineapple nail this is probably the most time-consuming one but it's not difficult just make sure to go slow so you want to use your knife yellow nail polish and just kind of drag it down into a curved line next you're going to use a black nail striper to outline your pineapple then you're just going to draw three diagonal lines from the top of the pineapple and then three diagonal lines going the opposite direction then all you want to do is take the tip of your nail striper or you could use a dotting tool whatever you want and just add it inside each of the little triangles on your pineapple then we want to add the top of the pineapple so I'm just using a nail striper to add little pointy leaves you can do as many as you want to and you also want to have some of the Leafs kind of going down onto the pineapple itself and final touch is to just outline your top of the pineapple so gives it a little bit more of a realistic look and I promise is a lot easier than it looks so just make sure to go slow and take your time with it very last nail is the thumbnail which is going to be a fun orange citrus nail just using our orange polish we're just dragging it down into a circular motion and we're doing the same shape coming down from our cuticle area and I am going to be using two coats of this because as you can see it's a little bit streaky and then all you want to do is take a white nail polish use it to outline any curve of the orange and add some lines that all connect into a central point into the corner of your nail so that you have little orange slices is the finished manicure once I added my topcoat I think it's so cute you can do one fruit on each nail like I did today or you can do all strawberry nails or all cherry nails or you could even do something really really simple like doing one fruit at an accent nail like on your ring finger or something like that so I hope that you enjoyed the video and give it a thumbs up if you found it helpful and yeah I hope this you want to try out some fruit nails thank you for watching and subscribing hi", "gs2B8ckuB0U": "god bless me good morning what's up what's up it's like 2 30

review from North Fork today we have a special request from my boy he rates the silence you want to see how this look I would smoke I smell the effects of this poker going dude we got the sour blueberry cush and this thing is loud just as loud as the Kindle and I'm gonna give you guys an in-depth perspective on my behalf it's very honest I'm not getting paid for this I'm giving you an honest review now here's the thing with reviewers I want you guys to know what you guys are getting yourselves into right before you purchase any of this flour I'm doing on mine just oh my my my good spirits you know I'm saying I I'm not charging these guys to do it don't make no sense you know that once I get a bigger platform maybe right now this come on now I'm just doing this because I love you guys this is a community yeah I want to know how something is let me know I worry and I do a review on it simple as that now go check out my previous review with me and my wife with the tincture this stuff is awesome if you looking for something other than flower or dab any of the smoke levels try this out man they're good I'll turn this now almost pop this open I'm gonna give you my view right I can smell it from here this is a sour berry it is extremely sour smell like solid diesel diesel yeah diesel and sour is what I'm getting from this diesel in sour that's all I can say they should call this our diesel this is how it smells trim is pretty good on here nice medium-sized buzz the small sized buds and I have a close-up for you guys actually give me a second get that closer for you now yeah there are a couple C's not a lot have a nice well stickiness to it not to watch the market down pretty easily though yep smells good so this is a fair short I won't see this until the video plays this is a blunt you about to see look up the stickiness around it if you ever get a hemp flour with that stickiness around it when you smoke it it is some good it is some good that's all that stickiness from the play it is good do those look fire or would that look pretty good at huh nice little trucks on there there are a couple seeds not many it's a couple but man oh man oh man the smell on this bud is crazy when I say crazy I know it mean seriously it's a serious smell and they do come in a resealable bags at least mine did I've seen some people it doesn't come with that luckily mine do you think I do have mason jars on the waves its Amazon everybody's taking a while because of what's going on all right so let's brought some of this so without further ado do all right hi everybody out there going out doing okay I'm doing fantabulous man I'm actually ready to go back to work it's gonna be a while though you know I'm not even in Texas some of you already know the government one that's opened back up but he's having second thoughts I'm not gonna rush the process I'm just along for the ride this is not like I'm not getting paid I still get paid regardless I'm getting much money so it's unfortunate uh for some people and some people out there stressing out wait no unemployment it's not hitting them right now if I know you should I help you it snows so good oh my god yes and that's one reason I like doing videos instead of pictures so you can see the live results of it pictures sometimes just don't do justice to me it's like a standstill image doesn't come to life or nothing you want to see what them tracks look like you wanna see what them flowers look like you want to see what the trim job is like all around 3d three dimensionally I know this won't stick that's another from the brand-new that's not even opened this is Wow my wife said this one was louder than the orange Kim which it is this one has more flavor to it the orange Kim is just straight diesel this is sour and diesel and undertone I can't say berry because it's not really various more of a lemon so this is like a sour lemon diesel fish the baryon really smell I love the smell blueberries not much like a unripe blueberry a balanced smell blueberry all right so just shake yourself so we - four - so far on the smell and the lips at orange at North work cheaper to nurse a nice local dairy stove with this so he - four - later on I'll be dropping another review on the third string from Northport I got more packages coming in today and tomorrow so I'm trying to push

we're gonna roll this one pretty quickly honey worried about how it's gonna move I'm anxious to smoke somebody smoked all that I mean nerves calm back again guys as you know as I explained in the first video there was really no certificate of analysis for all these strains there was one on there but it was not specific as to which training went to so I went to the website I couldn't find a

out", "WVfgnKLCWeI": "this design makes use of female fruit slices which can be found on eBay for a dollar - or may be purchased at your local beauty supply store this design is super simple to create and looks amazing during the summer time so start off with a base coat to protect your natural nails then choose two colors a darker and a lighter shade that complements the fruit slice you're going to use I'm using pinks for my strawberry nail paint the lighter shade onto the tip of your nail while it's still wet use a darker shade halfway up the first this does not have to be perfect because we're going to blend it all together by using some glitter polish I'm using China glazes fairy dust which is my favorite glitter polish while your nail is still wet with the glitter polish press a fruit slice onto your nail with tweezers now seal it all in with a couple coats of a top coat this will prevent the fruit slice from falling off and will add some beautiful shine and that's it a very simple way to get a fresh and fruity manicure I'll see you all next time", "JbQU9Zl95wM": "[Music] well it's up everyone here with the update on the slur akane number Seven's and the one Magnum PI and see this ladies looking real good here it's been purple and all kinds of colors on it know if you can see close up on that nug but just some beautiful colors some oranges and magentas and all kinds of stuff coming in on that before I get too far into anything I want to give a little shout out to the people that been commenting on the videos and stuff so Cal Pro grower hydroponic OTO flower the other day I had cousin combo king he commented but I think YouTube actually pulled his comment for some reason because I got the notification but then I didn't see the actual comment and I wasn't able to respond to him so I just want to say thank you to you for you know shooting us a comment we really appreciate that keeps us stoked on doing the videos and keeps the stoked on just you know growing in general to be able to share with everyone else and then also on monarch gardens saying the same thing happened with his comment solid in the notifications I couldn't even read the whole comment it was it was too long to fit in the little bar on my phone but same thing I saw a notification but it wouldn't it wouldn't show up on actual video so I don't know what happened with that maybe YouTube flagged it or something but I just want to say thank you to you too yeah man everyone that's been commenting on the videos and stuff love you guys videos too I love you know love the the getting able to being able to share all of this with with all of you guys and likewise seeing all your guys's Gardens keeps me stoked on you know trying to do better and stuff over here you know I don't know I'm forgiving everyone's names and stuff on there you know I'm stoner brain but thanks everyone and thanks for everyone dropping info and stuff and helping out but anyway we'll get into it now here so yeah so far this is my favorite lady right here the serger cane number Seven's and then probably that back one in the over there this one right here they're all looking pretty good how to steak a lot of them because the the notes are getting so big and dance that they're they started toppling over this little one in the front hasn't got steak though because it's so short and stout which is cool but I almost kind of like maybe that one I don't know why have to smoke them and see but yeah so some of these we can stake down you can see this one's really really fading out this one actually has the biggest nugs though as far as like filling in a cola rather than the golf ball kind of type but you know it doesn't have a much smell for us maybe it's an outdoor plant instead of indoor so I don't know maybe I might take a cut of that run it outside and see what happens well yeah so that's it for the third game number seven in the tent these are looking like they're about a week week to go so they're right about on the schedule with the flower room next door so these will probably be getting chopped and and hung up in the same time as the flower room and then here's all the moms the slur akane mom's got the chem oh geez in the back just they're huge this is the triple cheese in the front but this is a slur Akane that's the celery came back there these are slur Akane's they're just they're [ __ ] huge man like I'm gonna clone all of these probably tomorrow afternoon I got to do it in rockwool cubes rather than the cups like we did these ones in the cups I'm gonna have to have used rockwool cubes because I'm gonna have so many [ __ ] clones because I'm gonna clone every single branch i'm cloning this i'm cloning the oh geez so i won't have enough room inside the dome to run the cup i like the cup method though because it's i mean look at them they're [ __ ] they're getting the dinner nice and green no no shock or anything i'm going from the cube into into a cup or cube into a pot so i mean i prefer that but space wise there's no way I'm gonna be able to fit all these clones cuz I mean I'm gonna have like one two three four five off of this one I mean this yeah there's just too many to fit cups in there so we're gonna run walk ruffle cubes in the road and just running how we've done in the past I'm also gonna clone this basil plant over here because it's getting massive you know like I need to get it I need to get pieces of this and put it everywhere because it's supposed to repel bugs it smells really really good in the blueberry - this is gonna get cleaned also a couple branches on it they'll just clone off that because we want to cross this with some stuff yeah so some more slur Akane biggle they got really tall and stretchy got the cob light in here now this was in the flower room so the light that was up here was just a shitty t5 that are a t8 when we got rid of our t5 because the T fives were just pulling way too much power is heating up the whole room it was just a pain in the ass so we went with the t8 so we could drop it real low on the plants and just slam them with the t8 well the t8 went out so we pulled the Cobb out of there put it in here it's running about half half power right now it seems to be doing just fine it's actually gonna work out perfect overall these cups here that have all the canter auto seeds in them so I mean you got pretty much to two light sources slamming down on top of these and I can dial it up and down right here with the dial - if I if I need you know turn it off turn it all the way up about half way and yeah so this is all the counter auto seats we got some stuff popping through already and these just went in here yesterday so let me see if I can find there you got one there I think there was one right here there's a few there they're popping through already I got another one over there it looks like well yeah so on the on the counter ADO's this is the peanut Sunday right here this these ones in the middle are the special occasion these ones on the far end are the orange sunset we had is we germinated six of each pack and we got six four six on the peanut Sunday six four six on the special occasion we got four four six on the orange sunset so I went ahead and I threw two more two more seeds in a in a paper talents out of a baggie so those are germinating right now probably check them tomorrow since they've been in there for already 24 hours so they're tomorrow or the day after and then with that that'll give me enough time to see what's gonna pop up out of these and what's not and whatever is not it's gonna be probably one of these two and boom will throw throw those uh hopefully sprouted seeds into one into two of these cups or hopefully none of these cups just they all pop up you know I've had that happen to where the seed didn't germinate as fast as the other one stood in the soil and then it came up so we'll see see how it goes but so far we're pretty stoked on the germination rate and everything and another little surprise too was all the packs had more seeds than they said on the pack so every pack had more than what it was labeled which was [ __ ] awesome so stoked on that so thanks camerado because that's pretty rad but yeah that's that and then we got you can see the freaking jungle over here of plants and about the bottom will run out so we're getting ready getting ready to to get these cloned up so we can chop them and and start reusing the pots probably maybe get some bigger pots for some moms that we're in keep around just got a lot of stuff to do in here it's always seems like something but anyway that's the update on the slurry cane and hopefully in about a week or so we'll be chopping these ladies down and then in a few weeks from there giving you guys a smoke report on these two I'm super excited to try these so stay tuned and we'll see on the next one later [Music]", "-VXhEiJBxMc": "you know balloons are pro

the jungle we in a jungle - smoking legal what up y'all is that [ __ ] Academy today it's the morning time I'm about to get my workout in but before I work out I honestly like to smoke so I figured I would smoke with you guys and it'll only feel about these new pans I picked up picked up these pans call old pal I actually got they have sativas into custom hybrids so I went and grabbed all three of those [ __ ] so I figured why not go on and use the sativa this morning which I believe is this guy right here yeah so I figured out going to use this before my workout see exactly how it does let you guys know how it works these cartridges tests between like about 78 and 81 percent so they're not super high testing but that's perfect for me for working out I don't like to be like - Vogon high when I workout because then my heart start beating too fast and then I can't finish my [ __ ] workout so I like to get something that's not too strong but these [ __ ] right here was only like 20 bucks for a half gram so I figured why not at the dispensary I work at we usually don't sell too much [ __ ] things so I figured I'd give it a try and I will let you guys go alone to ride with me it's like I say the name of this is old pal and we gonna see exactly how to [ __ ] hit so let me go in and open it this says it's only for useful five five ten threat battery which is normal it has a safety thing to open it to child safety so you see I got three different tabs here you got one two and three over here so one two three what you do is you hold this one and then hold the outer one and then it open with no problem if you try to open the two in the middle it's not gonna work so you got to use the outer and the outer ones okay so as you see I am in Cali so boom so you got the little sticker there I like to take that off of my [ __ ] though I don't like leaving that all mine I know I'm in California I know it's marijuana I don't need to leave that on there but I'm not gonna waste time trying to get off right now so looking at the holes in the filtration system those holes are a pretty big size which means it's gonna let out more vapor so I'm not really a fan of that I like smaller holes on my filters but is what it is the oil seems to be pretty thick it's not just you know running down super easy so let's see how it works let's get to rock and so I can get this workout done so I'm running a little late for work that's why I'm doing my workout here at the house so I'm just going to use my rolled battery all right guess I'm ready to hit bottoms up okay taste-wise scale of one to ten I give it like probably a seven it's not like fruity flavor or anything so it doesn't kind of does have a little bit of like a tainting taste tangent test hitting a little bit of a tangent taste it is a little bit of a harsh throat hit it's not where I'd be like oh I wouldn't smoke that again but you can fill this in the throat for the amount of time like the long draws that I take I can definitely feel that in the throat but take a couple more reps and and see how it does door my workout today's not gonna be a long crazy workout it's just gonna be some stuff here and I at the house look little calisthenics you know got to make sure you keep yourself you know nice and healthy even though we like to blow trees and oils it's still important to make sure we keep ourselves healthy I

because it's working out this thing is pretty harsh on the throat you know I like when you get down to the bottom of your cartridges and you start feeling like a heavier hit that mother buddy is starting like that so I'm very curious how to be once it's at the end yeah excuse me [ __ ] I still got that morning mucus in me [ __ ] but um I can feel a nice little buzz from it though I'll definitely definitely say that is definitely giving a little buzz for 20 bucks I mean I wasn't expecting it to feel like you know ice cream on the throat to be totally honest yeah [ __ ] I think is pretty cool but I got my arrows dating all the sizes do this here we go it is making coffee [ __ ] yeah that's gonna be my new hair dude I'm thinking about that [ __ ] come on players y'all know y'all

somewhere between there but I can say everything has its purpose like I don't always want to be at the [ __ ] moon like sometimes I just need to be you know kind of hanging out in the [ __ ] clouds and [ __ ] and that's kind of where this one had me it was really good for my workout excuse me I didn't get to uh like you know my heart rate didn't like shoot through the [ __ ] roof or anything it was just a perfect hide it was it I was able to enjoy the music as I worked out like I like to listen to the music when I work out and that's like one of the most important things to me it's like my playlist like I'm talking about like if I get to the gym and my headphones is dead I'm going right back to the house down like Copeland so this was a I was able to enjoy my music pretty well pretty good with the old pal sativa like I say it does kind of have a harsh throat hit but if you're a big dog and you can take that [ __ ] [ __ ] it you know 20 bucks I say you know if you a baller on a

older nails wait i use sinful colors snow me white first we'll go through and paint on the basic outlines of all the fruit and then we'll go in and fill in the details so start up all the curb yellow line for the banana added the banana on my thumb my pinky and my little next make green dots for kiwi fruit all the names of polishes i use will be down below mix paint on a slightly rounded triangle and some strawberry I chose to put quite a few of isn't because I think this is so cute for the pineapple a dot on a yellow oval shape I made my pineapples come up the side of my nails so the shape wasn't too important for me add some grapes in wherever you think you need to fill in some space now it's time to add them some more details you're going to need some quite thin brushes for this so if you don't hit it in the fresh so you can cut them I'll put a video all about that which I will link to down below Hudson Anna add some brown marks very top of it and then add a curved line down the middle and a little dot at the very end it's kind of hard to see here but what I'm doing is adding in a little orange dots on the stories make sure they're quite small make the top of the strawberry by adding on a few green strokes of polish pull the kiwi fruit add a white dot into the very center then add small white stripes around the outside of the dot making sure to steal these plenty of green shopping then air keeps of tiny black dots on the outside of the white dot pull the pineapple of paint on some Brown crisscrosses then paint on some green leaves now just add some little

this is a Lemon Drop disposable point three Gramm yes point three gram cartridge I didn't know they made them that small but you know it's a nice little disposable cart the first disposable I've tried here in Illinois and you can see it's in the matter line of products by far McCann which is a cultivator here in Illinois now in this instance I believe Lemon Drop is not a strain specific flavor but instead it's a kind of laboratory infused combination of terpenes for a sort of confectionery flavor I would say that flavor is definitely achieved it's got a delicious almost like that lemon head candy if you've ever tried those tastes just like that to me kind of a harsh hit but I really enjoy the high from it it very much that put me in a cerebral headspace where I was like really productive for at least felt like being productive and didn't want to sit still very sativa dominant in terms of the high for me but yeah great taste like I said a little bit of a harsh hit but I do like the disposable convenience and as you can see in this video here no external battery or charging required you just draw and you get a nice hit out of it and this stuff is good medicine now let's talk about price so pretty much the standard recreational price I'm seeing after-tax there's a little bit of give or take to this depending on where you're located in Illinois but pretty much to give in to price after-tax for these point three gram disposable carts is about 50 bucks which is an unbelievably horrible deal I can get full Graham carts for considerably cheaper that are just top-shelf quality from the black market which is the case for most people I know but nevertheless why I'm here is to document this legal cannabis situation here in Illinois and it's gonna continue to progress hopefully and hopefully prices will be less [ __ ] but hopefully this painted a good picture if you're interested in picking up this cart I would recommend it for it's great lemon confectionery flavor and its really awesome sativa dominant productivity inducing buzz that's all I got to say today though guys stay safe", "Rb15GBaGnFc": "[Music] what's up YouTube Northwest rowing and other friends

everybody good morning good afternoon good evening whatever time of the day it is that you have settled in to watch this video so today for our opening we have a new one from now I'm stay its whathe I've not had this brand yet so this is gonna be completely unknown of what we're gonna be looking at inside here today is June the 28th and it looks like we have a package day of June the second so it hasn't been in this bottle for too long hopefully it has a seal over it and because it has been in for a month so will dry out over that a little bit of time obviously before we get into that let's pull this guy up here there we go BAM right where it should be okay so we know she's working right bring my top off bring the top over zero it off I said zero it off I don't I don't know what that was anyway continuing sharp pronounce this name horribly wrong when it pronounced it - so opening this and we do have an air seal it's always a great sign because well it's not gonna completely just between my fingers hopefully we're gonna find out right now so bring it up here for a nice quick little view hmm welcome pretty nice lots of crystal give it a squeeze she has a bit of a bounce to her she bounces back a bit that's nice that's always good I'm gonna bring out a smaller piece here to try to run through my fingers so two fingers that's me absolutely nothing breaking off and I almost lost that one and it's completely unfocused there we go so we're gonna try it between two or three it is barely even coming apart definitely gonna need a grinder or some scissors or something for this guy I mean you probably pull it apart with your fingers but I can guarantee will won't break up as good as if you put it into a into some sort of grinder or such something is not right with my top today so I'm just gonna do that all right so bringing her in I mean it was a little bit of void space in the container again it's not one of the worst containers but it's also not one of the best containers so get the packaging down eventually I surely hope anyway moving on there is basically a non-existent amount of shake in the bottom of this once I start pulling it all the buzz even the last little bit in there seems to be but that is always good we don't like it when the guys try to fill up their last little bit with a bunch of shaking bottoms no one likes that let's be honest okay so it settles out 3.5 right on the dot awesome exactly where we want it to be kind of had a feeling this is gonna happen if you guys haven't noticed at first they were wavering a bit some of them we're a little bit lower some of them you know might have been not quite but we're good now I do believe that is all for this time guys until next time", "hLnUppkcIVg": "hey what's up how you guys doing - boy L will so I just got back from the shop and I'm gonna show you my pickups got the plum you know I was using the I don't even know how you pronounce it let me know in the comment I

kratom extract week phenomenal yes so yesterday or two days ago I did the upload on the OPM a shots bomb calm like them today we are reviewing this case shot here third extract that I have tried I'm gonna keep this video very short because we don't need to keep talking about like a million things you know what I'm saying so let's just jump right into it tasted a million times better than the OPM s shot or the MIT 45 like legit I was so surprised I was like you know what this is not bad but it did taste like imagine like grapefruit juice like how concentrated is so it was more than like a citrusy side type of flavor and yeah I was like okay this that was good but however I'm gonna let you know guys I honestly did not feel like a certain amount of strength with this one so definitely not my favorite I'm gonna say that it's a tie between the MIT 45 and the OPM s this one I don't think it's like something that I'm going to potentially like even think twice about again sorry Keesha but yeah also as far as taking the extracts what I'm gonna recommend in what I tried a couple days in a row was because you know if like you don't take cream for a while and you sort of have this like it's a weird kind of like you're going without feeling and when you take the kratom extract it doesn't give you that like like it gives you that relief but it almost feels like your body hasn't gotten something if you take it every day so what I'm going to suggest honestly is to maybe take like depending on if you have a high tolerance or not take some powder or with the shots it's honestly someone came in the other day and we were talking about it and he explained it perfectly he said it gives it legs it gives an extract shot some legs basically meaning just like you know what it it balances it all out and it gives you that like foundation for just your kratom dose for the day so some people could take these by themselves but I do recommend if you do take the powder every day maybe like if you take 10 grams of the powder and then you want to take one of the extract shots I'd say do like two and three two to three grams on top of the extract shot and that's gonna give you that better quality you know feeling so when I took this key shot it was like it wasn't noticeable even in 20 minutes I wasn't like feeling phenomenal or whatever so I have taken the key shot and then about 10 capsules of endo and that has left me feeling really nice so like if I were to take the opium met shot I don't think I'd be able to take 10 capsules maybe I'd take like 3 or 4 so the OPM s the MIT 45 definitely much stronger the K shots a little bit on the weaker side but better flavor so if these guys work for you that's really cool let me know if they do subscribe to my channel give me a thumbs up and share my videos man you know what I'm saying because that's what makes the world go round hallelujah that's about it guys thanks for watching yeah stay tuned peace", "7cUPQntyRLM": "hello everyone welcome to hoopla kids style today I'm going to show you how to make fruit salad nails these look delicious I love these ones so the first thing we're gonna do is to paint our base coats I'm using a bright pink on the thumb a red on the floor finger a light green in the middle finger followed by yellow and then finally I'm using a lovely light blue on my little finger so of course you've got to repeat that on your other hand remember though you don't have to do this combination get creative so let's get started with the detail the first thing we're going to do is watermelon on the thumb so we need to do the rind using green and add detail using a lighter green then using the black pen we're going to add the pips now we're gonna do the strawberry we want to do a zigzag using dark green on the top of the nail and then pips using the yellow now for the kiwi fruit it's a white spot in the middle with radiating spikes that look a bit like a Sun then using the black and tiny little spots in between just to make detail now I've got a pineapple I'm doing a green zigzag at the top of my nail then I'm doing diagonal Criss crosses using a gold in between them I'm doing orange spots and finally a cherry we've got two little red spots and a green stalk and there you have it that's how you do the fruit salad nails so let's do it on the other hand we've got a watermelon a strawberry now the kiwi fruit followed by of course a pineapple and then to finish it off a cute little cherry so this is what the strawberry looks like and the watermelon and here's the rest of our fingers don't they look great and there you have it that's how you can do your very own fruit salad nails so thank you very much for watching you play kids style everyone if you have enjoyed this
