{"-Ow97uDqoZI": "okay cool so today in the name of what's in my pre-roll we've got this 2g double pack of strawberry wedding cake from sf roots via ease uh he's dropped some money into my account so i was like all right let me just take advantage of this let me just buy a bunch of joints from places that i haven't heard of before i've seen these guys on ease i don't know if i've seen them in a shop but i was curious so i figured hey why not let's check it out together so here we go we've got sf roots we've got whole flower premium pre-roll so that's what we're looking at here and it is infused i don't know if i said that earlier but here is the deets if i can zoom in on this little area here hold on there we go all right so this is coming out the total cannabinoids of 22.93 thc at 20.28 zero cbd and this was packaged back on july 25th we are mid-november now so that is a few months about four months ago this expires i guess next year according to this there's the batch info etc i think that's all the information keef infused light pre-roll whoops keep infused instructions light inhale enjoy all right cool that's that so this is a double pack of 1g joints inside supposedly let's see what other info we got on here strawberry wedding cake government warning watch out they're always watching some distributor yeah and that looks to be it so all right i just didn't want to miss anything there so my haste to get this done before my phone potentially overheats because it does that on these longer videos so here we go so this was 20 bucks pre-tax i believe so for two 1g joints that are infused that's not too bad depending on the material inside it says whole flower premium come on guys come on out pre-rolls there we go whole flower premium so i don't know what that's supposed to be i guess i'll save one of these to smoke and i'll try to smoke it and talk live about it on my patreon maybe i'll do a live or something but this one's going back coffee's working right now let's see all right so this is what we got so you can see a little bit came out already just was hanging out in the tube i guess maybe made its way out of these js it's a little heavily packed at the top but the crutch doesn't appear to be too weak the bend is happening up further so that's not too bad decent crutch let me get a dry pool it's got a floral sweetness to it it does not taste bad at all i think that's that wedding cakey kind of sweetness in there so that's cool it's not tasting too bad it's not super pronounced though i'm not trying to mislead you nothing on the outside so i'm guessing there's going to be extra keefe basically on the inside and now you know i'm not one two oops let me get in focus there i'm not one to be all about the thc percentages that's not me man let me zoom in i'm so far away you guys are just seeing my hand basically you're not seeing this masterful twist this masterful spiral cut that i'm doing that's totally intentional all right yeah it's having a hard one today the coffee is running thick there we go all right so this is supposed to be a full g i guess it's a g with the floral material our plant material is probably would be more commonly said and the keef but we're going to find out what else is in here it's looking a little dark it did say it was premium but it didn't make any claims i don't believe of being indoor yeah nothing left in there all right so there's what came out there's a little bit better of a view on it so yeah it doesn't make any claims on the tube here it just says whole flower premium pre-roll but it doesn't say it's indoor or anything like that so no promises made it's looking like it's greenhouse to me uh just from the color alone but hey that could just be the color of the nug maybe i'm wrong on that sf roots feel free to chime in so it does seem that has these chunks here of uh of keefe so it's infused i guess but it's kind of chunked up together there in little bits let's see if we can find any unwanted passengers in here the material is just looking fairly ground i guess this is probably a big chunk of keefe there we go fairly ground down um not atypical for pre-rolls in general but i'm thinking that if there were there's a big chunk key right there uh if there were any passengers that they would have been finely ground two little bits and looking something like that so like there's just a little tiny evident i mean you know this i don't know the quality of the flower that went into this i can't say it says premium this is a little piece of a seed pod right here what's this guy i don't know chime in what do you guys think what that is it looks it's too small it's just all ground up it's too hard to tell it could just be a little piece of one of those like tiny premature seed pods here's a bigger piece of lumber so so yeah it looks evident that this was just kind of ground up i'm sure they used some kind of fruit futuro machine or some other mask grinder and they're mass packing it but the material itself didn't taste too bad on the dry pool let me get a sniff on this you guys take a look in there but yeah you know i mean this is two 1g joints in one tube so what can you expect for that but yeah not smelling anything fantastic just a little minty a little musty just plant like you know overall plant that's what i'm getting off of this so so yeah the taste was a little better than the smell but let's go ahead and get a weight on this get the scale kicking over here you guys just admire those little piles of keefe and i'll smoke the other one and we'll see how it goes why not you know it's not like i'm not super turned off by this material but it's just you know it seems like it's fairly evident that this is not indoor especially by the smell too but but i mean the color was my first my first um indication i guess but all right let me zoom way out here here we go getting the way on let's tear this bad boy out all righty teared you guys can see that perfect so if this comes out to 0.9 or more just because i like to give that a little bit of leeway with my scale 0.9 or higher then we are good to go gets a pass you know i mean it's like i'm not again super stoked coming up to 0.8 let me re-weigh got a little bit of dust here there we go retail i'll just do it again for safety's sake but let's see it might come up if it comes up 0.8 maybe it is a little shy maybe the other one is 1.1 because it is two and one tube you can't say there's not much okay there's point nine so all right let's give it to him it's a pass it's a technical path um not an s rank i would say it's kind of like a i'll give this like a b or a c i don't know it depends on how much i like this student how much i want them out of my class but that's what you're getting 20 bucks plus tax for two of these that's just the contents of one so you have the knowledge now use it to your discretion if you want it if you find it for a price you like go for it", "O9kBd_cleAc": "hey what's good everybody j ping here checking in respectmyregion.com here today to do a quick taste test pre-roll review featuring the hammerhead infused pre-roll a group out of san pedro long beach california uh man we've i'm personally really excited to check this out i've been hearing a lot of great things um we're looking at a product that has quality cannabis in terms of flour there are premium diamonds sprinkled out throughout this blunt i'm sorry throughout this joint there is distillate and on the outside has been coated and then it was coated in keef as well and then they do a strain or botanical natural terpene specific uh kind of um blend i guess i would say depending on the flavor that they're going for and so this is the og uh og kush flavor og kush strain flour and then og natural terpenes and so i'm excited to check it out the packaging is something i'm a big fan of i really like the aquatic underwater vibe the hammerhead the logo is super dope they have the little view here on the box of what's inside the joint testing wise 26.89 on the thc 31.47 on the total cannabinoids so this is definitely potent distributed by sea bright farms so here we go we've got cardboard box plastic dupe tube joint smells good inside oh it is definitely covered in keefe y'all check this out that is one hell of a good looking infused joint right there all right the dry hit is delicious i'm gonna massage it out just a little bit infused joints sometimes can be packed pretty tight and it makes for a troublesome smoke so always important to make sure you come ready with these um premium products all right here we go you guys see the light make sure when you're lighting your joints yo you guys got to be twisting it you want to make sure you get an even burn all the way around the joint there you go and then you got to give it a couple rips and look at that a nice good even burn here i'll show you wow wow this tastes really good so i was telling the hammerhead team like yo you know i try the fuzzies i try the jeters i try all these different you know infused joints that are out there i remember all the infused ones back in seattle big shout out to all the infused companies you know all over doing joints but the fact remains is that keef and distillate makes this a harsher product and so if you have good tasting flour and the diamonds the dusty the terps whatever it is you're adding to it you're infusing it with is that if that can complement your flour then you've got it and from what i'm tasting so far this is complementing everything oh yeah i would smoke these all the time for sure feels like i'm smoking a blunt that i like or a fat ass joint that i rolled myself and then coated myself and then dipped myself i love it this is dope this is dope when i think of a score out of 10 in terms of flavor i think of a 98 99 out of 100 the only thing i don't want in this product is natural terpenes i want cannabis terps if this had some fire og terps from cannabis only in this this [ __ ] would be way more potent than it is but it's already good so i'm going to give it a 98 instead of a 99 just for that reason in terms of the overall score i'm going to give it a 90 a 98 as well because i still want cannabis terps cannabis only everything on this product and this makes it a perfect product this is going to be one of the best products on the entire west coast we tour taste test reviews everything this is just wow wow wow wow nice [ __ ] work hammerhead hell yeah let me know what you guys think if you guys have had the og kush if you had the og hammerhead infused pre-roll in the past please be sure to drop a comment let me know what you think let the other people know what you think uh if you haven't yet let us know when you go buy it let us know if you're in a parking lot chill and watching this considering it i recommend it 10 out of 10 on the recommendation this is dope super duper fire 100 natural paper over here i rest my taste like follow and subscribe to respect my region on all social medias y'all i'll catch you all in the next review i gotta finish smoking this and just enjoy it even the white ash on the top done love you guys peace", "IX5dj0SfQDQ": "well it's time to do another video here and um unfortunately the mailman hasn't arrived yet it's with my stuff so um wait a minute what the hell is that it's the plate of pot and it's got eight items on here and it looks like one two three four pre-rolls and four three point fives um well let's go through them i guess we've got edison ice cream cake we've got weed me mandarin cookies uh ignite crescendo that's a pre-roll no idea what that is scotia lemon dory then we've got canna farms super critical uh silver haze or something like that then we've got captain's choice it's some sort of mysterious sativa blend of pre-roll then we've got another new lp here dixtra green houses i think that's what they call it dixtra something like that um lemon pepper spice and finally we've got ignite gg number four pre-roll oh my goodness this is very exciting eight new items on this plate of pot right in time when i ran out just giving a shuffle here so it's all nice and random super random and here we go i'll take anything except a pre-roll please no no it's the captain's choice oh maybe these will be good i don't know we'll see it's the captain's choice here it is it's the captain's choice sativa blend uh 19 or 195.5 milligrams per gram uh and this is two pre-rolls in here for a total of one g and let's see here united greenery so that's who makes this that's who the captain works for and we've got the date is november the 3rd of 2020 so not too bad not too bad so if you're wondering why i got these four pre-rolls on this plate of pot here um when i made my last order i had like 20 bucks left over so i thought you know what i'm going to get a couple 1g things but there's not many of those around anymore so i thought i'll just get 20 worth of pre-rolls and i tried to get stuff that uh we don't normally see as flower right so this one here right you don't even have the lp doesn't have anything so i mean or the brand that's why i thought it'd be cool this one here for two dubs that are each supposed to be half a gram this went for four dollars and 38 cents which is not bad um for two half grams supposedly half ram joints we'll find out soon first we're going to check out the scale here because uh that's what we're gonna do so like on my last video we're gonna do it a little differently here we're gonna put this on zero it out because somebody suggested this and you know in my mind this would be technically slightly slightly even more uh accurate so here we put that on 50.00 perfect perfect see look at that [Laughter] i guess that's cool anyways let's open this up and see what these things look like and way holy shit oh my god that's not even a i thought that was a flip top i've been trying to flip it like this that would pop open but nope that's the hinge they hid the opening over here somewhere oh boy that is a little bit difficult to open but there we go we got it and hey you know what these are actually out of all the pre-rolls i've seen these are some of the nicest looking the filter isn't insanely huge it's big i would go half that size but that's it's not half the size of the joint like those quest ones let's see what they each weigh with filter because normally we don't check it with the filter oh my god 0.8 that's good what about this one 0.8 also wow that means that these might weigh the proper amount let's find out let's empty these in here and see if it makes uh oh and look at that nice little spiral we'll see if it makes it a gram look at that i just pulled the filter out all nice oh very nice and now i should be able to just just sort of go like this and empty it all here look at that 0.49 i did get a couple tiny little bits out so you know that's that's fucking close oh my god i've never seen one that was so accurate i'm impressed i'm impressed let's try this one i have no idea what strain is in here though that's a mystery [Music] there's a little bit in the tip come on get out of there come on get all of you come on oh my god look at this they actually did it the captain did it all right so i went and got this nice box and i'm gonna check out the uh we'll check out this stuff here with the microscope and see what kind of stuff they're putting inside here see a little stem right there hopefully that's the only one right well let's take a look at it we got this nice box it's black so we won't get a lot of reflection should be all right so one thing i didn't think of when i was getting this box was how tall the box was it's pretty tall i can barely actually know what i'm going to turn the box around and i'm gonna put this thing up on here and check there we go i figured they were so here we are looking at the captain's choice this is what the captain smokes when the captain's looking for a sativa apparently um so you can see some chunky trichomes in there you can see it it does look a little bit like uh it reminds me somewhat not as nicely of but somewhat like shred i i don't know if uh can see some bits of stem here and there you can see some trichomes they're kind of cloudy and chunky looking let's see if we can zoom in closer that's about as close as i can get without it getting all horribly blurry oh there we go a little bit nicer there yeah so that's kind of what it looks like there and you know i don't see a ton of stems i see some little bits of of stem and leaf like you can see right there the big reflection you see all the reflections shining so much off that pretty sure that's a leaf right there and so it looks okay it doesn't look as bad as that one time i got the pedros from color that pretty ready to roll garbage that stuff was horrible but this looks okay it doesn't look as good as shred but it looks okay so hopefully it is okay and i'm gonna go try it and then i'll be right back so i just got in from trying the captain's choice sativa blend oh sativa blend i didn't notice that before interesting at 19 so i first out there when i was trying i thought it was kind of weak but um after a while uh it's sort of sort of a creeper on there and it sort of kicks up to like maybe just below a medium for the high so the high on here is uh it's all right but at first it kind of was like it felt weak but there's a bit of a creeper there and it sort of creeps up to maybe a medium maybe just somewhere around a medium maybe just below a medium to a medium that's kind of nice and it's kind of like uh it's got like a i guess it makes it kind of alert sort of um sort of really awake it's kind of woke me up this thing it made me really um make me feel really awake and stuff i don't feel like energetic or anything but i feel really kind of like i could go and do some sort of physical activities or some shit um yeah so that's kind of all right i guess not that i want to go do anything like that but you know i guess it's okay it's okay it's a nice it's like kind of like um like a clear-headed kind of a buzz maybe not clear-headed but it's kind of it's not a couch lock at all we'll say that and yeah but this stuff is quite dry so i don't know if how it would burn in a joint or whatever there was absolutely no flavor no flavor at all and there was no smell too so that you know that sucks for both of those things unless i guess some people they they like it so it doesn't smell so i guess for you that will be okay but the high on here is okay um the weight i'm surprised actually had the proper weight on here for um pretty much for both of them they came up to well combined it came up to one and uh yeah and it was actually packed really nicely in here it's a probably one of the nicest pre-rolls i've seen so far it was a little bit large filter but it wasn't insane like some of them and as it came out it was all nicely packed it had it felt like there was no hard spots or anything like maybe there would be really good air flow through there there was no no hard spots or anything that was all sort of nicely nicely packed so yeah you know for five bucks and it's okay there's better for five bucks but you know whatever it's uh it's the captain's choice so [Laughter] if you like captains and maybe i don't know who knows i wouldn't i don't think i would ever buy it again but you know i had five bucks to spend and i spent it on this and i don't regret it because there was nothing else available so i would have had to have spent well i would have had to have less stuff so i don't regret it because it just gave me more stuff to try there how old was that i wouldn't buy it again though anyways though that's the captain's choice um this uh seven more things on the um what is that called there so we got seven more things on the plate of pot uh come check it out hit the subscribe button uh in the notification bell it'll tell you when the next um one of those videos goes up and that yeah that's uh that's all there is for this well we'll see you later have a good one i just remembered something that i wanted to add in here real quick because i just remembered it i was just stopped recording but anyways when i was saying there was no flavor in this there was no flavor but there's a little bit of an aftertaste which is not the best aftertaste and it's a taste i know very well and you guys probably know very well it's the taste of when there's a seed in your joint you're smoking it there's a seed in there and it burns that taste it's very unique taste that was the there was a slight aftertaste of that so i don't know if maybe a seed or two got ground up in this also maybe who knows but i did have slight aftertaste of of a seed you know that's unmistakable aftertaste it took me a few minutes to figure out what it was and then when i realized that i was like oh yeah that's that yeah anyways just thought i'd mention that because uh yeah anyways see you later have a good one", "jPWqIMkbnjg": "what's up everybody it's rob back with

instagram man this is day three of the blackout that's currently happening in my community um they shut out all the freaking power to the whole entire like block because they're trying to prevent any fires from happening there's a lot of really high 85 mile winds and stuff happening so they just don't want anything bad happen dude there's trees broken down literally all over my complex and things i'm just like whoa this looks like literally like a horror movie bro go follow me on my instagram to get updated with that stuff because i have no power bro i haven't been able to upload i'm just literally recording right now because look you see my setup back there nothing's on bro because there's no power whatsoever i don't have internet access i don't have internet to edit i mean i don't have access to my computer to edit videos so yeah um we've been staying at my in-laws house because they're the only ones with um access to you know and internet and you know anything power as that so we've been staying over there for the past couple days and there's no one here so man so i'm taking advantage and i'm gonna be smoking this cheetah piss blunt guys that purchased that cookies you guys remember that video i'm finally gonna be smoking it right here throughout the whole entire apartment and just gonna be talking to you guys since no one's here i'm just gonna fully enjoy this to the max so i just cut it open right here you have to cut it with scissors it doesn't have a little seal to open it but this is the cheetah piss bone this one is sitting at 23 thc this is the front and then let me go ahead and slide it out all right guys boom and then you get it in a nice little long white tube boom and then let me go ahead and take this out hopefully no bud falls out oh my goodness this thing is thick yo this is thicker than a bowl of oatmeal boys holy smokes this is the cookies blunt this is a hemp wrap with a glass tip and you got the cheetah piss stuffed to the max right there bro it feels like it's going to fall out but they got that thing wrapped in there nice i'm squeezing around and it doesn't really seem like there's any gaps in here so let's just go ahead and uh smoke this yo i lost my thing to mount my freaking tripod onto my camera so this angle is just gonna have to do all right yo so we got our blunt and we got our torch right here because i heard with these you kind of you it's better to light them with the torch just because you could get a nice more even burn so that's what we're gonna do boys we're just gonna go ahead and torch it roast it like a little marshmallow roast the tip boys don't burn it too much and then once it's nice and charred you can pretty much just start cheating on [Music] it oh nothing hit back boys oh my goodness this thing is about to get hot hold on let me close the window so i mean the door so it doesn't go out to the living room and stuff all right so right off the bat what i taste from this wrap dude is more like a i know this wrap is some type of flavoring i just can't tell what kind it is [Music] but this thing is burning smooth dude so i thought the last cheetah piss which was light death was super smooth this is like a whole different level personally i've never tried a hemp wrap so i can't really say i'm too familiar with this wrap but overall so far so good dude the taste is actually super smooth like i'm saying you get a very very nice sweet aroma to it like when you inhale i don't know if that's the weed or if that's the wrap helping it but dude they rolled this honestly pretty freaking perfect all right so i'm gonna just keep chiefing this thing away until i make a dent in it because i honestly don't feel like i should just be talking over this whoever's on the phone can wait bro this thing is too good man so far guys i think i'm tasting a lot more of the wrap than i'm tasting the bud which kind of leads me to believe like i kind of wish they would have just rolled this in like some type of joint maybe like a vibes papers like cubano joint or something i know you're supposed to put like a quarter ounce in those but just make like a special type of like little can and paper and roll like a two to three gram j with a glass filter because personally look i'm not trying to bash it and say it's bad but me personally you know when i smoke i usually try like to taste my weed and i feel like in this case the hemp wrap is just overpowering the weed a hundred percent [Music] like i am getting a little bit now that i'm hitting it more i am getting a little bit of the essence of the cheetah piss that i got from the light def but this one is just like a hundred percent more smoother the light def i'm gonna be 100 honest that one when i smoked it out of a j when i smoked it out of a bong it just tasted so phenomenal like that you could taste every single terp in that plant and in this one i just feel like like the the hemp rep is just doing too much in this man it's playing like it's trying to play like the main role in this part and then that's not the case it shouldn't be the case man the main person in this should be the bud 100 [Music] we are blowing some fat clouds i'm not gonna lie this is kind of burning though how can i describe this it doesn't hit like a blunt bro because the glass tip just gives it a whole type of different filtration system and also the hem wrap is just like so neatly wrapped it kind of reminds me of a backward i don't know if you guys could see that but it's kind of like a spiral [Music] bro this thing is chucking clouds dude i don't know if i don't know if like you guys can see all the smoke around me but this room is definitely getting hot so like you know paying 30 beans for this or was like 35 beans for this like i don't even know i think it was 30. [Music] i think personally i would rather just i don't know though because 2gs in this it's kind of worth it plus the glass tip plus you don't even have to roll it already there i guess this is a fun thing to to cop when you're out with the homies or when you're gonna go gonna go out to sesh or something for a special occasion i definitely don't think you should be you know copying these when you're just gonna go smoke by yourself or something because this is this is enjoyable but honestly buying an eighth would be way more enjoyable and being able to hit it out of the bong [Music] just because when i personally was hitting it out of the bong i felt like i was getting a way more crazy high dude and um like i kept saying i feel like you could taste the strain a lot more now remember this is um 100 indoor grown this is like the main stuff that they try to sell out so the one that i had last time was a light death which was supposed to be cheaper um you know in quality but in my opinion there was nothing cheap about that that plant was 100 fire i wouldn't mind going to cop that again because i had such an enjoyable time smoking that one [Music] this thing is ripping bro like it's starting to get hot in here because of all the smoke man i'm starting to get the little sweats let's talk about the high so far so far it's like i'm saying i'm not really getting a crazy high like i felt like i was getting with it with the um in the light def cheetah piss um with this one it's a little bit more mellow it's not like boom smacking your face put you to sleep like the light death was and i don't know if that's just because it's in a combination with the hemp wrap or maybe it's just because i haven't finished the whole thing but i'm not getting a crazy height but i'm just gonna keep chiefing and see if that changes throughout this [Music] once you get to the end dude is when it starts like really really hitting honestly like in the beginning it hits but when you get to like the in the middle to the end is when it's just like i feel like that's when it's more tightly packed and it's just literally chucking clouds and i feel like it gives me the sensation in my chest like oh dude does he just take a fat hit but look at the circle ring on this everything about it dude everything about it is good in my opinion it's just that the hemp wrap like i keep saying it just gives such a distinct taste dude like it tastes like it doesn't taste like wheat it just tastes like out of place you feel me it doesn't taste like it should be like you should be wrapping butt in this in my opinion maybe i'm just this is the first time i've ever tried a hemp um wrap and i must say i'm not the biggest fan i'm definitely not the biggest fan i would never go out of my way to you know wrap one because i feel like now that i've tried you know joints bongs everything i feel like i really really know what's the best method to get the most out of your product [Music] oh my goodness this thing is freaking hitting dude i'm trying to hit after hit but soloing this to the face is kind of like crazy i know some of you out there are probably like yo yo i could finish this but this is actually some freaking gas and it's actually packed perfectly so it burns very very slow like i feel like i if i look back at the camera it's probably going to be at least over 10 minutes i know [Music] and so far dude this room is actually very very hot box i'm not gonna lie but it's all good because we have one of those air purifiers the ionizers that you just press and it's like boom instantly wipes up everything i love it dude if you if you are um you know a smoker you definitely should get one for your pad if you want to be smoking inside because it instantly i kid you not in almost not instantly instantly but within like five to ten minutes it clears up the whole room the smell the stink everything and it's you know finito this thing is freaking hitting harsh now dude once it gets to the end it's kind of like plus it was like when i started it i think it was like up to like right here so it's a it's a pretty decent sized blunt i must say myself this thing is definitely like i'm not getting like that crazy high like i was saying but i am feeling a little bit more like of a of a head relaxation honestly it's not a body it's just more in the head and i feel like maybe the hem prep has something to do with the conjunction of the bud like i was saying but i'm i'm honestly i feel all right definitely not a pr a bad product like i was saying it's just like me personally man after you know using joints bonds everything i feel like i already have my preference and these hemp wraps just for me are not the wave so with that being said the overall product is actually really really good you know seven out of ten i felt like it would get i would give it an eight or a nine out of ten if it was wrapped in a joint with the gloss tip i'd rather i prefer to see that than this honestly but the overall concept of it is actually really really freaking dope like if you look at it it's actually really dope you know the cookies and the cheetah piss and having everything just at the fingertips of a just a blunt with the glass tip is phenomenal so with that being said seven out of ten for me um i'm gonna go ahead and end it out here guys if you guys enjoyed

gram of their live resin diamonds that concentrate component that extra like punch to it and then if that wasn't enough they wrap it in lift tickets yup lift tickets i love is an infused rolling paper we've seen them around since like the pre-legalization medical days so it was super fun to see that that was the paper that this was used for and we need to give a big shout out to mj one of our favorite delivery services here in los angeles we were able to get this luxury pre-roll hand-delivered to us so we didn't even have to go out and visit a shop during the pandemic yeah all right so

name is Courtney Crosby I currently live in Portland Oregon working in the cannabis industry and I want to share my love of the cannabis with you all but before we get started got a little Bowl packed here if you want to join alone that be awesome [Music] your best resource for smoking without the smell is going to be cartridges there are a few different types and styles of cartridges I mean with a prequel Tabar battery this is going to be my favorite battery that I have and it comes with the battery itself a charger a micro USB charger which I love about this battery two different bottom pieces for your cartridges that you had attached to the bottom of your cartridge to make it a magnet connection to the battery itself a few different cartridges to this battery and show you how well it works and everything screw this little bottom on the metal bottom piece on here making it a magnet connection to the battery and see so it doesn't fall out which is really nice look at the button five times to turn the battery on and off you can also double click the button here and it will do a pre heat setting which is really nice if you've ever had your battery laying on the side and all the oil has run to one side of the cartridge or it's just really cold and your cartridge and the oil inside is really cold you can put that pre heat setting on and it'll preheat the cartridge in together ready for use which is really awesome also has a temperature gauge up here at the top which is really important three cartridges to burn at different temperatures also when you set your cartridge down on the lowest temperature you're gonna go through your cartridge a lot slower it's also gonna taste a lot better so if you have your cartridge turn all the way up on high which is good for some cartridges to work or to lay other cartridges it'll just taste really burn you'll actually burn your cartridge and sometimes it can actually pop through the top of your cartridge and burn you which what you don't want on our cartridge oh just turn it down I can help with things like that so I'm gonna hit this bad boy and show you what it can do [Music] so taking this metal piece off and transferring it to you let's try out this buddy's cartridge these specific cartridges you can tell there's a little bit different we got two different mouthpieces here also the different types of oil on the inside which is really important just depending on what kind of cartridge you want I'll specifically really like the flat tips because you can hit it from any direction where is these tips you can only get it from the front or the back you have a specific battery with a button on it you have to hit a specific direction that can be difficult if your cartridge is in at a funny angle I just transferred the metal piece on to this cartridge here so it is now a magnet connection to this battery here so it doesn't fall out and you try it with this cartridge [Music] moving on to evolve I have their living resin cartridge and their battery to go open up this battery check it out another micro USB charger which is really great just plugs in down here on the bottom which is really awesome it says evolve across the battery with a nice button [Music] a button for your battery is also really important because some cartridges actually require a button it kind of just sends the signal to the cartridge saying okay it's time to warm up and activate the cartridge so some cartridges actually require a button on them some batteries are just a pull-through battery some cartridges work with those but not all cartridges do the last battery that we got here this is going to be a disposable battery so the battery comes with the cartridge you don't have to buy them separately just really great but once you're finished with that you would actually recycle the whole bad boy together so let this one it will be one of those pull through batteries it doesn't have a button on it or anything this is the Nano here there's also this type of a battery here that also has the button but also has a screw on USB charger on the top really great if you're looking for just an easy accessible battery on the go most of time these bad boys had lifetime warranties on them but unfortunately most the time if you lose this charger please piece in is irreplaceable that is why I like the micro USB chargers it a lot of these bad boys gone here [Music] please let me know down below what you thought in today's video I'm going to have any questions tips or things to add please let me know I love to hear about it thanks for watching and I hope you all have a great day", "nt--GaafyCg": "[Music] welcome back to flight crew we're coming at you with a hot box right now yeah because my [ __ ] lights

paper you got bro i'll say that [ __ ] wasn't even that bad if y'all don't know check out our kibano roll-up paper on instagram you feel me out the murder for the vibes papers he needs to come out with vibes that perhaps oh well oh vibesies yeah i didn't know that i said the only brand i really know well i guess those are the two now so raw raw juicy did you know he owned uh you know 2.0 didn't know that yeah well more you know i've never tried that stuff but him too oh ain't that the drink yeah i've tried that [ __ ] before this it's like it's like a it's like it's like it's like a it's like a water it's a fruity water one of those vitamin waters yeah yeah it's damaged just like one of those i don't like vitamin water just give me plain water but what everybody's actually kind of solid like it's not the best thing like i mean you know like as an athlete [ __ ] is lived off the gatorade and pirate for like mostly life so we know that when i all the side [ __ ] started coming out like the only one that i like the only power drink i still [ __ ] with that's like off bread but it's still good is that body armor shout out by [ __ ] kobe or rrp that [ __ ] covey because that was his [ __ ] that body armor oh yeah they get off that too any type of like flavored water like that i'm good now you don't even like just regular like fizzy water and [ __ ] like that that should be so good i just had a bottle today like it's like you get the you get the you get the satisfaction of soda but it's still water but it's still water still not good for you though because it's kind of sugar in it no no it's just water it's literally just water with carbon added to it that's what gives it bubbles used to buy those by the [ __ ] pack and i just i can't drink it anymore it's gross i mean i think there is one with sugar in it but really [ __ ] just like fizzy water like fizzy flavored water like those shits it's literally just water with carbon in it to give it bubbles i don't know she used to buy the fizzy ones and then she bought the regular ones that weren't carbonated and that's even [ __ ] worse oh fruit water those [ __ ] are nasty oh gosh the grape ones are the worst those would be those those are nasty but one time so we were doing this weird [ __ ] some on some white people [ __ ] in south dakota we were doing a mock house party so we were literally like we had a bunch of students and uh parents would go through it was like a tour and we would act like we were in a house party and like scenarios would come up and we would like pause and they would like talk about the scenario and stuff like that like there's like a rape scene and stuff like that i wasn't part of anything brutal thank god i was just part of this one scene where we're playing the game at this table or whatever oh so you [ __ ] played beer pong that bit uh it was some weird card game or something i don't know but um i was with my brothers we were doing the scene together and these [ __ ] know i hate flavored water and they had something with them that day they brought this he's like all right here you guys goes to play for water yeah so it's supposed to be regular absolutely i take shots that's like my part i literally like i take three shots and these [ __ ] filled each shot with grape flavored [ __ ] water and it's the worst one i absolutely hate the great one so that [ __ ] really acted like he was taking a shot yes it looked legit because i was like i threw the first one back i like i was like and then i took the second one i kept it in my mouth took the other one kept it in my mouth because i didn't have to say any lines after that wait until they left the room and went spit it out in the sink oh that was this man said the grape flavored water yeah flavored water is trash but fizzy water is good did you want it's not too bad flavored water is trapped with fizzy flavored water it's good that's not bad but the [ __ ] dizzy flavored water is hella good like i said i just had to um i had a what was i had today i had a black cherry that was the flavor i had today those are the best black cherries hella good if i'm gonna drink the fizzy water it's definitely gonna be black cherry what the [ __ ] was that your shoes [ __ ] probably not that black cherry was hella good though black tree like cherries a low-key goated flavor bro i don't think like is it weird that like i don't like cherries on top of my well cherries on top of like those like on top of like milkshakes and [ __ ] aren't cherries that's mary she don't cherries it's just soaked in like sugar water pretty much it's like a candied cherry pretty much yeah they're cool and i don't eat them but they're cool and sure like temples no i don't i don't eat them hoes at all perfect i don't eat them i never got cheese on my on my all my [ __ ] when i was younger my like shakes and whatnot i'll just give it to my mom or something somebody would eat it not a big fan of cherries in general i don't eat like actual cherries either nah but like cherry pop tarts are goated um there's some oh black cherry uh there's a black cherry i want to say dutch or like a game leaf no it's a black cherry game yeah those are goated those are fire um [ __ ] cherry vanilla soda and damn near anything like cherry vanilla i carry soda itself there's fire i don't know if i have black tray but i know like tray vanilla coke you've never had black cherries on the the shasta oh that's just fire i don't know if it's the same cause soda don't it's not the same anymore because damn we use real sugar i thought straws to use cane sugar or like sugarcane they might i don't know i had the shots to like i got one from the vending machine it's still 35 cents clutch i got one from a vending machine that [ __ ] did not taste the same or i don't know i never really drink sauce just like that my favorite soda growing up was uh dr pepper until i can stop drinking soda fruit fruit like dr pepper they got the best cherries on the dr pepper yeah that was that's the reason why i [ __ ] with cherry soda like the cherry uh like vanilla root beer always been stupid cherry root beer went stupid they did a trade vanilla or you know cherry vanilla coke is fire yeah that's just fire too i'm about to say you know i like like burger king mcdonald's that should be having like those thousand drink machines and whatnot like bro once i saw what i saw a tray vanilla root beer bro i was man oh yeah that's just oh i love those machines with the [ __ ] thousands of choices but yeah i thought that i had to stop half of them are out though i had to stop doing that [ __ ] though bro because um i just hate when you go through a drive-through and you ask like when you like a jack-in-the-box and you ask for a certain drink yeah they just be like what and then they just like throw some random [ __ ] in the cup well you asked for a [ __ ] cherry sprite they gave you purple [ __ ] fanta what the [ __ ] i'm crying yeah now when i go to like when i go to like places like that i always go inside just so i know like i'ma get what the [ __ ] i want to get because like there's this burger king uh tuskegee school and [ __ ] with that like everybody everybody in tuskegee already know about the burger king first off shouts out to them but um nah bruh they have 1000 drink machines too and my and my [ __ ] my [ __ ] when i was out there bro was a um or vanilla high c i prefer the fruit punch classic fruit punch i see i mean orange is classy but when they put that ella in that [ __ ] but that [ __ ] or they got the [ __ ] the minute made better made us fire out of those machines true loki if i was there if it wasn't like if it was on my campus i would have came down with like a couple water bottles or something filled up no it's not on campus it's like i mean it's like a couple blocks but like [ __ ] i mean [ __ ] do walk there it's honestly like the same distance from like here if we were going to like you know that quick stop right down there yeah like at the at the end like right by the freeway it would literally be like the same dish from like walking for like i know i'm just left like my dorm room too burger king because where i stay was like kind of like deeper if you were then if you're like at like the martialettes or something from what we called it but yeah like [ __ ] i remember i asked i was like hey bro let me get an orange vanilla high c one time [ __ ] they just like i said they just threw some [ __ ] in there bro oh wait uh i came back in i was just like [ __ ] it do this myself went in there yeah just like [ __ ] it that's what i do well you got the wrong [ __ ] i'm just gonna i'll take a couple water bottles fill that [ __ ] up go back to campus yeah no that's the thing like a lot of [ __ ] just to help whoa what the gym i don't know i really never saw nobody who heard about that but in south dakota i went to visit my brother one weekend and there's a mcdonald's like two blocks from campus so like i guess a couple years ago things would just like always get hella drunk and just try to walk through the drive-through and they're like they would just like they wouldn't let them let them and then finally like [ __ ] it i guess it's safer than them trying to like drive because they're drunk so then they they literally let people walk through the drive too they might as well just let [ __ ] do that [ __ ] that [ __ ] is hilarious we're sitting there we're in my brother's car he's got like this old-ass cadillac where my brother's car and this drunk guys dude behind us and all of a sudden he just starts shaking the [ __ ] car he's like bouncing us we're like oh do we have to get out and beat his ass oh i'll be over here like they're about kicked out of line though they're like they're like the mcdonald's people told them to stop man i saw that show like they let them just walk through i'm like okay let me this that's nice honestly i like that that's nice i used to get hella mad cuz i remember there used to be times where me and my brother used to uh oh yeah because we had to i can't think you gotta smoke your eye [ __ ] there's smoke everywhere it's always in my way in my eye uh i could this you don't even bother me right now no uh there's this taco bell you know what do you really talk about where i used to live by like kfc in the taco bell yeah like when me and my brother were like stupid young like when i was like the 34th grade we like you know ride our bikes over there get food and [ __ ] like and then like sometimes on the late night we just be like [ __ ] let's slide with the [ __ ] um obviously the front will be closed if we just be like bro we on the bikes bro like this is technically right and through i don't know if it's driving but it's right it's just a dangerous thing because like you can get hit they actually let you get you did they actually let you get food no they should never let us get food yeah i figured they wouldn't they see you on the camera like nah these two [ __ ] think they about to rob what i'm like bro if you try to get me two tacos and some nachos bruh it's not like i could take out fast on this [ __ ] bike anyway right if you really want to rob them on a bike bro like how far are we getting [ __ ] go call 9-1-1 be like hey bro two [ __ ] robbed us on a bike they went that way you getting caught for sure that's what i'm saying don't rob nobody because karma unless you have a plan karma is a [ __ ] if you steal for anything still from these million dollar corporations yep that bought a [ __ ] for like two cents to sell it to us for like five dollars oh for sure [ __ ] walmart mm-hmm i always get your five-figure discounts i i don't know if i could i could say this

how to be slick nope damn nah i'm not gonna go to library pioneer with like older generation because i knew [ __ ] who were in like my brother's age and whatnot bro and [ __ ] would just like [ __ ] said they used to just like pop open the like slide door and and just describe whatever they wanted yeah you know just like bro i remember one time and then [ __ ] go right to gamestop and sell that [ __ ] and that's why gamestop prices is [ __ ] so like that's why you can't get [ __ ] back for your game because [ __ ] like y'all diggers used to steal that [ __ ] from walmart and sell it to gamestop like bruh what you know one time i was in walmart but and you know how they had like the little like the wire things that go around the boxes and [ __ ] yeah it's like this let me just walk

because the main colors they had was like white black and red yeah so i'm just like you would have been straight but still yeah i got the black yellow shirts then my coach stole your coach my coach this [ __ ] borrowed up and never gave them back nah [ __ ] i'm breaking your kneecap at practice that [ __ ] was he's my dad's best friend kneecaps at practice he's like my uncle that's just [ __ ] do what it's [ __ ] up they just won the championship too and football that's nice he still hasn't got him on basketball he's got three in football though for the state yeah oh damn it's a lot that's right i guess that's a lot i don't know [ __ ] i don't know well i mean like because when he first came in we went 0-8 in football for [ __ ] three seasons before we finally won a game this [ __ ] sucked not winning a game at all i don't that's tough that has to do something to your pride growing up that has to it made us work harder i wasn't like sixth grade when i first got there we didn't win the game until i was a freshman or eighth grader freshman i mean that's good that it made you work harder but [ __ ] i couldn't imagine it sucked i'm sorry but i think it's who i played but were nice at least basketball we we never that never happened to us in basketball thank [ __ ] god well yeah take the fact that i've never played no other sport it always happened to our girls our girls would beat the same team they would have three wins on the year because they would beat the same team they played like the same team three times and they'd beat them that would be their only wins on the year i mean they only won just because they was trashed in them yes and one year they lost to them [ __ ] that's like us losing to kennedy that one too in our [ __ ] our coach literally told us on their bus because we took a it was uh the morning game it was like the tournament type of thing yeah so everybody sleep so we went to watch the game and our coach literally like told us he's like hey don't say [ __ ] about like do not say because we're like the guys out there [ __ ] he's like do not say anything to them girls man like i said it could have magically loki though i'm not gonna say it was better than us but like we we will all make it to like the same like playoff range you know girls that was the oh that was that team's only win on the year that's well no our girls were buggies shouts out this shout out to them too that's not the best our girls are not the best they're better now but they were not they were not the best they couldn't even do the tip drill where you throw it off the backboard and like run to the back of the line yeah or like run to the other side of the court and then it's done you think we should do it yeah so they were trying to do that and they could not they could not do it some girls would throw it over the backboard some girls would throw it under the backboard some girls would grab it and couldn't jump and like gravity couldn't jump at the same time the coordination was [ __ ] up yeah so like so when they would drop it they would have to run i mean of course that's the same thing with us so they would get like two two in and then drop it i can run in two in drop it's like running they were running like for 45 minutes because they could not get the tip i don't think they ever got it down we literally like it was [ __ ] up we stopped practice to watch them tragic it's like a big-ass gym and there's a center divider that comes down which is like a big aspect so we were on the sides watching them trying to do you just look you just people on the side you just be like they still ain't got it oh damn they [ __ ] up they say [ __ ] it up we were real [ __ ] too because we uh we started doing it we started doing the drill y'all started doing it hella easy yeah just we're gonna just poop all right so chalk it up yeah let's let's get the [ __ ] out of this hot box man we have tastes high overall so taste for me i'm giving it a smooth ass eight because i am looking genuinely shocked that like i don't know what it tastes like and it doesn't taste like like i can't get the flavor on it but it just tastes it doesn't it didn't hurt my throat tastes pretty good with the hump wrap too i think if it was a joint that might we probably would have been able to really taste it yeah but yeah with the hip breath that [ __ ] was good i'm giving it an eight let me give it up oh yeah the seven wasn't like anything to it like there wasn't no like hints of anything really right um yeah seven because it wasn't like it wasn't like where it burned yeah or burned your throat or anything but there wasn't like a fruity taste or like a floral taste or anything like a woody or anything i would say more like woodier just because like i really couldn't like get a taste but it just tastes like a good like woody i just tasted the hemp mostly no i couldn't like if i'm getting anything it tastes like woody and smooth i just know it's smooth as [ __ ] like that's why i'm giving it a just because like it was very very very very very very smooth definitely give it a seven on high i'm gonna definitely give it a nine because it's smacking me right now i mean that might be the hot box too but i'm also yeah it hit me in the middle of smoking i was just like you ever get like those like pings of like highness yeah just like oh [ __ ] yeah i'm high it's like a movie where like you see like it'll be like oh that's weird but yeah nine for sure on the high and then overall experience i mean if i'm being solid like i like the two g's i just hated that glass tip it wasn't bad the glass tip is hella big bro yeah i don't know why they make them so big i know like i understand air flow and [ __ ] like proper air flow but you just gotta understand like what types of like valves they usually you feel me negative like [ __ ] you just gonna use a straight valve where you go um lower one sides like area so you can get more pressure going through you feel me like that [ __ ] that's basic engineering bruh how are you keeping your eyes open in here i don't think i don't think my eyes are open but i can still see everything yeah overall i'm gonna give it a that's an eight for sure would i say seven i don't know but i didn't even see anything i don't know you didn't give anything but that's a i can't get mine that's a good blunt though for sure two grams usually because when you get a bluntness use like one gram and it's like it's still the same size tip one yeah then it's not packed enough and then it's like all you taste is hemp wrap that i like the two two g's for sure gary payton i just gotta grab an actual [ __ ] eighth of it and try it so what did i say i said the taste was at eight nine and seven so 24 to 30 which is like what seven nine holy [ __ ] which is a b i give it a b eighty percent and what'd you say i gave it a 24 out of 30. same thing so he gave it a b huh gary pays a solid b blunt you can't go wrong with that [ __ ] shouts out to oh god i'm sorry i can't i can't i can't anyways shouts out let me close the [ __ ] real quick real quick shouts out to look at your ass oh shout out to cookies oakland shout out to cookie oakland man gary payton shouts out to bernie shouts out to all the [ __ ] who had to put this blunt together shout outs out to the [ __ ] who grew this power is up shouts out to gary payton to be from oakland california you feel me shout out to oakland in general and from that i guess we're calling it quits this is tk my boy stoner first hotbox video yes sir catch

little thing that we call SML we need you to subscribe and while you're there I need you to hit that notification bell and also just like me because I'm pop mom and you guys already love me anyway so make sure you're going in that love but Ananya to guys today I know have been one like a total hiatus but maybe about a week or two now just because of the holiday break so I appreciate you guys hanging in there making sure you go to my videos as soon as they drop on leave Wednesdays I appreciate it I came back with something bigger this week guys I have Peck woods not to be confused with back woods this is tactless this is packwood's dot la is out of Los Angeles and I am so excited so be the proud owner of three of them I have all three pack words from LA they're now at planted 13 so you can get packwood's in nevada now at planted 13 so shout out to shot planted 13 that always hook me up with the latest that comes out I got all of these and Nevada from them they have an exclusive one called alien og so I'm excited I have all three so what I want to do today is just do a simple product review with you guys I will include all the links to Packwood's la comm so you guys can go in a site find out with new strands that they're coming up with but I'm just excited about the company so what they have done is infused rolling papers that look like blood papers and they're not they're a handmade hemp wrap paper that they put a vein into it to make it look like it was like an actual plant wrapper this guy's is special because they did three different infuse menteur this they have a concentrate in it they have a premium flower and then on outside they dust it with Keith so I don't even know how strong this is gonna be I don't I don't know how many puffs I'm gonna be able to get all I know is I'm gonna be a little out so I don't want you to judge me but we're gonna get into this I have three brands here this one is the alien OG hopefully you can see that this one is exclusive to Planet 13 once again shout out to them they are sold out maybe out of this one you guys have to call them and see this one is called GABA and this is a hybrid so is the alien og so both of these are hyper some remember hybrids want to keep you nice in the middle that way you can feel the head body high but not too high now this one the purple one is called purple punch and this one is an indica so today I'm not going to smoke Invicta I'm also not gonna smoke this particular hybrid Agathe I'm gonna go for the alien og because I am an alien and I want to get a shot off the plane 213 because this one was exclusive you might not see this one on the market I'm not sure so I wanted to kind of give my review to them as well what I thought of the one they made just for planting 13 customers so we're gonna get into this I'm gonna remove these two to the side so first of all I'm going to just talk about the packaging because you my peeps know when I do a product review I go there I go all the way there first of all I love that this can't break I do know they're going for $60 at the shop so they have $60 here in Nevada we can look up and see what they're going for Vegas but this is $60 so for $60 to Graham would concentrate premium flower and they keep one outside that does an amazing deal and I love that you can't break anything so you don't have to silver fragile because I mean your product is fragile but I love the date took the time to kind of like really design it where it's eye-catching as well and even if you see it inside of this place like it's playing 13 they have done the displays so beautifully so shout out to the pack was marketing team in LA y'all did that it also kind of reminds me in a weird way of a Kylie lipstick if y'all agree with me pop peeps just tell me that in the comment it really does it has that whole trippin thing on the side so this is really a good packaging I I'm impressed with packaging didn't even think that so you just roll it off it's a roll and I hope my camera can get to this so let me come up I want you guys to really see that when you first pull it out and you can really smell it the scent on this is I just love the smell okay so if you can see them holding my hand up you can see the key fits nicely dusted on it outside this part of it is a glass tip so it's gonna allow you to like kind of burn it evenly so you get a nice draw every time you pull that's what the glass tip is supposed to doing this is a nice sized glass citize I would say that's a couple of inches I don't know if you can see that real close up but that's like a two inch glass that's really nice to me it feels like if you had a mini cigar in a way so I kind of I love the feel of it it's nothing to it but to do it we're gonna get into it anything I like that's a blunt or the palm rolls or anything like that I like to light mines with the hemp I know this is a little piece of this is hemp rope I like to light it with that that way it gives me some type of control instead of letting my lighter control everything so that's how I'm gonna do it so choose the you pot peeps shot the Packwood's LA and let's get this alien og from shot planted 13 let's I like to inhale just to make sure I'm pulling everything I must say lighting getting I thought the pool would be happy they go be a lot heavier and it's not it's really smooth and I guess it has something to do with the glass tip now I can tell if you can tell I lit it wrong in here but it should have a nice even lip and because that keep us on the outside it shouldn't burn through fast that's what it shouldn't do if you find yourself in you lit it the wrong way just let it take its time and let they kind of like let it breathe and it'll evenly start to burn around so what I like is that you don't have to put the whole piece in your mouth it burns real light you can just put your mouth right on a tip just like my shirt be on the lookout for shop pop mom for 20 years oh I got that weed weird I like this a little dude not sure what premium flower I do know that the concentrate is nice and to keep this not even coming off on my hand I love that so let's talk a little more in depth about this back once I got my smoking hat on you know I've seen Rick Ross smoked this I've seen you waka flocka the baby little baby what's that other baby skittles baby I don't know one of them other babies they've all had this and now I'm hot moms at it I gotta do this I need a friend shout out to any of my papi friends that want to come share cuz I don't know if I'm gonna finish this this is this is a lot I might have this for the next couple days it's two grounds one person should have to finish this off seriously what did you say when you hi you just don't know what to say I guess you say that [ __ ] was good huh no I hate that y'all see me like this cuz I'm gonna be rolling I don't even know me get anything else doing this is too much this is probably not the best product reveiw to have done I'm super afraid of my life right now but this is nice you know what this would be great for like people that are having bachelor parties or bachelorette parties New Year's Christmas you can get them the people if you live in a legal state oh I can't move to this come to the East Coast Jesus [Music] Oh also Packwood's shout-out to y'all have made a collaboration with cocoanuts which some of the celebrities have teamed up to make these into like chocolate edibles kind of thing so check out backwoods la calm because they got a lot of interesting collaborations like they did a collaboration with planted 13 they're doing it with celebrities so shout out to them definitely gonna go to pack once when I go to LA cuz this is pretty cool in the light so stoned and how many puffs that I take I don't even know if somebody keep it count I wish somebody was here to play this is what they do to me pop beats they just leave me in a room with filming and just tell me to go for my own okay I'm really high seriously you don't think it too high he's just like alright I'm over it I'm like hi okay I think I hit this at least maybe 10 times which is extreme okay this is my review of a Little J first of all I'm high I'm really high and I just don't even know this hormone right now seriously I don't even I don't even know what to say I mean for once I am truly I think it's strong I for what a high grade us I feel like my body is just like somebody else came and took off really nice somebody named Adele a no Gina so somebody can come take over your body if you did a little G because I don't feel I don't know oh I probably wish I had a friend this year went that way I can have somebody to give me feedback and I know Papeete y'all wish to do that but you're not here right right here matter of fact you try it exactly it's like a calming effect but you just feel like hmm maybe I should take it slow like I feel like I can do things but I should probably take it slow I feel like if you were sharing with this this was someone you don't have to worry about them soggy enough to tip its glass so it's really like one stay sturdy you're not sometimes you you roll a blunt and then they get all saggy at the tip of it and you gotta pull it back together they've already solved that issue so this is a great cheerful I would suggest you buy it this holiday season share it with your friends you can put it out as you see I'm probably one hit just another day so this is definitely a two day if you buy yourself this is a two day situation it's no way this is no way it's just no way like I'm cool put old day I feel great about this situation would I buy it hell yeah yeah I like the alien og I do I really do and this key thing is fascinating it really is because it's not like coming off on my hands or anything Frank it don't come on that's just like amazing oh my burn my nose oh [ __ ] I feel cool this out oh I'd say that like I got a young Stoli if I put it alright guys here's my Beulah spec would if I had to give five stars I would definitely get them five pot leaves on these these is they they're the way you hold them they strung in your hand they burn slowly not burning fast I've been at this for about an hour or so 35 minutes it's a good burn if you were smoking a regular blunt you're [ __ ] we've been done so backwards y'all got pop

my next video next week I appreciate you Papi's check me out on IG [Music]", "90i9gwPVILY": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the canvas small ei I'm your host Andrew Friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of cannabis reviews and our special episode series battle pre-roll were three pre rolls down from trailblazer they've been pretty good not great we've found a winner from these three already now we have one last contender in the ring and it's from tweed I assume TWD it's a pre rule we have sixty point four milligrams of THC and 70 milligrams of CBD so it is six point four percent THC and there's a little bit more CBD in there this is our first one Graham joint of the competition and warning do not drive so let's get back to it Krakauer duty seal see if we can get into it there we go and there is our joint it was the best protected but it's the most bent you will notice top is not twisted off and let's lock that up well the other ones took the tips off this one has it on so I will light it with the tip on to assess it the way it would like that's the raw King size it's been packed down quite a bit again it's a 1 gram joint let's check out what the top material is looking like all right so you can see some different colors you can also notice that it's a little bit dried out it's not a bright green or an exciting green in the hand it smells like old cannabis for sure kind of just a bit like a milk chocolate but you can't notice quite a bit of Keith in my hand actually so we shall see how it burns twist that back on I guess I'll get rid of this crazy tail even though they left it on there which is crazy to seem lighter same lighting process except a little bit of wind now so I noticed one thing right away that it's just not burning that well but let's give you the courage buff and let's go so as far as the burn goes you can you can clearly see how it's changed as far as appealing flavors go there are none it just takes like hot smoke its ran instantly like really badly none of the other ones ran like that this one really ran but you can see why because the air pockets in the bend not as definitely not hand finished or hand finished the same way the other ones were I guess I will fix the run a little bit and keep off and on it it's not easy to pull on it tastes like old wood as far as battle pre-roll goes and the actual need to continue smoking this and the grade that I want to give it I think we can just stop right here so this was tweed balanced TWD balanced THC CBD this was from which lot sorry lot 1 9 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 5 4 and of all of them we had a bar set pretty well 7.5 was our highest it tasted pretty good it burnt nice and white and it burnt straight what are we gonna give this I guess it gets 5 just for being cannabis but would I buy it again no I paid this was actually the most expensive joint of the entire battle at six dollars and fifty cents I believe I paid for it or maybe it was six dollars but I think it was 650 and it definitely leaves the absolute most to be desired so would not buy again five points TWD so I'll show you if you want to watch back you can watch the final episode and watch the conclusion and hear all of my final thoughts make sure like comment share and subscribe until next time Cheers what's my name what's my name the cannabis Somali yay", "HZbwqO6bpaY": "all right today we're going to be reviewing the alien labs one gram pre-roll strain angle 41. let's get into it all right so just to give you guys some information i got this from um pcf it's dispensary around here in the 209 in the valley in california um i got this 14 out the door and i've been seeing a lot of comments on my other videos from my cartridges specifically uh just because i get them for so cheap out the door from the dispensary it's not just me like i'm not cabin you know you could go to the comments this is these dispensaries they're known around my my area like for being really [ __ ] cheap um alien labs the eggs they used to be 52 out the door but they recently bumped it up to 72 out the door so basically just like any other area now um but we do got like marathon g for like 52 out the door we got a corova for 29 out the door um a lot of cure come just the marathon of g just because it's like nipsey's weed rip nipsey man but uh it's not that good bro 52 bucks that's the only reason they made this [ __ ] 52 bucks it wasn't for that all the other care company aids their um 29 out the door and the indoors 25 out the door the light depth which is greenhouse 20 out the door outdoor 15. i'll make a video on on um on the dispensaries i go to so whoever cares about them um you know you guys could watch them anyways i got this 14 out the door okay but anyways i got this 14 out the door um i already tried one it was a scherbassia one that my homie jober got shadow joker we split it between three heads got me pretty lit so i'm kind of curious to see how lit this will get me smoking into the dome and although i think the other one was like 24 or 23 percent csg this one's only 19 tsp 19.38 and 0.04 cbd it was manufactured 51120 and package 60220 um and yeah that's it so one grand p roll uh let me know how much you guys get this for out the door where you guys are from i paid 14 out the door and let's get to it man oh so honestly i was telling my homie i was like um i was like bruh hella dumb the alien labs ace now go for 72. you just get three of these [ __ ] for like what 36 bucks you know fourteen dollars each 40 bucks whatever you know get yourself an eighth right there and three three p rules but uh all right let's open this [ __ ] see what the [ __ ] is about i'm already smoked like i said i already smoked it so i know it's good but um just give us a little little review and also crack the seal crack the seal [ __ ] sings bait that [ __ ] pisses me off bro cause i spend my hard work my hard-earned money on this [ __ ] just a [ __ ] just from [ __ ] i call it fake bro hmm [ __ ] all right mmm you see the weed pop out in labs one grand pro sick comes in raw cone like i said if you guys are if you guys been sticking on my channel you guys know what that noise means good air flow gonna start heating up your rig right now and give you some seconds part of the video if you got a car get ready to hit a [ __ ] blinker get your lungs right let's [ __ ] do this i'll turn my ac off right quick burn that x's paper off sunday i'm about to upload this video right now play some gta i was supposed to go on the hike but um there's some family [ __ ] going on right now so just rather be home you know just in case bro wear your [ __ ] mask she's not a joke two people in my family already got that [ __ ] so i'll stop playing around with that [ __ ] bro way different so i mean not that the shabbat show was bad and it was [ __ ] amazing this is amazing too not that this one's bad either it's just good to know that they got the [ __ ] together they really care you know making sure it tastes different oh you can see that rosin ring already look at that it's gas bro already the taste for a gelato gelato is a safe bet you know you want to get a wheatie never try you want to try a wheat bread you never tried before and if they have a lot to get the gelato it's going to be guys you go same for cards same for wax just get gelato it's always going to get you lit so it's going to taste fire that's a good thing about gelato and um this strain cross is actually uh gelato 41 hence the ariel 41 and some type of og so it's a really good mix because the gelato is there for the flavor the og is there for the high just like girl scout cookies how it's um urban poison and uh what's the other one i know it's og kush but there's like a third straight um but yeah taste [ __ ] one through ten i'll give this [ __ ] like a nine to be honest yeah that's a solid 9 out of 10 for sure for sure um the high i'll get to y'all at the end of the joint see what's see what he's talking about so i'll get to y'all when i'm about like right here about it about us turn it off and um i'll let you guys know let you guys know how i'm feeling man i'll give you my final final results but so far bro guys look at the ash though it's kind of black that could be the paper though because look the the like middle is white it could be fake raw much cones be maybe i don't know fire though i'll be back i'll be back in a bit i'll tell you guys my final thoughts so all right bruh just to give you guys an update my highest forgot my [ __ ] keys in the car [Music] no i'm not going to give it 10 out of 10 i'm gonna give it a nine just because the ash is not white and that matters when you're raising a joint but i'm being picky okay guys shit's fired if i'll give you something a nine that's almost perfect you gotta realize that like a seven is something that's like like you know that's something like you know you just smoke most of the time but once and then you'll find that unicorn and then just get you high different red so um yeah definitely [ __ ] recommend to shave you guys thinking about copying this copy it almost out of pay i'm gonna say that this is better than the [ __ ] uh cookie spiro [ __ ] that [ __ ] was 20 bucks so definitely recommend this over cookies pre-roll everything is about that everything you know about corova i recommend this over corrobor p rule i recommend this over basically a lot of heroes so i would definitely say these are my top three not number one uh pre-roll so far the alien labs period um i would recommend the scherbassio just because it's a whole different taste but if you like gelato definitely get the air before every 41. great taste um it's gonna be it man i'm live as [ __ ] put the ashtray i'll catch you on next video bruh and", "_PyqdvruQwU": "ready you're ready for this ready are you ready we are ready to smoke marijuana marijuana review day ready we're doing it we're going in

could be happening we don't know that's just an unknown let's open it up see what we get here's that little sealy sealy sealy sealy so boom we're getting in there what do we get oh it's a little package there's a thc picture on there and then there's nothing else on this pack this is a nice little slick little pack though i do like it i'll slot right in my pocket yeah ripped off the plastic there let's go for the open opening oh some little tinfoil wrap there like a cigarette pack normally you just pull okay oh yeah there's there it is there it is pull that away and then we have ten readies up in this batch boom look at that there's your retican ready now the marijuana inside you can clearly see there's marijuana inside that's good that's good that's what i'm hoping for let's do math real quick here the package comes with 10 pre-rolls the package weighs 3.5 grams of dope so in each pre-roll you got .35 of marijuana i paid 24.99 for this package that makes every pre-roll about 250. so 250 for .35 grams of dough now let's see what's in the pre-roll just for fun that's what this is about we're recreational we're just doing things for fun i'm gonna rip this batch open let's get you open let's see what we're smoking on is it sticks is it stems is it seeds we don't know let's see it's not dry and crusty i will give it that you know you're not uh may 2nd package date the weed that's falling out is not dry and crusty there is a bit of humidity left in there that's what you want yeah yeah we'll do a little dance for that okay so there's .38 of dope in this pre-roll that's on point perfect ah do another dance you're getting dances today now let's see what's actually in here so it's not too bad look at this this is a stem here okay that's something you don't want to really pre-roll right here that's leaf okay so there's a bunch of leaf getting in there this is definitely bottoms okay this is bottoms this is the bins after it's handled weed you're going to grab all this bits and you're going to put it in your parel that's what's happening here but there is flour in there too it's not all sticks and stems it's not all leaf matter you can see the leaf matter there's chances you know when i roll my joints i report all the stem all these little bits that affects my smoking goodness these are i'm pretty slick i mean i am slick but i'm also pretty happy this is a little slick pack um i'm looking forward to getting all snapped up here it's [ __ ] 420 right on the dot too hmm not bad not bad not a whole lot of flavor there's really not a lot that stands out on that taste i know i'm smoking weed but there's nothing to complain about either right i'll just start there so good good good good in the past i've had two other radicands actually have them right here i have the waffle and the god bud done both these they were both 29.99 which is a great price and they were both quality dopes they passed the test they're rebuyable they're suggestible check them out check out redican this is gonna be perfect for me throughout my day a quick little snap snap i'll take my i'll take bowl hoots throughout the day just to get my medicine so i can keep going that's what this is very convenient actually and for 250 per joint all i need is one and then i continue on my day this one's almost going out though i need more than that so you got a second one going right away before this one goes out and you just gotta keep her going it's smokeable but it's not flavorful that's what i like to say there i smoked my second one i'm getting down there i'm getting pretty snapped up i am feeling good i'm starting to forget words here you go friends take one of those put it in your mouth later later as easy as that smoke three at once if you want whoo [Music] you can like two up and give one to a friend if you want that's how easy that is to they're quick lights that is nice it's not like uh they light like a cigarette you smoke you know one two three four five there's five more somewhere one two i lost three okay so no i have four i have four in my hand and i got five six seven eight nine i lost one when i threw one to a friend but the neat thing about these this is really cool let's say you're like boom out on the street you're like hey bros guess what i just got i got some reddit cam readies you want one do you want one and they're like yeah we'll take one and you're like boom there you go friend there you go other friend and then you're [ __ ] flying now all your friends have your own little pre-roll and you carry about your day i actually have all the pre-rolls going just a big fatty right now here that's the way just get ready if you're a lightweight one will get you go going if you're a lightweight one we'll get you going but if you need a little more than one light up seven they're they get going good now you know you light them all or you can light one all right so it is smokable weed there's no way i do that if there's no way i could do that if this wasn't smoke but we this is decent weed okay there's there's not a lot of taste there it really just falls in the sativa category that's what's going on there so there's no point for really enjoying your bud the weed needs to be better but the convenience and the actual product is fantastic straight up fantastic these are quick you want to go out on the boat you want to even [ __ ] take a rip on the sea-doo you want to go up in a hot air balloon grab these like wherever you go you can just have these with you have these in your car have these in your glove compartment i just smashed through 10 retican readies the overall smoke was a little harsh a little dry there's not much flavor in there at all but the pure convenience of having smokeable weed rolled up into something like this to just have on you wherever you are and blast away whenever you need just real quick boom boom boom that's awesome the weed probably a six five that's where i'm sitting with the weed six five the actual product the actual product get fireweed up in this [ __ ] the actual product is an eight one these are awesome okay so let's do that [Applause] [Music]

those like one of those clowns oh oh oh no i didn't see those the crazy thing is if we ever seen a clown if we ran it would get you first no it's nice it wouldn't but like the reason why i know it wouldn't get me first is because like like you might run but like i'm gonna know where to go like you're just gonna disappear like the clown could be for all you know that [ __ ] could be athletic too because most of them i feel like it would be like fast like so fast like it yeah they probably wear like a size 12 or 13. yeah like they were looking kind of fast in some of them videos so i mean hey

got you", "-qZGNpaIWV8": "hey what's good everybody j ping here checking in live respectmyregion.com here with a west coast weed tour review got the homie today can of escapes how's it going everybody and we're going to be reviewing napalm cannabis company the grenade check that out man absolutely incredible um one of the most premium luxurious over the top above and beyond items in the entire cannabis industry this is the flex piece of all flex pieces in the pre-roll category can you guys can you guys zoom in on this real quick i want them i want them to see can you guys zoom in on this real quick check this out oh my gosh so today's item that we have is the blue tommies from uh the grenade xxl infused pre-roll seven grand premium indoor flower one gram live resin lift tickets rolling lift tickets infused rolling paper which is a live resin rolling paper have you ever tried that before it's incredible and then a ceramic tip it says the backpack boys times five points los angeles it's that elite [ __ ] man are you ready you put this in your hand feel the grenade in your hand feel that i've seen these for a while and i i did not think that i was going to smoke one so this is a this is a fun surprise and it's it's been quite a minute since i was actually intimidated by uh getting ready to consume intimidated is the word i do here it's intimidating i hear that from the bud tenders people are a little bit intimidated by the price point but when you talk about luxury items the best of the best the best some of the best flour exotic collaborations look at this grenade it's quite literally a grenade there's a pin there's this handle super cool i don't know if you guys can see this but they're the the uh the little fire emoji emblem that they have is right there on the glass it's it's insane so we're gonna jump right in we're going to keep it keep it consistent with the west coast we tour we're going to hit it once talk about it we're going to hit it twice we're going to give it a 4 out of 10. um you're supposed to smoke this all the way through we are going to put this out after a couple hits after we talk about it uh and then i'll dive in because no most people are gonna put this out unless they are fully prepared to smoke 200 which we might have to do it are you ready yeah all right let's let me let's let's let's get it rolling three and a half grams of flour how do i see you pull the pin you pull this out i don't i didn't pull if you have to pull yeah yeah very easily without the engineering packaging i'd be impressed oh yeah you just twisted them out that's pretty cool okay so we've got this eight gram monster here check this out you guys oh wait lift ticket paper that's it lift it we'll have to look that up wow it's gonna be dope it's gonna be dope i'm pretty excited all right you guys we got the torch i'm gonna massage it out just a little bit i do hear the general feedback is that these canoes so we will have to find out let's dry hit figure out dry head is smooth and creamy uh was there a strain oh the blue tummies all right here we go [Music] we got too much all right here we go nothing yet let's try to just try it with a little bit of a lighter all right so i can tell you right off the bat it's tough to hit the airflow is really good on it though it's not like it's too tight it's nothing to do with that i definitely rips through super nice that ceramic tip that's the nicest mouthpiece on anything i've ever smoked without a doubt it's very easy to rip the flavor is super creamy tiny little bit of gas and i'm getting a tiny little bit of berry like tiny little bits of like blueberry or maybe blackberry or whatever it is i don't know just berries so [ __ ] curious right it's pretty heavy it's large a lot of flavor to it when it comes to the flour again it's the blue tommies you got one gram of live resin the lift ticket infused rolling paper and the ceramic tip super delicious product i'm not sure as to the genetics of the blue tommies i'm not sure on the tripping profile on that i do wish that was included on here um the lift ticket information would love would love to know the stream for the live resin on that but we could probably look this up on their instagram or something um overall i think it's a delicious experience super heavy definitely like you mentioned the weight it's a solid super solid the the branding and the product appeal off the charts um this group napalm with exhibit you know they just really went above and beyond to deliver truly a premium experience kind of redefining the pre-roll category it is a pre-roll joint rolling papers infused rolling papers live resin seven grand premium indoor flower and it rips we did hear rumors of it kind of canoeing on some people at least i've heard that from multiple sources uh but this is honestly smoking pretty much perfectly yeah i'm um i'm actually impressed by how it smokes because that's how you light it though well definitely how you light it's going to control a lot of it but in terms of i thought it would be like an overpowering smoke yeah that it would really hit not harsh no not at all no like it actually i guess delicious the amount of wheat in there does a nice job of filtering the smoke as it comes down yeah absolutely um yeah i think that ceramic tip too super smooth just to just like i wonder what else could you re-roll with the ceramic tip though i think i'm definitely going to keep this running tip i'm going to see if we're able to kind of clean it and reuse it i don't know about my rolling abilities to roll another one i don't think i have it in me to roll any grammar that's for sure that's the i mean for for me with the the packaging i love this because it's that this is the child resistance resistant piece um i'd be curious as to how airtight it is i'm sure it's pretty airtight but you could put weed in here oh yeah definitely reuse it here just to show the people to reuse this as as the stash jar for your weed uh a great grenade glass and you guys can see the flame right there on the front and that's not just like a random jar that they got repurposed they had to get this jar custom-made that's dope that i i'm usually gonna look for for reasons to to dislike packaging for for waste related reasons but this is cool enough to keep so it goes into that category you can do a lot with this not just put weed in it like it's a do you have a tournament or some [ __ ] do you have a score in mind out of 10 for this review because i am extremely impressed with this the price obviously you know it's a product in its own category on the on the category i'm gonna from for my sport it's gonna be relative to other pre-rolls uh and i'm not gonna consider cost because you know when you're when you're getting a piece like that that's getting that [ __ ] piece yeah yeah um and for that reason i'm going to give that a eight eight five eight point five eight point five on it okay i'm surprised myself that i would give it that type of score with again this is without knowing much about the flower but in terms of the harshness of the smoke blue tommy's flower seven grand premium indoor from the backpack boys is that bay area hype [ __ ] right is [Music] i think i think backpack boys are la boys is is bae oh so i'm confusing the two i i might be confusing the two this is let us know we don't know this is that but like no i think i think that that's an la outfit i [ __ ] i'll [ __ ] with it man i think this is some of the best the best i've smoked the lyric hannah gars i've smoked i've smoked 10 of those zero cannagars the biggest of the biggest the ounces the small 12 grammers the small ones the the the seven grammars i believe is what uh the smallest one i think some something like that this is incredible here's here's what i'll say about this so she's probably my my highest cost on a quarterly to perhaps buy monthly occasion i would pay retail for this that's impressive that that's uh for the writing for the right occasion for the right group for the right reason to to celebrate this is a nice piece for that my score out of 10 out of 100 i'll respect my recent website i'm coming in at 9.2 and it's the same issues that i typically have would love to know more about the genetics we'd love to have a terpene profile on there it just really helps to cement the the experience you're about to have as a consumer as a customer we're paying good money for for just weed in general at this point and the consumer we want to know what we're about to experience flavor wise taste wise high wise and i know that can sometimes be a lot to ask for but there's so much going on on this product and there's a nice beautiful empty space in the back of the tag that it would have been huge maybe that's where they put like the sticker in the testing results well but there's two spots one one we could go qr code on there yeah i'm always with a qr code i'm looking at this and you could have they could put a nice insert in here yeah yeah because all that's sitting in there is the is the piece which you don't need to see anyway i mean i couldn't really tell what it looked like until i took it out anyway and i couldn't even add to the allure perhaps this is a free game for dave paul and for any packaging people or branding people creating a surprise when the product comes out that's a nice little uh endorphin rush for the consumer it's going to be memorable for that experience but also to so fill this with information about perhaps the farmer or the medium that it's grown in or the history of the company the people that are involved anything that you can associate to the story yeah yeah yeah i think that's fair too so like i said you know 9.25 for me more information on the story more information on the terpenes and the genetics and to them to me it's a perfect product regardless of the price point i think this is something that i would pay the money that for a couple times a year you know either as gifts or for myself uh i thoroughly enjoy it experience in itself the overall potency of this [ __ ] it's all fire it all tastes really good yeah i would uh i would love to find reasons to to hate on it but as it goes well we'll let you guys do the hating make sure you all type in respectmyregion.com let's go

can get cones Raw's these are the raw versions they're brown they're opposed to be organically made or whatever these are the basic white cones this is a company that you can buy it's called J wear and they make cones as well they're pretty cheap but when you buy from J we're compared to buying from the cones company the cones companies gonna ask you what sides you want them in small that it added a large when you're buying half grams you're gonna want the point six otherwise known as the smalls and these ones will do the half grams and then if you're ordering for the one grams you're gonna want the one point three I don't know if you can see that there gives you a size one point three that's for your actual gram if you use the gram ones it's really hard to get a gram in them so they call them one point threes or they're a hundred and nine millimeters the hundred and nine millimeter is the way you need to know if you're ordering from other companies like this J wear because they don't come in sizes point six point that it it comes in reefer King size and party size but the hundred and nine millimeter is the actual size that gets you that one gram but if not the ninety eight millimeter will do half grams pretty good but you get a lot of extra paper just so you know so basically some of the things you guys are gonna need beside your cones in the machine you're gonna need a grinder to grind the product I prefer these coffee grinders like this these suckers right here get the cannabis to the exact consistency you want for it to be able to burn smoothly you can over grind with these real easy and just make piles of Keith but if you just tag it a couple of times which we'll show you in a minute it keeps the product real consist and it helps surface stims which you can pull out later of course cones when you buy the machine it comes with one of these scrubbers and before you reload this every time you need to make sure you clean it otherwise you get Jam ups so this is a real important tool to make sure you don't lose you're gonna want a pair of tweezers in case some of them get stuck down in there and you can tweezer them out if you have problems this is a good emergency tool to go to you're gonna want a couple of different size rods or pins or whatever to be able to poke down inside of the cones and help pack them in case they got air spots in them these work really good we just got a piece of bamboo nap in we've been using them for a long time if you guys want and you guys don't have that much product you guys could cut off little pieces of card like I did here and this card will actually fit on this combs machine let's see it goes like right here well maybe over here there it is so it goes like that and then we got another one with an angle and we put it like that and you can block off holes this way and only fill in so many without losing product through the rest of the holes a couple crappy old business cards work really good for that but they also work good for stirring and making sure that you can fill all the cones so these work really good we got an old film container here and the reason why we have this film container is because you're gonna need a skel if you're doing it for shops to get them the exact weight so this helps hold the cone up and not spill all the stuff out of it as you're weighing them so you could go through and weigh them real fast like that but these are a couple of the essentials that you guys are gonna need besides some product for us we've got some gorilla glue these are some buds that work quite pretty enough to go into the sacks for people there's a bunch of smalls in here but so we're gonna make these into joints so go to waste we also got some green queen and we have a bag of pitbull and even though it's really good smoke it just it got real lar fee it didn't get real dense like we wanted it to so this all get rolled into joints it didn't make it into the bag so a couple of things you guys want to know to start you want to really clean the table really good otherwise it'll go from a one-man job to a two-man job on the bottom of this cones machine right here it have suction pads these suction pads are crucial for you to get through this once you stick this sucker down and the spot you want it at and make sure it sucked down real good to where it's not gonna come off leave it there don't keep picking it up if you keep picking it up you're gonna cover the table and keep and when you cover the table and keep it won't stick no more and if it doesn't stick you'll never be able to pick this spring up on the inside and be able to turn it like this it'll keep picking up with it and then you can't two-hand it and pick it up this spring is real strong in here so you want to make sure that it's tucked down real good so you can actually turn it okay so now I'm gonna go ahead and get out some cones and then I'll show you guys how we load it all right so to load your cones machine I'm going with these point sixes the this order calls for a lot of handout pre-rolls so most of the handout pre-rolls you get in the shop are gonna be 0.6 s or half grams those are the ones they usually hand out the gram size joints we'll do in a minute but basically you grab this stack of cones like this and then you can real easily just walk along and drop them down inside of these holes like this and it makes it really fast to go through it and dump them you're gonna pull out the little paper stints that they give you and you're just gonna go through and load this whole machine down like this until you get done so I'm gonna go through and load this and then I'll show you guys how we do deal with the grind all right real quick just you guys know we filled this in the down position if you can see here it's touching that's the down position and then when you go to lift it up that's the up position it sinks them all down to where they're down inside of there lower than the grade of the actual top so that way when you put the Cannabis on there or your material it'll go down inside there so now I'm gonna show you guys what it we do to grind it and the consistency you're looking for a couple of things that forgot to mention you're gonna want a couple of Tupperware containers we're gonna want one for grinding your product into then you're gonna want one to put the finished cones in and this one we'll use later but for now we're gonna roll with this one so basically we're gonna get our coffee grinder out and start grinding product let me get that set up so I could show you what it looks like so for me I like to go through it and try to remove as much stem as possible and get rid of all your chunks of stem those will end up plaguing you later when you go to try to tighten joint down and twist the tops those little pieces of stem will start poking through it so I'm gonna just keep breaking this up like this getting it inside of this grinder trying to pull all the big chunks that I can find anything hard real pokey you want it gone but make sure you got gloves on so you're not you know making everybody's smoke all dirty dead skinned and you don't get your hands super sticky or black this products real sticky and it'll ruin your hands real fast it'll make it tore you can't touch the papers without ruining them so you want to make sure that you get your hands covered with some kind of gloves for this process it's just better all the way around and sanitary for the product as well you don't need to fill this very full of course you don't want to be sitting here all day long doing tiny bits at a time but I mean you want to make sure that it's got a good chunk in it just not super packed to where gonna make it hard and you have to fight the lid on it so once I get it about like that I'm gonna throw my cap on and this only takes like a couple of seconds you'll listen and I'll let you hear it there's one and then I'll do one with a shake then I'm gonna open it up and you can already see that it's pretty ground down pretty fine so a consistency like this is really nice but you have to still be sure that there ain't no bigger chunks like this these little chunks like this will get stuck in there and mess you up real bad so you're just gonna go through it and break them up make sure and I move the product from one side of this box to the other just to make sure there ain't no big chunks that did get broke up like that one or any big stem that you see you're gonna want to make sure it's broke up as well any big stems but that's basically the grind right there then I take this and I slide it down and then I go on to the next one you can see all the kief in it there's a lot of Keef in that if you go too long all you will make is piles of Keef there won't you won't have any mass to it so when you go to smoke the joy what happens is this one and either gets so compacted that it doesn't want a bird or two it'll start running oil all the way down your face when you smoke on it it gets so tight that the oil just starts pouring out the end of the cone and you don't want that so I'm gonna go through this bag right here and knock out as much as I can and I'll show you guys what it looks like when I get it all browned up okay here you can see our consistency it's fine grain powder like tobacco we removed all the stems like we talked about you need about 65 to 70 grams to do 120 1/2 grammars you always want to go about 5-6 grams over so they're not light but plus you're gonna lose some even with your scale on the point system which we'll show you later so I got my consistency ground up set that off to the side say this is the area I'm working in I already threw my pile of stems away you're gonna want to take a moist paper towel and wipe this down real good and make sure it's clean you're also going to want to touch the bottom of your suction cups and make sure they're clean and moist and there's nothing stuck to them then you're gonna set it down and you're gonna make sure it's planted on the table solid so that way when you go to pick it up later and turn it it doesn't come up off of the table but now that we know it's on there and it's already in the up position not the down position where the white papers showing but up position am i picking it up and locking it into place it keeps the papers from getting destroyed now taking the old card I like to use these business cards and I like to sprinkle it on here and try to go pretty evenly and you're not gonna fill them all right the second you're just gonna spread some out across the tops and make sure some little pieces fall down in there so that way when we do the first beating you can make sure that you get it all the way down to the cones filter at the bottom the little crutch so I'm just gonna get some down inside of these like this and once I'm confident that I spilt a little bit in each one and that each one's got a little tiny bit in it I'm gonna go ahead and go through like this and if you do it light-handed don't go Bam Bam Bam just like it actually gives you a better pack than if you're slamming on it real hard then I'm gonna go through and I'm gonna add some more and this time I'm gonna get a little fuller and a little fuller until they're all filled up you're just gonna keep repeating this process and if you do it if you take the time to do it right the first time you won't have to bunch you have to fix nobody likes having to go through and fix a whole bunch of these combs it sucks so to keep the process fast it just do it right the first time and you won't have no problem so I had it a little bit and add some more product and I'm gonna do this until I know that all the paper are covered that each one of them have some to the top of that white paper in there I don't know if you can see that with the camera but you got to make sure that it gets all the way up to there it looks like I need to grind some more let me have a second and I'll be right back guys so I got more ground we're gonna get them all filled up a little fast make sure we get all of our holes filled and you can look down in them and see which ones didn't get it which ones did and of course I didn't weigh this product which I probably should have then I would have known I had enough but I don't got time I got orders to fill so I'm just flying through it as fast as I can we still have thwack sirs to do which I'll make a video on that that's where we take whacks and then keep rolling which I'm sure everybody's already knows how to do but we get so many questions why not make a video about it right and of course we don't get paid for by combs or anybody else for any of these videos we post you guys know nowadays YouTube confiscates all the money and it doesn't allow anybody to do any type of merchant handling or any type of third party marketing or anything like that for anything with cannabis on it they uh ixnay your videos monetization so we don't get paid for this we just do this out of you know share and share alike and this culture was based on that so all these secret keepers nowadays you can keep your secrets and Joe money alright that's looking pretty good we got just about all of them full some of them are a little short but they'll make up for it later as we're pulling weight out of them cuz they're always gonna be over so you're gonna be taking quite a bit out as you go [Music] alright now when you go to the turn it it's stuck to the table really good and they're gonna all stand up for you just like that right there now you're gonna go and pick through them and you're gonna throw them on a scale to see what they weigh and that's why we have this little cup here and we set that on the scale before we turn our scale on to tear it I also like to keep another cup on the graphic pass this one over here because as I pull them these way approximately for the half gram joints about 0.2 so at point two you need to make sure that this says point 7 or 0.8 and in California and Oregon to be able to say that you're selling it to a shop and it's medicine you need to make them weigh exactly so that way they're not getting a messed up dosage scale so point 7 is what they really want them to be at so you're just gonna take over here and make yourself a little pile because as you can see when we shook this thing it kicked out all kinds of product around it so as soon as we're done we're gonna clean it all to the front of us get it back into our bag or our Tupperware and clean the table again and start over again but this one still says point eight so I got to get it down now it jumped two points there it is right there that's close enough okay so you're gonna take your poker you got two different pokers you're gonna take your poker and just to get you a nice flat top to be able to grab it with three fingers and you're gonna do a shake like this and that shake is gonna tighten it up you can hold it up to the light and look through it and you can see that the product made it all the way down to the bottom and there's no big air gap here and if there is an air gap you just keep shaking it until it comes out when you crease it with your three fingers it's gonna make a little try thing like that kind of like a triangle right once you got it like that you're gonna give it a gentle twist like this and then you're gonna shake it again to help tighten that twist into place and when you're done it should look just like that right there to keep your scale from being on for long periods of time though the trick is to go through pull them out one at a time weigh them make sure that they get their weight right and set them right here in this jar fill up a jar like this first and then go through and tighten them all up after you're done it'll make it a lot faster for you in the long run and you could have multiple jars and go through the whole thing real fast but unless you have somebody else here helping you and you're doing this by yourself this is the best way to do it right here all right guys I'm gonna go on to finish it in this out I'll show you guys how many we get and what they look like when we're all done all right made it through all 120 it took me about 28 minutes 29 minutes or so and just from going from here skelling I'm dumping the excess inside of the cup dropping them in here boom boom boom until I had my cup full shut my scale off take them twist all the tops throw them inside of my Tupperware that's what a hundred and twenty look like it would normally go straight from here twist them put them in a two sticker label um and then put them in off to the side but this company doesn't need them to so there is going in Tupperware and they're gonna be delivered like that and the tough work so they stay dry and they don't dry out any further before you guys even get to this process though you guys should practically roll one see how it smokes and make sure that it burns properly before you get to this stage where you're making hundreds of them if you get some cannabis that people grow or if you didn't grow it yourself and you're purchasing it they didn't flush it properly the joints won't burn right and you don't want to make hundreds of them and hand them out and get a lot of complaints about the way they burn I mean the number one reason for them not burning right is because of the way people dry and cure it but if they don't flush properly that's another reason why to moist a weed won't grind white right or it won't burn right so you want to make sure that it's at the right dried consistency to be able to grind up nicely not so dry that it's you know turn straight to dust but about four to six percent is the average moisture level that you're going to be looking for my next stage will be after this is to clean this to repeat the process and I'll show you guys how I do that alright so real quick for you guys to clean this the simple way is to make sure everything's down in the holes first using a card to scrape all any big chunks that's leftover then you take your brush and you go through and you brush off the top make sure everything goes down on the inside like this here make sure it's good and clean then you're gonna make sure that it's in the upright position not in the bottom closed position that way this can go all the way through and clean really good I like to choose a section this is in section so find a section start at a section and roll with it and just fly through it like this right here and this is pushing everything down to the bottom and this will make sure that when you put the next set of cones and they don't stick to the walls that could be a real big problem if you get them all caked in there you can't get them out you end up breaking a bunch of papers this is the best way to do it just like this right here all right so we got it all cleaned out I don't know if you could pan the camera down here and see inside here all that that's in there so we got our tough water dish over here I'm gonna just dump my extras in there I'm gonna take this bad boy lean it over on its side like this so I could see down it I don't know if you guys can see in there and then I'll take my brush and I'm gonna go through and I'm gonna scrub this bottom plate off with the brush and get it really good and clean and try to get all that stuff out of there and onto the table it's weird holding it like this for your guys's angle but uh you got to make sure you get the thing super clean you don't want this thing getting gummed up it'll gum up real fast on you if you have to you have to clean it with alcohol or something that's fine clean it with alcohol but then make sure you let it dry out for a long time before you use it again because the key itself will stick to everything like glue if it sits there the longer it sits there it'll stick so hard it'll be real hard to get off so the trick is is to go through this as fast as you can and try to get you know all of the product back off of the off of this 120 sight combs machine so it's not stuck to it like glue then you could give it a couple of days it's clean set it off to the side out of the way try not to get the two or the three little suction cups dirty you got your tongue over here and you look at this right here see how it automatically keeps up and starts to clump up that's because it's got a lot of oils in it get your card out scrape it all right back into your tough wire and you're gonna repeat the process again and again and again so you're done with your tada but you want to make sure that you clean this table off really good I got me a paper towel right here and I'm gonna get it wet and I'll use that to read moisten the table again and make sure that it's tucked down real good because any of these little particles right here they're gonna mess up your guys's suction with the suction cup so grab a paper towel and then go through and just give it a good wipe picking up all those little green particles flip this bad boy over make sure my suction cups are clean stick it to the table make sure it's stuck now you can turn it BAM back in business time to reload and go again and basically that's all there is to how you do this 120 sight cones machine it's real simple it's made out of real hard plastic and if you can afford it I know they're expensive but if you guys can afford it this is the way to go for mass producing joints the cones works good they got crutches in them so you don't get cannabis or tobacco or whatever you're using in your mouth and these are the subway we prefer to do it if we're gonna be doing them by the you know buttload but thanks for watching be sure to LIKE and subscribe and we'll catch you guys on the flip side stay lifted and stay safe peace", "WAMA8UOJzKo": "i thought it went out for a sec definitely not i got this cone here that i stuffed about a month ago and totally forgot the smoke glad i put a stick in it that'll help a lot with the airflow my favorite thing about these is the wood mouthpiece but also you can fit a lot of weed in this [ __ ] towards the top of it i put a little bit of sour diesel crumble so i'm hoping it'll burn slow and evenly but i figured i'd spark this up and answer a couple q a questions that you guys left me on my youtube channel [Applause] probably gonna lit this with a lighter but [ __ ] it [ __ ] that's so smooth damn that's like rancid in a good way for some reason gmo and all these like garlicky and skunky strains have just given me like a newfound appreciation for horrible smells i don't know what it is but have you ever like driven past a skunk ever since you started smoking weed and you're like damn is someone sparking up some fire or did someone just run over a [ __ ] skunk oh yeah that's where the oil is [ __ ] all right let's get into the first question okay this question is from kane williams he asks how quickly can you roll a backwood very slowly i can roll one as slow as backwood burns i've probably only rolled like two or three in my entire life i'm not a big blunt guy so if i'm smoking it backwards chances are somebody else was rolling up i know everybody knows backwoods and everyone's on the backwood craze right now but personally it's just not for me i love good joy i don't know why there's just something about the pureness of just like the paper with the weed like all you taste is weed you don't get that russian cream [ __ ] taste it's like just straight weed that's what i want when i smoke i won't weed crypt asks what do you think of brands marketing their products as desired effects rather than by strain and genetic from a marketing standpoint i totally get it they're trying to market to the least educated and most confused consumer because especially if somebody doesn't know what they're consuming and get something that they don't want they might have a horrible [ __ ] time like if you're trying to chill out and you have really bad anxiety and you don't smoke a lot you consume a sativa you might freak the [ __ ] out or if you're just trying to like be high and enjoy yourself and you have a heavy indica you're like [ __ ] couch locked and you're like oh we just makes me lazy and useless like there's different effects that these different strains get and sometimes when people hear indica and sativa they don't really understand it i thought it would help for a sec definitely not but i think you still need to understand that the heavy users are the ones that are coming back every day and those are the ones that understand the difference between sativa indica hybrid different terpenes etc so as long as they still put like indica on there i totally understand if they write relax on the cover just so the inexperienced consumer can kind of get an idea for what they're getting this is gonna get me lit as [ __ ] it's only nine o'clock in the morning this is gonna be a long day super breezy 100 asks is youtube your full-time job or do you have another job youtube is not my full-time job but like what i do here is kind of my full-time job like i don't get paid from youtube if you watch an ad on my youtube channel i'm not getting that money i don't know who is but i make all of my money in the cannabis industry through marketing products or advertising or selling glass through my snapchat i also help companies with their marketing and branding not just advertising myself i'll help run their pages for them but it's all weed related like all of my money has come one way or another through the cannabis industry we got a long way to go there's about four grams of wheat in this there might have been a little bit more actually but these luxe rolls can fit a [ __ ] on a weed kalili 1997 asks what's your favorite temperature to take dabs in degrees i use a timer so i don't know the exact temp but it's somewhere in the like 650-ish temperature probably i really want to get one of those terp thermometers that you can like put on your banger that like tells you the exact temperature you're dabbing at one of these days well dude asks have you ever grown your own or have you ever had any interest in doing a small home closet grow i've never grown before but i do want to do it but i want to do it when it's like actually illegal because i want to do it publicly like i want to grow for my first time and make it like a series on this channel or on my snapchat or something where i post the progress and what i'm doing and people can kind of chime in and you know if you have had experience you can kind of give me some advice or if you've never done it before you can kind of do it along with me but pennsylvania has not legalized the homegrown laws yet but hopefully one day they will because these prices are [ __ ] stupid so [ __ ] super smooth stream i totally understand the hype in gmo whoo this shit's great all right i'm taking too long on these questions we're gonna be done this thing before we've done the questions justin asks how long do you think it'll be until weed is legal in all of the us probably like another five years i'm gonna say at least i don't see either trump or biden putting it into effect honestly it's probably gonna be legal in all 50 states before it's federally legal our only saving grace is that coronavirus makes it so that the economy is so bad that they just have to legalize weed to give it a boost but i don't really know how much that would help because economy is going to be [ __ ] zomboys88 what's the best tasting strain of weed that you've ever smoked probably kosher tangy i've said this before a million times but i love the fruity flavored strains but especially the ones that have an orangey strain there right up my alley and kosher tangy is so fire danny asked do you prefer smoking on flour or concentrate more and have you ever thought about doing a meet-up for your followers to smoke and chill with you [ __ ] that was rough i dab more but i honestly prefer smoking flour i just dab because it's kind of more considerate but there's something special about flour like that's how i was introduced into weed and it's just such a beautiful product i just always have to say i truly prefer it overdabs and yes i have thought about doing a follower meet up i've actually wanted to do like a smoke sesh lounge in colorado where it would have been totally legal but then corona happened so it just was out of the picture maybe in a year or two once all this coveted [ __ ] cools down and people can like do that and maybe pennsylvania laws even cool down i would love to do one in philadelphia like that would be my dream if i could do some sort of like fan meetup in philadelphia legally i would love to do that so maybe one day but really right now it's just not in the cards okay this is getting rough [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah this shit's like super super roachy and i got a little ways to go so i'm not looking forward to the rest of this definitely loving that gmo high though just medicinal ass have you ever tried medical cannabis in florida also what would you say contributed to your success in the cannabis industry i have gotten medical weed from florida before it is pretty fire i only smoked it once and i was really [ __ ] up i was in atlantic city in a limo going home with the clout crew and some random person in our limo had it and i don't even know who they were but i remember seeing it and looking at it and smelled good and we smoked it but uh i can't like really digest the high of it like i was [ __ ] up at the time and i probably only had like three to four hits you know it's not like i really have delved into the medical scene in florida but a lot of you guys snapped me and it looks pretty fire over there so hats off to florida [ __ ] oh and uh to the second part of your question honestly i feel like it's mainly the connection i have with the people that watch these videos i love talking to you guys especially on snapchat i feel like i really get to know a lot of you guys and i it's weird i pretty much could like go to any city in the world and have like someone to sesh with it's it's like a really weird like friendship i have with you guys and a lot of you guys have been watching me for a long period of time like shout out to the new guys too y'all to homies but but the guys that have been watching me for a long time you guys have continued to support me there's people that have bought you know dozens of glass pieces off of me there's people that have you know i have messages saved from three four years ago on snapchat like that you know i have some people that really support and watch my videos and that's what's contributed to my success so far is that i got those real ones out there and i appreciate you guys for real like i'm not trying to get corny but uh that's really what's contributed to my success anyone can get a camera and smoke weed on the internet but to have a group of people that like watch you and like anticipate your videos every day or like you know on youtube i'm not every day i'm sorry i want to be but i'm just not right now but to just have a group of people that like anticipate your videos like if i don't post for three four days on youtube i have people commenting like yo where the video is at and if it's not for that you don't have success because if people don't want to come back you're not going to have success i don't know i don't even know if that really answered the question but thank you to everyone that's watching this let's just take a minute and say thank you to you guys if you're watching this for real thank you all right next question and joins out we gotta realize like this [ __ ] okay so pascal asks what's the most intense way you've ever smoked weed just curious um probably that stupid-ass gas mask that was pretty intense i'd say more intense than that like i've hit a couple heavy rigs that were like you know thirty thousand dollars that i was like all right this is like insane if i drop even his carb cap i owe him three grand ren s the question we all wanna know go to munchie um i've been actually struggling to find like my go-to munchie recently i've been mixing it up but you know what you really can't go wrong with like a reese's cup that's probably my go-to something like chocolate that and like wash it down with a soda i think i might have answered this question before and that might have not even been the same answer but i'm high right now and i just was like you know that's what i would go for leave a comment below and let me know what your go-to munchie is santos asked what was your dream job when you were growing up when i was a little kid i always wanted to be an actor i don't know why it just kind of seemed like a fun job so i always wanted to just like imitate movies and stuff that i've seen but then when i was in middle school and stuff it actually changed i wanted to be like a professional like cinematographer or editor that was always like my dream job but then i just kind of turned into a youtuber i don't really know what happened you guys could still chase your dreams don't let me disappoint you i'm just [ __ ] around honestly like the film industry's kind of [ __ ] especially with covet i'm not mad that i turned out the way i did this thing keeps going out keep talking too much [Music] ziki asks how's piper doing how's she liking the house in pa piper is great i'd show you her right now but she's not here she's with my girlfriend at her parents house she's loving pennsylvania she's meeting all my friends but honestly the only issue was our house is a little too small my girl moved into my condo with me and like it was the perfect size for just me but for the two of us it's just not big enough she has a real job where she doesn't just smoke weed on the internet and go like hey guys check out this bong so sometimes if she's like having meetings and i'm trying to smoke weed on the internet it just doesn't really work out well but we actually just bought a house i'm so excited it's so much bigger than the house we're in right now i love the area it's in it's not too far from where i'm already from but that house will be even better for piper so that'll be nice and it will also be nicer for my girlfriend and i because i can film videos and be allowed while she can have her serious meetings in her office and i can be in my office and we can you know do our own thing but that means i'm going to have a new studio i'm totally going to switch it up i'm not totally sure what i want to do yet but i've had the table that i'm on forever really since i've started popcorn this has so much nostalgic feelings to me but it's honestly like covered in weed and dirty as [ __ ] and honestly kind of ugly looking so i want to get something a little sleeker so i'm going to change up the entire setup so i'm excited for that you're still gonna have a couple more videos in this setup because we don't actually move in for a couple more weeks but the days of the videos in this room will be coming to an end we will be getting a new studio and i'm super excited to bring you guys along for the journey putin asks lmao randomly spotted you and his zach goes to vid are you cool with him yes that goes is my good friend he's a good guy candice asks what type of camera do you use for recording or type of software to use for editing i use a canon g7x and for editing i use final cut x it's really not that intricate it's a pretty simple setup for the most part i am going to upgrade the camera sooner or later or at least add another camera but while it's one-man show it's just so much easier to use the canon g7x jessica s and this awful iso

pictures of weed on the internet and uh i grew a following so that's how i got into the industry i'm not really like certified in the industry i just have a account where i smoke weed on the internet honestly but if you're looking to get into the industry yourself find what part of the canvas industry you like and get into it if you like doing retail you're going to need to get a license but it's not that hard to get if you like growing and cultivating that's a little bit harder but you can do it take a couple classes you know just just do it bro it's really not that hard find what you want to do and do it i personally have always loved making videos and creating content and there's this little niche of people that are smoking weed on the internet and i love doing it so here i am in the industry but wrapping this video up you guys thank you so much for watching click like if you enjoyed if you made it to the end you probably did and make sure you subscribe i got a lot more videos on

off just a little bit so it'd be nice and easy to spark up for you guys you know what actually give me one second I'm just gonna go grab the ashtray right over here so we can make it a little bit easier on ourselves and yeah so right off the RIP I just want to say hope you guys are all having a freaking awesome day night whatever the [ __ ] it is for you and yeah I hope this video is gonna brighten up your day you know if your day is not so bright and if your days already amazingly bright well then you know Cheers props and welcome I hope you enjoy the sesh let's get this [ __ ] started up and we will get to talk and maybe trying to do in front of the camera I think good Cheers gotta say man I'm assuming over the time that I've been you know making all these YouTube videos my skills on rolling I've gone from absolute bottom of the barrel breaking blunts in half trying to roam - honestly I I would have to put myself in a pretty pretty pretty decent position when it comes to rolling me I've honestly never met anyone in person that can't roll better you know better smokeable joints than me you know cuz obviously everybody has their preference on let you know I want a little bit of looser I want a little bit tighter I can do you know whatever you want I'll roll it up I like it but yeah so right now I am still currently chillin in Kalamazoo Michigan because of the corona virus I've not really wanted to go back to my house because there's a lot more cases there and personally I don't know if you guys know this but I've seen an asthma it's pretty seasonal but it also has to do a lot with when the weather changes my allergy sofa clothes are really hot too really cool that it really messes up my allergies and cold too you know vice versa the same thing really message about so honestly like I don't know I've just been trying to stay safe and some other stuff like that I actually have a buddy who got it back from my house he said he really didn't had any symptoms and his whole family got it he's pretty sure that his mother got at the supermarket but you know you just gotta be stayin safe smoking to mean staying chill but honestly I think the main thing to keep in mind is just stay [ __ ] just just stay relaxed a chilled out because you know what one of the things that I realized when all this started was you know it's not just Michigan it's not just America it is the entire world that is dealing with this pandemic right now and you know it's like you can't really feel bad about yourself if you're just kind of hanging out chill and smoking because technically that's what the government is telling us to do so it's like you're following orders so it you know for a lot of people out there a lot of people out there probably feeling really great you know I'm happy that I'm all for all this and that but I'm sure there's a lot of you out there who are just like man I feel like I'm losing my mind stay relaxed everybody's in the same shoes as you we're all going through this [ __ ] together trust me it's rough on me and trust me you guys know this I haven't been going to school or had a normal job in about three years now because I've been doing YouTube and stuff like that and I feel like it would affect me less than other people just because I'm used to hanging out not really doing a lot you know chilling but for me personally I do go out a lot you know at night and you know to go to clubs and bars and stuff like that so that's been really difficult on me but in the comments let me know what your biggest struggle is on the coronavirus arm maybe it's you're not able to see your friends I'm pretty much shown in a house with my boys and stuff like that so in all honesty it's pretty straight with me you know like nothing too crazy nothing nothing nothing where I'm going to insane because I you know don't have any human content but I know there's some of you out there and especially shout out to the people who actually got the coronavirus I just want to send out my deepest condolences to you guys I hope that you're okay I hope that you are recovering well and that you're doing all right and you know make sure to just stay inside and just stay safe and all that jazz smoke a joint you know what I mean such to Adani video do what you gotta do by the way I gotta say this um real quick I gotta give a little shout out to mama smokes shoutout to you MA I love you so much she actually told me I called her up on the phone today cuz I saw that I had a missed touch from her and she said to me that she was missing me so much that she went out and she watched one of my videos just so she could hear my voice and I was like ma you're the sweetest lady of all time seriously that really warmed my heart that made my day and uh yeah might honestly title this video how to get through the coronavirus without losing your mind let me think about other tips and tricks I can give you guys okay here's another one if you guys haven't been go outside and take walks almost every single day it helps you get that fresh air it really helps clear your mind and you can just really be calm and chill and relaxed about it and you know it just really relaxes your body I've definitely been finding that um to be a really solid move for myself personally I don't know about you guys but I've been taking pretty much daily walks I also have my longboard I don't know if you guys skate or longboard anything like that but you know even the government's been saying you know make sure you guys get outside you know do your thing because you need exercise you need energy I would even say you know to everybody out there do a you know a 100 push up a day challenge try to do 100 pushups every single day and you know just get a little bit stronger maybe do some ab crunches just a little home workout remedy I'm sure you guys are all doing this stuff and I'm just reiterating what you guys already know but you know it's important it's important to do it and I gotta say especially for us all out here that are smokers and stuff we're definitely probably more risk of you know possible death when it comes to coronavirus just because of the fact that you know we our lungs are not as good as you know nonsmoker lung so make sure you guys are really being careful make sure you guys are you know obviously you know everybody's got a ton of friends that they hang out with and stuff like that but try to keep your circles pretty tight and even if you know you're hanging out with a friend or you know you're giving some you know you're giving a friend some weed or something they didn't have any your you know you wanted to provide them some weed something like that do a no-contact pickup you know what I'm saying even as much as you want to see your friend it's hard I know but just it's the smart way to go about it that's what we honestly that's what I've been having to do and as someone who goes out pretty much Megan is extremely social I probably hang out with three to four different friend groups every single day when I'm in my house it's been really difficult for me but it's the smart way if we can keep this down everybody's gonna be a lot better off we'll lose a lot less lives you know in the long run it'll just be the you know it's gonna be the the way it has to go by the way lemon you got it let you guys let me know it kinda get a little bit stoned ears let me know what you guys think of the different ambiance here I'm actually up in one of the rooms but instead of in the car because honestly it is latest [ __ ] well actually it's honestly not too late I'm gonna guess that it's maybe like 9:30 10 o'clock at night something like that but it's definitely dark outside to a point where the lighting would not be okay and yeah I just want to make sure you guys got a halfway decent looking down on smokes video again that's crazy I can see myself in the mirror man I just want to say that I really love you guys all out there and seriously this whole corona thing not to keep talking about it too much but it really has given me a respect for life in general because it's like you know man it could go just like that and there's nothing you can really do about it you know what I'm saying so try to cherish these days and just really make sure you talk to your loved ones make sure you give your mom a call make sure you give your dad a call you know if you don't live with them trust me it means a lot it means a lot students actually smoking really nice I've seen just a literally actually a little bottle over here it's actually perfect to be honest I love finding stuff that you can use to a shame to like for months and months and months and they're just some random little crap it's not a fancy ashtray so like if you drop it it doesn't break or anything like that big moves big moves and yeah let me know what you guys like I said before let me know what you guys think of the you know the room is a home I'm not really just like you know I guess just more smoking inside the house or post in my car because I know that a lot of you likes me smoking in my card specifically I don't really know why maybe it's heads of the og days but yeah let me know if you want another video inside the house or if you would just prefer the videos to be out in the car again like I said the main reason I made this video in the house is because of the fact that it's getting darker outside and there was not good enough lighting you guys would be looking at a single pixel of Donnie right here and I don't think you don't want that yeah damn thing saving we're about to the end ma'am I hope you guys enjoyed this video I really from the bottom of my heart I gonna get close on this one bring it on in from the bottom of my heart I just want to say I'm really sorry about lack in the videos it is completely on me I've been playing valor and I've been slacking off I've not been doing my job and I just want to say if any of you out there are looking a place of Valor in games I'm actually doing pretty good actually dropped 44 kills in a match 44 and 14 the world records 54 by AC which is pretty cool hit me up and I will DM you you know my mic code or my friend friend thing whatever and yes I'm gonna finish this off real quick and then we'll be on here love you guys all so much until next time peace the [ __ ] out have an awesome day love you guys", "bBaF5_NmQzs": "we're going to keep this role in here episode two of this 12 episode saga is that overstating calling it a saga is that even the appropriate word how are they all right you're watching the song I did you the saga continues pre-rolls major seller for just about everyone that sells them I want to show you guys innovative ways to package your pre rolls again 2019 being that critical year that you have to stand out you have to get your share of those millions of consumers who are coming into the market for the first time you got to separate yourself from just the traditional pop top and you should subscribe to the channel too because we're going to be showing you eco packaging innovation in 2019 and other stuff to Ingrid without further ado let's let's show the audience some pre-roll options if you are a dupe tube user and you want to get away from that but you're not quite ready a way that you could do that is to get a punch and put your tubes into a pouch and then you just have a little bit of an upscale way to market your product a little on the fence with that idea but I could even see that being that had like a really like premium or like luster looking pouch with like nice felt a nice like velvet exactly that could be really with like as gold hot stamp or something for more premium trim like we talked about before that fits for it you know you're telling a story it's say for example similar to the first batch of naturalistic feel to granola vibe it's now in the woods vibe but you have a bunch of pop tops you want to make additions to it so whether it's a craft label or a craft sleeve or putting it inside of that pouch its additions that we can make to alter the vibe that you're giving and then you know the next stage is we can really give a custom feel to exactly what you're looking for to build it from scratch but we can do those alterations in those modifications if you guys have already made purchases to get it more on point with what the store that you guys are trying to tell okay another way to move up from the duke tube is with these four tubes which you can get in any size and we can do all kinds of finishes on them this one has spot UV on it the clear varnish that adds some shine and it has a hot stamp on it this one is using a spot pearl varnish which is has a slight sparkle to it you make these any size and something you're going to hear also that we hear all the time it's just about how you keep these fresh so we do with people putting the doob tubes inside of tubes like that or you can put it in a little baggie as well - if you think freshness is going to be concerned if you're not moving through the product really quickly really popular for people that are trying to get away from the plastic look still have that really cool you know cylinder a cylindrical look but completely made out of board recycled board so really with a nice alternative to the classic plastic duty alright next up it's a folding box that has a soft touch of varnish on it so when you hold it in your hand it automatically feels a little bit more elevated or a lot more elevated than any kind of standard do to be folding boxes are far more affordable in terms of cost and like rigid more premium boxes so you might think oh I can't afford a box for my pre rolls because you know the price point isn't high enough but folding boxes like that that's like a 25 to 50 cent box depending on the volume that you're ordering versus the rigid ones are gonna be more dollar than two dollars depending on of course the specs of what it is it's simpler and more complex but don't rule out boxes for even low ticket items because there's ways to do them really affordably Manny I want to get you on the show before the Animus but what do you think about what have you found people like using on the pre-rolls has it been more like your customers have been more folding boxes rigid boxes tins what are you kind of seeing in the market so for like a single that's where I think people are more cautious on the pricing but for packs that's a higher retail price point Melissa welcome to the show that's the vault box you guys said a lot of you have seen that child-resistant certified you need a key or the flat object or pencil the true versatility of the vault box that's a beautiful rigid box no like buttons hanging off easy for consumers consumers love it and perfect for a pack perfect for a pack it's another fan favorite we've shown on previous episodes of the cannabis packaging show whose creation was this one is this a ingrid or had the creation you you come on to the show and hold the product is a family place its own this was another customer who had due to dupe tubes that they were trying to elevate the look of so they went for a larger version in this box there's an insert inside that is holding their tubes it's holding three so that you can do it in two Kasim sativa hybrid you could do a morning afternoon and night you could do a blank blank and blank three different strains whatever it is so these are ways to sell the product often the packaging is going to dictate how you're actually selling in your business strategy so those are always fun conversations that have when people are saying aren't so like not just making the packaging but what's the strategy behind how we're going to sell it gold plated tin gold plated if you want to go with like you know $100 pack of pre-roll isn't really make an impact you got the gold plated tin it's just more when we talked about we cater to all markets and Gucci's of the world the marque mass markets of the world if you're going for that vibe you're telling that story you want to elevate your packaging to the highest level if you're not and you don't then we find affordable ways to still tell your story and if you need a child-resistant sliding tin go to contempo packaging comm and drop your email in the box and we will send you when it's ready we'll send you an email when it's ready got quite a few see our innovations in the pipeline Jody's excited about them I could sell with with a quark trap which is a nice way to package on your pre-roll and then you can put it in something else these things are wildly popular my thing with these is like okay for how do you fit all the compliance information on them so like is it going to be a label that Flags or do you put it in a box I think sometimes I see brands they have a really nice primary package they're not considering compliance and labeling and then the end result because it's not done you know thoughtfully is the actual consumer gets something that doesn't really look too professional kind of looks tattered this is one example of something that you could do with those vials just put it into a nice box like this which would showcase them as well because this is clear acetate that look of the product being suspended is really cool doing it with clear inserts and showcasing the product so it's not really competing with the packaging but really the focus of what you're trying to show off Nick what do you like in terms of pre-roll packaging what are some of your you know that you're selling to into the market or even as a consumer what's like good pre-roll packaging yeah so I really like the cardboard spiral tubes I think it's you know a changeup from the the typical pop tops and we've had a lot of people very interested in them recently and and we can dress up the wrap with different print print techniques and make it you know really be able to tell your story we're constantly bringing you know boatloads of shipments in here so again tacking on to some of the shipments that we're bringing in so you don't have to be afraid only over a couple of thousand pieces of flying it in and if you have the time we can tack it on to one of our many boat shipments so that we can add you to the large retailers that we're doing and make it much more affordable than if you were just on your own we could do a whole show in 2019 about projections and how do you buy efficiently and how do you not just buy when you have an immediate need because you incur unnecessary costs but that is not the purpose of these shows so angry please continue all right last two things to show our non contempo items but definitely worth showing because they are very nice this is a lipstick tube that is a push to release feature fresh seal to the clicking and has embossing on the top stay tuned and this last is a box this is from Milan so we shopped the market in like big fashion cities to stay on top of trends and this was just a gorgeous box that obviously the dimensions would be different for pre-rolls but I'm just thinking like that would be that's like a game-changer that I think sure that under the Shelf and you've got like like a pre-roll or like a simple box versus that thing in terms of making an impact and getting people to notice you that's the kind of like thought process I think we should be having I think it's important to also consider what your consumers gonna do with the product so in the case of a bigger box that's gonna go on a coffee table that's gonna be a showpiece for a party they're having it's Christmas time you're having a Christmas gathering everyone gets their own pre-roll another thing that's popular in the market right now if it's a three pack five pack seven pack of pre-rolls where is that going when your consumer consumer leaves the store they're going to a concert they're going to a show it needs to fit in a purse it needs to fit in your pocket so those are the types of things you need to think about in terms of the actual end user so to speak and what they'll actually be doing with and how does that add to the overall experience that that packaging provides so keep that in mind as well just drop in great points right here knowledge boy I love it all right guys any other pre-roll stuff from the showroom that is worth showing our wonderful audience Ron's coming up for the display show drunken building displays longer than I've been alive so we have full boxes once more about the lux and they're really clean packaging that's soft touch finish with a nice hot stamp on it all right good stuff all right we'll see you guys the next episode thanks for watching the cannabis packaging show we're contempo specialty packaging see you soon", "e_wSUYRq7vs": "hey guys dave warden here for the weed report just hitting here sunday night making some topicals doing some stuff and i realized i've got this fuzzies that i got at uh scherbinski's on fairfax los angeles fashion district i thought you guys might want to check it out with me so fuzzies so it says hand rolled in bold one infused pre-roll net weight 1.5 grams you see a little california warning sticker let's roll it over bam og kush okay boom let's see what they say over here about 25 thc very little cbd manufactured 11 24 20 package 114. so that's not too bad they got this to the market fast i've had this for about a week so that's really good actually for california cannabis that a really slow supply chain out here testing and just all those various things bam so let's see what this is saying boom manufactured by sublime in oakland california sublime is a well-known uh manufacturer up there in oakland shout out to my friends at sublime uh tamper seal tamper seal all right let's try and break in here with one hand fiona in the mix fionna so you guys never met fiona before she's dope she's kind she's from a feral bloodline she's a little nutty she destroys stuff but she's she's all about that mad love so word up to fiona helping us out here with this joint let's see if i can get this open with one hand i really didn't plan ahead and it's been a minute since i made a video sorry about that by the way i've been busy working in the weed industry instead of doing my reviews of course i've been out for many many years bam okay okay i see you fuzzy i see you fuzzy so boom chow resistant plastic two bam see what's inside blam okay all right we got our fuzzy so that's uh dipped or sprayed in oil and then rolled in keefe so it looks pretty good let's see what fiona thinks fiona you know fiona's more of a bond girl so she's not really co-signing all right i did not fix my hair and man how's it going guys rockstone was my pillow too where do i look is that you guys in there hey what up i'm looking at the wrong side got my character down bit of an oil fire there sorry rookie move you guys i'm so out of practice thank you for your patience i don't know where to look i'm like um kind of tastes like cheap hash oil and this keef a lot of people oh [ __ ] look at this look at this look it already went limp on me and i hit it too hard so it canoed so i'm gonna blame that on me let's just blame that on me let's just blame that canoe on me um this limpy part oh look i got it back oh it went limp that happens to every guy sometimes ladies no no no bad david um i'm gonna go hit this again huh um kinda not great a tiny little touch of og kush flavor but it's really that sort of syrupy sweet sort of oil taste i'm not sure if they're using distillate or what kind of oil they use for this but um i don't know i joints are kind of whack anyways in the california world because uh if they're legal they get ground up and then they got to sit through testing and do all this stuff and it just takes forever to get on the market but yeah not feeling this not feeling this fuzzy gone limp on me that's kind of how i feel about the experience it's kind of an analogy but look check that out how i got it all cray maybe you could blame that on me but i think that's just me i just hit it too hard i'm a [ __ ] fiend i've been cleaning up around the house all day making topicals and i'm just like a little uptight so i had this joint but well there's the fuzzies um packaging is great initial presentation's great performance questionable um these are really popular these are really high selling uh joints um 25 you know which is pretty high for enjoy and but certainly a decent amount of that's due to the key for the infusion but um i would not recommend this i apologize to everyone at fuzzies and my friends over at sublime this one's kind of whack um it just doesn't really taste great it kind of like very little strain flavor and mostly just novelty i think i'm gonna try again just yep nope not feeling it no good no good but uh thank you guys for a quick little thing i think a new new video name bag of weed weed bag i got a big bag filled with eights of all these different strains and companies that i just need to dump out i've had it for months and i just need to test them and stuff so leave in the comments what do you want bag of weed weed bag dave's grab bag off weed weed report grab bag bag bag anyway you guys great to see you again hope you're all doing well enduring covid uh stay safe uh peace and love and mad respect peace and pot y'all peace and pot", "GT2DH1H5XHQ": "so here we go it's the um the disc of dankness and there's this item left it's hawaii heartbreak free roll by riff so let's shuffle this up and give it a spin and collect this pre-roll oh my god what a surprise it's riff white heartbreak pre-roll [Applause] so here's riff hawaii heartbreak pre-roll um at uh what what percent is this 17 oh yeah 17.87 percent or 178.77 milligrams thc and what size is this one by one g so this is a one gram um pre-roll apparently i guess uh what's the package date here is there one oh yeah there's one january 28 2020. so there we go yep one times one gram dried cannabis pre-roll yeah i've never tried one of these before i don't smoke cannabis anymore i use vaporizers now i get a couple vaporizers but um yeah i thought it'd be interesting just to check this out because i used to love rolling dubs used to roll tons of dubs but now anyways um i was just curious i was always wondering a friend gave this to me so i thought you know what i'm just gonna save for uh opening up with you guys and we'll check it out together here so yeah and we can weigh it too we can check all kinds of things out all right so it comes in a little tube here which is then also wrapped in plastic so even more garbage let's see what do we got inside here uh open up oh you gotta press what squeeze below cap oh my goodness look at that hey look in there there it is it's hiding there we go you know that seems like an all right roll this is a fucking huge filter though oh shit that's a massive filter uh when i used to roll like when where i'm from we roll joints like your filter you built like that that amount of space maybe even like that don't go like that or like this but anyways oh that smells real nice wow mmm that smells really nice that does smell nice my my let's check the scale this is supposed to be one gram and i'm assuming they're not counting the paper and the filter that would suck if they were cuz someone you want here's a 50.00 gram weight we're checking nice and accurate there so see how much does the whole thing weigh hey 1.34 that's uh good one point that's good good okay well there we go now i'm not gonna smoke this but you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna bust it open we're gonna take a look at what the hell they put inside of here because i was always wondering what does the quality of the stuff in here look like i know it smells nice so i have my uh my little bowl here it's all calibrated it's zeroed out so i think maybe we'll just tear the paper and i'll dump it into here and we can check the uh the weight right yes here it goes come on riff hey hey slightly over that's all right that's a good sign that's what you want now let's see look how it's broken up there looks like a nice grind looks decent let's check it out with the microscope i guess i don't know there's the pre-roll the inside of the pre-roll it seemed like a good roll you actually did so it's cool okay we've got to zoom in here with um a microscope check it in oh hey right there that so here we are checking it out up close with the microscope everything's all ground up here oh a little bit of purple looks like got a purple section um yeah lots of trichomes they're the kind of chunky ones there where there's a bunch of like little clusters of cloudy trichomes that's for um quality the stuff inside you know you can't really tell all that much from stuff that's ground up right because it's it's hard to tell i can definitely see chunks of trichomes though they got the big chunky kind there it reminds me a bit of the stuff you see on like a lot of the ultra sour they got the same sort of colors usually whoa oh oh oh oh what did we find we found something what is this looks like a string some kind of thread i'm not talking about the pink thing there i'm talking about the blue thing right in the center do you see that a little microfiber there a little microfiber see look at that we zoomed right in on it you can see it there it is little piece of some shit there some sort of thing a string maybe thread i don't know anyways though i suppose it's not so bad if you find just one anyways you know what best way to tell with this because it's all busted up i gotta go try this in the vaporizer so i'll be back so i just got in from this uh riff hawaii heartbreak pre-roll that i busted up and vaped some of it's a one gram pre-roll um yeah it's good stuff i like it i don't think i liked it this much the last time i got hawaii heartbreak i actually do like it it's um it's a nice kind of let's see where would i put this maybe somewhere maybe a step up from medium but not not at the top you know what i mean so it's pretty good the taste is um i i don't know how to describe this taste there is nice flavor here though i don't know how to describe it i guess you could say the taste is kind of like well it reminds me a bit of like dirt but like the cleanest dirt i've ever tasted so clean if i can taste remnants of the cleaning products that was used to clean it i don't know if that makes sense but that's kind of a feeling i get from the taste i like it though it's not a bad thing it's a good way though it's like the good version of that taste and uh i like it it's very nice so obviously i didn't go out for the entire thing right because if you buy this this comes as a whole gram right so i could probably go for let's see here i could probably do two and at least two more bowls in the packs on this so if you were to buy this this would definitely get you pretty cooked i would say because you probably even smoked the whole thing right um but you know when i go out i always fill up every single time just so i have like a standard i always use one bowl in the packs i fill it right up or whatever so that way each time i'm always testing the exact same amount and that way it's kind of like a standard so i can sort of compare things so yeah this is good stuff i like it very nice um i was better than i was expecting which is cool so yeah so is it worth the price though i don't know that's kind of that's kind of where i don't know because you can buy one gram of this on its own for ten dollars and this is like just under 13. sorry it's just over 12 12 28 so 12 28 versus 10 10 and so that's like two dollars and eighteen cents for them to roll it so that's like you're standing there you buy weed then you give someone two dollars and eighteen cents to roll and then they give it to you and take it so that's really what you're paying for i guess but this is um this is good stuff this makes me like hawaii heartbreak more so i might i might try another of those sometime i don't know who knows anyways that's it for the uh disc of dankness so i have no idea what's coming up next i guess we'll see anyways if you also want to see hit the subscribe button and um click on the bell and then it'll tell you when the next video comes up because there is more coming i just don't know what to do yet but i do have some more stuff so anyways have a good one you guys we'll see you later", "QK6ILN8mHeU": "hey what's going on everybody jay ping here checking in live respectmyregion.com i've got an official west coast we tour review today featuring ember valley one of california's most popular a bud tender favorite across the state i'm very excited today's strain is the berry jack hybrid thc listed at 23.1 percent we've got cultivation date march 2nd 2020 packaging date may 7 2020 so we're looking at cannabis that is you know roughly five and a half months old packaged on may 7 so roughly packaged uh three months and two weeks ago so definitely something that should be good should be terpy should have a lot of flavor i'm personally excited so let's dive right in i will give you guys a one hit review and then two hits with the score per how i usually do it in my joint effort pre-roll series i open the tube as i smell it there's this slight fruity chemically smell but unfortunately it does look like there is a bunch of flower cannabis outside of the pre-roll and in the tube so let's check this out here yeah there's definitely definitely some good some shake coming out of here it looks like it's probably coming out of the mouthpiece which would make sense because as you guys can see there is a complete open circle in this joint mouthpiece there is not a crutch super interesting that there's not a crutch here hopefully it doesn't impact a smoking experience but i'm definitely sure that cannabis is floating out of this and into this too because there's you know because there's no approach we've got a nice evenly stuffed j that is how it came in the joint i did not unravel it yet so i can see that is as this is bouncing around in the tube because it's not twisted flour is leaking out of the joy tube so a little bit of quality control there but it's hard it's tough with the pre-rolls it really is because so much happens um you know sometimes it's only done by hand sometimes brands only use you know machines to stuff them etc i'm not sure at the details so let's just dive right into the smoke shall we the dry hit has flavor but dry hit us flavor and i didn't get scooby snacks in my mouth when i just did that dry hair so that was nice all right here we go you guys ready so on the first hit right there very smooth um not much flavor the aftertaste right now [Music] it's just really that of burnt smoke burnt paper uh a little bit of burnt earthiness i'm not getting a huge terpene profile that i would think would come with berry jack so second hit usually we get the better taste let's check it out yeah so per usual second hit much more flavorful you guys can see i got the cough that time um let's see i'm getting notes of berry i'm getting limonene i got a little bit of pinene again this is the berry jack so i would expect a little bit of that terpinoline a little bit of that pinene the limonene that you would get in a jack herrera cross or a dutch treat or an amnesia hay something along those lines but this berry here gives it this earthiness and those these berry tones i'm really liking it let me hit it one more time and i'll give you guys the official score out of 100 simply because that first taste did not that first hit did not do this justice the second hit was so tasty a third hit is necessary here we go all righty so i have 10 categories for this uh pre-roll review the west coast we tour official official rating system does 100 points ten categories each uh presentation first you know i look at the ember valley tube and i think you know it is a basic joint but i really enjoy the logo the font and the white and red coloring i think it pops so although it is a standard joint tube um you know plastic not glass i'm gonna give them a decent score uh probably you know somewhere in that eight to nine range um simply because you know i do like their red white and black that they do i think it's attractive appeal same thing ember valley has lots of respect and clout here rightfully so and rightfully earned in california so i do feel like the appeal is there again i'd have to go eight to nine closer to a nine the color you know you talk about the color what is color meaning canvas well when i look at the joint and i look at the color of it you know if this joint were wrapped in the same paper and i could tell that the wheat inside was brown well then the color would be bad so color on this is appropriate for a flower pre-roll there's chunks in here i can see some some good bits of pre-roll is an attractive color you know it could be barf brown or green it's just not attractive so the colors there the smell when i opened the tube i said that there wasn't really a terpe smell but to correct myself there was berry notes there was this you know slight gassy musk maybe not gas but this muskiness and i think that's evident that it is one of the very uh notes or natures of this strain the berry jack so smell i'll give it you know maybe a high six maybe a low seven now when i talk about the taste the first hit not so great and as a consumer that first hit is usually everything that's going to determine whether or not they really want to keep smoking it or how impactful that that experience you know how powerful that memory really is so taste with this i'm gonna give it an you know a nice eight to two you know eight point two five to a five probably closer to eight point two five i like it i wish there was more jack to it um that first hit kind of gave me a little bit of a sour puss taste you know what i mean it just wasn't the best so i'll give it the 8.25 on the taste for this uh it tasted good i don't want you guys to you know be get this get this the wrong way it does taste very good um potency potency potency potency when we're talking potency that's thc 23.1 this is a sativa i'm talking talking talking i got lots of energy i think the potency is right on point um it's hard for me to give it at a 10 out of 10 when the thc scores are low but i do feel that the thc the terpenes are you know creating a nice entourage effect i can feel my heart kind of racing and pumping due to the sativa nature the sativa hybrid nature of this so potency i'll give it the i'll give it the 8.75 maybe even the nine i think it's right up there with where it should be potency-wise for this strain um experience you know i'll give it a nine i'll give it a nine because you know these pre-rolls can range anywhere between 13 and like 18 bucks sometimes you might even pay 20 for the grand but that's that's pretty rare so with that said the experience for me i feel is appropriate for the price appropriate for the smoke the strain i'd say the experience for me is a perfect ah maybe you know i'll give the experience a nine i'll give the experience a nine and the reason why i give it a nine is because again there was some some scooby snacks throughout the j it wasn't twisted perfectly uh the ash is looking good um but that first hit was rough now more information available is a new category this year for us the reason why we added that is because as a consumer i want to be able to look up more information about the strain or more information about the brand you know instagram facebook linkedin etc so lamber valley has a strong internet presence there could always be more information about the strain and pre-rolls you know helping me to guide it you know lighter versus you know the hemp wicks etc so more information available i'm gonna give them a solid eight uh i do feel like more like i say most brands can improve on this more more information should always be available the day that a brand gets a 10 out of 10 is the day that i'm celebrating and filming a video just shouting out that brand hasn't happened and what i recommend i would absolutely recommend this berry jack hybrid from amber valley i feel like it's worth smoking you know 10 out of 10 times i just wish this particular joint was a little bit more less messy you know the pre-roll being kind of undone at the tip kind of impacts it but yes 10 out of 10 i would recommend an overall score for me ah when i taken things all in consideration and just to give it an overall rating i'm gonna stick with a solid nine um i think you know the strain the flower the actual cannabis side of things made it a very positive experience but i definitely feel it's important to highlight some of the other things you know the scooby snacks um you know there could always be more information available online uh there aren't actually any terpenes listed here on the joint tube so i feel like that is kind of a missed opportunity that could be still capitalized on over the you know next few years so overall score 9 out of 10 this is a high quality pre-roll i highly recommend you guys visit any of the dispensaries in norcal or socal that carry amber valley there's literally i believe 150 to 250 dispensaries that carry amber valley maybe more if you guys have any questions about this product any of my ratings or rankings please feel free to drop a comment and send me a dm i would love to talk with you about my thinking about why you know why i chose these numbers and this you know the strain et cetera so appreciate you guys for all the love

checking in live check it out we all peace", "vvOrD3iny_8": "[Music] so [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another delta 8 video uh this is another delta 8 hemp video i actually completely forgot i still had tincture i still had another one of these products to make a video on and uh what better way to have some apple juice but these are tinctures and with tinctures they actually are droppers or like you basically put it underneath the tongue and let it absorb into your system but i've seen people put it in drinks as well and i'm very fortunate enough to have the pineapple express one if you can tell from the intro uh it also says the amount per serving is 30 30 drop wait serving size 30 drops wait serving per container 30. okay so those 900 drops is what they're saying and then one serving which is 30 drops is 33 milligrams of delta athc so yeah let's see this i've only tried a few tinctures and they're mostly very i would say it's a very alcoholic taste because i believe there's like i don't know was it glycerin i don't even know what it was in there but i'm sure there was alcohol in the last tincture i tried definitely was not good at all so we're just gonna open this oh it shows okay so this is at about 75 milligrams i'm smelling it smells really nice so 75 one milliliter is 30 drops so we're at 75 so that should be about should be about 22.5 milligrams all right 22.5 milligrams here we go kind of tasted like bubblegum it's a very minimal taste at best but since it's the only thing i put in my mouth like i can taste it but like if i were to put it in this i feel like i wouldn't taste it but we're gonna do that um but no not bad i was honestly expecting a much worse taste so let's do another let's do another 75 in here so obviously the effects aren't gonna [ __ ] just immediately take over you know so i will be filming again in about an hour or so uh but yes i wanted to get a shot of me pouring this in here how many shots let's see seventy-five another 75 [ __ ] it we'll do another 75 all right so how many was that so that's about 70 milligrams of delta eight thc in there i think i did over 100 plus milligrams on this stuff so i'm excited to see oh [ __ ] you can see it's just is that chill in there what the [ __ ] so just like that's crazy there's like a layer on top yeah i drink mostly it well that tastes like pineapple and apple now pineapple and apple juice that's crazy good so i'm gonna get back to you in about 30 or 45 minutes to an hour i do have a fast metabolism so it might be a little bit quicker than that but overall you know another good way to take delta athc you know there's gummies there's actually dabbing it there's cartridges and now there's tinctures as well and for those of you who you know i think i feel like like some people don't like to um medicate you like normally you know smoking flower or vaping or dabbing or anything and they want more of a i wouldn't say a better way but a more i don't know how to say it but it's just you know you just put it underneath the tongue and you go about your day that's about it you know what i'm saying and uh you you set it in your mouth and you forget it basically but other than that yes i will be filming or i will get back to you in about an hour or so so [Music] all right guys so i am back uh it's been about 45 minutes i mean i do feel somewhat of a buzz but i honestly feel like what i take like 100 milligrams i think my tolerance is a little bit higher than that but i definitely do feel it i definitely feel it around the eyes and everything um as far as like the drink goes i drank most of it because it tastes like just apple juice now and uh as you've seen from the earlier clip it was just sitting on top i mean yeah it's still it just tastes like apple juice but you can still put some of this in here [ __ ] it so we're gonna end it off i'm gonna take some more but i definitely do feel it and for how little i took you know i didn't take that much i took like what 80 milligrams or something or so [Music] okay i'm gonna take some more real quick before i end it off but i definitely do feel a head change oh but yes uh definitely i would i would definitely recommend it for the people that um don't want to smoke or vape or dab or eat edibles because you know that's a lot of uh sugar you know all those gummies like that one video i did recently there's a lot of a lot of [ __ ] sugar especially in the morning but this is a more subtle way of dosing and uh and yeah it's just a great way to to get some delta into your system and it's legal link will be in the comments below if you're interested but other than that hopefully you did enjoy this video cheers to some regular apple juice i mean there's a slight pineapple but not as strong as it was when i just put it in there but yeah hopefully you did enjoy the video peace out [Music] do [Music] you", "yQZ5HnDQhuQ": "[Music] hi guys welcome back to my channel hope you guys are all having a little day welcome back if you are you have been part of the game i don't know what to call you guys um

this company um i'm not sponsored by the way but i met up with this company and they actually hooked me up with some free products and i'm so thankful and i already picked up the package and the package looks so [ __ ] pretty so pretty um and i'm so excited to show you guys like i'm so excited to show you guys as i was saying i'm not sponsored so i'm going to be giving my honest opinion but i'm very thankful that they hooked me up with this with these products like that's so amazing but this wouldn't have been done by myself i wouldn't be able to do this on my own like you guys have also helped me get like these free products so y'all deserve to see me smoke these and it's like i'm smoking for you guys okay we smoking virtually hopefully one day we do get to like have like a big ass smoke sesh together and like a lit ass day like that would be so fun you know nice view type of [ __ ] but this is how the packaging looks hi 90s super nice super yellow definitely summer vibes has the palm trees right here they're wax infused cannabis pre-rolls each of them hold 1.2 grams and you all know like most of the time i be smoking like joins priors once in a while backwards but it's like everywhere not rare i would say but it's not i don't smoke it as often you know because pre-rolls um are definitely much healthier since they're nicotine free and let's just take a moment thumbnail these are so cute i can't i cannot oh my gosh so we have right here the um flavors that it has we have strawberry it's sweet and juicy strawberries straight from the fields we have watermelon the refreshing watermelon you crave after the beach peach so juicy and delightful you'll want seconds definitely tropical punch oh i love the the color for this one i love the color for all of them but this is like my favorite color a blend of sweet tropical flute flavors gelato oh my gosh you guys are you guys seeing what i'm seeing the packagings are so cute super [ __ ] cute sugar cookie ice cream better than grandma's pink lemonade like a cold glass of lemonade on a summer day definitely for the summer days pineapple sweet pineapple sprinkled with sugar and double cup a candy lemon lime soda your favorite rapper's drink okay hi nighties i see you guys you guys the packaging oh my gosh i can't even decide which one i want to try out first because they all look so cool and you can tell like the packaging is good quality i like glass containers like this because i can usually like stuff this pre-roll if i didn't finish it in the um back or like if i have another one and i'm like i'm gonna save it in here so it doesn't reek my room like these are just pretty cool containers and like i like that they're colorful that's super cool and it's vibrant and it makes me like happy and it's so summer vibes definitely summer vibes i really like it like i don't know i'm just so excited i can't even choose which one like i think i'm gonna have to like grab them all and do like any minimizing well because they're all too good so guys i actually didn't record a lot and i was actually talking a lot about the product itself and i'm already i already had sparked it up too and i was not recording uh youtuber fails look it it's definitely burning pretty nice we have that white ash i just [ __ ] up the burning that's why it's like but it's burning very like nice and even not even but smooth because i didn't burn it even but yeah as i was saying i was talking about the product i really love um i'm smoking tropical punch and this one has 29.7 thc i just chose this one because it matches my nails to be honest nothing specific in particular but it's hitting pretty good their weed is indoor weed they don't use no um no trim nor shake which is like number one like a big thing most of the pre-rolls range from 30 to 40 so far as i'm hitting it it's super smooth i can taste it that tropical in there these are so like on the gold and cute as [ __ ] like hey you're going to freaking grocery shopping or something you want to smoke right before let me take out aha 90s super cute super fashionable just spark it up ready to go so far i actually like the weed it's hitting pretty good and for it being small like it's hitting pretty good and as i was saying when i was unboxing packaging um they are wax infused heroes and h holds 1.2 grams so these little shits hold 1.2 not bad at all oh i did try fuzzies and it has 0.5 and i just feel like last time in like five minutes or so and this one already has lasted me like okay decent time and although it doesn't have the wax out on the outside it has it in the inside it tastes like pretty enjoyable versus the fuzzy i just felt like i don't know it just tasted like straight up wax like i don't know how to explain in like straight up wax and it also i don't know if it also could have been like the weed too that fuzzies carried because i know that the packaging date was pretty um it had been like since the end of march that they had packaged that [ __ ] so i was like [ __ ] but i already had paid for another great thing about these free rolls each of them comes from a natural blend of terpenes but i really like these spring rolls like i feel like with two i'd be like pretty cool two or three [ __ ] smoke on eight right now [ __ ] it it's all down maybe smoking like how many do you want me to smoke in the session because they do have seven now left i have seven all left so let me know what you guys want to see with the rest of these pre-rolls because yeah i don't want to be reviewing each flavor that's going to be too many or maybe i can i can do a series on this high 90s let me know down what you guys think i should do seven pre-rolls in a sitting um a series of like some flavors or like i don't know don't let me know some creative ideas i sometimes don't i'm not really creative i'm not creative to be honest but i do enjoy making videos for you guys and for the people that do enjoy thank you so much like i said i wouldn't be able to be doing this without you guys and we all go make it here i [ __ ] burned myself with a lighter but definitely i [ __ ] with it i also loved like it is a pre-roll i'm usually you guys always know i'm usually smoking joints free rows once in a while i'll be smoking some backwoods or whatever but it's an occasion it's not all the time because they are nicotine free so they are healthier which is it benefits you you know but i hope you guys enjoyed this video and say hi to the [ __ ] sky and until next time bye", "SDXcp2mxufU": "hey guys welcome back to our Channel I've had a couple of things planned so yesterday I went to a couple different uh uh dispensaries I went to the clear choice for cannabis some like that and and then later on after work I wouldn't got a pre-roll ad to the stash box so I'm gonna give you my review on both of what I got um before I do that let me get into something a little more festive let's do it okay so what I'm gonna talk about real quick first and I'm gonna use this little hi session smoking all these to get into my next segue that I have some news on my tell you guys this the first cartridge the cartridge I got yesterday it's called helluva needed um it's a marijuana extract this guy right here it looks like and isn't this the coolest it blueberry dream is the name of the cartridge flavor and elevated it comes to one ground this is what the market looks like it's very cool this is that oh that's not great this is it right here this is um what my austin wreck looks like it's Jerry and a little quasar and it just popped in here I've got the extender and this is the highest setting right now and it's 88 percent of total cannabinoids with an eighty percent THC now the blueberry tastes a little artificial I gotta say that it makes my nose burn just a little bit but the clapping at a minimum sometimes it's amazing but that's when it gets like no I feel like my that itchy nose thing I get is only with artificial stuff so I think the artificial is probably and the flavor is it's blueberry drew you might have heard of that so it tastes really good there mango flavor is tasty as well it doesn't taste artificial and they're watermelon flavor does not taste either so I guess it might have just been blueberry but elevated is a really good cartridge to put inside of a rig like this battery like this one of cartridges it could be hit or miss so when you find one that you like especially if you have the pleasure to go into dispensary and it's always being there pick it up um so clear choice cannabis a good dispensary it's it's a coma I think I think so yes is it - coming out it's right next to a Hollywood hustler which is awesome and they've got a bunch of THC sex related things so that's interesting as well and right next to that if you're great good in stone definitely vein clear choice cannabis it's a good will so go in there and find some good stuff I actually recently was in the gut that good well and I found a book that was about a soldier in during World War two that had the unique ability to predict German attacks based on his erections this is a true book I found in that good well this is real based on his erections protects German attacks damn like I don't know I've never had an erection but I don't know if any man that could maybe write a book on his dick soldiers I don't know but it's a really good place to find some unique stuff that good well next to you clear choice canvas so next I'm gonna get into this prequel that I got it's called pudding now this pre roll I've been reading this book the Goldfinch and I'm actually putting a lot of I'm putting all those readings here on this channel as well it's gonna be called the reading rainstorm and it's just me like 30 or 40 minutes honestly of reading so if you're not down for like a good creative book if you didn't just smoke and want to hear you know I really they're really just a good book talking about some and just the interesting ass [ __ ] book I'm starting it from around page 20 so I'm gonna really try to get all as my sessions of sitting down reading like 10 pages that are you know a chapter cuz the chapters are like 10 pages long a chapter so while just smoking and I'm gonna not not to much commentary it's just me being really animated reading this [ __ ] awesome ass book if you guys wanted to see that you know stay tuned it's gonna be called the Reading Rainbow and they're gonna be long as [ __ ] so don't click on that if you don't

Kanab in a way that's harvested last month and it's got like 1% CBD I've actually been liking the things that have a little bit of CBD in it because I think that's what makes it also like hybrid all right let's remove this one I'm just going to show you how French this guy is beautiful when we take it out it's kind of half smoked it I've been reading the step dang gas book but it's made with an L

last night I wrote so much about like after reading like that I couldn't even stop myself I I don't know I'm I buy my uncomfortable enough to read from this dream journal you guys ever maybe wanted to hear something like that we could do a read-through of my dream book um but it it gave me some interesting stuff and I'm not sure where it came from but then I thought about it oh my god I read like

day or do something to store then you don't have anything to dream about it's just my opinion on drink some okay well I think that um I'm gonna get into this book saying that um I'm with that like a

is it [ __ ] my bad 630 milligrams and total thc 472 and the cbd 102 milligrams so it's got a lot of thc and a lot of cbd the original gangster is an og and you can get these at a lot of dispensaries they're starting to get quite popular and today the strain is original gangster i want to say this is an indica dominant hybrid but i'm not 100 on that and they do run you about 20 bucks a piece but all places sell them for different prices so don't hold me to that the other one i reviewed was the apple drip the apple drip one if i remember correctly i gave it 8.4 and it tasted just like sour apples or like green apples this is that original gangster by caviar gold i do have uh a lot of their stuff here the moon rocks the jay and silent bob line uh if you haven't tried their tinctures this is these are really good too i recommend taking about 15 drops for like a novice but you have to experiment with those drops and see how much are good for you i'm not sure if they still sell these but they used to have the little cavities which are like these mini joints and they're fun they're really mini you only get like six hits off them when they're gone they're little mini joints okay so far [Music] for the original gangster i do taste the og the og comes through but it also has the distillate in the key so so far i like it and there is one and a half grams inside each one of these pre-rolls these joints the cavi cone it does get a big resin ring around it once you start you can see it right there that wet around there that resin ring that's all that [ __ ] all that thc that distill it the more i'm hitting it the more it's hitting me let's see which one i like better the original gangster or the apple drip because i want to say the j and silent bob ones are a little higher in the thc than these i believe you know what time it is cheers everybody let's get a shotgun in there are a few strains i still haven't tried i gotta review the uh snooki buchi's pre-roll and i have to review the king cavi the king cavi og uh pre-roll i do have those i will be reviewing them uh in the next week or so oh i cheers up let's try it again sorry [Music] whoa ah gotta get that burp out there we go i love how slow these burn they burn so slow they last [ __ ] forever like i said before these are these are good for two maybe three people it'll get two three people lit because i'm already stoned in i'm not even halfway yet the ash is a more of a white to light gray it's not all white ash but it's got the distillate and the keep in there too so and it doesn't have any information what distillate they use or what key you know i really don't have any information on that maybe one day they'll put it online or on their packaging so far i'm not disappointed i like the original gangster they do have flower of this too they don't just have the pre-rolls you can get an actual eighth of original gangster uh like weed the flower and i want to say it's moon rocks like comes in the box like this one here this here was the strong berry and i've reviewed the ice water and the strong berry if you guys haven't seen those go ahead and go check them out okay i'm gonna get like two more hits added i can give you guys my official review uh quick movie recommendation the shawshank redemption if you guys haven't seen it you're [ __ ] up you're missing out it's a great [ __ ] movie uh it's a prison movie but i don't think there's any rape in it not that i remember no prison sex so that's always good it's a really [ __ ] good movie if you guys haven't seen it i definitely recommend checking it out uh the shawshank redemption it's a great flick and burps okay last hit let's go all right let's calculate it up okay price that varies from place to place for what you're getting uh because it they burn they last forever and it's got the distillate and the keep in it uh these are extremely [ __ ] good so for you know 20 bucks 12 bucks whatever you're getting them for it's a decent price it's good for what you're getting the uh the look that looks like ju all the other ones they use the same cones and everything else can't see the weeds so i can't tell you about the look the the smell on the dry pool on this is tastes like an og nothing crazy about it it's pretty normal the high or the smoothness the smoothness is there it's my throat's not all [ __ ] up and it's even in the joint this isn't even bong hit and the high the high is there too i'm loaded but i'm not any more loaded than i was when i uh smoked the apple drip but the apple drip had a better flavor so i remember giving the apple drip an 8.4 so i'm gonna have to give the original gangster by uh caviar gold the cabbie cone i'm giving it the 8 3 because it's right there on par with the uh with the apple drip but it doesn't taste as good so the apple drip gets a point better for the taste other than that they're almost identical in the way that they get you loaded so i'm giving it the 8.3 that was my review hope you guys enjoyed it until next time smoking with small town [Music]", "LuE5EwEJyBw": "it's never a [ __ ] dull moment here at four-twenty unbox let me tell you that between

guys are a little little for sure but pretty damn cool last time we opened one of these up and we saw what we wanted to see and that was no leaf and a bunch of nice fluffy crumbled bud so without further ado you want to take a closer look as we always say here at 420 unboxed my marijuana mystery shopper catchphrase let me take a closer look myself and I will tell you man I like these cones nice roll job you know for commercial rolling you know this is a I don't know if you guys ever tried to roll a cone man but it is not easy so there you go nice job looks very tasty passes the taste the smell all that kind of test hasn't passed a taste test yet but you know what I'm saying it's about to so we already went through that that moustache of mine is highly flammable just like my charismatic personality right here at 4:20 unbox with your marijuana mystery shopper oh man what's with tasty city boat giving it a spin while we light it up we'll puff on him and man oh that's going

pre-roll game if you get it in a cardboard box and it's uh they're dry grab yourself a pack case throw above it in there let it sit for 24 hours your experience will be completely different than smoking a dry pre-roll nobody wants to do that anymore so let's let's change that welcome everybody this is anthony with boveda joined today by cody ziering with pac case how the hell are you buddy i'm good i'm good i'm coming off vacation so i'm still uh still a little bit of vacation mode um which is always a fun little area to be in no doubt uh best part about vacation is on the way their worst part of vacation is coming back to the office and seeing 18 000 emails waiting for you it happens all the time i know yeah so it's just been pitchforking out of that but um things are good yeah there's a lot going on here a lot of things to talk about today absolutely industry's booming boveda is booming pack cases booming let's get to it where do you want to start i mean you want to start with i guess how we kind of ran into each other years ago yeah absolutely this has been a long time coming no doubt um where was that i think mj biz vegas 2017 maybe yeah okay um yeah you guys what launched in 2016. just about yeah we uh we we came up with the idea very very early on like january 2nd 2016 we were still working for a vertically integrated cannabis company right near aspen colorado great experience gave us great insight into the industry and really what the cannabis market kind of demands uh and everything has come from there it was like it was one of my first very first trade shows i think when i walked over and saw you guys um it was a funny story we we bumped into you uh quite literally um saw your shirt and were like oh we know bobito we love that and we just started talking with you brett and i actually got invited brett's my business partner everybody in case uh nobody nobody knew that uh brettgelfan shout out to you buddy um brett and i actually went to that convention for free the cannabis company had purchased tickets for us and we had left before the show happened so we got to go on their dime and you know that's kind of when our world turned around and how did you how did you guys get into the space again um what was your background before pack case funny funny story uh i was working tech i was uh working for apple at the time i was an engineer um doing some annoying stuff on the phones with in between customers and engineering kind of realized that uh corporate life wasn't for me i needed a change and i was helping brett work on some website for some cannabis company uh two weeks later he said hey we need a director of marketing are you interested i jumped on the opportunities like all right we'll pack your stuff and get to colorado next month uh time to start so went out there a little bit of nepotism uh brett's uh brett's dad my dad and the guy that hired us have all been friends for 30 35 years i guess he wanted some smart cheap labor at the time and that's uh kind of how we got our invitation but a few months later unfortunately he got sick and it put brett and i in a position where we were running the show uh in our young 20s which is absurd to put 20 year olds in charge of a 15 million cannabis company but hey you know you got to do what you got to do in business it sure is yeah we have a similar story too um you know i want to hear it how did you get started please yeah no i was i was in tech as well like straight out of college um under the fluorescent lights in a cube sea of cubes and i was like oh yes i'm getting out of school i'm gonna you know work and sell stuff and pay off my loans and you know it's a big fortune 500 company and uh after about a year and a half you know i was going through started out as like uh you know basically a quote guy you know early on learning the sales process and then moved through quickly but i know i wanted to to sell and to really own accounts and quarterback stuff and i talked to my boss and he's like well that's probably eight to ten years away for you and so i'm like oh i can be patient but uh not that patient [Laughter] and uh yeah luckily family friends um one of my family friends lived down the street from my cousin again nepotism here lucky right place right time but um kate holstein who's in charge of our international business she's been uh she actually got me to sidetrack even more she got me my first job um working like as a banquet server at weddings and so i've just i've known her since i was a kid basically and she's like hey i worked this company boveda and um now we make these humidity control packs we're in the cannabis space we're in the tobacco market and we're in the music industry and i heard those three things i said cool i mean yeah i'm in so i interviewed with them long story short um you know as employee number 12 and i think we're over 65 now and that was just four and a half years ago so um really fun fun place to work similar stories here we're basically um very similar in what we do our products and our services are very complementary to the things we're trying to address here to the cannabis industry 100 peanut butter and jelly uh especially for for pre-rolls we make something that's uh great for protecting them and you guys make sure that they stay fresh and tasty for as long as absolutely possible longer than most thought would be possible exactly so anthony i mean we've been talking we've known each other for a long time but really i don't know the the story behind boveda how how did that come about what is it like tell everybody what bovita is yeah so um it's a really simple product and that's that's what uh that's what we like most about it but it's very effective and it works pretty well um it started 25 years ago a couple of guys in the tobacco business they were cigar smokers saw a problem with uh humidification one-way humidification for regulators for cigar humidors um they said there's got to be a better way to do this so they worked um with a couple of engineers from general mills here in minnesota on coming up with a product that's able to basically self-control it's not you you don't have to add anything to it um and it's a two-way controller so in a deficit environment it'll add humidity and then when there's not enough it'll or when there's too much it'll it'll absorb some too so it's it's really getting rid of those peaks and hills and valleys of humidity um and so that that technology started for the like i said for the the cigars and tobacco business and then over time and we i'm sure this has been talked about on many of our other podcasts but um you know we started seeing these tobacco stores uh selling a lot of products in northern california um to the traditional market and um there's like wow there's there's a demand for this on the cannabis space too and that was probably 10 12 years ago now um and so we came up with our our 62 formula and um you know from there the the technology has really stayed the same but we've been finding out more about how this technology can um you know not just protect weight and help you know manage the moisture content or water activity but to also preserve terpenes and trichome integrity so it's been fun to to watch how it's how it's grown and what we've learned um that's that's really fun there's a huge feast of thought culture here feast of learning love of learning um that's that's something that's at our very core um and we have a lab down in um the basement of our hq here where a lot of these tests are being ran we have a lot of partners um different labs across the states and even internationally that help run tests and it's it's really cool uh so yeah that's you know it's a bit of a ramble there but that's uh no it it it sounds super cool i mean we did we've we've been doing r d on our products for four years you know always trying to come up with new stuff but we just have to make a really interesting design and make sure it's structurally integral you guys you have to do some chemical engineering which i can only imagine just ups the level of difficulty by you know to the umpteenth degree so good for you guys it's great that you guys can do everything downstairs and run humidity tests and i know that's a great segue into what we'll we'll talk about next because you can't really run a humidity test without measuring what you're trying to contain the humidity within uh which kind of leads me on to what we do over a pack case and we make these really amazing joint cases this is one of our awesome hemp clients father obsidian but check this out we call this product a jpeg it's our flagship so you'll notice inside this is what's amazing to bovida and everyone who uses it there's a gasket seal that lines the actual case to hold five payrolls um so when you close it you can actually hear the click that's how you know it's sealed and then our favorite part not so boveda is central but we have a extra little place that you can store roaches so you can't finish a joint you don't want to stink up the rest of uh the fresh ones inside the pack that was a really cool idea um so as we were developing this the whole reason we put a gasket in there was to make sure that pre-rolls stayed fresh unfortunately in this industry the pre-roll has been an underutilized product skew for so long such an easy product to produce it's something that from a beginner to an intermediate to a super heady everyone loves smoking joints everyone loves smoking bloods and when we first got in the industry back in 2016 everyone was just taking trim that shitty extra leftover whatever stuffing in a pre-roll and saying okay good enough today now it's totally different story people use only flower premium everything sometimes they're even caviar which means that they may have a core with some hash or are wrapped with some keef and some extra little bits on the outside and can exceed retail values of over 50 bucks in fact last time i was in vegas at the show we went to a dispensary planet 13 and they were selling a can of cigar for a thousand dollars uh so the pre-roll game has totally evolved now think about this anthony what would what would you do if you went out you bought a blood that was a thousand dollars and it was dry i would immediately want to return it right and can you probably not probably not so products like that have to be in something that's airtight and gasket sealed and if you're doing it the right way you have a bill vita pack in there as well yeah no doubt um you you brought up some really interesting stuff cody um do you mind expanding a little bit on how you've seen um you know we're we're more on the you know we certainly work with a lot of companies that manufacture pre-rolls um but also you know people that are just packaging grams or eighths or quarters or ounces or pounds um but it seems you know i mean you guys have a focus on pre-rolls do you want to elaborate on how that's changed throughout like the last four or five years um you know going into this more premium stuff versus just the consumable hey you know the dispensary is running a deal and you get a free pre-roll and it's kind of just like everyone expects oh it's it's probably gonna be dry it's probably not gonna taste very good but i mean how is it where is it changed and where is it changing where is it going yeah absolutely like i had said before when we first got into it no one really cared they just took a pre-roll they were sometimes even making them in the dispensary with leftover whatever after bagging out you know an eighth for a customer there's maybe another gram or two in the jar so the manager said screw it let's grind it up throw it in some pre-rolls and now we can sell it today the pre-roll is a main sku in the industry i think it accounts for maybe 10 15 20 somewhere in there depending on the month of total cannabis sales in the entire country so clearly they're here to stay and it's a product that people love so very quickly back in 2016 and 17 when we were starting pack case we realized that the pre-roll was super underutilized it wasn't really given the appreciation that it should have i mean it's a top level sku it's a real money maker and it doesn't take a lot of money to actually start producing them so we created our product because there wasn't any premium offerings like i said everyone was just throwing [ __ ] in a tube and or a bag and that was it there really wasn't like a uh a big demand for people asking for quality pre-rolls and we didn't understand that because as pre-roll enthusiasts someone who we smoke joints all the time especially when we went skiing or out for hikes or whatever joints are the way to go um no one really had anything that was nice or worth talking about bringing home so instead we just buy flour and roll our own but it left a huge amount of market opportunity for all these cannabis companies who weren't doing something to make a premium sku that addresses a huge market need so there was an incredible amount of demand and no supply whatsoever and that's where pac case came in to fill the gap and give opportunities to companies like this to be able to sell a premium pre-roll so was pac case kind of born on the mountain per se it's funny uh we quickly came up with the idea late at night uh the second night that brett and i had ever met um just because we were talking about going skiing and taking joints before we ever had a prototype uh i had actually uh three or four joints like in my chest pocket um took a little kicker while i was skiing and totally yard sale ate [ __ ] skis went flying worst part though uh i was kind of hurt and the joints were all broken so not only was i like in pain i couldn't smoke so it was it was rough so brett and i very quickly jumped on finding someone to help us out with the design and we quite literally used our prototype our very first one which i have right here super basic shitty design but uh this i used for an entire winter to hold pre-rolls and make sure that they wouldn't break so connor was uh was born out of uh two things a we needed a person we had a personal need we needed to be able to carry joints on the mountain or going for hikes or wherever uh and at the same time we knew that the cannabis market needed it too so it was a little bit of a selfish uh build it was kind of doing it for us and then realized there was a business behind it too that's that's exactly it though i mean that's how great products and ideas are born what's what's uh what's a problem i'm facing in my world today like some broken pre-rolls and then you know there's gonna be thousands of other people that have the same problem so cool stuff i've always loved your guys products um and you guys um you have your your five pack obviously what's what's more of your consumer facing um your duo right do you have you don't have a single though because who's gonna smoke a single joint i mean you're always gonna have one for a buddy so you would think that we uh we do have a we may or may not i cannot confirm or deny that we have a single in the works um but it won't be ready for a while if in fact we're working on something uh really though like one is never enough right like two is always better than one three is better than two and [ __ ] if you can have five will have five um so it's it's what's most amazing and what i find most interesting about our product and why it it works so well on both sides of the aisle um it's a packaging product it was always developed to be a packaging product and whole allow cannabis companies to sell pre-rolls but over the course of a year or two as we were our social media was growing and people were starting to find out about what we were doing people started asking for these just like hey i don't live in a cannabis state how do i get one um so we put them up on amazon and let it ride and uh two years later we've sold you know more than 50 000 units and are absolutely crushing a thousand reviews which blows my mind and we have over four and a half stars which on a product intended for packaging that gets sold as an accessory yeah blows my mind every time 100 and um one thing that i've always loved about your guys product is that um you know you can you can customize it um you know the the business can go put their branding on it and customize it however they want um that's a huge thing especially up in canada and some other markets that um you know they can't necessarily advertise or brand do you have any experience there um helping companies really market their brand with your guys packaging technology i'm glad that you asked that anthony pack case technically is a packaging company right that's the product that we sell but really when you get down to things we consider ourselves a marketing company we give our clients an ability to brand and promote products in ways that they wouldn't be able to before our packaging may be slightly more expensive than everyone else on the market but that's obviously because it's a premium feel what other packaging can go out and say hey i sell for 20 on amazon but instead you can come to my dispensary take five of my best highest quality joints with delicious flour have my brand on it and then now go and walk around with it so we give these companies not just an opportunity to create beautiful packaging that's going to create an amazing customer experience but we also allow their customers to then become a walking advertisement for their company think about it you buy a jpack from somebody that means you have five joints so you take one joint out to smoke with a friend well you're obviously gonna close the pack put it back in your pocket again you still have four left so you're gonna hold on to the packaging for a long time which means anytime you smoke with somebody and you take that out your brand as a company gets exposed to their friend who's now likely to become a customer their self themselves yeah well and let's let's back up to a second so let's talk about um the premium aspect so and what that value can can mean not only to a business but to the consumer so your guys you go i mean let's and we can even back up to that leap down study that we helped you guys do so that by let's explain this to the the people so yeah boba can take uh packaging and put it into a um a dry chamber put above the pack in there and then we can basically estimate the shelf life or stability how long the boba packs can last how long the product is going to stay fresh um versus no active humidity control versus having a boat pack in there and then we can compare that um against the control and give you hey this is going gonna you know add an extra week two weeks a month some cases um let's should we chat about uh how that went and what that kind of means for brands and consumers as far as you know brands are gonna be able to go into more inventory and that's something that we've seen on on the boveda side is um you know a big concern or a big problem facing a lot of these operators was hey we're just trying to get product on the shelf because the supply and demand chart is totally kitty wampus and you know we've had cultivators operators say we're we're trying to like they're torn especially these commercial ones because they want to have a longer cure on their their flower and they wanna couldn't really control that quality um but then they have um people in the supply chain saying hey this dispensary's been out of said strain this amount of flour for x amount of days and like we just we need to get on the shelf it's just flying off the shelf that we have seen as i have seen personally that's kind of slowing down and people are able to go into more inventory and carry more um but our products together can help assure that that shelf life is there and so product isn't sitting for two three months and then it's sold dry that's one of the benefits of being able to use pack case and boveda together um these operators who you know think about it if you have a production team of 10 well you don't necessarily want to have two people doing pre-rolls and two people doing edibles and spread out your labor force a lot of the times it's more efficient and our clients have told us this that you know i want to put my entire production team have them do an entire run start to finish bang it out and then move on to the next project now when you do that with flour with pre-roll with something that's not necessarily super shelf stable like a concentrate or an edible you have to have velocity so not only do you have to package it up quickly you have to get it out the door you have to get it to the dispensary they have to shelve it and then they have to get it out to the consumer now that process can take a lot longer than it would take a cannabis to dehumidify and then dry out lose terpenes lose flavor lose potency and mess with um with effects right like if uh some thc converts into cbd that flower that you smoke once it's converted is gonna make you feel totally different than if it didn't exactly so with boveda and pack case because they're such a tremendous seal these producers have the ability to make an entire run of pre-rolls leave them in their factory if they have to and as long as it's properly sealed and the boveda pack is fresh these pre-rolls are going to last a lot longer which means that their production problems that come along with having to do massive runs and then making it like sit on it as opposed to doing smaller runs and moving them quicker and making a regular process makes life a lot easier for them they can sit down bang out all of their pre-rolls that they need for a month and two days and then not have to worry about the quality at all because of the protection that pacquiao boveda provides yeah and a term that comes to mind that i hear a lot is consistency um and that's that's what a lot these brands want to deliver because they know in a lot of these markets especially on the east coast where i've been working predominantly it's medicine so uh you know it's if you can the cannabis plant in the flower is not a it's not a pill and it's very volatile and so like you said um you start getting that trichome degradation and you're gonna lose medicinal benefits um and it's like you know going to get your prescription and your short your short two pills and there's an extra one magical pill tossed in there you know it's like you you want to make sure that the product is consistent and delivered same same smell same taste same flavor same effect every time and uh yeah i think i think our our two products definitely can help um in that in that regard absolutely cannabis obviously is a product that affects headspace and if you find something that works for you and you find something that you like you want to make sure that if you buy it again it's going to have the same exact effect uh there's only one way to do that in terms of flour and pre-rolls and that's control the humidity making sure that the product stays the same on day one as it is on day 30 and potentially even out to day 60s so it's important i know that a lot of people that consume cannabis for medical reasons um which there are many that's how this whole industry really started right um they need that they need consistency of dose they need consistency of effect and you can only do that by controlling terpene and humidity content right yup yup there's no doubt about that and then um you know let's another thing that i've been seeing um and sorry this is so salesy just because that's the world that i live in every day is just sales but um you know competition between brands um i i like to think of the cannabis industry as a more friendly um competition uh than any than any other industry that i've been in or or seen where it's you know really we're we're all in this together with one common goal and that's to bring uh relief to a lot of people and liberty to a lot of people um to do what they want with their lives consume what they want and um just not step on anyone else's toes but competition on shelf space um is the pack case boveda combo is that something that people can use to set their their brands apart from others is that can you take these these two common value adds and educate the consumer to say hey i'm gonna my pre-rolls are gonna probably be better in here by the time i get them depending on when they were packaged and you know i'm gonna have an extra two three weeks to go through these um with the boveda pack and then you know i have the pack case forever um these are these are things that consumers care about and are gonna want is that messaging from the consumer is that getting driven to these brands that are making these decisions on packaging yet it's a good question some of the brands who really have a premium focus and a premium attention absolutely they understand that their customers keep coming back to them because their products are so good some of the there's a lot of a lot unfortunate but there's a lot of cannabis companies out there that really don't cater to a premium market um and don't really care about the quality of their products um you know like i said a lot of them are still back in the model of 2016. let's take any leftover [ __ ] that we have let's toss it in a pre-roll put it in the doob tube and just send it whatever happens happens i don't know about you but whenever i consume something that affects headspace uh alcohol cannabis whatever else it may be i always want to make sure that i'm getting something that's quality and consistent um price isn't so much uh a concern of mine right i would much rather pay an extra 20 or 30 bucks to know that uh the quality that i'm getting is there versus having to deal with some [ __ ] for a much cheaper cost i believe that if you're gonna intake something it should only be the the best quality you know it's affecting you like you as yourself not a car not a house you and your health so for me as a consumer i always want to make sure i'm getting high quality and i think that there's a lot of companies that value my sentiment and cater towards a client like me when you have a customer that doesn't you end up with shitty product and that creates a negative loop sure you're going to get the sale once or twice because it's a cheap product but i doubt that person's coming back to you there's no consistency there's no flavor it's all dry harsh smoke it's no good no one likes that yeah and that's i think that's changing too i think as more people get introduced to cannabis i mean we talk about all these people taking baby steps i mean i was down in in florida i had a dispensary doing a visit and i i witnessed what i always knew was going on down there but never had witness for myself which was a woman that looked just like my grandma going into a dispensary for the first time and she has all of her paperwork and she looks at the the person at the front desk and she's kind of you know pretty coy and her her husband's behind her um you know they're just kind of looking around and she goes i'm here to um purchase some marijuana it's so cool to see that but there's so many people that need to be become educated on you know multiple different aspects of cannabis um but it's there's so many new people coming into it and uh that's that's a that's a big piece of the education piece and you know knowing what you're consuming how it's gonna make you feel um you know what you like essentially there are a lot of people figuring out what they like and um you know here in minnesota it's tough for me uh because we don't have um you know like we don't have adult use here so i can't just go in and say hey you know i'm wanting this today and that's uh that's something that a lot of new states are having which is is great um and uh sorry i kind of lost my train of thought here it's all good those are those were always my fate when when i was back at the cannabis company those are always my favorite people you know there were times and days where you know as just a higher level employee at the company uh the dispensary was short-handed so i'd have to go in there and maybe put a quick shift in and just talk to cool people about wheat all day it was honestly not a bad way to uh spend a couple hours outside of my normal role my favorite customers were always the older folks who really had never id any idea they'd walk in they'd always be like hey can i like can i buy some weed yeah and it's like you don't have to whisper it's legal welcome to the cannabis store let me show you what what are you what are you interested in what would you like to try are you interested in smoking something would you like to vape something would you like to try an edible it's always great introducing those people to the entire world something that as an enthusiast we've been living for decades right but i don't want to date myself but [ __ ] it's been a long time um yeah it's it's it's remarkable the clearly the direction of the country the world is totally changing our neighbors up to the north were a lot smarter than we were legalized a lot quicker and look what happened now they have five or six companies in cannabis worth over a billion dollars you ever think that there'd be a unicorn in cannabis now there's five it's insane yep ellen what do you think is i mean comparing the canada to the u.s right now um especially these last couple weeks um just these these larger operators and what what is that what does this mean for cannabis in 2021 um as far as these these bigger companies you know that and you know four or five years ago in the grassroots cannabis movement semi grassroots cannabis movement um you know a lot of it was the the buzz around trade shows in the industry was all these you know these big companies are gonna come in and they're gonna start getting swooped up and the commercialization does cannabis in your opinion cody does it kind of model what happened uh recently this last decade with beer craft beer and you know your big domestic beer is there gonna be a commercial side of cannabis and then also room for the craft cultivator um that's really focused on small quality good stuff um that's gonna be competing against you know price and volume from some of these giants that's a great question the beer model is one that is perfect to use as an analogy um i think myself a lot of these major cannabis companies are swooping up a lot of the smaller ones there's a lot of conglomeration that's going on in the industry obviously when you kind of grow as a company or you want to expand you either need additional growth space which requires additional licensing so a lot of the small guys or the guys that were in quickly did some decent growing started as a startup and made it to mid-sized company those are ideal acquisition targets for the big boys so i think what's going to happen at least the next three four years is that all the big boys are going to start to swoop up a lot of the smaller guys that's where you emerge the budweiser the coors light all the the general high volume lower quality lower price type products from that will come the grassroots movement again so i think everything is going to kind of go underground for a little while and all these craft companies in maybe three four years will start to emerge when people really care about quality and it's not so much about bottom dollar anymore yeah we have a huge canadian client that we love working with when we first started with them they had a huge huge initiative and focus on innovation it was 2018 they had an opportunity to really try and control the market with an innovative awesome product uh cost was no object they said [ __ ] it we want the coolest best highest quality product that we can provide and it worked out great for them they quickly jumped into one of the leaders positions in the industry in canada and everything was was great it towards the end of 2019 and then with uh early covid uh early 2020 uh their share price fell dramatically they were you know their balance sheets showed that they were just outlaying cash left and right for the innovation without necessarily realizing that when you spend so much on innovation it takes a long time for it to come back right roi on innovation is a year year and a half process minimum for us for example you know we started designing jpeg trio in 2018 it didn't get launched until you know mid 2019 it took 12 16 months 18 months to get the product out there so with this cannabis company even though they were so amazingly focused on innovation for the first part once legalization happened now they realize that it's all about bottom dollar and how do we reduce cost of goods so now instead of trying to produce flowers that may be tastier but take an extra two weeks now they're producing lower quality genetics that harvest faster that they can just turn around and sell and cheaper packaging and i think that's now the start of where you see the the budweiser and the the coors lights versus like uh you know a small batch brewing company really focused on delivering a delicious tasty product i mean one has consistency one has flavor yup but you know which would you prefer to drink budweiser or the the local craft beer pretty easy decision in my opinion yeah well for me too it's a time and place thing sometimes uh you know being from minnesota and uh going up to the cabin a busch light just kind of brings you back you know i love those you mean can't hate on that i'm a big coors guy i went to school in colorado spent a few years in co i love course especially like any tailgate absolutely but then you know you're trying to drink 16 18 beers potentially and really have yourself an afternoon that's not so much the case when you're drinking something that's a little bit tastier and perhaps next to a steak and maybe you're gonna have one or two very different days though the pairing is everything bingo and the season two i'm a big seasoned guy when it comes to those things absolutely you brought up uh i don't know how much time we have here ramsay um but you brought up uh kovid um how do you think that's been um impacting i guess pros and cons um your guys customers people you've been working with um you know if i can touch briefly i can just say what i've noticed is um i think a lot of these quality things sops standard practices best practices a lot of these procedural things are starting to really get drilled into um on paper and people are starting to like really figure their their [ __ ] out um and that's i think making a little bit extra room for products and services that focus on true value-add and um you know roi that you know we can bovada specifically too can can really tell you hey your flower your inventory your entire inventory weighs this today um and here's the percent moisture content um if you added two percent moisture content to that entire inventory here's the literal change in fair market value of your inventory i think those things now it's not it's not everything's not moving so fast where it's hey package it get it you know it doesn't matter if it cures on the shelf whatever we just we got to get it in stores because we don't have any and people are buying it anyway um i think covid kind of or the lockdown specifically um kind of help people really look at their what they're doing their day-to-day operations and where they can make changes have you guys noticed that too absolutely it gave you know business operators a chance to sit back and not be surrounded by the buzz of a hopping office and they actually had a few moments to think about like hey what can we do better what can we do to improve like our everything our process is top to bottom from growing the production of packaging to sales yeah um what's interesting is that you know this is what makes me happy is that a lot of the country deemed cannabis in a central industry um okay would you ever have been able to imagine that 10 years ago probably not i mean even back in 2014 but government said hey people need cannabis especially in california and all the cannabis companies stayed open so i think having those cannabis restrictions that got imposed on everybody required all these business operators to really sit back and understand how can we do things more efficiently because [ __ ] i used to run my growing operation with 40 people well now i can only have 15 in the building so how are we still going to manage the same output but with less than half of the labor staff forces you to sit back and really think about what you're doing and if you guys are cutting short you know corners trying to take a shortcut when that's not necessarily the best thing to do or neces or even necessary you know small little changes in process like adding a movita pack into your curing box can potentially generate an extra 300 000 a year for a mid-sized cannabis company it's substantial and that tiny little you know how much could that really end up costing you a couple thousand dollars over the course of a year when you can end up you know that can let you back a couple hundred thousand so a lot of these guys with cannabis you just you've been running and like you you ever try and get on a treadmill when it's set at 10 you there's no warm-up time you just have to get down and start sprinting yeah college a couple times yeah i'm not sure if those ended well but that's that's what working in a cannabis company is like the moment that your product goes out the door for the first time it's off to the races you have now an endless uh endless demand for your product and you have to continuously handle that that with good supply um and they don't haven't had a lot of time to think about it as soon as they got on that treadmill it's just off to the races full sprint covent gave them a chance to sit back take a second step off the treadmill and try and figure out what they should actually be doing yeah i completely agree um definitely notice that as well on our end um all right cody uh what's next for paccase great question we have a couple cool new packaging products coming out but that's not really what what tickles me i get very excited about the consumer market i love bringing products to people that will actually use it so we have a really awesome new case that should be launching the next five six months uh think jpac an iphone had a baby that's about all i can touch on it yeah well that's uh that's intriguing um because i think i think i know where that's going um don't wanna don't want to speculate too much but um and where can you pick these up so i know you said amazon um i know you guys have uh point of purchase displays too so i'm assuming that it's this is getting into more mass retail absolutely yeah we uh we sell in a couple different places you can go out and check uh jpac products out on amazon number one uh our shopping website packcase.com i'm sorry packcase.shop you can get there from packcase.com as well um and now they're we're starting to be available in retailers so there's a whole bunch of distributors starting to pick these up so you should start seeing them in retail stores over the next few months and if you're a retailer and interested in picking up our products we have a wonderful wholesale section on paccase.shop so make sure to stop there put in a little vendor request and we'll make sure to get to you so you guys can start selling pack cases yourself cool cool yeah same thing for boveda um we're on amazon we're in the retail stores uh we have a direct site businesses we have a wholesale site too um yeah you guys go out there up your pre-roll game if you get it in a cardboard box and it's uh they're dry grab yourself a pack case throw above it in there let it sit for 24 hours your experience will be completely different than smoking a dry pre-roll nobody wants to do that anymore so let's change that [Music] you", "7lqkReXMrh0": "I need to say this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or you have a medical marijuana card like I actually do myself I don't wanna show you my personal information hi yo what's up guys Ronnie really back at juice I would know this frame review for you guys in this video it's been a minute since I did a any strain review video or anything like this so um if you guys want to see more of these videos let me know down below in the comments and I'll definitely get him out because you know I like doing these videos but um I wasn't even planning on doing this review or then I was just thinking like I haven't done a review of eating I know why I said [ __ ] it why not these are pretty cool so let me do every one them so I got um two packs of these um dutchy pretty rolls but they actually called them um and it is cigarettes so um I don't know I just thought these are pretty cool because ever since I was like young and I first started smoking weed I always like at least for me was like always a dream like the day that I'd be able to like walk until I can Circle K or you know I don't know if you have support cases where you guys live a gas station you wanna me and I like buy a packet like cigarettes but like weed cigarettes and then I mean so we finally got some cannabis cigarettes so that's pretty lit in my opinion um but yeah I got this mo dispensary go ahead and get them from a [ __ ] gas station or nothin but still [ __ ] lit what hopefully one day they'll be gas stations but this video will be reviewing the Northern Lights one if you guys want to see a review on the purplish green let me know down below in the comments and I'll get back to ya and that's my stupid fire concentrate it's right now so if you guys want to see a wax review let me know down below in the comments and I'll get that out too but yeah let's just hop into this so duchies Northern Lights cannabis cigarettes basically just pre-rolls but they're [ __ ] on fire but yeah let's go over the pathogen real quick so this is the front of it pretty basic pretty simple but it's [ __ ] I don't know it gets the point across and it's the open enemy and so it says duchies right there Northern Lights obviously it's the indica made with 100% but source from premium genetics and then it comes with six potent 0.5 mm cannabis cigarettes and Isis keep it keep out of reach of children yeah 6.5 pre-rolls in the back of it just says Northern Lights as a pure indica and is arguably the most famous strain in the world yeah that's definitely one of the most famous strains so that's the back of it pretty plain and simple and in the side of the box has had the Arizona Department of California this side just has some other warning on it nothing else crazy yeah these road forty-four dollars plus tax but they actually that's a little bit expensive in my opinion for like six point five three rolls that's like three grams three grams for 45 bucks that's a little bit expense that's not expensive but on the pricey side you know what I mean um I've got these when everybody won't get one free so I paid 45 bucks for two of them I'm still like $22 each so can't complain I paid about 20 bucks for this I don't know if I would pay that full price 45 bucks for them that's a little bit pricey maybe if I needed something convene I was going on with the trip was something I'm one of them maybe I would but like just done like the everyday occasion I don't think I really see myself kicking these up too often but they are really sick so I already smoked five of these they only have one left for you guys so you open it up it comes in these little bags or this little bag and it's to keep it fresh I'm pretty sure oh I didn't notice that this is just now but I guess it comes with a sticker I don't know how I missed that but yeah that's pretty cool I'm so a little sticker mm-hmm yes that's kind of cool so you can like kinda it says Northern Lights all the time in because you can like try out all the flavors and like make a little collection wall I don't know do something cool don't mean that I mean but they normally it comes in a purple bag I'm assuming for this indica I guess it's the tables would probably come in like a yellow bag or something I don't know the only meaning so we got one to one and they're normally they'll be like if you if it's a fresh pack so I haven't opened this one yet so I'm gonna open this in the next review so you see what it's like when I open a fresh new sealed box you see I'm saying completely schools so there'll be 6/6 ones in that one but this one only has one left let's multiply already but you take it out a little small but it's hey let's [ __ ] pack completely tight in there so my first time taking these out I was like kind of thinking like them like these are kind of small you and I mean I don't know if they're gonna be like they're gonna do me like that they're gonna really give me the lid off for just like one y'all know saying but they not they actually do you just this oh oh yeah they probably like one of the most potent pre-rolls i've ever had they're also um really packed like they packed perfect when you select even though this is only make point 5 and it's like pretty small it's gonna burn for about oh it's gonna burn for about 10 minutes or so so it's [ __ ] fire yeah so this is the pre-roll give you guys one more look at it and then the crutch even has their little logo in it so that's kind of cool yeah that's the joint nothing else really to it um I forget all the top of my head what this was tested at but I want to say it was about 24% 25% but I lost the sticker sorry yeah let's just get into smoking this now if you guys are smoking along I forgot a lighter I think I got one so yeah a soft bunch of this now though hope you guys are smoking long hope you guys are smoking something dank and if you guys are cheers let's get it so dogs in the background I don't know if you hear that let's get it shoes all right so yeah this is [ __ ] fire you can see already and just burn them pretty perfect not running nothing at all so the taste on this is like so far you can tell us that you can definitely tell us made from straight yo my buds they're not using the trim and no [ __ ] like a lot of pre-roll is doing on I mean definitely some fire and this a pre-roll that thing has a pungent like Northern Light stage like um definitely like that classic indica pungent like skunky taste um definitely fire now like and like I said before like these things like these joints even though they're so small they burn for a minute and they burn perfect like you see that [ __ ] like it's I never really look at the ash till just now the ash is not the best color you want to see one smoking a joint but I have seen a lot worse so that's not I don't know let me know what you guys think about ash down below in the comments but you can see how it's smoking it's not running at all smoking pretty much perfect you know I mean like perfect the taste them like it just has like a pungent funky taste like nothing like too crazy like the taste isn't like too good I mean it tastes fire it tastes like some fire bud like that I thought if I roll up a joint myself it would taste better than this but I don't know if it really all depends I don't know it's just personal preference and it all depends I don't know I haven't really smoked flour too much I smoked many concentrates no but he's good but not like what I remember you know I mean but it's definitely definitely has that classic identity that Classica indica like you mean like you see me stuttering over my words a little bit definitely getting kind of tired relaxing yeah just classic indicate indica high so let me go over the raisins but I'll read this real quick usually in these reviews I do like five riddance log over the package in that age the smoke the high the price point not like give like an overall review so um the packaging I thought this packaging was pretty cool it's just I got a little like a cigarette box but like a [ __ ] for a week I mean so it's pretty [ __ ] dope I thought it was lit I like the concept but like I like the idea behind it so um I give it a four point five out of five I just feel like they could have added like a little bit more information about the strange like that on the box because it doesn't really say too much about the strain or any information at all you know - but it says Northern Lights and that's it but besides for that I thought the pack pretty dope so let me know what you guys thought of it down below in the comments and if you disagree with me or you're with me on any of these just let me know down below in the comments but the taste on this um they gave like a four out of five I think that's pretty accurate because like I said it's not the for a pre-roll it's [ __ ] fire a secret age for super tasty um like on for a pre-roll it's like top notch but I feel like if I just bought some top-notch flower like a Potter 8th for 45 and rolled my own joint it probably tastes better than this and if you're fatter than this you know what I mean but it's fire for sure the smoke they looked the way it smokes you guys seen like this thing rips like you know some of those pre-rolls dispensaries are giving you they don't even brown right don't hit right yeah but this burns like perfect all the way down to the grudge this smokes like it his [ __ ] yeah you guys been seeing so this the way it smokes I give it a 5 out of 5 because it's like it's ripping you out I mean you should smack him the high the high is up there but I got kind of stuck between a four and a 4.5 out of 5 so I gave it like a four point two out of five because it's [ __ ] fired but like I said I definitely had some more to fire like for 45 bucks I feel like I could get like a way far like a way better eighth the only mean I roll my own [ __ ] so I feel like they're paying more for like the package and just like that the looks initiated this static of it you know I mean but it's definitely fired the next thing was um yes I'll give it like a four point two out of five for the high the price point I gave like a four out of five it's a little bit pricey for something like I hit like three grams applied for 45 bucks it's a little bit pricey but like if you're going off like if you need something convenient like it going on a trip or something like that that's [ __ ] a good option for you because I mean they're [ __ ] they're really good they they're coat when they burn [ __ ] perfect this you guys see I mean everything about them is good but they're just a little bit pricey so come if you don't mind paying a little bit sure I guess I go for it but me I couldn't see myself on them unless I was like going on a trip and I or I needed something convenient everybody sneaky use some [ __ ] I mean because I feel like I think I got that I already said I can definitely get away far for $45 and roll my own [ __ ] but if you don't know how to roll I guess over these or something but the price point I need like a four out of five so that makes the overall rating about like a four out of five but um these are definitely fired so if you ever see them in your area duchies that she's pretty rose that can we pick him up and try them out um if they're having the buy one get one free deal definitely pick him up and try him out place uh 20 bucks for three grams can't go wrong as fired like this video and want to see more reviews I'm gonna down below in the comments and if you want to see a review on these on [ __ ] dream big rolls there's something I'm going to comments to I'll get that out and add some like fireworks I could do every review on so let me know down below in the comments if you like doing some more review videos again but so much for that thumbs up comment like subscribe do all that good [ __ ] you're gonna count with you Mitch Enron you're a so", "Oi1RwMRf-s0": "everybody we are back one other view and today we got another honey puff joint and this is the pre rolled transparent cone brought to you by honey puffs so without further ado let's hop right into this review so we got the honey puff logo we got the Rasta guy slow-burning on his tongue two of these cones are in the tube and these are cherry flavored which is kind of neat because these actually did have a really strong flavor to them but we'll get into that in a second so let's get the the pack popped open and see what we got on the inside here now they do give it to you in this little test tube which is kind of cool how it's a nice crushproof container I do like that a lot of the other brands they give you the you know the Platt the not the plastic the paper ones and they basically can get crushed really easily and I do know that the biodegradable factor this that in the other and I know this is just basically trash so be sure to recycle this stuff when you're done using this little tube toss in a recycling bin or or repurpose it and use it for traveling for other joint for other J's and whatnot but definitely don't just toss it you know in the trash I mean we got more wasteful products here we got the straws so that is my complaint about these foreign brands a lot of them cut corners to the point where all the packaging is just kind of wasteful but yeah the let's see what else we got on here we got some watt walkie text check that out you can't even read it from when they heat sealed all this honey puff usa.com Brandon design of the USA paper made in Europe packaging made in the People's Republic of China this product is absolutely only to be used with legal non tobacco smoke wind herbs such as Tribe Buddha's blend bulldog or single herbs such as passion flower that's a mouthful of nonsense I could tell you that only legal herbs you should be putting in this puppy is this so you got the cone here itself it has the feel the paper the paper that the the cellulose paper that they chose it has the same feel as like the elata elata cellulose papers it's not a super thick one it's not a super thin one but it's definitely got a feel to it and you got the nice tip there which actually is pretty decent it's got a nice little w in there which is cool that's gonna stop a lot of the really finely ground particulate from getting into your mouth no it did have a cherry flavor which is kind of a nice little touch especially when we just did our hemp wrap Throwdown last week and we talked about how that kind of the intense flavors are really for more so than masking properties not so much as a complimentary I would more so think like the like for example last week how we did the the hemp wrap plane with the CBD that kind of is like more of like an enhancement the CBD plus is more of like an enhancement this is more just as like a flavor to kind of do a little bit of a cover up for you but needless to say we got the one and a quarter sized cone here which is kind of neat because it's a little shorty which is good I like the king size counts too but this one we did we tried to do a little quick smoke just to do a nice little review on these but again it smoked all right the tips who knows what's in there you can clearly see that there is some red one of the sides of the paper has red red ink on it along with the little cherries on the outside we don't know if it's soy ink or not we don't know what kind of preparations went into the you know the dyeing of this paper or the tie or the paper itself if it's bleached by paper or what it is basically so we don't really know if any of the chemicals are gonna leach off in the smoke when we actually do end up burning this but needless to say if you're only doing this one or two times the flavor itself was strong enough to mask it the nastiest of herbs that you got that you're packing in here but it does hold a pretty decent amount you can almost get like two to basically two-thirds to three-quarters of a gram into this thing if you pack it right grind it up layer it and pack it in there properly you can get a really nice long smoke out of this definitely not a king size but definitely nice short smoke so if you like flavored papers definitely give these clear cones a try I don't know particularly honey puff is the one you would want to try first but I would compare them to the potency of flavor of like a Juicy J it definitely has the intensity flavor like a Juicy J would have it's definitely not subtle so you want to cover it up try out one of these honey puffs trans parent cones if you liked this review give it a thumbs up for more content like this subscribe for more I do smoke and reviews every single day so be on the lookout for that and have a great rest your day", "YyeYeKGCpD8": "[Music] we'll then start by initially going very slowly and turning machine up and as you do this you'll start to hear a little bit of electronic sound initially coming to machine as you can see here we're starting a very low vibration and building up that you can see here the butter medium setting with the machine this tends to be the area in which beetles start loading a lot more material in and working that material this is going to start initially packing down and vibrating that material in there now if you start to have an issue with things floating at the top and not packing down properly there's a nice convenient function of this machine which is at the high function as you start turning it up the vibrational difference and what we're doing here this will initially have your product vibrating on top and sync it down that knowing that it can't over pack your free rolls if you have so much waited product on the top so always staying conscious of how much material you're working with at all times will keep your p rolls from being over packed or under packed and occasion from here if I feel comfortable enough with my three roles in pack I will turn the Machine down and off to this low-end all function for safety purposes you can't turn the Machine off as well afterwards so I'm just gonna be moving this machine up to a very good tampering speed here to where we can actually start introducing the product and three rolls I'm not looking for an aggressive speed by any means just something very light to make a nice movement on there and as you can hear that's kind of the sound we're looking for on this very light as I'm moving my material into this I'm stirring it maintaining a good consistency of product if it separates with the Keith on the bottom there and we started getting a lot of big material on top it can make for a very uneven pack and it will make it a very major struggle for you as far as getting all of your joints evenly packed as you so desire as we're going through this and getting an even pack you can see that not many of these are vibrating and moving which is meaning that they're not sinking into the pre-roll any further than what we have it so this is when we're going to step up the motor a little bit and see if it can sink them in as you can see they're starting to rotate further and further and the center ones are starting to have a much more dense pack we want to make sure every single one of these pre rolls is capable of moving on its own to get the pack we so desire I'm not pushing these in by any means but slowly rushing them over across from each other and as you can see a lot of the seeds and the stems are pushing their way to the top through this vibration to do one last finishing product I am going to give it a high volt and as you can see they sunk at his best it good there from there I feel rather confident in my pack and I'm really curious to see where these pre-roll sets so I'm going to unscrew my locking screws here out of convenience and just keeping your parts and pieces together again I highly recommend just keeping these with the tray if you have a container next to you or anything else like that feel free to put the locking nuts in there however do not worry about the washer so much yet until we get this top tray out the top tray I'm gonna move on over to a reclaim Abul bucket over here in which this product is completely viable and ready to go for another run or any other process that you're wishing to do we can set it down here or a nice easy way to get these out is make sure you grab your washers set it aside and tip it upside down as you can see here all these are kind of full still so you can proceed to give them a tap and go forward some of these may be rather densely packed in there so I highly recommend having a ballpoint pen or even metallic chopsticks is actually a very useful tool we use around here as you can see we're ready to go and the material is packed and ready to go right there for another run or whatever you desire to do with it from here I'm gonna be taking out the base the bottom tray pulling it out making sure I'm not hitting any of the pre rolls we're gonna look at those crunches just to make sure and see how even those are going down on the bottom making sure that all our papers are completely even the same size now different papers are gonna have different specifications as far as their tolerances go and being made manufactured so keeping that in mind when we're working with these can give us a lot of different variables so now that the machine is not going to prevent that from here we press down and as we see here before us all our papers are pushed up and forward and ready to go from here they're gonna need a pack as well as a fold on them depending how you like your product you may need to insert a tiny bit more material in one or take out other material and others but then 10% variable is what we're saying with our machine here and you're next a little free roll", "sINnYmma-9s": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary today is a classic ass episode which means edible review but this is not a company that is new to us but it is new to us in the world of edibles uh that is because it's from moxie the folks over at moxie uh we've actually reviewed a few products from them um i know we've done a couple of carts and live resin where they have a different branding mx by moxie there but now they are in the edibles game with the classic cannabis infused gummy uh it seems like if you are a weed company and you want to branch out from whatever your starting project product is you go gummies and that's what looks like it's happening with moxie uh this packaging is pretty uh nice it's uh kind of like a aluminum can little puck here uh pretty substantial actually uh this little tin is not cheap i'm sure uh but you got all the stuff you want to see on it uh we've got our lab testing results here on the side uh and then we've got uh our dosage instructions which these are uh 10 milligram gummies they're 10 10 milligram gummies in here for 100 milligrams in total uh and these gummies cost me 17 bucks at my dispensary which puts them at the ever so slightly above average price point for a 100 milligram gummy in my neck of the woods uh it does say on here that uh moxie has won 90 plus industry awards neat uh i always find those things to be more annoying than edifying or clarifying uh if you're not gonna tell us what awards you've won uh why should i believe you anyways uh we need some more uh you know packaging regulations here but uh that's neither here nor there let's get to the moxie good stuff i did not actually mention what flavor this is it is the member berry flavor or strain i guess i didn't realize there was a member berry strain before this it does show member berries on there uh i don't know what k i assume member barry got its name from the south park episode which minor rant here boy south park uh on the air for 24 seasons now i remember back when people were making jokes about the simpsons getting along in the tooth back around it's like 15th 16th 17th season uh and now we here we are with south park uh at its 24th season i think there was even a time where south park mocked the simpsons for being uh so long in the tooth that is not to knock south park it's just crazy how long actually and resilient that show has been around anyways member berries uh i don't actually have never seen the episode i don't really watch south park anymore still appreciate what those fine folks do but um i do remember hearing on the internet for about 24 hours people saying remember when a member something like that remember barry who knows uh i assume it tastes just like berries uh let's go ahead and get into this edible here this is 17 thing of gummies uh with my experiences with moxie have been good uh nothing to write a home about like um totally fine makers of cartridges uh and i've had some of their wax before too in non-cartridge form and found it to be totally unobjectionable uh nothing stand out but nothing uh to be suspicious of either all right well here is our here are our gummies rather got a little moxie logo on them uh 10 gummies in there i i guess the idea that every gummy has to be five milligrams everything has to be five milligrams is becoming irrelevant that was a law but i see everything lots of things now uh packaged as 10 milligrams so uh getting lax cool shut up siri she keeps thinking i'm talking to her uh anyways here is our moxie member berry let's give this a shot hmm wow very pleasant very pleasant starting taste um kind of a chewier gummy i don't really need to tell you what a gummy gummy's gonna taste like it's pretty fruity to start uh but there is actually a very strong cannabis aftertaste i mean it's not grotesque most gummies don't get uh offensively bad you've got enough sugar in there to mask the taste but there is a pretty strong weed aftertaste here so if you are very sensitive to it watch out fine for the first two or three seconds and then there it is actually about five alarm weed taste there you got a couple of seconds uh before it really hits you wow that is powerful that is one of the uh more weedy tasting gummies that i've had uh in some time i wonder how they infused uh if they did something different it looks like uh same process as far as i can tell just a very strong weed taste uh that does make me a little optimistic that these are gonna be pretty potent uh there's not necessarily a total correlation between oh well somebody just subscribed apparently that's what that noise was um there's not always a correlation between taste and potency but there sometimes is so fingers crossed that these member berries are going to be as potent as we hope uh for me guys i am gonna eat all 10 of these it's probably going to take me oh i'm going to do over the next half hour 45 minutes or so and then 90 minutes two hours after i have that last one i'll come right back here and let you guys know the most important part about the edible review is it gonna get you high and i've got really really high hopes no pun intended for these with that aftertaste until then guys thanks for sticking around we'll see you right back here in just a bit oh there it is bye welcome back to wheats guys it has been about uh just over two hours since i had my first member berry uh cannabis infused gummy from moxie and that is a really sticky inside of a container there a lot of residue anytime i'm talking about residue it means i'm pretty high uh so these are pretty good gummies these are um i would say um on the good end of average the high end of average they're uh good not outstanding not the absolute best i've ever had uh not the best test tasting gummies by a long shot but they are certainly going to get the job done uh for anybody who is familiar with 100 milligram edibles um 100 milligram gummies uh if they work for you these are going to do the job they are just a total uh thumbs up in terms of quality uh really the only thing to talk about here uh is gonna be the taste and price uh the taste didn't offend me that much uh i quite used to a pretty bitter cannabis aftertaste and uh there was that potency you want with the with that uh taste but it is a stronger cannabis aftertaste if you're looking for gummies with no weed taste these aren't for you uh and that these were the only other thing to mention is that these weren't the cheapest gummies these aren't the cheapest gummies available at my dispensary um so i would not necessarily buy these myself because i know that i can get just as good of a gummy for a cheaper price at my dispensary say a um punch edibles or a buddha's best they have a couple of different gummies at a i at my place for sometimes uh like five bucks cheaper than these so that is a thing to consider uh it really is just going to depend on the price at your dispensary because there is nothing again in this package that's going to say uh it's worth a premium over any other gummy um but you know totally perfunctory and good i'd say these moxie may not have moxie but they have gumption gumption what a weird word speaking of gumption no speaking of moxie let's do a little cherry on top we're gonna do something with some real moxie uh and cherry on tops by the way anytime we have a review that we like we like to give a little something extra that's not weed related uh and let's do something with as i said somebody with some moxie now normally i have a policy i don't like to uh give any cherry on tops for anything that i've actually finished uh because you know i like to it's a wheat thing we we do the entire experience but i've been enjoying this book so much i'm confident that even though i've only got about a uh i don't know a couple dozen pages or so left to go i'm confident that i'm still uh if enjoyed enough to give it my recommendation and that book is a nonfiction book by the author maria konokova uh former writer for the new yorker called the biggest bluff uh she is a fantastic writer and a psychology phd from harvard uh who uh decided to take a break from writing and instead uh spend a year training to become a poker champ after having never played poker uh she just decides that she wants to see what it's all about but really it's a book about how to make good decisions how to avoid making bad decisions why poker is a good analog for decision making it's a pretty fascinating stuff she's an excellent writer it's a really cool concept again the book is the biggest bluff by maria konakova uh that is an excellent book from an author who has a lot of moxie and somebody who has a little bit of moxie is moxie and their member um edible i almost forgot that's what we were talking about but that is what we were here for pretty good from them really good from maria and that guys is gonna do it for everything here on wheats until we see you for our next review or whatever it is stay high more importantly stay healthy we'll see you then goodbye", "XWaaVYuPs_M": "hi there how are you i hope everything is amazing because today we are going to try some moonwalker delta eight they came out with two brand new flavors and i've already tried them they're freaking delicious i put them back in their boxes just for show i'm gonna take them right back out moonwalker if you're not familiar it's a delta eight company they make um vape cartridges so i have a couple of those over here as well so they do vape cartridges and gummies and uh they just released these two new flavors of gummies and two new flavors of vape cart so they have four of each now and uh they're freaking delicious but i figured before we jumped into it um i would kind we should kind of maybe go over a couple things maybe we should take one real quick so this is the sour strawberry this one is phobos and it is 25 milligrams per gummy delta 8 is about 60 as psychoactive as delta 9. so if you were to kind of compare this to a delta 9 gummy you'd be looking at about a 15 milligram delta 9. the delta 9 is typically what you smoke that is what you are all aware of for the most part i feel like unless you're living under a rock then you've definitely heard of just weed weed delta 9 is federally illegal although some states have uh adopted it to be legal that was the weirdest way of saying that but to some states it's legal in i'm luckily in one of those states that it is fully legal you can grow you can buy it recreational medicinally yeah it's really cool i love it sorry to brag on there for a second but um delta h now this is different so to get all sciency about it delta nine has a double bond on the ninth carbon chain where you can see that delta eight would have a double bond on the eighth carbon chain that one minuscule difference does make an entire world of difference and how it interacts within your body so the way delta nine works is that it works really well with the cb1 receptors in your endocannabinoid system so we have that within our body the cb1 receptors are a bit more um geared for giving you a body and a brain high when combined with the delta nine so that's why you kind of feel like your body maybe you feel a little bit more floaty you feel like your head is a little bit foggy but you're getting that maybe we should talk about the negative side effects as well real quick so you're getting that high and and i love it and i love cannabis and um i will never give up my delta nine but you do get a bit of like a foggier high and if you're smoking sativa and you have a sativa strain um if you're not familiar is a really amazing daytime strain as it typically ramps you up or an indica strain is going to kind of let a really awesome nighttime strain ramp you down so a sativa strain also can exacerbate certain symptoms like anxiety depression just like overall nervousness and i find that it does do that for me so i don't typically smoke sativa during the day because i have that kind of a negative side effect with it whereas indica i do love to smoke indica it is my primary flower that i enjoy but uh it tends to relax you bring you down and can cause laziness couch locks sleepiness just overall on not being as productive as you may want to be and i don't necessarily want to smoke and then just become a potato i want to be able to um continue to enjoy my day so that is kind of where delta eight comes in delta eight being the double bond on the eighth carbon chain and it reacting to your cb two receptors within your body gives you a different feeling it is definitely a more clear headed high you don't get that anxiety uh that sativa does end up causing because it doesn't have that kind of receptor it doesn't have that kind of chemical makeup and how it interacts with your body now of course we are all different humans delta 9 thc will react differently for one person than it does to the next you know some people can smoke a whole lot while others can only smoke a little bit and they never have like an increase of need some people love sativa and they they smoke it and then they are like the most productive person throughout the entire day another person is having an internal panic attack while doing it so it is still a bit experimental and i do want to urge you guys to do research figure out what is best for you start small ask family or friends you know maybe even have somebody there with you if you do want to try it for the very first time delta 8 is just different so being that it reacts differently within your body combining with the cb2 receptors and having a different chemical makeup of course you're going to have an entirely different experience with it i think a lot of people are just expecting it to be the same as weed just lower and it's not it's just it's simply not because it's totally different it does give you that high but it gives you that it's just a clear-headed calm high you don't get that anxiety inducing like panic when it starts to creep up you just you kind of feel it creep up and then you just feel wusa so that's what we're going to do i'm going to eat a gummy and then continue on with my day and come back in an hour or a couple hours and we'll kind of talk about and see the effects and everything that i'm feeling while i'm feeling it so that um we have the most accurate representation of what this is so this one here is phobos i love this one this one is sour strawberry they had it limited edition and it sold out in like 48 hours so then they did a poll moonwalker did a poll on their instagram should we make it a permanent flavor and it was an overwhelming resounding yes so they did bring it back as a permanent flavor and then they came out with a second flavor which is actually my all-time favorite so this one is hyperion and it is a mango kush now with these there's there's no difference between the four different flavors that they have um they also have that blueberry one i think it's called blue dream euphoria and then they also have the watermelon skittles one and uh there's no difference between each of the battles they're all 625 milligrams total or 25 milligrams per gummy within the battles there's no difference as far as strains go delta 8 is still so new i don't even know necessarily if there needs to be any difference in strains ever because it gives you just like that very specific kind of high that's what it looks like it's just a little cube like a sugar coated cube and uh mango kush oh my god this one is so good yeah the only difference between the four is the flavor so you're gonna get the same effect so you just find the flavor that you love the most so before that kicks in let's talk about some pros and cons this is important that we talk about everything i don't want you guys to go into this blind i want you to have a very good understanding of what to expect so um most important or the i guess the number one question would be is it legal and the answer is yes it is federally legal here in the united states there are some states that have decided to outlaw it where you can't get it shipped to you and i apologize i'll put those dates down below in the description box hopefully they kind of get on board soon but from what i'm understanding is that um and this is the con part of it those states that have chosen not to legalize it may have done so because there's just not enough research yet uh to back it and not enough um checks and balances in place to make sure that every company on the market that is trying to come out with a delta 8 product so rapidly fast is doing it in a safe manner that is going to protect their citizens and i love that they did that but i also kind of hate that they did that because i feel bad that you can get your hands on this or be able to vet out your own good company so moonwalker i'm going to go out there and say that this is the number one delta eight company on the market they do have third party lab testing done and they do have those lab results on their website but they also have test results if you go ahead and scan this code that's on the back of all of their products so they have it on the back of their cartridges as well as on here there's no additives fillers there's no chemicals that are going to harm you and then it's also going to give you the breakdown of the delta 8 and the delta 9 and the percentages and all of that stuff so um yes it is legal a lot of it is a little bit still in this gray area of is it safe for you i would say to vet out the companies that you're going to be purchasing from as a consumer you are tasked yourself also to make responsible consuming decisions as well as on the company's behalf it is important for them to be honest about their product now like i said with moonwalker it is the leading brand of delta eight on the market i have been using them now for a few months three four months i've never had any negative side effect my husband absolutely loves them i've not had a single other person tell me that they've had any sort of a negative side effect with moonwalker and i have given it to a lot of people live i have shared with a lot of people another pro being that uh it's amazing for the daytime i do i can't really smoke too much during the day uh sativa like i said before kind of ramps up my anxiety whereas if i take one gummy during the day my anxiety does not ramp up i still remain productive but i feel elevated i feel happier which i know is something that a lot of people don't want to necessarily talk about that this actually makes you a happier or a better person but in my reality it does especially when i'm having hormonal mood swings when i'm having ups and downs due to seasonal weather and seasonal depression it lifts me out of that fog and it makes me a happier person let's see another con it's honestly it is hard for me to come up with cons for this con number two if you take too much it's gonna make you sleepy so i take one during the day the sativa it kind of has a sativa ish effect where i feel elevated but i'm still very clear-headed and productive but i don't have that anxiety trigger that sativa will oftentimes give me but i take two at night and i get even more elevated but to a point where i'm starting to get sleepy and i'm able to fall asleep easier it doesn't necessarily make me sleepy but it allows me to fall asleep a lot easier and it allows me to stay asleep longer so i've been loving it honestly loving it for that oh another frequently asked question is is it the same as or different from cbd it is totally different it does come from the same plant but cbd again is a different cannabinoid on that plant it's going to bond to your receptors within your endocannabinoid therapy system differently cbd is not going to get you a high at all but it is going to have a lot of those types of calming restorative effects oh okay so this next one could be a pro oricon it does increase your appetite so i do find myself a little bit more snacky when i have my delta eight as opposed to a traditional weed delta nine but if you're looking to increase your appetite reduce your nausea then this is definitely going to be it for you if you are on a weight loss journey you need to practice some self-control and you need to get those snacks out of your house because you will definitely eat them okay i am going to go away for a little bit and then i'll come back when uh it's taking effect and i'm gonna time it it's already 10 45 in the morning um let's see i took it about 15 minutes ago now so yeah we'll time that and i'll be back soon so the gummy hit while i was filming another video um probably good because i kind of got a little bit more oomph in me to keep going and i was actually quite afraid of this color that i'm putting in my hair right now and now i feel kind of excited and chill about it but it took about 50 minutes on the button for me to feel it and right now it is still rising a little bit by a little bit before it plateaus so i think that in about another 15 minutes i'm gonna feel totally golden and uh i have more stuff i got to get done today so okay hi just doing a little quick check-in it is now one o'clock i did two loads of laundry i filmed a whole other video dyed my hair purple and i'm about to go finish editing a video that i need to upload tomorrow and post it over on my patreon so so far it's been fairly productive but i think first i need lunch because the munchies hit and i'm freaking starving i don't know if you guys can tell it's this is a very cohesive calm i feel like i have a lot of energy and i feel like i'm talking really fast and maybe i am but i feel calm and i feel happy and i'm and excited and i just changed in front of my window and there's this dude trimming this tree out here from the power company or whatnot but he managed to not turn around while i was changing i think it's a female yeah i just i kind of feel like i can just go get done so i'm gonna do that and i have about another hour and a half before i gotta head out and i've kind of timed it i know that these last about four or four and a half hours for me and i kind of timed it so that it would be worn off before i need to head out because i do not condone driving under the influence of anything please it's not funny it's not fun and it's not safe that's me momming you guys for a second i'll see you soon okay now it is 1 37 and i feel like i'm starting to slowly come down from it right now i'm still very energetic and still in such a damn good mood and i don't feel like i got lethargic that i got unfocused or anything along those lines even yet if a police officer was to knock on my front door right now i feel like i would very well be able to handle that conversation yeah i just overall i feel really good so i thought there was a couple interesting things that i read on this as well so i just wanted to point out that each of the gummies is only 15 calories and 2 grams of total sugars they are completely vegan as well which i know is a huge deal when you're dealing with gummies there's a lot of vegetarians and vegans out there that are not going to touch gummies generally because they typically not vegan so i thought this was really really cool and then um i kind of wanted to do just a quick hit off of one of these or maybe both of these cartridges so they have two new carts that came out this one is telesto and it is a orange chem dog and it does have the 800 milligrams of delta eight thc natural terpenes and natural flavor in here they come in this container that you have to child proof lock it but they oh and it's glass by the way um but they come very clear and then you can see the bubble in there but when you tip it the bubble is it's not moving so it's a pretty thick consistency they don't clog like almost ever which i have a huge problem with carts clogging moonwalker also sells this which is a silk discreet um pen which is really really nice because it fits just in the palm of your hand really well so orange chem dog so i'm guessing i'm gonna have a little bit more of a citrus kind of terpene taste to it [Music] that's really good i didn't want to inhale too much because um i need this to wear off before i leave so i just kind of wanted to test it out i do have that kind of citrusy bit of flavor in that cart and then let me try the other one here real quick this one is called himalaya and it's a grape runs this other one that i have over here that i just took out is their um strawberry shoe i forget the name of it but it is such a pure delicious taste to it these don't taste much at all like weed um but i kind of have that feeling about a lot of carts i don't feel like it has you know too much of a taste so i wouldn't say necessarily that it's different it doesn't taste um i can't get into this one it does wow adult proof too it doesn't taste adulterated or like chemicals or anything like that at all here's this this one is the grape one and again if we flip it over we see that the bubbles just not moving at all [Music] [Music] this one tastes delicious this one and the strawberry ones might be my two favorite vape carts so um yeah i think that it's really cool you could practice your smoke tricks with it um they do actually make me cough pretty hard but i didn't really take very big of inhales just now so it just kind of tickled my throat but with the cards i do get my desired effect that i'm looking for but i would say that it hits you definitely a lot sooner than the gummy so you can start to feel the effects of this within a few minutes but they say give it about 20 minutes to fully feel what you're gonna feel and then if you feel like you need more go ahead and take another hit now with delta eight a couple things that i found to be incredibly interesting was that you can build up a tolerance to it a little bit faster than you can with traditional weed delta nine um however the reverse is also true in that you can basically detox and lower your tolerance at a much faster pace than with delta nine so um me personally i did feel like when i very first started with the gummies one was very strong for me so i always suggest to people to try just a half a gummy at first and kind of understand how that feels now that i've been taking at least one a day for about three to four months or like 90 to 100 days i can take the one and i'm like perfectly good in coasting um throughout the entire day obviously but i can take the two to achieve what i did get with one four months ago that's that that's where i got to be about the same level but then again if i take a week off from these entirely i can bring my tolerance right back down and be right back to it you know and then with the cards again i've also realized that they last a really really long time longer than the typical i feel like i don't hit it as much because i feel that desired effect i'm right away and i don't really struggle to try to keep it or maintain it like maybe you hit it a couple of times a day um every couple hours just take one hit and it really is pretty good just like that um but if you are looking to actually get that high elevated feeling then to just hit a couple hits i feel like you just don't need as much of it even though it's less psychoactive i feel like you get to that desired effect of what you're looking for a little bit sooner than trying to like really take it to here you know so that's it that's everything that i have for you guys today um i kind of want to do a little vote and see what their next flavor should be i think that this community could kind of sway them into perhaps making another flavor so i'd love for you guys to vote down below which fruity flavor you'd want to see next they already have blueberry watermelon sour strawberry and mango and i'm kind of on like team peach here because i love anything like peach rings anything peach flavored is freaking phenomenal so i'm gonna vote for peach but i mean think about it you guys go into your emojis and figure out which emoji you like there's banana grapes cherry peach pineapple oh my god maybe a peach pineapple that would be really good like a combo one oh my god that would be delicious okay so let me know which fruit flavor you would like them to feature next as far as the gummies and um that's it that's everything that i have for you guys today thank you all so damn much for being here i love you i love you i love you and i will see you next time bye", "AAkkdCpgX6o": "hey

respectmyregion.com here in chicago today to do a taste test review featuring a half gram pre-roll called the selfie this is a maui wowie one gram sativa joint coming in hot at what where are we at in the testing cbd 0.11 thca 14.81 and total cannabinoids 15.14 so this is not a high potency pre-roll by any means this is going to be more hopefully flavorful and terpe but we shall see the grower on this it says ieso illinois one gram pre-roll single slow cured premium ground flour i mean it is what it is dube tube nothing too crazy let's see what the smell is looking like yeah you get some sativa in there you can smell that little citrusy pine the pre-roll is packed pretty tightly i'm gonna massage that out looks like your classic just raw paper nothing too crazy and then the way we do these uh taste test reviews you all pretty simple one hit talk about it two hits score out of ten three hits give you guys a score out of a hundred definitely remember to like follow and subscribe to respect my region and please be sure to go support modern cannabis aka mocha moca here in chicago i'm downtown you guys can see beautiful day a beautiful view shout out to recreational cannabis man so dope to be able to go to a store wait outside for a bit pop inside and get treated like a patient all right here we go first hit it's light citrusy piney not overpowering in any one of those flavors but you can taste them all right taste test official score one hit talk about a two hit score out of 10. this is more of an affordable pre-roll so i think the score out of 10 on this taste test is going to be closer to like a 7.75 you really do get this light citrus this light floor this very light pine but it's not super pungent it's not super loud it's not super citrusy so because of that can't be a super high score on the taste it's just not the best version of any one of the flavors i've ever had or the best version of maui but the ash very light colored so that's solid and the high right now is very much not necessarily like energetic but i'm more focused i feel like i'm ready to either go run or just start the day and so maybe it's mood improving i think that would be the right word but either way when you start to think about a score out of a hundred and the overall score basic packaging no terpene information not the best tasting weed but also not bad tasting as well i think i'm gonna have to give this product a 75 out of 100 with a 7.75 official taste test score you want the thc to be a little higher you want the terpenes to be a little higher on the sativa strain so that way you actually get the effects you want the entourage effect the thc and the terpenes to come in and provide a strain specific kind of high maui wowie known for you know the cerebral clarity an energizing burst maybe even a little bit of appetite suppressant um but definitely you know creativity inducing for sure so 75 out of 177.5 i'm sorry 7.75 out of 10 on the overall score and the taste test let me know what you guys think drop a comment smash it like if you've been to chicago you've tried legal weed let me know what you guys think drop some recommendations and i will see you all on the next review big shout out to ieso illinois and modern cannabis for the plug love you all peace", "K43zCdkls9Q": "all right we got another grow talk question natural PG ARS it's a pretty good one here we're gonna learn about PG ours but frosty Minton okay naturally when you say natural PG ours it's not natural PG ours I tell you what kelp is loaded with them how do you think it becomes a fastest growing plant in the world it makes its own PG RS man and then it grabs nutrients from the from the ocean and blam oh man Kyle sudden I'm eaten in a salad before my sushi well this one says what up dudes kinda grew and did you see back with another question I currently have nine seedlings rollin one cheese - alien orange gum and six corleone from a friend last week my friend that gaming the seeds took me in his facility he had quite a few corleone I was blown away by their size they're freaking huge and realize that they may have a challenge on my hands going to sativa dominant strain in my three and a half by three knife pro tent and when I mentioned my concerns to my friend he told me that I shouldn't have to worry about it if I used PG ours he gave me the recipe for the natural one they used and I wanted your feedback I heard Scotty talking about kelp recently when someone asked about foliar feeding with recharge but this recipe has a few other things so let's see here is Brett recipe here involves a little bit of kelp this is a quarter teaspoon per gallon 1/4 teaspoon gallon fulvic same amount humic as well as a little bit of yucca at the end for just delivery so what do you think about that I don't know I know like I said that kelp is the only thing that I'm familiar with the PG ours in fulvic and humic acids are just ki laters so it's gonna get the kelp in there and it's definitely using kelp um isn't gonna be something that's going to control the growth of the plant so that it's not going to stretch it's gonna make it grow um it's gonna make it grow cuz if you think about you just kind of ever think about these things as like the proportion stuff is in and kelp has all its PG RS and hormones and everything in two proportions of a plant that grows really fast yep I mean that's why kelp is an awesome like a amendment or supplement to use for your plants but it's not gonna control the stretch at all there are some ways to control stretch though just real quick talk about with like gravity and all the cheating ways back in the day peeping PG RS that people use for ornamental flowers to keep them short that was things like packed packed little beaut Rizal I think I say that correctly which that that pretty much just influence plants to stop stop vertical growth you know it is their time just from science speaking I know like people would say if you use it if you use pack low early enough but I've spare people say this about Eagle 22 for powdery mildew before harvest like if that were to get tested lab tested you're not gonna find anything in there it's just when people apply it at the wrong time so I'm not saying use this I'm just curious easy even if you treated like clones with pack low just because the tests doesn't come up positive for it being there or it says non-detectable does not mean that it's not there or that that's something that you want to be inhaling but it's at all it's 2020 by the way and anyone with the discerning tastes or whatever I don't know discerning I can tell what pack low bud looks like it's very obvious super hard nug [ __ ] you know what pack low blood sounds like when it hits a table yes it will I've seen people grow some hard dog recently though man I'm not gonna put it on them no to my some of it can be streamed you think for sure like don't stream Pacific nugs are just hard yes my point is that no matter what you grow it's this weird hardened up just homogeneous hard enough may get hurt people with it yeah just it's just a missing shot your quality goes way down so I would think about environmental aspects first off those lights and this guy's grow I know some lights you can penny a double-ended they haven't pinned to the ceiling I know there's a further my lights are away from my plant the more it's gonna stretch towards the light especially if I have lower light depending on how much light you have in the room okay yeah fair enough I'm tell you a personal experience as well we're talking about factors depending on your lighting if your rooms getting really hot you can get some stress yeah you know let's stretch more yeah actually I heard about that that has to do with the differential between the daytime temperatures nighttime temperatures those where like if you have a colder nighttime temperature and a warmer daytime it'll make it stretch more but if you have a warmer nighttime temperature then you have daytime temperature then it makes the planet stretch less and then further than that you can go and change if you have LEDs with the ability to change the color temperature of the LEDs we were using or even HPS and metal halides having more blue light it's gonna keep internal spacing shorter and more compact versus if you just had like more red light in there it's definitely going to stretch more I got GU roof a couple if you call mechanical things don't wait too long if you know you have some stretchy sativas don't let them get big and then go to flower you can do some topping at the right time if it's applicable to their your foot your plant structure yep sweet round into super crops where you know how to drain know how to super crop know how to tie down know all those tricks because implementing them all you know Scroggins stuff if that works for you there's a great way to be able to control it mechanically as the grower it's a skill that you learn but when I was growing Allan sweets come for two three years it was I learned a lot of that stuff because you had to or it's just going into the lights that lateral bud growth works I mean to take a bud like this on its side you get so many tops on there yeah just tip your tent over coming up something like that love it love it", "7yFjgD89oU8": "hey what's good everybody jpeg here checking in respect my region.com here today to do a quick taste test pre-roll review we're in chicago illinois today and last night we visited the modern cannabis aka mocha dispensary in downtown chicago and today's pre-roll review is going to be the grand of flora this is the uh the melonata so it's a one grand pre-roll from the same fam as the usual cookies group so coming from la coming from the west coast very familiar with cookies and granite flora i'm excited to check things out let's go ahead and pop into the tube and dive in the way we do these one are these uh these taste test pre-roll reviews is gonna be a one hit talk about it two hits score out of 10. if i can get in it there we go and then i'll give you guys a score out of 100. so let's check out the pre-roll it's got a great color to it right nice fresh green classic raw paper when you bust open the tube it's got a nice creamy fruity gassy smell and taste and the taste is pretty consensual so here we go let's go ahead and bust it in all right got a funny light right now it's because the lighter there we go there we go all right all right all right we got a canoe it's how it goes sometimes just go ahead and get that broken just start over from the top oh taste wise coming in at about a coming in at about a solid eight i would say and then let's see i think overall yeah it's going to be a solid 8.75 on the overall taste so far and then when you talk about the actual taste and overall experience and the potency the color all these things the undeniable issue at the beginning of how it lit it's going to affect the score which is how it goes [Music] when you think about all the things considered this is an 18 plus tax pre-roll i can feel the high it's a little bit energetic a little bit clarifying it's potent i think i give this a [Music] 8.5 overall you got to drop the score a little bit because of the way that it lit and how like it's just not it's just not the greatest it can be so let me know what you guys think drop a comment be sure to like follow and subscribe uh be sure to give me any recommendations and if you're in chicago if you're in illinois be sure to drop by modern cannabis big shout out to their whole team for the recommendation grand flora you guys rolled a little bit better on the next one but i'll also come better prepared with a better lighter so it's not even that windy i don't know what the big deal was but either way burning funny love y'all i'll see you on the next taste test pre-roll review peace", "GGGW1xP3Uyg": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video and if you couldn't tell from the title this is overall garden video I mean got the sweater on as well and I got the cartridge as well and yeah like the title says this is basically like a video just letting you know that there are fakes when it comes to raw garden it's it's so stupid in the cannabis industry once you've been like once you become like an established company people are just trying to like make money off your name they're trying to sell fake products under your name and basically with your heart the hard work that you put in for your company is just easily easily used for another person's gain you know and that shit's not the business you know and we're gonna be talking about the fakes when it comes to raw garden I have a few pictures that was taken from raw Gardens Instagram let me just pull them up right here so I'll also be putting it on the screen right here so you can get a better look of what I'm gonna be talking about and another thing I'd like to mention is that I guess my packaging is a newer packaging so it's not gonna be I don't know like here's a thing with raw garden and with other companies that do the same they're gonna constantly keep updating their packaging because like I said people are onto their [ __ ] and they're they're gonna just keep you know they're gonna keep at it so you just got so we're gonna bring it up right here and right off the bat you can see that the font is different and actually the color is a lot different especially the the font on here it says like I'll post on the screen don't worry but basically you could tell from the font and where the positioning of the flower is I guess so right here I got the tray clip good I bought this from flavors I'll post it right here I mean they have it on their website as Walt rock garden if you go it on raw garden the raw garden up farm you can actually search up all the dispensaries that have it there legally so I bought mine at flavors as you can see right here all that good stuff let me just so I'm guessing that they had to update this because they just pulled over the QR code but I mean you can go and check all these I actually don't have a QR code like scanner oh I just download one real quick so we'll see this [Music] basically running the same but the numbers are a little bit different I mean it says right here eighty one point zero three zero five and then this one's eighteen point eight six so I mean you gonna have to take my word for it I bought it at flavors I do not have the receipt on me but if you didn't see that video previous from this I showed the receipt in there exactly not bad just gotta be careful with the raw garden you should go on their Instagram also to basically check out how to tell the real from fakes you know this is it right here very very clear stuff and yeah I mean I've been hitting this already and it tastes very very good it does not taste like it's some fake [ __ ] you know and you guys know me I've been I've been getting raw gardener for years now and honestly like I would know if I had a fake [Music] good stuff this is the chill battery very very good battery for itself for what but like I said check out the photos or the pictures that rawr and put on their Instagram yeah it's a little bit different actually it says four right here it actually has the percentages right here as well but I guess they switched up the new sticker so yeah I don't know they just keep changing a [ __ ] every time so at the end of the day like unless they update those pictures it's gonna be hard to tell you know because they gotta keep switching their packaging because each time they [ __ ] get settled in these [ __ ] people just trying to fake the cartridge fake the packaging and all that stuff another thing that I've noticed from the pictures is that that ever should be on its own column or its own row so the other ones they actually has no additives ever in one single line so that's another that's like the biggest difference that I can notice just by you know looking and scanning at the box ooh and if you guys haven't seen Shaka x4 20 video on the subject already please check it out it's a dope video I posted it online community posts so if you guys haven't checked that out already you should really check it out does good content similar to that of mine so you know if I don't upload you know I'm saying you got more other content creators to go and check out them you know so shout out to you Shaka X 420 shout out to you your boy should be some cool collabs if that were to ever happen but yeah I'm gonna take one more hit and we're probably gonna end the video here be careful with the roll of iron cartridge you know I like when they was first brought into my attention that raw barn has fakes or had fakes and stuff I was really like hesitant like I was like no I'm gonna copy raw garden you know because like I don't know I just I just didn't think that they would and sitting here now knowing what we know like anything can be copied it's crazy so if you're an upcoming like cannabis company [ __ ] I don't even know how to like avoid this you know maybe like some really intricate into your kids ass packaging that is alike cost a lot so therefore they wouldn't buy it because it costs a lot I don't know who knows but I'm gonna take a million hit for you guys and we're gonna call it a video and uh I just had plumbing service at my house and one of the plumbers actually watches my videos so whoever you were I forgot your name but it's a small ass world and it's crazy like he came up and he was like it simplistic you me what you do videos so I was pretty interesting but yeah shout-out to you thanks for doing a good job on our plumbing you know I'm gonna take one more hit for you guys and we're probably gonna end the video here [Music] these are guys [Music] [Music] you", "g3-u5aYlnZY": "all right y'all this is part two jp checking in respect my region.com here in chicago illinois we just had to fix and doctor the cookies pre-roll go watch the other video this entire finger length roughly half the pre-roll was dumped into the bottom of this i could literally pour out the dust and so what we did here to give the collins aven cookies flower an actual authentic review just at least on the quality of the flower i went ahead massage it out and forced all the weed that was in the top half of the joint on this side i shook it down and twisted you can see how much paper right how much space there really was so man already failed cookies on the quality of this cannot believe i just experienced that five years in the cannabis industry i've never seen a joint do that before absolutely unacceptable here we go the way we do the taste test pre-roll reviews if you guys don't know yet is one hit talk about it two hits score out of ten three hits overall score now again i already failed this product because half of the flower had fallen through the mouthpiece into the bottom of the pre-roll just destroyed and when you pay 18 and then a 30 tax on top of that that comes up to a 25 pre-roll roughly unacceptable here we go still getting scooby snacks because they put literally just dust they just put dust in the whole pre-roll really just disappointed man it's super frustrating all right there's the first hit taste wise tastes like earthy piney gas it doesn't necessarily taste like gelato kind of gas or like a og kush kind of guys but for the collins ab strain it does have a little bit of sweet gassiness to it the ash is kind of light colored so shout out to them for that scorebox out of 10 i'm gonna give this a i'm gonna give this an eight flat it's sweet it's piney but it's not super super super delicious it's not like oh my gosh i really want to smoke this again uh kind of weed quality but at this point they've already burned the bridge because again i paid 23 four dollars for a joint that's just not worth it at the end of the day so overall 82.5 is the final score in terms of this smoking experience if it was a half gram indoor growing pre-roll for like 10 bucks but the reality is is that this is still gonna get a failing grade 20 plus dollar gram joint half of the flour was just gone disintegrated again watch the other video let me know what you guys think if you've tried cookies in chicago please be sure to drop a comment share your experience if you had a similar experience be sure to let me know subscribe to

RSO for short is a broad spectrum and herbal cannabis oil that generally contains the full range of cannabinoids found in marijuana it is used to treat a wide array of bodily ails and disease is helping to cure everything from your regular head cold to various forms of cancer this wonderful product was created by namesake Rick Simpson out of personal necessity working as an engineer in a hospital in Canada during the late 90s the boiler room where he actually performs these duties was covered in asbestos causing his central nervous system to go into shock and Rick fell off a ladder hitting his head on the way down you'll go on to suffer for years from this accident having dizzy spells and a terrible ringing in his ears traditional medications prescribed by doctors had no effect after brief exposure to a documentary aimed at displaying the positive benefits of using marijuana Rick took this information to his doctor but the subject matter was shrugged off time and time again after many hours of research Rick sourced his own cannabis supply I started noticing slight improvement in his symptoms in 2003 3 suspect bubs had arisen on Rick's arm he was diagnosed with skin cancer more specifically basalt cell carcinoma upon some critical thinking and some studying Rick had found a study from the Journal of the National Cancer Institute where they demonstrated THC was found to kill cancer cells in mice he decided the best course of action would be to treat his condition topically and started experimenting with indica Candida strains and food create high quality green alcohol and developed his first batch of concentrated cannabis oil he applied it to his cancer spots and covered them with a bandage for four days to his astonishment roger after he removed the bandages spots had completely disappeared from then on he refined his process began cultivating his own cannabis and made it his mission to distribute cannabis oil to those who need it just like he did here many hurdles such as police raids thousands of plants been confiscated and mainstream medical denial helped treat over 5,000 people rick is that is famed RSO should be made with pure indica strains as they help the body get the rest it needs during the healing process our Sol can be found at many dispensaries in legal states but due to the basic nature of economics that can be a little pricey the good news is that it is not too hard to make yourself and if you are careful about your ingredients in Clinton illness of your workstation to come out with the great product we have

you can see within my flow hub classic i'm going to come to the top here and i'm going to sort by bulk flower now that i have the strain that i'm looking to pre-package i'm going to highlight that strain and on the bottom right i'm going to select pack bulk flower this is going to bring up a modal for us for packing our flower the first thing i'm going to select is going to be my weight category i'm going to scroll down i'm going to select joints as you can see this is going to include more fields for us to fill out before we can roll these joints into pre-rolls first i'm going to add is my quantity i have 1362 grams let's say that i'm going to roll 25 one gram joints so i'm going to put in 25 here next i'm going to move this to a specific room i'm going to add these right to my dispensary floor the next thing we're going to be adding is our cost per unit we want to include the cost of the crutch the paper the flour and labor for getting this rolled up i'm going to say this cost us about 3.57 next we're going to fill out the weight so i'm going to put a 1 in here and we're going to see this 1362 decrease by 25 grams next we've got our total weight of this specific pre-roll this is going to include the paper and the crutch let's say this is coming out at 1.12 grams total lastly we're going to put in the price that we're selling these joints for i'm going to say i sell these joints at ten dollars next i'm going to select pack the buds you'll see that our quantity has gone down here for the quantity of bulk flour but if i come to the top for category and scroll down to packed bud we're going to see our recently rolled joints in the system now these will have the same package tag number as the bulk flower that they were rolled from and we can come in here and make an edit to these if we'd like if we were to change the package tag we have that option and then we can put any other uh information in here but we want to put in our unit of measure for each save and close and that is how we roll joints within flow hub so to recap we went to our bulk flower we selected that bulk flower scroll down and select pack flower from there we then pack the flour into 25 one gram joints", "HPeCUvEf2XA": "I have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually I've been smoking on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up its up everybody youtubes and really busting my balls about their Community Guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks oh yeah what is going on everybody and welcome back to another episode of free [ __ ] / I've been asked this question like a million times over the past couple days because of my most recent video so knock him out both in one episode you know what I mean before we get to that this video is sponsored by my goddamn self so a lot of you guys have been asking for merch specifically merch that doesn't say hey I'm a [ __ ] pothead on it because I understand that right you guys are like yo man I'd like to merch I want to support you but I don't want a pot leaf on my back and I respect that so just for you people I've dropped a piece drip tea it's pretty much the peace tea that we did before it says peace right here on the breast and then a peace sign on the back but it's like dripping it's like liquidy it looks really cool it's probably only gonna be available for two weeks let's make it two weeks so if you guys want to check that out link is in the description make sure to check it out by yourself one two weeks very limited they're [ __ ] awesome doesn't really scream that you smoke weed and yeah pretty cool so ever since I released that video a couple days ago which by the way he's doing very well the most common question that I get asked is Erik if you're not smoking these boo fast carts then what are your favorite cartridges if you know anything about the channel you know that these have been pretty much my go-to for the past couple weeks couple months I don't even know how long but it's usually the Moonrock carts which this one's empty and thus tizzy I found that these two right here are kind of the cleanest high and they give you the best high for sure like one or two hits out of these I'm not gonna lie that I've tried plenty of carts have tried kingpins brass knuckles like legitimate kingpins legitimate brass knuckles and there's a whole bunch of different brands out there for the most part it takes you like what two three hits and then you're like all right now I'm feeling good but with either of these with one solid not even a blinker with one solid hit like five six seconds I'm feeling it and that's that's kind of tough to do with a pen for me right cuz you tolerance just goes higher and higher and higher after every time I'm not sure how much is left in here it's a strawberry Nana car it's pretty much done tastes very good no best thing about cz see like a not a lot of pins make me cough bro I'm not gonna lie after a hit like that but the thing about susie that doesn't make you my daily driver is one it's only available in california and to its proprietary little battery so if this dies i don't have any other device but i have like a million 510 thread battery so that's mainly why this is nice don't get me wrong and they recently remodeled other package its new packaging it's higher THC percentages and there's no pesticides so sissies your thing then go ahead and check it out man but because of those two things it really just i don't really hit it every day you know i mean i don't get the opportunity to smoke bcz every single day however alright the game has changed man dr. zodiac who usually makes the moon rock cartridges said [ __ ] that i want to branch into other things [ __ ] the moon rocks and we got ourselves i'm not sure he's coming out with anymore but we have ourselves six different cartridges six different flavors six different strains from dr. zodiac himself the maker of the moon rocks and they hit the same bro and it takes a lot for me to say that about a cartridge bro there's not many cards out there that hit like a moon rock car but from the [ __ ] himself obviously it's gonna be pretty dope man have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually i've been smokin on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up i actually gave Kyle one of them which is why one of them is missing so it gives me an opportunity to open it up so packaging is on point first of all you have some crazy I there's so much going on right here there's like a lion's a spaceship in the background there's like a little spiral galaxy right there like this is tight I've got to open it up and inside you'll see a battery a charger and your one gram cartridge I think they also sell them in half grams yeah yeah I've never seen him in half grams but there's a little spot right there for a half gram so I imagine that they do now the [ __ ] cartridges a low charger and we have ourselves right here what is this one the Lion Heart clear so a lot of these don't have the strain actually on them I'm not exactly Lionheart distrain I've never heard of it but the other ones I'll go through and tell you what I think this train is but I guess that's part of the fun man little guessing game so very first hit off of this cart by the way as you can see right here we got a little bubble right there and as you guys know I said in my last video I said hey the bubble moves it's bunk so let's go ahead and see if that bubble is moving I'm not even seeing it but I know the bubbles not moving beautiful beautiful man let's go ahead and just give this a nice low trip blinker yeah we'll get a nice rip and then we'll give it a blinker [Music] goddamn bro [Music] [Music] I couldn't even blink it man okay mm-hmm so I'm not gonna lie Lionheart was my least favorite which is why I gave it to Kai but after that hit man I don't know I might have to reconsider lion-hearted clear very fire next one up I think we're going to go through for my favorite to least favorite right now just as we got that one out of the way my very very favorite out of the six new ones that he has is called this Linwood lemonade clear this pen right here straight up tastes like I'm taking a [ __ ] dab bro it's ridiculous like it tastes so much like lemon like I have lemon gene aemon's right now and I think it kind of reminds me of that but every time I rip this it's flavor town and it's high town baby [Music] that's not saying that's insane man I can literally rip these off a pro I mean that would probably be really bad my tolerance but dude god damn I'm eyes and look [ __ ] all right yeah Lin would absolutely fired next up we have a Bobby blues clear which I believe is Blue Dream or something of the sort tastes very much like Blue Dream and it is the second most delicious one oh yeah that's blue dream for sure next up we have the silverback clear which i think is the best look and artwork in my opinion it's my third favorite and this is guerrilla glue like I said these are just assumptions I could be completely flow going wrong about all these but this is this is generally what I'm tasting what I'm getting the effects that I'm getting from these pants man every single pen also has the little logo or the little artwork on it instead of the little doctor zodiac bunny but we do have the bunny right there and we got the bunny right there as well mad goddamn I love these bro I don't know there's just a look about these you know I mean like every single cart looks the [ __ ] same man and at a certain point like when you're getting really high off all the cards still you look for a little something extra right you look for a little pizzazz you look for a little like all the cards are the same I need something that stands out oh wow all right that second hit was a little different hang on that might bump up man I don't know that might bump up to number two right there goddamn that silver bag is why you're next up this could actually this is up there man I'm not gonna lie next up we have the razzle dazzle clear there's a little berry hitting a cartridge right there which is very clean this color is nice I don't know there's something cool about all these like it's one thing to color one things the flavor when things like the plugins and say you should make it I don't know man one's a real bright pink with all the colors on it I think this one really reminds me of an actual moon rock cardiguez which is like a berry flavored moon rock art tastes very similar to that it honestly tastes like a DAB like I don't know man like not a lot of dab cards sometimes dab cards will just be Tudor P if that makes any sense like oh dude this doesn't even taste like weed this just tastes like like a [ __ ] candy cart or something you know what I mean and I don't really [ __ ] with that but these have like it taste like wheat like you know you're getting that wheat I don't know if all of you are under that there's probably gonna be some people that bro I just smoked with a flavor like alright these cards aren't for you then I'm not gonna lie these cards are for getting extremely [ __ ] medicated and a hint of flavor that's like enjoyable but not too much I don't know but it's some good stuff now this last one here is called Frosty's snowcone again don't necessarily know if that's strain or not um but this little it's a little Frosty the Snowman guys looking evil on here what is he I like that a little logo man it's looking [ __ ] cool there's color by the way purple is probably my favorite color like probably a lighter shade of purple is my favorite color but this is solid right here Wow okay wait I feel like I'm cleansing my palette between each of these hits it's kind of a long time and usually on the streams I'm just like so I'm getting a decent amount of time to actually taste these do why is it so [ __ ] hard to rank these bro that's unnecessary like these are all fire five had however much these retail for like fifty sixty seventy bucks I don't know how much I I wouldn't pick one [ __ ] wait hang on if I had people are gonna ask me but they're like dude I only have enough money for one which one should I buy hey I think I'm buying the lemonade yeah that's a no-brainer I think the lemonade ones like no-brainer no-brainer kind of number one there and then number two bro it's like but just pick your poison yeah I mean goddamn everyone's probably gonna ask for this part no we're okay there you go durability tests on the spot [ __ ] beautiful everyone's gonna ask for it Oh first of all we need to get this thumbnail hang on let's get a bang and ask them no going right now oh not today son not [ __ ] today try to do this on stream and it was rather difficult so we're gonna see what's good right here it's just a little difficult because like it's hard to create a seal around so when you're inhaling you're just getting a lot of air all right so if you're not in a state where you can get dr. zodiacs and Moonrock cartridges and you're like damn I still want to have a little so wanna have a little swagger so we'll have a little what are your favorite batteries Eric I can get my own cartridges what do you like to smoke the actual cars use em so great great move question bro I actually have a little something right here it's like a part to a cliche bro personally I like batteries that don't have a button I don't know what it is but like yeah it's an added luxury that you can change the temperature but give a foot most of the time like I just want to hit it take out of my pocket inhale put it in and then we're good you know I mean I have to like click five times turn on and then like one two three and like change the temp and then like all right you know I mean it's just like those added seconds it seems like some [ __ ] but it kind of matters I mentioned this battery and all of these batteries made by Batman on a video before they're on the one gram in one sitting video but their website only sells wholesale they only sell like two dispensaries and stuff you know what it means so you couldn't buy it individually however I've helped you out don't even worry about it we have found an online head shop that was willing to work with us they even gave us a discount code so head up J vape industries it'll be in the description down below and you can use code Eric 10 for 10 percent off I have this battery and all of the magic Bab ballad batteries they're [ __ ] late all right I got you guys don't worry I got you guys take the lemon one of course slide in there and they both have this magnet [ __ ] that's like I don't know why that's so sexy like I don't know why I meant these are both the same color - damn in here I like this little midnight look look that's not coming out man you got a oh you know what I mean like that's [ __ ] tight you don't getting the only gripe on the see cell palm that I like the VAM on better is obviously this one's smaller this one that's a light so you know when you're heating it you know what I mean this one oh there is a light on this one never mind [ __ ] I don't know man look bad the stick one might hit a little harder than this I'd say if you're buying a dr. zodiac pen and you got the battery with it there's no need to upgrade but if you in need of a new battery these are the movement especially if you don't have a proper battery and you have one of those stick low eight dollar ones at the local smoke shop get rid of that [ __ ] it's gonna die in like a month month and a half get either one of these batteries men Eric 10 for 10% off by the merch first but like a if you want to check these out too if you need a battery a go ahead and check them out man I hope you all enjoyed hope you all learn something this wasn't a drugs 101 I don't know why I said that but like I don't learn something about batteries or card in my favorites hey you know what I mean let's get let's get a solid little double hit here going both batteries actually get something cool willing you know yeah when you have three you can actually like hit it properly you know what I mean I'm like yeah look at this cloud that I made

alright I'm here with Joe count to be ah know from Cresco labs that's tickers CL Joe thanks for joining us on the show today Evan thanks for having me appreciate you taking the time yeah of course and so why don't we start off by just giving investors a bit of an overview of Cresco labs how do you how do you guys see yourself as different from some of the other MSO is out there yeah so Cresco we started back in 2013 when our home state of Illinois passed the compassionate use of medical cannabis we got our licenses in 2015 and what differentiates us from a lot of our competitors out there is our focus on the middle to aspects of the value chain as you look at cannabis and the ability to be vertically integrated you have the cultivation of manufacturing side the development of branded products the distribution of those branded products onto other people's retail shelves and then your own retail while we're competent and we participate in all aspects of the value chain the core focus for Cresco is on those middle two verticals is really developed the first National cannabis brand and then distribute that brand into everyone else's stores the goal for Cresco is to be on every shelf across the country and all the states we operate in we currently operated in 11 states and we have a footprint that we feel like providing quality products consistent products and available products will really differentiate us from our peers right and so can you explain to investors with the Sunnyside brand is all about so the Sunnyside brand is our version of retail and we're excited to introduce this brand to the the multiple states that we operate in we feel like for far too long the retail stores in cannabis have been relegated to the industrial corridors we're looking to bring the retail store to the corner of first and main where people can buy their coffee where people shop at their Whole Foods and have this retail experience that belongs it's this exciting opportunity for customers whether you're familiar with cannabis or new to cannabis can come in and and purchase products and understand and look the opportunities that are there the wellness category is one that's been underserved in cannabis people focus too much on is it a recreational store is it a medical store we feel this wellness category is really where sunnyside will live and will flourish because the consumer is really looking to improve their lifestyle through a wellness category and that's what the Sunnyside brand is designed to do Oh perfect that sounds like an excellent needs to be fitting into and now another recent acquisition has also been focused on that New York fully integrated and licensed I'm not gonna I'm not gonna butcher the name myself but I'll let you kind of dive into that if you want to explain how that might fit in with the Sunnyside retail experience yeah so in in the country I mean New York is a very populous state certainly a center of the financial universe so we wanted to we made a strategic acquisition they're one of the ten licenses that exist in the state of New York with the cultivation license you'll also get for retail licenses all four of those stores will be open by the end of this month two are currently open in Bardonia New Hartford and two will open in Brooklyn in Williamsburg and then in Huntington Long Island so two very populous areas this fits right in with the Sunnyside brand we're excited to bring this new level of retail to the New York market which we feel has been an incredibly underserved market you're seeing a state with that many people and a medical program that is very robust but you're not seeing it perform to the level of Florida or Pennsylvania or Arizona or Illinois so we're excited to get in there help educate the patients again on a wellness platform that works for them Sunnyside fits right in the conditions list in New York is very robust people have access to medicine and with the closing of that transaction in the next 30 days approximately we're very excited to be part of New York my home state still reading that's excellent and you guys provided any sort of specifics on the finance side for that acquisition yet no that's that and all the disclosures that are that are required actually will be will be looking forward to that and so again fitting again with the finance side of things how do you see the the sunny side rollout affecting yours wholesale to resale route proportions relative to each other in terms of the cannabis sales well so in some states again New York it's pretty much a vertically forced model states like Illinois where you're able to participate you're able to buy third-party products sell third-party products the focus for Cresco again is on those middle two verticals we never alienate a customer to provide that product to our stores our goal is to make sure it's on everybody's shelves and our retailers buy from us I mean our internal retail stores buy from us they stand in line right next to the other the other retailers we don't give preferential treatment to our own retail we want to make sure our primary focus at Cresco is getting our products are our house of brands out into the marketplace and we feel like all the retailers out there should have opportunity and access to our products they represent our brand well we try to give them marketing support to make sure our brand is well represented in the market but we can't possibly own enough retail to reach the entire country so we want to utilize the distribution platforms that are out there and the people are truly focused on being retailers and doing an incredible job of servicing customers making sure they have our product on their shelves and display properly perfect no I mean that makes excellent sense and that's actually really an interesting way to frame it that your own stores wait in line and not prioritizing though I think that really speaks to the consumer focus of Cresco labs you mentioned house of brands you mind giving you masters a little bit of an update and as much as you can on the origin house acquisition yeah so the origin house acquisition again is an incredibly exciting moment for Cresco the California market is so important to anyone in the cannabis space especially a multi-state operator who's really trying to create a national brand if if you alienate California it's at your own peril there is not a more important cannabis market in the world so us getting our house of brands into there through the largest distribution platform origin house made perfect sense for us so we're excited to jump in the origin house transaction is underway we did receive a second request from the Department of Justice we're working through that you know we talked a lot myself and my partner's backgrounds were in mortgage banking and we saw that industry go from unregulated to hyper regulated with government agencies jumping in and we had to guide our companies three of that process there was yeah we're doing in this in this space we're excited for the opportunity to present the information in the DOJ to help them understand the cannabis industry we think this will not only be a step forward for Cresco but in industry as a whole as we all pursue this path towards national legalization this is part of the necessary steps that makes perfect sense and it's just again sticking with that the acquisition side of things you guys just released a prospectus and mid-july pretty substantial you want to give any any thoughts on the M&A strategy or where those proceeds might go its parts you know Crest Coast focus is to continue to go deeper in the States we're in we're really focused on being again in the important footprint that we've put together we want to be the top player in the markets that we operate in so as we look at M&A strategies you know continuing to go deeper into the states that were in has been our focus from day one will continue to apply into new markets as they come online but our real focus from an M&A standpoint is to go deeper into the markets that were in make sure we're the most important and visible company in those respective markets excellent that's perfect and so I that kind of wraps up all the touch points that I wanted to raise I think it's August 21st is your earnings report or earnings release date that's correct yes awesome so investors should look out for good news on August 21st again thank you very much Joe for for coming on the show appreciate your time thank you very much I appreciate it and I look forward to talking to you again [Music]", "_BvMkY9DkKA": "what up and welcome to another edition of canopy where we are bringing to you honest and unbiased cannabis rain reviews so today we are going to be reviewing north star by copper state farms i picked this up over at the local joint as you see it was actually part of a first time patient special so you guys know i would never go out and buy copper state farms um this was a freebie with my first time beijing special over there but if you are like me and have never tried northstar let's go ahead and talk about it this is almost a purebred sativa it is a 90 a 10 indica that is a cross between two of probably the most popular strains of all time one of which is northern lights the other is afghani so two old school strains coming together to create this north star so i'm gonna bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out then we're gonna take a look at it together okay so you just had a chance to check out this north star what did you think of this stuff let me know in the comments below so the first thing i got to tell you guys and local joint i i know i've addressed this before in my other reviews that i've done for you guys but why is the medicine not sealed why can anybody just go open these jars or packages in the back any of your da's can just open these seal the packages seal the package this is a health and safety concern you guys i know that this is not going to pass once wreck and uh the wreck bill goes into effect so yeah start sealing the bags here you guys this is like just unheard of now here's the deal and this is kind of something i want to talk about so this stuff was it's got a date on here of 9 24 september the 24th i picked this stuff up on 11 25 so basically two months after this stuff and i'm guessing was harvested or maybe packaged probably the package date so two months after the package date and i'm reviewing it a month after that so today is actually christmas day it's 11 25 today um so it's three months from probably the package so this is starting to get a little bit old it does have a thc percentage here of 17.42 now i'm not sure if that is the total thc or the total cannabinoids um i'd really like that printed on the package here so i don't really know but i'd be very curious to find out now um you know let's get into the smell let's just open this bag and see what's going on like a tiny bit of like sweet spice but i mean honest to god i really had to search for that there's really not any terps in this jar and uh are in this bag and i can tell you that when i ground this stuff up there wasn't really any additional flavor that came out i mean i did smell kind of some of the sweetness the haziness that was in the northern lights um but that's about it it's not like it smells bad or anything but like there's not really any terpenes to report i'm going to start calling this the covet weed you know honestly the weed that doesn't have any smell i'm just going to call coven weed so yeah i mean there's just not a whole lot of terpenes to report and let's look at the buds themselves and see what it looks like really not the best looking buds you guys these are just all popcorn buds in the eighth i mean and mind you this is a 33.8 i mean in honest-to-god 33 you can spend 35 and go get some sonoran roots from health for life um there's just not really like there's it's just that light lime green color these peach colored orange hairs they're not really sticking off the bud surprisingly the butt is actually still a little bit malleable which i'm shocked that it still got any malleability to it um this was absolutely run through an auto trim machine it's just all the butt is pressed up against the the nug you can kind of see that that's indicative of an auto trimmer it's not really sticky and there's just not really any trichomes on the butt i mean it's really really struggling in the looks and it's really struggling in the smell um perspective which is probably it's just it's indicating to me that this is probably going to lack in the taste department as well but what i want to do is before i get started here i want to go ahead and i threw this back before i started filming today up on the penny fenders test because i'm pretty sure i actually caught local joint pinching from a half ounce that i got from them so let's see if they were pinching on this north state uh star by copper state farm so here's the penny fingers test now okay so the time has come for the penny bingers test let's see if this north star by copper state farms weighs 3.5 grams like is listed on the package here it was weighed out by the local joint so let's see if they're penny pinching i'm going to go ahead we'll get the scale turned on here i'm going to put a dollar bill on the scale to make sure that this weighs 1 gram and that we're all calibrated here perfect let's go ahead we will put our cup on the scale and just so you guys see this bag is still sealed so let's go ahead we'll get our cup put on the scale i'm gonna go ahead and tear that out so that is not affecting the weight now let's get the bag opened up and we'll dump the contents into the jar and see if we have a pass oh no that is a penny pinch 3.46 grams from local joint penny pinching you guys that is very sad i am very disappointed in your local joint local joint local joint local joint a fail on the penny fingers test 3.46 that is just a travesty and a shame and i got to be honest with you guys i did call local joint a couple weeks ago about three weeks ago to tell them about my experience and a couple of the problems and issues i had with their buds one of which was them not sealing the bags the other witch was me buying bud that was like three four months old from them uh another of which is me telling them that i didn't like lemon terps only to walk out of there with a half ounce of bag of weed that had lemon terps um and i believe again the other issue is the penny pinching they never called me back and i was really disappointed about that and it's crazy because after i posted my review on instagram and youtube they reached out to me on my instagram page saying hey thanks for the review come back in and try the other flavors and it's like are you kidding me you guys never even followed up with me you never even returned my phone call after i took the time to call and address my concerns so yeah i'm until this gets resolved i'm not going back to the local joint to pick up more flour that's for damn sure um so i'll let you guys know if the issue gets resolved i'll update the comments here um but yeah did not leave a good taste in my mouth failing a penny pincher's test like that again definitely not leaving a good taste in my mouth local joint start calibrating your scales and if you're coming that close start putting all of your bags over you know 3.55 is not that hard to put on a scale but when you're penny pinching it just leaves a bad taste in patient's mouth so i can tell you that i really hope the taste in my mouth is a little better after i get some of this north star in me so today i'm going to be enjoying this north star hopefully enjoying this north star out of my arizer extreme q desktop vape i've got it set to 375 degrees fahrenheit as you see right there my whip which is basically just this silicone tube that gets the vapor from the vaporizer to me the end with the screen on it that one is going to go sit atop the bowl which is sitting on the vaporizer i want to smell that bowl to see how this stuff smells just a light subtle sweetness nothing really to report there um and so this is how that looks with the screen end going into the bowl that is sitting on the heating element the other end is going into my scientific innovations triple filtered bubbler i'm only using two of the three filtration chambers today i've got some uh brand new distilled water in the second a brand new organic cotton filter in the third that'll filter out any potential impurities that did not get purged out in the final stages of growing um and properly you know if this bud wasn't properly flushed that's going to certainly help and you know honestly i'm not super thrilled about the growing practices over there at copper state farm so i think i'm going to need all the filtration that i can get here um so if you guys are ready i'm certainly ready to get down let's try out some of this north star by copper state it's been on the back burner for a little while you guys you know i'm not a fan of copper state farms but i'm going to keep this review on bias so let's go ahead and burn it down and see what this stuff is all about okay so it's just kind of a little bit of a sweetness almost like a candy sweetness not really fruity maybe a little bit fruity but it's almost like a uh light candy so subtle sweet candy let me dive in for a second rip since that first one didn't produce a whole lot of visible vapor okay so kind of some more of that subtle sweetness not a whole lot of flavor here it was fairly smooth not the smoothest that i've had i had kind of a little pinch in my throat towards the end there it's really lacking in the terpenes maybe like now kind of like a sweetness a tiny bit of citrus in there it's not really doing much for me you guys i gotta be honest um in the flavor department at least just yet now i'm gonna finish out this bowl so while i'm finishing out this bowl i'm gonna bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out under the magnification with 25 times macro lens you can get a little bit of a better up close and personal view of this north star while i'm finishing the bowl so here it comes now okay so you are looking at the north star by copper state farms and this stuff has got that typical lime green coloration the orange hairs on this are very light in color they're almost kind of peach in their coloration and they are hugging up so tightly to the bud they literally like it's almost like so you guys see this butt is fully smooth and flat so the hairs are really really kind of mostly coming from underneath the bud and kind of just spreading like a little bit of a spiderweb inside of this but um definitely lacking in the um trichomes on this bud this but definitely looks like it was run through an auto trimmer no excess leaf material but um you know definitely indications that it was run through an auto trimmer you know while it's not the worst looking butt i've ever seen it's just that really really tightly packed dense but that looks like uh greenhouse grown bud like what they're growing down there at copper state farm so yeah definitely some room for improvement on this stuff okay so you just finished checking out some of this north star under that macro lens what do you guys think let me know in the comments below now you know i gotta be honest like this stuff yeah i'm not even i don't want to waste your time for those of you who are not gonna watch the you know till the end of the review but this strain in particular um and just copper state in general for me it's just not medicine that's really on the level which is why really the only time i review them is when i get these free eights or these free grams you know as a first time patient or like as a bogo or whatever it is um they're just not one of my go-to strains um there are some decent things about this and i want to talk about those um you know the potency actually being one of them shockingly because at first i was like this isn't coming on it's not coming out then i'm kind of like no you know what for like a sativa it's it's actually does have some some decent effects but i want to talk about those effects i want to talk about how i'm feeling how the whole process was so let's go ahead i want to start by talking about the looks and let me give you guys my rundown of how i do all of my reviews so all of the strains i rate i rate on a scale from 0 to 10 0 being the worst 10 being the absolute best i break that down to four different categories look smell taste and potency or how effective this medicine is i'll sign up to 2.5 points each in each of those respective categories we'll tally up the total at the end anything seven or above is going to get my dank thumbs up approval anything seven or below will not um and if it does get a seven or above i'll tell you if i would go out and buy this straight again so let's start by talking about the looks or bag appeal of this bud i'm gonna bring it up on the screen one last time so it's fresh in your mind then we'll go ahead and get into my final review on this north star by copper state farms okay so you just had a chance to see this bud let's go ahead and talk about the looks now to me there's just it's not like this is bad looking bud there's just not really anything redeeming about this bud and in all honesty it's like there's just there's like hardly any trichomes on it and just overall it's like the fact of the matter is that it's it seems like they sprayed growth regulators on these just because of how tight and packed the buds are it's it's been auto trimmed so ran through an auto trim machine which is kind of like just a grater that runs back and forth and trims up the bud um you know it's just got that light lime green coloration there's just not a whole lot of things that are like you know amazing about this bud so for me i think from the looks perspective it's only going to be a 1.0 out of 2.5 because it's like it looks okay but it really it just looks okay is how it looks um you know it not definitely not even a 1.5 on this and the looks and the smell i would say the same thing like you know the fact is there's really not any smell in this jar to begin with excuse me in this bag to begin with just this little bit of a sweet kind of a haziness um which is almost just a little like spicy almost kind of like peppery um but you know you gotta go searching for flavors on this so for me the smell is also only going to get a 1.0 out of 2.5 now the taste i thought this was going to be more like 1.0 but you know the more thought i gave it it's like it was pretty damn smooth all things considering and while there wasn't a whole lot of flavor it wasn't like it was like harsh or rough to smoke and even till the end of the bowl it was like it wasn't like it went to like that burnt flour taste real real quick and you know it was just not enjoyable at all like it was pretty smooth medicine i want to give them the benefit of the doubt in this category and give them a 1.5 um in the taste because it really it wasn't awful it just there's not really a whole lot of taste there so there's not a lot of you know flavor to report um so 1.5 in the taste out of 2.5 and let's get to the potency you know for me at first i thought this was a 1.0 because it really what didn't come on quickly at all it's kind of a little bit of a creeper but the more i you just kind of settled into this it's like it is a sativa dominant like almost full sativa um very alert very energizing i can certainly go do anything i need to do today very clear minded and you know not really any haziness a tiny bit of you know i got a little bit of pressure on my head some very subtle effects in the body um but it's mostly a heady type feel you know i do have that pressure and it's it's in my head a little bit of cloudiness a little bit of haziness but honestly god i'm still pretty damn focused for the most part um so yeah i you know it's funny i think i would put this potency at a 1.5 as opposed to a one um even though it's not very very potent medicine it's like that you know the analogy i i you use you guys like the car that just like you know uh the the the light turned green and then it just went and stalled out or like the airplane that never took off you know so you know i i'm gonna put it a 1.5 in the potency so for those of you who have been following it's a 1.0 and uh look 1.0 in the smell 1.5 in the taste and 1.5 of the potency so it's going to be a 5.0 for me from uh for this copper state the north star by copper state farms you know not the worst meds i've ever had but certainly not going to be getting our dank thumbs up approval it's going to get a booth thumbs down that x this nickel cross and uh you know again this has a 33 price tag on the back i don't know anybody who'd be buying this for 33 bucks if you are one of them i i'm sorry i i feel bad if you have to go grab this because truthfully i'd probably rather just not really puff or like let my tolerance come up and puff this meds uh and you know local joint get it together with the penny pinching and just with the recommendations that you guys are doing and you know call back your customers when they're calling to give feedback to you guys about the dispensary and about your herb um it's this this whole experience did not leave a good taste in my mouth and again i know this was a freebie but yeah it's like free or not let's put it this way i i wouldn't drive down there to get this as a freebie that's for damn sure i don't care if they're giving it away literally absolutely free like i got mine for free um just not worth it so yeah unfortunately this north star by copper state farms not getting our thumbs up um and let me know what do you guys think it's a 5 out of 10 fair let me know in the comments below and then let me know what you guys want to see me review next and until then you guys please take care of yourself and one another and i look forward to seeing you guys again soon peace", "dOr-KK3IAJk": "yo guys what is going on ethan here today i'm going to be reviewing this shrieker cart from rise over in florida i don't know what other states i have it in but this is where i'm at and this is where i got it from so this is what the cartridge looks like um let me try to have it focus a little bit better but the oil does look good and i have tasted already and it is a pretty good car as you can see it may be a little bit high already but this cartridge does i can't even talk right now that's how good this cartridge is so it does smack let me hit it again i said let me hit it again and this was my first hit on the video so this already tells you cheese but i do want to thank you guys for all the support you guys have been giving me i know i haven't uploaded in a while it's been like two weeks i've just been really busy i've been trying to use my other social medias more so i haven't been uploading on youtube as much so that's my fault i've just been trying to grow my other ones so i could bring more of a following to my youtube if that makes any more sense so i'm gonna have my other social medias on the screen so you guys can check that out but yeah i want to thank you guys for all the support recently this cartridge is amazing so yeah it's a good car um thank you rise for giving me this cartridge to review and i'm not being like biased because they gave me the cartridge if it was ass i would say it's ass so this this is a good card [Music] this is the battery that comes with it so i don't know what voltage it's at but i'm just using the one that came with it because i didn't want to [ __ ] around the batteries and get one that was too hot for this and mess up the cartridge but yeah this is a really good battery and a nice cartridge as well i like how on this battery you don't need to hit anything so you just charge it and then whenever you want to use it put the cartridge on and you just inhale and it turns on by itself so so i want to let you guys know like i've been seeing a lot of people saying like oh i don't have the right equipment to start the youtube channel i don't have this i don't have that i want to show you guys that i'm recording this one like this video on my phone instead of my other camera just to show you that you guys don't need every little thing to start a channel like i started using my phone and i'm using it again on this video just to show you guys that you guys don't need all the equipment just start a channel so yeah it's it's kind of cool and i like seeing the channel grows and i get to meet more people so i really like engaging with my i guess the people that subscribe to me and that follow me so i want to thank you guys a lot this video wasn't going to be long it was just a little review on the cartridge and like i said already it is a nice cartridge this is just a half gram they do make full grams but obviously it do cost more but i think it's like like 50 bucks around that price i'm not exactly sure but i'm gonna have the information down below in the comments because i think if i put in the description they're gonna remove it but i'll i'll see if i can put it in the description i'm not gonna be 100 sure and i'll try to pop it up on the screen that's going to be it for the video this card is good like i just said a couple times but subscribe comment leave a like and thank you

like a waiver i guess yeah yeah but she got it and i was like [ __ ] it how did you convince them or was it not that hard my parents always been quite like that like they never tripped on me like that so that's the good thing you know but from there i started getting blasted like every week i was like okay house i might as well yo once you get one it's over you're gonna want to be in the shop all

looking funny yeah bro so mama be saying [ __ ] so last time we spoke you said that you had done um like music basically for a long time already apart from like you singing now right so what is it exactly you did before i was playing in a in a band i was doing a mexican bandana she's in awenze i was playing charchita is i was doing that for like six years and then once the once the quarantine started the coverage the [ __ ] started i started singing too i was like [ __ ] why not try something new you know yeah and then after that well i just uploaded a cover and then from there everyone was like hey you should start seeing you like you know this is going viral and [ __ ] it's blowing up and i'm like for sure yeah i'm down so what i did was i met some homies that were in a groupo and then they told me to pull up to their houses to to to jam out and show you for me and then i was like oh yeah i'm down and i pulled up and then they were like hey we got a compad that has the record label like he wants to hear you sing what the [ __ ] so from there i was just like [ __ ] it we had never sang up to that point you weren't i never sang that was like my first that was my first cover that had dropped and that [ __ ] was that [ __ ] was badass though did people tell you like you could sing or they thought you could sing or how did you even build up to that point well just the next day i woke up the video was [ __ ] hitting like got views i was like oh what the [ __ ] hey they're like bro you sound just like nothing else i was like oh [ __ ] hell yeah well i mean i guess i'm gonna start singing you know so i could see what i get out of it that's crazy and that's what happened and then my boss heard me sing and he's like bro i'm gonna sign you and he signed me and i've been in the record label for three three months already that's insane bro how do you feel getting signed like so quick i know you have a hustle of making music already but as far as singing right like i feel like making music doing what you're doing before yeah to this point you'd be like i you appreciate you didn't expect that back then i didn't expect it to be honest well as a as of now i still feel like it feels unreal you know like and i'm barely starting because all this all this music [ __ ] is new to me too like i don't i never know how to play norteno you know i was always like a panda boy that's what you grew up doing yeah yeah yeah so it was kind of new to me and i was like well hopefully i fit in this in this lifestyle you know and and so far it's been good bro hell yeah we are here freaking channel like so to familiar like do they have a background in music already or what inspired you to originally when you want to try it yeah my well actually all my family oh my my from my dad said there were all djs so i was always in the music like just hearing dj and [ __ ] and and then from the dj's uh like back doesn't parties you know how they're quinceaneras and [ __ ] you don't have a dj bobbing bro they have quinceaneras so then the dj ponder which is my family they put it right there and then we see navana right there too and i was like okay what the [ __ ] like this one that [ __ ] sound badass so i started getting into randa little by little and then from there i was like i went i went to one of the buses from awanda and i was like what's up you know let me join a band and he's like yeah we need to start practicing your [ __ ] so that's what i did and i was doing it for six years damn it was quite a while bruh she was so how old were you when you started i was like 14 14 at 14 15 i was starting i started young bro i was doing marching band two throughout my whole high school years yeah yeah so would you recommend that people that like do music or play instruments try like different aspects of music like you did you know how you were playing the instrument and then you went from that to singing and now hell yeah bro it's always like like i said it's always good to experience new things you know because you never know you never know what you could we could get out of it like i was always i was always into music so maybe that's you know yeah that played a big role in it i think your family's background probably did too you know because i felt a lot of people want to play music but their family is like girl don't do that yeah like that's a waste of time like you know or yeah that's what they were telling me back then too they'll be like hey nah don't do that yeah go to school you could you could get a good job you know you don't have to be struggling i was like [ __ ] i saw a girl yeah hell yeah we are here did you ever think you were gonna live a normal life like when you were younger did you ever think like you're gonna live a normal life like i'm gonna go to school i'm gonna figure it out get a job and then boom boom boom what you mean what you have like you know like a normal young guy you know when you're like in school most people were like yeah i'll go to college at some point then i'm gonna get a job did you ever think that was gonna be oh yeah hell yeah bro that was always my plan like it's where to go to college you know finish my my career everything and i mean he didn't end up as planned you know you speak a lot of spanish mainly like around the people you're with you may speak spanish well it was mostly english but i speak both i want my parents to have to speak spanish so i'm bilingual you know i speak yeah hell yeah i talk [ __ ] my mom tells me i talk fast as [ __ ] she's like i love being rapping on me oh what the [ __ ] what the hell yeah [ __ ] weird yeah i thought it is that's why i like i i could speak spanish too i don't i do talk spanish but what i mean so i'd be like [ __ ] you know like she's mixing it up using both in shape [Laughter] hell yeah that's sick bro so right now where are you currently staying as far as state wise right now i'm staying in texas okay and dallas texas that's right that's where my record label is at right now so out there is [ __ ] badass bro a lot of talk watchers out there [ __ ] a lot of a lot of checkings out there like a lot of [ __ ] out there

with that hey just don't get dope as responses that was hard he's gonna hit me up we can help each other out we can help each other out because i'm trying to figure that out too i think you're going to do good bro yeah and i think the category of like the style music that you made is probably the biggest category as far as like latinos like love to listen and love music yeah they love to listen to that you know a lot of people related to that song bro like yeah like crazy in the comments where the comments yeah it's it's it's a good song real good song yeah i think that category is crazy like that you could [ __ ] explode crazy bro and yeah i feel like you um you can stretch your voice out a lot more yeah for sure yeah for sure that was pr that was a good uh actually it was a good sound for it too because i actually played it with it you know yeah you really stressed your voice bro i was playing with it i was just like because i feel like i uh i'll be trying to sing the same songs i listen to and when i try to sing that song i run out of air every time oh my god really stretched his voice on it like you went back with a back back back [Music] yeah i mean and imagine me i'm [ __ ] i'm a [ __ ] twig out here [ __ ] i can't even you know so for me singing that song and when i'd be singing that [ __ ] i'd be getting terrible for sure dude that's crazy bro he's like non-stop just like yeah he's back to back yeah that's exactly what i was thinking i was like bro that's hard you know how does he do it yeah i run out of air bro and like try to catch my [ __ ] breath and i'm like god damn it like [ __ ] and a lot of the songs i feel like as far as like the koreas around that are like that type they kind of kind of like a pace to them whereas like they say and they slow they say and there's a pause to it you know yeah they kind of play what they do and then only little parts i feel like are really back to back but your [ __ ] was the whole thing i was like damn bro you said what the [ __ ] that was hard yeah hell yeah yeah that's just hard bro appreciate it bro yeah bro how long did it take you but a practical like to do something like that like for that song yeah well that's how i actually well the song it was bill uh haciendas shout out to homie haciendo yes too that we was built together you know we we wrote half and half of it too like la compusa like the the the fast part you're talking about yeah he's he came up with that part yeah so that's what like we build it together and [ __ ] and that's all that's how it came out and and we'll throw that song like when it came out i was like [ __ ] it was stuck at 30k and i was like damn like i think it's it's probably going to be stuck there you know and then that's when i made it over [ __ ]

description and dude look babe peek your head closer you see that you can't see her in the smoke it is box man we out", "F1Gj0gPR_Lk": "hey everyone how's it going hope you're having a great day today we're gonna be answering some questions that you sent to us through YouTube or Instagram and yeah everybody's gonna be anonymous for privacy purposes so here we go question number one new to vaping what factor does voltage play in to vaping amazing question first of all I would say in order to understand voltage you need to understand mas casa t so viscosity is just the thinness or the thickness of your oils so if you have a thick oil which basically you can tell by flipping over your cartridge upside down and if it doesn't move or takes forever in a day to move you have a thick oil if it takes like five seconds probably a medium and then if it's almost instantly you got a you got a thin oil so thinner oils would need a lower voltage and thicker oils would need a higher voltage if you vape thin oils on a higher voltage you run the risk of burning the oil itself and if you vape thicker oils at low temperatures it might not heat up all of the oil in and you might not get the draw that you're looking for also cartridges play a factor into this sometimes because of the air hole but that's a whole nother video I'll link I'll put a link to it like right around here somewhere so you want to make sure that you get the full inhalation of your draw and you also want to make sure that you're not burning your oils either alright question number two can I refill my cartridge with new oils absolutely I would say don't do it more than twice otherwise you run the risk of clogging old oils might get stuck in there and so don't burn your new oils correctly you might lose flavor taste vapor production it could leak you know because it's just over time I mean you know you want to change the oil in your car and with this it's just like this is you're actually inhaling it and this is going in your body so you want the best quality of you know oil that you can find plus if you're like a flavor chaser and you know somebody who likes to try and taste different strains you know it's best if you change your oils you know once maybe twice and then dispose of them because they're they're not meant to last forever next question says do these work with normal vape liquids no no they don't uh vape liquid is too thin it'll drip out it'll leak out into the battery you know that you'll have connectivity problems if you do that I wouldn't put a juice in it odds these aren't meant for a juice how do I put a juice into my ex5 cartridge so again not free juice but all the cartridges that we sell they're all top fill so you unscrew the top cap or if it's plastic and it has a plug you just fill down the plug if it's a ceramic mouthpiece just take the mouthpiece off fill it around the heating tube because the heating tube is gonna or the heating post is gonna be directly down the center there's gonna be a hole down there where you can look straight down through it that's where the air flow comes from do not put anything in there what you want to do is have the oil drip around that post touching the glass and and being on the inside of the glass you want to be able to see the oil rise up you don't want if you put it through that post you're not gonna be able to see anything it's just gonna leak straight down into your battery and the ex5 cartridge is as a top fill you just remove it I believe the heating post is actually connected to the mouthpiece so you just squeeze it on in there it's it it's it's a dope it's a dope cartridge you can control the air flow through it - it's pretty hardcore um next question how long do I inhale while holding the button so the button will usually just hold for a good 10 to 15 seconds and you uh you can't you can't hold it for for more than that but usually as soon as you put the cartridge you know to inhale you're gonna hold the button down and then let go when you're done and just you know it won't last more than 15 seconds and then the really the rest is just up to you how long do I have to charge the battery for it does the pen light have to flash or the battery and the charger have to stay green so I know it's full it really depends on the unit you have and for the most part for the most part pins that have adapted connectors or you plug you plug them into the 510 threading you plug that into a computer it's gonna light red and hold red and then it will transition into green and hold green if it's something like this sometimes they'll flash 20 times I know the snap flash is 20 20 times and this one it flashes eight times and then it goes blank um you know just read the instructions I would say so to answer your first question how long do you charge the battery I would say no more than two hours you know some even less than an hour depending you got to watch them and get to know it you know it's something that you're gonna be carrying around in your pocket with you all day every day you know so it's good to know like what what you have on your body but usually what I would do is when I first get it use it up let it die twice charge it for two hours and then never past one hour again alright and can you use it while charging he was talking about the wolf duo no you cannot you cannot use it while it's charging it's not it doesn't have a bypass on it but this one does this is the wolf uni you can charge it or yeah you can't vape it while you're charging it next question hey I just got a new cartridge and whenever I put it in my uni just flashes but when I put in another cartridge it works fine what should I do the best method is basically what you did you know you tried another cartridge inside of the battery and it works so you ruled out that the battery was fine it was just the cartridge that I was having an issue the cool thing about all vaporizers is that they'll try to talk to you they'll try to okay with you if it's something internal with the cartridge it'll probably read as a misfire which will flash three times if it's something as simple as like the cartridge is fine the battery is fine maybe there's a magnet involved it's just not getting a connective touch to it it just can't read the cartridge it'll flash five times just an error like that it could be something like with the magnets you know the magnet might not be screwed into the proper length so sometimes maybe you want to back off the magnet a little bit from the from the cartridge itself back it off put it back in and see if that works so right now it's telling me one two three four five that means I cannot it cannot read the cartridge there's nothing wrong with the cartridge nothing wrong with the vapin but five times tells me that it's just not connecting to the battery so when I screw it back on I put it back in I'm able to get some draws try different cartridges different batteries different batteries and different cartridges kind of rule them out rule out problems if they indicate if you don't understand what the indicator is trying to tell you other than that I would say you know give customer service a call I'm sure we can take care of it for you that'll do it for today guys hope that was helpful let us know if you want to see more of these send in your questions I want to know I want to answer them but yet peace", "RhOqzKeiEoI": "welcome to another doctored green thumb strain review I am dr. greenthumb know it's been a while since we've done a strain review but the doctors been busy no I'm saying go in here go there but none of that really matters today we have what is known or what is called the Hammerhead og this hammerhead og is an indica its THC percentage is 24% so it should be pretty good its CBD is 1.1 percent people that have smoked it says it makes you sleepy gives you the munchies makes you confused yeah this is real life they sound like some [ __ ] cherry lightweights but you know nonetheless I'm gonna smoke it because I don't get none of that I'm immune to all those crazy little stereotypical stoner things that people talk about you know like confusion hunger and giggly and pression and [ __ ] like that the doctor doesn't get none of that man we've been smoking too long down here at the temple alright so um the Hammerhead og looked pretty good the Nugget you know was pretty tight it's very dense a lot of orange hairs if you will so we're just gonna light this [ __ ] up and the doctor will tell you what he thinks of it incidentally the funky field tip on this is not actually a funky field tip this is a dr. greenthumb tip by nish coming soon my good friend niche glass mm-hmm dr. green dumped tips but I gotta tell you this we put that [ __ ] phone on shut it up [ __ ] well I'm sorry to say that not even this cool ass tip could save the taste of this so-called to hammerhead weed this ain't even hammer and a tic-tac it's actually quite brutal I don't know why I'm still smoking it but I can't stop there must be a magnet on this foot by this [ __ ] niche tip right here because this is [ __ ] torture this is like listening to an hour of Shiki raucous battle raps and [ __ ] oh I'm sorry that was it for you but I got to give this this stuff a - two thumbs I mean at least it gets that because it still has me smoking it somehow even though it's not really up to up to the doctor standards you know if you could see through my glasses there'd probably be a tear coming through my eye like that Indian who [ __ ] it didn't like people you know littering everywhere man people who start pollution people can stop it it's [ __ ] weed is I mean it looked awesome man what what did you guys do the Hammerhead the [ __ ] out of here

you guys in spirit but today I'm coming at you with a review of Kush him mr. the sample that was sent to me from my friends over actually the phone I really never tried shake before so there's a first time for me and I still not share the experience with you guys so we're gonna open this up and also I have like these Kashmir they're like pre-roll classic tubes I wanted to do something a little different than the world calls that we all normally use these clothes $1.99 I got them from the gift spot people a little sis ash they look like this they're tubes they have filters on them just like a cigarette so I'm just gonna stuff this up with some of this shake and see how this is my first experience with shake see what this is about shout out to the people when I tweeted all leave is sending this over pull it up shadow pimp in the basement it is your first time I can see that it doesn't look bad and it has a good smell to it just nice and dry so I'm pretty sure it's gonna be easy to put inside whether you're using raw coal or using a tube like I got here it smells good I'm gonna remove some of these sticks out of the way to make it a little easier I'm stuffing up these colors guys make a few comments below let me know it's day yesterday how did you guys enjoy a day we're stranded you guys smoke you know actually this says shake I thought it would be a little bit more grinded up in there this might take a while guess I'm gonna have to pick me up some machine it's don't seem to be working out too well for you I'll tell you what rather do have you guys sit down go through all of this drama with you I'd get back at you in a minute once I get this up in here then I finally figured it out me silly me inside here it was like a little straw thing to help you so I used that to help I got it in it didn't take too long but like I said this is my first time our first experience with this and I wanted to bring guns along with me so now that we got this bangla stuff this out first time testing out a shake it actually tastes like a free one that I bought more this one's done up I like to shout out again to the phones to send me two little samples I got another one well I just wanted to go with it I wanted to go make a little video see how this was like I said this is my first time with any type of shake or anything like that and to be honest with you it tastes just like a pre-roll you actually I'm surprised any question of daylight it is tweeted forms shadows got to do customer service delivery why skies are really good over here once again like I said leave me a couple of comments let me know how that guy spends on dances but I have to make you a little pre-roll how those things rolled up if you take them into if you're going somewhere you know whatever you just want to have a quick smoke just go for that I guess well just have a rolled up see how I was waiting for you but how you do it it's a pretty good product so long let you guys go ahead and get back to doing whatever you doing you back in the basement as you can see some on convection guys slowly", "BuTUEXSpFoA": "yo what is going on you guys it's your boy mr thc man and i'm back at it with a banger i got my girl with me how you doing baby hello pretty good just took out my braids i'm sorry for this wild hair yeah you look hot with your hair down like that thank you 100 but yeah guys so today we got you guys you know and y'all read the title man y'all know what you're here for man you know what i'm saying we're going to be talking about basically are popcorn nugs worth it um shout out to pixie stix you know what i'm saying he did hook me up with some flour this isn't pixie stix flour by the way it's just a jar that he gave me but you know what i'm saying so far from you consuming these popcorn nugs what would you say you prefer would you say you prefer these popcorn nuts exactly i'm gonna get into what strain this is and everything you know what i'm saying oh do you prefer to get like a full-size nug or full-size zip or you know what i'm saying with regular-sized nuts if so i'm like all right well first of all you have to explain what type of popcorn next okay right right right okay let's look this isn't ordinary popcorn eggs okay this isn't like popcorn nugs from like you know what i'm saying you're alright harvest that just kind of came out these popcorn nuts specifically are from the bags of exotics like the entire it's a salad you know what i'm saying that's basically how the plug sells these it's a [ __ ] salad that's what it calls them and this is a combination of like zerber skittles a [ __ ] gelato all kinds of [ __ ] that this [ __ ] got bro he gave me like a whole list it's like seven strains that are basically put into these now i feel like these come from 400 to 600 zips that's something to take into consideration so it's bomb popcorn nugs it's like as bomb as it gets you know what i'm saying because you're smoking still from 500 600 zips but it just happens to be that they're popcorn nuts you know what i'm saying and i feel like oh my god it smells so gassy bro like bro like i was spending like 300 on zips that were like hit or miss like three hundred dollars on zips like you were like halfway through the j you'd be like yeah this is all right but you wouldn't be like you're stuck with like a whole half zip or a zip you know yeah and you wouldn't be like oh like every single hit is just so enjoyable you know what i'm saying it's just like you're left with this like i don't know man it's kind of like disappointment i feel like with some of these other zips that i've bought you know what i'm saying so to buy this and like to be at first when like when at first when they sent me the menu and they're like it's a shake and then it's it's 200 a zip i was like i mean it's not shake it's a popcorn nugs and it's 200 a zip it's like popcorn eggs for 200 is hit but you must be [ __ ] out of your mind bro like i was 200 a zip for like gas pack you know what i'm saying yeah for some gas pack so i thought this was crazy but right now bro like especially in california the game is really [ __ ] up so yeah you can like the homie was like bro i got 120 ounce but probably with like some greenhouse like i was like all right bro like i get it there is cheaper butt out there okay so before all the critics come in here like nah i brought my plug got it bro like you look bro these are real growers these strains aren't just gelato that was growing at the homies [ __ ] house these are from real farmers you know what i'm saying shout out darwin farms you know what i'm saying but i'm gonna just show you guys real quick i'm gonna do a little film on the on the phone just so you guys kind of get an idea can you hold the tree actually babe cause i'm trying to do everything popcorn popcorn nuts see what i'm saying like there's a lot of knives that are pretty big yeah i mean i wouldn't say that the nugs are like completely super small either you're right i mean but jesus i mean like guys like this [ __ ] is gas boy it just looks purple and green everywhere purple and green all over the tc fam tray you know what i'm saying jesus oh that gas pack you know so now i mean i'm gonna break down my perspective on what i think about smoking popcorn nugs first of all i thought it was like kind of funny like bro this dude's really selling popcorn now it's like and not just like selling them but he's really flipping them you know what i'm saying 200 is it i was a little skeptical of it but the homie was like nah bro it's all exotic strains you know and then like the homie sen the plug sent back over like all the strains and stuff and i was like all right bro i was like let me get like a half zip of it um just to see like how it smokes you feel me just like see what's up bruh i haven't been disappointed you know it probably even slaps more than any other single strain yeah it slapped harder than these other 300 zips that we got that came by themselves you feel me so i don't know bro i mean like 200 is it popcorn nugs but they're exotic nugs and honestly like i don't mind them because these aren't like there's not like the whole bag is like this yeah you know what i'm saying like they actually have like decent-sized like nugs in there too so i don't know i feel like it's it's a steal i'll take it i don't need like the bigger size nugs just to feel right about myself i know when he was like i got some popcorn nuts and bomb popcorn nice but he pulled out the tray i was like at first i was imagining like little ass nugs you know probably like a little jar of bag full of little nuts but i was like oh it's not that bad and he hooked it up he gave us 34 grams for a zip yeah oh but he gave it to you like in the bag he gave it to us in the bags yeah for this one but he gave us 36 grams damn i was like all right [ __ ] that's that i'll take it i'm thinking you know what something about bigger nugs too y'all like you get a lot of stem out of big nugs so like the nug might look bigger it might look rounder way more but it's all the same yeah you start taking it apart and you start taking like half a gram off yeah off a big ass stem i feel like with these little nugs you get more flour out of it because the stems are a lot smaller on here so it's a lot less stem plus actually the same thing i don't know why people always like discriminate popcorn nugs like that hey yo look popcorn nugs are shitty when you have an all-right grow like if your grow is like mediocre then your popcorn nugs are just not like it's popcorn yeah it's gonna be like all that but like when you when you're buying from real farmers you know what i'm saying let me see real deal yeah you know what i mean these are 700 zips at the dyspo seven to eight hundred dollar zips right here at the dispel for this [ __ ] yeah so when you're buying from real [ __ ] growers like i don't know man i think it it plays out you know it all maps itself out i mean at least for me i see myself picking up another zip of these popcorn nugs for sure i'm even tempted i i i i just it makes so much more sense like then to go spend twice as much on all right but let me tell you this though you know how we got like two different strains right we had had the bastille gelato they were both bomb but they just had two different tastes to him one yeah like highs were different too but they were just like completely different strains so one was like bastille gelato and the other one was like some sort of zerber some [ __ ] but the one that had like that sour diesel taste to it like that like the bottom one i'll pick up a zip with that it's forced something for a zip of that but i feel like i would do it bro that's my car payment 470 something bucks that's my car payment my dad would always say el vicioso it is it's a big bill you know like so through if you add up everything you spend on papers we i don't want to do it i'd be so upset if i really sat back and try to look at every single thing you know i was doing the math i i'm spending about eight to a g a month on just wheat just sweet and that's not counting when you [ __ ] up on the weed and get the like wrong yeah because i've had some bags but i don't smoke the whole way that i just left there like and i'm like no this this one wasn't it you know what i'm saying like i'm turning the car off one time put the windows down it's a warm day it's been pretty chill like these past few days no like no get your seat a little closer i think that's why like from the bottom i'm too far away like that there you go yeah why am i too dark well if you're further away with like all the light behind us and stuff you're gonna start looking a little different well i have a lot of hair there's like a whole mass going on right now at the park where yeah there's like church or something yeah like these people came and set up their own church at the park it's dope the way they did it though they have like speakers and stuff hey bro it's dope to see them doing something like this in the hood because it's not like a bad part like it's a good spot that they that's what you think well i mean it's the hood i get it i'm just saying baby you know [ __ ] got killed here plenty of times from here baby i know i'm just letting you know though like i know i get it the [ __ ] is getting killed here just like it doesn't look bad the park you know [ __ ] you know what's crazy about valeo it's not even like the adults that live here that make it bad like the people that let's say on these houses right here they're not [ __ ] gang bangers they're not it's the kids that grow up in different sides of valeo like like the [ __ ] you know what i'm saying like real projects in vallejo that come out of like the welfare apartments and stuff like that that start [ __ ] [ __ ] up that start going to different sides of the city and being like well this is our park now you know or whatever like oh yeah exactly that's where like all the [ __ ] murders and all that [ __ ] come through like actually r.i.p man a couple people there's like at least two or three people i went to high school with one of them got killed here well two or three of them got killed in different sides of valeo and like my high school i didn't end up doing high school i know doing high school in american canyon and those people did high school in american county too and got killed in valeo at our age you know one of them died like last year actually two of them died like uh right when we graduated one day like 18 got shot like a couple days after graduation the other one died at like 19. and uh last one i'm talking about that like a year ago and that last one died right here at this park he got shot he got shot in the car he was in the car and got shot up and well [ __ ] just like what like literally last week you know where we get senorita bread yeah they killed somebody right there yeah if we go there right now there's still the like candles and and flowers and everything that they went it was in the car nah what's crazy was that i think that fool was like inside the store like the little cvs or whatever that little pharmacy is i don't think it's a cbs but the one with the little pharmacy is the rite aid i think or something like that the one that's right next to the [ __ ] yeah it's like a dollar general store i think baby it's a dollar store oh i think okay it used to be it used to be some sort of like okay whatever this [ __ ] it is i believe that from what i hear um they found him in the store and like kind of like went after homie outside and then um they shot him he was really young it's almost like they hunt them huh yeah he would i believe he was gang banging um but he he died very young very very very young and [ __ ] man you know that [ __ ] side of me bro like i hate growing up around that stuff man i hate hearing the type of stories and [ __ ] it just hits different too when you you you've met the people you know what's crazy is that fool that just died i didn't even met him but i just i know people and like the same people that i know were like bro like they just shot you know this person i know and then like i drove by and i saw that everything was just still like you know like that just happened and i was like man bro like and then right here in american canyon in city where things don't even pop off the employee that got killed remember i told you because he told the guy to wear a face mask yeah yeah that's crazy that's too crazy an employee got killed because he asked the customer to wear a face mask and the customer got so mad shot him imagine doing your job like literally doing your job like you think he was willing to deposit his life for that business to go tell that person hey put on a face mask no but you know what i'm saying i don't think people will ever like think oh if i go do my job and just tell the dude something as simple as put on a face mask this person is going to get so mad it's like when you go to a restaurant or something and people just start arguing or whatnot like bro they're just doing their job but like when you go to verizon and you're already like arguing with the person about the phone like at the end of the day they're just they're doing their job it's not their fault your phone's not working it's not their fault the business is being whack like they're just they're collecting a paycheck doing what they're told to you know it's not their company so you could be like oh it's your fault and then take it out on them you know man and talking about all this [ __ ] bro to all my youngsters out there bro yeah i stopped being so [ __ ] with the pistols bro like i i understand keeping the strap on you so you don't get caught slacking like if somebody pulled a strap out on you and you got your strap and you had no yours boom like i understand that type of situation but bruh i don't get why we're in a generation where people were so [ __ ] people were so scared to fight people are so scared to get their ass beat that they'd rather squeeze that trigger instead instead of throwing hands and just owning whatever comes out of it yeah go watch the movie friday and i just i don't know like that's just whack to me it's just like bro it's real talk bro like y'all got beef with people bro just go throw hands bro ain't no need for anybody to get killed bro like sometimes the beef ain't even like you know what i'm saying or something not even worth your throwing hands sometimes not even worth your throwing hands i get it but i'm just saying it gets to that point though if it's to that point where you feel like i have to go you know i have to go prove my point or i have to go then then just go fight them you know what i said and even then bro even fighting you're really putting yourself in a crazy situation because okay everybody thinks that a fight it's all about as long as i don't get my ass beat bro you can kill somebody in the fight unknowingly you can drop them the wrong way you can like do something do one punch you know what i'm saying and that one punch starts to stops their heart like there's still a lot of things to it that you want to consider but i mean that's all i'm saying like that's how i grew up though i grew up like if you had a problem you go to the park and if that dude beat your ass last week you don't go the next day with the [ __ ] glock and go blow his head up it's like you [ __ ] wait a week and you go back the neck no no no no no no [ __ ] me you waited we go back the next week and then i want to rematch see if you beat my ass last time we're going again training you know i know but a lot of people don't see it that way like for example if you drop the gun and you're like let me go handle this throw hands you end up beating him right then a lot of people don't know how to take an l yeah don't get up pop grass right there like yeah they're not gonna wait till next [ __ ] week i'm saying they're gonna go back home that second and get the strap if they wanted to like there's people that really don't know how to take an l you know so at the end of the day just you know what just don't go get into drama don't get into some [ __ ] problems especially with people that are not worth it yeah if you can stay out of it stay out of it but if you go if you don't handle bro i'm saying that don't be so [ __ ] bro like hopefully your enemy isn't that [ __ ] either you know what i'm saying hopefully he that person man enough or woman enough to just say like let's throw these hands let's get it over with and then like let's let's keep living life like what the [ __ ] like i feel like real talk and it's hella hard to see it like this but we are all literally brothers and sisters at the end of the day like that that's what it comes down to we're from different families but we're all this one species of [ __ ] human beings like that [ __ ] ain't going to change it'd be hella dope if we were all united yeah if people weren't like we would create a lot more we would be a lot more successful if people were less oh let's be egotistic and let's go against each other or let's try to compete to who's the boss and who's on top and but talking about all of these fights um the homie payway tto just threw hands where's my phone at what's right here the homie i don't even know how i put down the homie pay way to through hands um my girl actually hasn't seen the video at all i know he just told me like before we turned on the camera he's like oh i want you to see this video so we can react to it i was like bet yeah so i'm about to play it first of all shout out to uh t.o hey bro give it to you bro you know i'm saying i i give it to you for this i give it to you for not being [ __ ] i give it to you for handling yours and for not just being a rapper and you know what i'm saying by just being a rapper [ __ ] get on the beat and talk all this ass and then in real life be like they run i don't want the smoke you know what i'm saying in real life they run oh yeah that's looking good all right here all right so i have the video on my phone but as i play it on my phone i'm gonna have it playing on the screen for you guys for you guys to watch it as well all right hold on you're gonna have to put it like no i want to hold it like this so you can see it they can see it i'm gonna have it for them on screen okay they'll be fine they can see it good do his slides off he's like i give it to him i wouldn't want to fight his slides either i would throw mines off too he's still slick though i don't know who that dude is right there that dude trying to pull him off damn he's still here he's saying [ __ ] [ __ ] wait i want to know if that dude in the white did he walk up with t.o oh he didn't walk up with tio it looks like he wants stop grabbing him stop grabbing him yeah just let them [ __ ] do whatever they want to do see no grabbing no grabbing like bro get the [ __ ] off of him bro like get him off get them off you see if this is a real fight bro and you're gonna have nobody around bruh if you have nobody around to be get him off me get him off me [ __ ] would have choked you out you passed out and that's what happens in the real you know what i'm saying like there's a whole car passing by or what oh no that's probably the dude he pulled up in it how are you talking [ __ ] bro just got your ass beat he's the one that was saying all this [ __ ] right right right you either kill b it's your [ __ ] he just it's none that's it yeah but look he's they're saying that that's embarrassing that's embarrassing because he got up and he walked away but in all reality bro if homie and the white wanted to keep throwing hands right he would have walked he would have kept going after him he didn't want to throw hands either they were both exhausted and you know why because [ __ ] don't train bro people don't work out people have about 50 seconds of energy all right now we're gonna now we're gonna kind of slow-mo through this clip so i'm just kind of scroll it so we're gonna kind of scroll back right now so they're walking up to him right you got your three camera guys you got your camera guy on the left you got a camera guy on the right and i think that dude in the far back is the only guy that's with the dude in the white um but then it starts off the dude in the white [ __ ] up right here he looks at the other dude which i mean that could have happened to anybody because this other dude looks like he's about to do something you know this other dude looks like he's about to do something so he looks at the other guy the second looks at the other guy tio did exactly what he was supposed to do look in a in a [ __ ] fight like a boxing match or some other [ __ ] people would have been like this is dirty you don't do this [ __ ] in a street fight bro you always got to be the first one to throw a punch and if you already know it's about to go down and you have the chance because that [ __ ] look left you better suck that boy bro cause it's a street fight bro like no rules exist so the dude looks t.o kind of gets down now t.o bro this is the only advice i got to give to you bro if you want to throw a strong punch don't don't throw your hand all the way back like that like you see how you kind of went over his head a little bit i mean i know you connected with him but homie still had the chance to kind of to duck you hit like the back of his head also your feet kind of like flew forward when you did that like your whole body was a little off balance um i know that's that adrenaline rush though bro that's like that adrenaline is [ __ ] going through you so you're just trying to like not get knocked out but like for all my other people watching bro if you're going to get in a fight and you want to throw a strong punch and a fast one going around like that it's a weak it's a way weaker punch throw a straight punch like you know what i'm saying you'll really [ __ ] somebody up if you're right in front of me but [ __ ] throws a hand you know so he throw he throws the right then he lets the left kind of swing it looks like the left didn't really connect too well then the other dude kind of grabs teo's head like pushes his head a little bit tio gets up they kind of back away you know this is good this is this was good on t.o's and i feel like he hit he hit and he's like i'm back i'm back i'm a back i'm a back you know what i'm saying um like guys that's a good thing to do another dude was like [ __ ] [ __ ] this is going down so he takes his slides off right right here this other duke should have took off on ceo i don't know why he waited this long trying to get his hands up trying to like you know what i'm saying and again look look this is so scared right before the punch goes in teal doesn't even throw anything and look how he's blocking already he's not even throwing punches he's just blocking he's blocking he gets too close to tio tio timed him out to knew he was walking to him and he throws again this time this dude backs out but look at how off-balance this guy is both of them low-key but at least he was throwing [ __ ] though didn't throw one punch then he falls now how did he fall out did he'll punch him when he found he tripped him oh no i think he hit him with his right look you see right hand kind of goes under and right there you see hits him with the right bot straight to the jaw homie goes down right there tio you shouldn't need the [ __ ] out that cat bruh but straight knees you should have kicked him right there bro i woulda oh my god bro you could have stomped on this boy bro i'm serious like you could have got two feet in the air and just jump straight on top of his head or something i don't know that's what but boy you see right here this was on the floor like right there straight knee to the head bad i would have slept that boy he was waiting for it too and he didn't he wanted to go straight back to the hands so that's when like they kind of stopped by the hair am i tripping like it's almost like it looked like he picked him up or something i don't know if he grabbed him by the hair he almost looked like he had like i mean he basically just holds him in a lock now to the other dude that you're out here like trying to pull teo away bro look bro just just let them you know they were actually like punching yeah like let it be bro like why are you getting in the middle of this bro since when do street fights have a [ __ ] referee people start pulling up with the whole crew i mean like i don't know i just i feel like for a situation like that you gotta let them handle it bro you gotta you know unless look unless it's your homie right and your homies on the floor and somebody's just destroying him boom boom boom boom and you're seeing that your homie isn't moving or reacting to anything i think that's the only right time for you to go in and be all right bro like you proved your point you know what i'm saying you did your thing like it's done like get the [ __ ] out you know what i'm saying even if you're homie bro if you're seeing your homies just on the floor have somebody and he's just smacking this [ __ ] you got to break it up for your homie's sake because what if your homie ends up killing this [ __ ] goes to jail for life you know what i'm saying so that's the only time i feel like people should really go in but if people are tussling like even with the um that smooth geophyte geo couldn't throw hands for [ __ ] because not look let me tell you something the other guy couldn't throw hands either but the other guy was more collective that's the reason he never [ __ ] fell like he was a lot more calm if you really look back at the fight and you see he was calm the whole time he kept his distance he was letting [ __ ] smooth geo just tire himself out jill had too much adrenaline running through him but i feel like what [ __ ] up geo was people separating them and pulling them apart yeah but julia was way heavier than him so geo could have easily picked him up and slammed him on the floor and it would have been over like see for skinny people for i'm not skinny but i'm not that skinny no more but for light people bruh that's the biggest downfall is that even if you're a good ass fighter bro in a street fight bro if that person just grips you bruh and picks you up and slams you it's like damn you know it's a hard one to bounce back from yeah um and i'm saying it from experience i've been picked up and slammed when you get picked up and slammed bro you don't your whole world goes upside down like you don't even know what the [ __ ] is going on you feel me so that's how i see that and for my big people don't step sit there and just try to exchange blows you're big you want me to throw fast punches like you're big you're you're supposed to you know what i'm saying use what you got be a quarterback basically like run at this dude [ __ ] drop like you know have you has anybody ever ran up to you and like hit you like this really push you with their body weight yeah and they will drop you yeah like if somebody runs at you and really throws their body weight at you that [ __ ] will [ __ ] make it so imagine yeah so imagine being like a hundred pounds over somebody and that person's 100 pounds lighter than you that's like a little kid if you run at that person and you hit him that person is gonna [ __ ] fly bro that person is gonna go flying like you feel me that's why like bruh as a short person if i'm gonna fight a big person you're not gonna be there to be like i'm here to do a show no you're there to do what you got to do and get the [ __ ] out get yourself out of the situation like keep it moving you know what i'm saying throw the hardest [ __ ] four punches five punches you got then get the [ __ ] out of there and leave drop it real quick i just that's how i see it like you don't if somebody like okay no matter how big they are right and you hit that [ __ ] real quick the [ __ ] five fastest strongest punches you got in you no matter what how big they are you're gonna daze them the [ __ ] out so now you got this big ass human that's all dazed out bro you can run circles around him he'll never touch you anymore but my biggest advice is just leave and that person being hurt already they're not gonna you know unless your punches were weak and they were like oh [ __ ] you now you little [ __ ] like now you're getting changed now you're gonna get [ __ ] up but if you make your punches worth it you can you can do just enough damage to get the [ __ ] out of there or if you do it just right bro you might knock them out silly i've seen it happen too but i don't know man i think i should too much information to y'all man i don't want my enemies watching this [ __ ] and be like [ __ ] really doing it was he really gonna for my fans like you know what i'm saying at the end of the day like even if my [ __ ] enemies hear this [ __ ] bro it'll promise you bro it'll all go out the window when it starts because this is how it goes like 99 of people aren't in fights or they don't train they don't even do something as simple as like box or or spar in some sort of different combat sport so when it all starts their adrenaline's rushing and the only thing they can do is their natural reactions but they can't even use their brain like they don't know what to do they're they're just you know instincts and the instinct of survival kicks in but i feel like for people that fight enough like andre has explained it best to me shout out to the homie he was like bro it's like you see it in slow-mo and they just think you crazy bro like i have never and it's because i was too excited i was too much i had too much adrenaline every time i was gonna fight but when you really slow the [ __ ] down and you're like your head's in the right place you could literally see everything like you can clearly see their moves and it's so clear and it gives you so much time to like get the [ __ ] out the way you know what i'm saying i don't know maybe it's just something you develop as you [ __ ] as you keep training as you keep training yeah yeah because no y'all be moving fast as [ __ ] i don't know how to [ __ ] you slow-mo i'll be trying to like do that like look at the segundo slo-mo and that's how i end up getting knocked out because i'm just like i think it's kind of like driving like when you get good at driving you can start driving a little faster but you're seeing it and when something happens is like you react to it really quick because you have those you know it's in your head like to just react to it and and because experience because of experience yeah so i feel like it's the same way with like fighting like if you have enough years of somebody throwing their hand at your face to hurt you you you must start moving a couple times and after you start moving and you start getting it like it just starts natural so even when a punch comes at you and you don't even see it coming your brain will react for you because you've done that reflection so many times so you know what i'm saying like it's crucial bro if you get if you're getting your ass be in fights that's your fault you should have trained you weren't training you know instead of wasting money on anything else go buy some gloves go buy your trainer ain't [ __ ] putting some work boy cause the world is harsh and real and this is not for you to go out there and [ __ ] people up or especially like your enemies like not this is like for when you know [ __ ] just goes down out of nowhere and [ __ ] your hands is all you got you know what i'm saying you gotta really check you or your family bro like what if it's your family what if somebody's trying to do something to the people around you you don't want to be in a situation where like you can't even protect them or like do your part you know [ __ ] that like you want to be able to knock them out with the one too you feel me but yeah yo shout out to payday y'all check out his youtube channel uh go stream his

very first review i just want to say before I get into the actual product I just want to say that you know I I barely got my medical card not too long ago and one thing I don't really see by illinois' med strange there's hardly any information out there on Google or on YouTube that's very few of youtubers out there but I feel like there should be more and you know Here I am I'm gonna be doing mostly flower reviews but uh today I actually got a pen I just want to show you guys so I got a fresco of lab Spanish Cresco cookies yeah it's pretty much Girl Scout cookies fresco just pretty much green it's a hybrid but it's a cheap of dominating this is Austin looking for not really a big not really a big disposal tank kind of guy or just any type of pen kind of guy but I like to have one just keep on going I'm in a public place where I can't burn flour you know and yeah that's why I actually bother you the THC levels on this bad boy are 75% they'll see me at all it's hoping they go pretty easy to open up just twist a little twist pretty neat little disposable pan doesn't have a push-button all you had to do is pretty much inhaling good job bringing the pound let's try it out yet just want to show you guys when it when you hit one lights up you know like a regular vape pen not a medical one definitely a Girl Scout taste I would say it's pretty potent and punchy like when you smoke it you know there's some vape cards that you can't really smell the like the marijuana taste but with this one it's pretty noticeable even when you blow it out you can smell it definitely a girl's got to he's real potent taste the cannabis in there and you can't really hide it but it's pretty good pretty good apart nice and tasty definitely hit oh yeah there you have it crest cold refresh but yeah there'll be more to come more videos to come first of many for the most part I'll be doing a flower but start do something easy you know something start off pretties for me just break the ice break the barrier yeah I look forward to more reviews and don't forget to subscribe like comment alright thank you", "RsxL412U_6U": "this video was recorded in a legal state in its intended for 21 plus or 18 with the medical cards thank you and enjoy the video [Music] we got another Susie pod review actually decided we're gonna [ __ ] review all of Susie pods for you guys but when we go to see like what I see where at least three or four I've weed yeah and that's bad because I see I see people go pick up in bulk so they don't do that but we happen to pick up in bulk and then we still have to go pick up and then we don't pick up in bulk and we still need to go [ __ ] Picasso it's the same situation but order so we're doing in the COS first we reviewed oh gee coach last week so this time it's purple Pines but which is monkey like my second favorite streamers dizzy yeah purple plunge is no joke up there it's up there with OG Kush and something with OG Kush when she's definitely out there competing with all of them don't see though on [ __ ] oh all right so we got it picked up a half round this time we usually get the four grand this one does have a lot of CBD which is what I like too you got a little bit of that see do you feel the CBD though that's like a psych bra you can't tell me I have 100% CBD and it's like okay brother that's why but you're not supposed to feel it it's just supposed to like I know but it's like I just like there's something yeah you love knowing that there's something in there as facts don't get fooled people though like not like that be like let's see what them anyways alright quick hey I won't tell you know yeah we need to get here before any of this [ __ ] because I realized a bunch of the videos are lame as [ __ ] cuz we don't smoke it up and you remember watching old weak tubers and then you would think I brawl shut the [ __ ] up just hit it he doesn't yeah so what kind of doing the same I know [Music] it's for sure smoother than the OG curve and it has a my opinion better better taste good cush it also added this little tropical taste but this one seems more more like for punching no yeah that's what I'm gonna say look up here reads tropical punch flavor and on the OG Kush it reads it reads rainbow flavor so they're both going for like a really really fruity flavor which is a rare something different a different it's kind of it's risky to do first it's risky first easy to do to try to get a flavorful oh gee because you know how people they are with the oh geez I want it straight okay watch they just just I exactly and people still manage to love no I would you cut like myself oh there's not all G cut review this purple point so yeah the flavor just like the other videos we're gonna raid it out of ten so the flavor would you rate it out of 10 labor actually I would do what I could eight point five to nine if I hit high nine no no not a point five eight one five eight point five final answer for favored 58.5 you guys haven't tried the purple punch go ahead and pick it up I wouldn't damn okay let me ask you this how would you compare it to like the sleepness I like this lg cush if you know how the og cush is that [ __ ] is no joke but this one is more if you're if you should like to be feeling mellow throughout the day but you don't want to get something like I have to be in the couch just having to take a nap through this if you want to [ __ ] take a little nap or it's time to go to sleep get yourself the whole G Kush and the really Dutch bump you it takes your whole body down and take your hat down it's it's a really heavy high well this one is more of a it's a it's a heavy hot but it still gives you this energy to do [ __ ] isn't it no I just Reina gonna see isn't a hybrid there's just straight indigo we're doing indicas first I just took a dull blinking one but [ __ ] Rufus back we also are how boxing because we realized we couldn't do a video at our house at her house yeah we complained about in the last video but yeah we had to come to a parking lot to make this video for you guys so drop a like if you guys enjoyed this video at all for sure another lying [ __ ] at Tony let you guys know how it tastes you let you know how it compares to the old you cush I want to speak on you can't see it in the video cards have a smoke Union and I have this really bad habit allowing to spit after I take a really fat ass hit low key I was just gonna cut my address because I'm feeling it slowly creeping in more and more so I thought it was already like don't let me but now I'm starting to like feel it more and then more well that is true the highest very different and sensor yeah this one's not gonna smack you sleep you in 20 seconds yeah the [ __ ] is gonna like slowly increasingly get higher and higher and higher which in my opinion let me wrong I love being smacking points in second foot I don't know there's something about like like gradually getting higher that [ __ ] you up mores because you're not smack smack smack see like what the Freak keep hitting it yeah cuz you're like what the [ __ ] is not hitting I don't see you know you're [ __ ] it all hits out 1 2 your [ __ ] out if I had to rate the taste out of 10 I would not whatever I rate the og was part of like a [ __ ] 10 and 9 but I would rate this I like bateman's a little time I thought that's pretty good it wasn't too harsh it is a lot smoother but I would say has although it's called purple punching you would expect like a bigger punch of flavor that's like it doesn't have as strong as a taste as the OG Kush and that's the only thing I'm gonna compare it to right now because I know you guys are gonna come in with y'all haven't tried the Bluebirds you ever tried this sure Nana believe me I have like those are flavorful as [ __ ] but talking in the car like I thought the og it has more of a flavor than this one this one tastes more like like you said like it is smoother but I thought it's four reasons because like there isn't much to work with you given it's just perfect on strike yeah me I don't know how to explain it like I taste it right now and I thought it was because I took two blinkers on once and there's a reason why I couldn't get a good good taste book I just make the right now and it just tasted like smooth small like I didn't really have something there like sure I know I know my head goes to like tropical yeah but it's like you don't get that strong purple like taste yeah I don't I really don't yeah yeah like you get more of a purple taste on the og in my opinion yeah so the flavor I would say it's like a seven hot like a eight eight yeah like a I'm never gonna talk about I'm never gonna get to be honest I don't wanna I was always say I probably won't give Stacy ever a bad grade on the taste cuz they're tasting it's always just clear nice smoke but I already know on that which one Scott Walker yeah I was gonna say I also say I was gonna speak to something good I wasn't thinking as far as I walk around seeing him [ __ ] nasty eyes bloopers all my I haven't even gotten a blooper I forgot she brought that [ __ ] is like that when did we get a less now I don't know but I remember I didn't have a good know I'm ever I told you that I don't wants to love from like too much taste and my knowledge [ __ ] I was like bro it tasted like I like was sucking okay that's day I was like sucking on like a million different flavor like Jolly Ranchers or like it was just too much flavor yeah I was like what the [ __ ] is going even like what is even going on [ __ ] bloopers okay now I'm gonna make this a blue burst hey buddy oh yeah perfect flange tastes amazing the smack just like telling you say which I love so I would give that [ __ ] like a eight or nine I [ __ ] love it because they just gave me a ride all the time it's amazing I love her lunch and omerod all brought have instead of rolling over all what I les I have a list of our top fives that are gonna be in there okay all right now right now you would have just the og cush and if you want to throw this one in but I mean there's no secret we used to pick up all I would say but that's because we never really would we're now inside our here we always look for the same only [ __ ] sure sure when janaab not bad because that's what we like but there's this series of trying to every city potter is really gonna make us try every like make us see what's really out there because i feel like there's some flavors i haven't even tried glow just thinking the same thing there's some [ __ ] I'm pretty sure stuff they're strange we haven't tried it has to be I'm hyped on the hike [ __ ] yeah I'm gonna take one more here Tony's gonna take it one more blinker and we're gonna get to [ __ ] about it here a couple more videos in this in this little spot cuz I like it it's away from everything and not yes like anybody I'm gonna take this blinker and get the [ __ ] outta here

watching we'll see in the next one", "m6eD8kvGuTg": "today we're smoking space coyotes five pack sativa infused joints uh first things i should tell you about this is they rotate the flour that is in these and they rotate the extract or live resin that is in this depending on what they have at the time so you can't you can't bank on it being the same flower every single time you buy it there's a good chance that that the insides will definitely change and rotate depending on what's available but i absolutely love this idea i think it's super freaking cool to just like do a package of five joints and you just brand the box and then slap a different sticker on the back for like what's in it and this is your this is like the five package joints that you buy you don't know what kind of flour you're getting or you just like ask before you buy it um in this case it is gmo root beer and lemon bean resin this was a super [ __ ] good combination of like strains or flour and extra or live resin they balance it so there's a 93 percent herb and 7 percent live resin in each joint and they all weigh half a gram each so there's five total in this package they come in a like this really nice metal tin you can see silhouettes and mountains there's a moon on the front and then on the back there's it says blazed blazed glazed blaze totally cosmic um inside if i can get this open inside so normally there's five joints i've smoked a few of them already but inside you would have all five of your joints carefully packaged my favorite thing about this or this package is i can carry this in my backpack if i go on a hike i can put in my disc golf bag if i go play disc golf i can put it in my pocket if i'm just walking around town and i don't have to worry about my packaging being squished i know that my product or my joints are going to be safe and i can't even recycle this now and put my own hand rolled joints in it and have a perfect tin for carrying those around with me they use field extracts in there as their infusion pretty sure they grow their own flour um but anyways these are our space coyotes sativa or five sativa infused joints be sure to check them out on social media follow respect my region on social media and check out all the rest of our reviews for the west coast we tour on youtube on instagram and on our website respectmyregion.com", "KOtZ3v8t3s8": "plus five and everybody boys I hope my neighbors are at home but I'm sure that they are boy we finally get late in today's video I feel so awkward right now I don't know why but welcome back to video hope you guys are having an amazing day today and if not I hope my video is able to make your day a little bit brighter I'm super duper excited for today's video I not only have half a blind I'm so butthurt you guys I have shout out to King palms send me more because I thought that I was too cool for school and that I didn't like hemp blunts and that I only like tobacco blunts but after smoking so many tobacco blunts and getting like headaches I [ __ ] with the king poems and so I try to like stuff it and I had it ready and when I was walking out here to set up my little filming it broke in half like literally in half so lively and as type [ __ ] I got a little Roach first a smoke and then I also got a bomb muhfucka a drink this is so refreshing you already know I got that double cup because honey Google today is a multiple game for toy edible loot bag video oh yes we've heard it here part two part two the first thing I pulled out is this rice krispies treat this is what it looks like I don't think the cameras focusing on it but looks like this this is one of my favorite edible but I feel like rice krispie treats and like treats like this like cereal bars I feel like they never hit me awhile back I went to dabba thon and I bought a 400 milligram at a bowl and it really didn't do much to me so yeah I have eaten this before in a my part 1 video but it was by a different brand I like to try all kinds of different brands and none of them seem to hit me too well but they're super super tasty so if you're more in it for the taste these are both then I got some soft beat thugs I never tried this brown before so I'm SuperDuper excited I love trying new brands of all kinds of different things and especially freaking edibles so in my part 1 video I had some different brand of chips so where is pretty much the same thing wheat hot cheetos and these have a hundred and fifty milligrams in this whole bag this has 500 milligrams so you got a great fight I also got oh my gosh I am so excited for this you guys these are sour belts candies and I love blue raspberry like flavored candies like airheads the blue but skittles the blade skittles is a happening but like anything blue and this is blue so I'm really I'm really stoked and I've heard from a lot of people that these were really really bomb so they hyped me up they hyped me up when I went to go get this stuff I was hyped up to try this because I guess you only eat one or two strips and you get super high but I have a high tolerance so honey a 300 milligram one or two bites is not gonna do me justice but if it tastes bomb I'm with the ships and then this is more my style you already know we might beat us this is a freaking la lucha that lon mmm okay so I really want you to this like right now okay I also got for the last but not least you guys oh by the way this has a hundred and ten milligrams so a little bit over 100 milligrams my everything really so last time we did a lemonade edible for the drink in the first new thing and then for this time I really needed to freakin go in with the 1200 milligram THC syrup because I've tried to CV syrup I've tried codeine I tried it all you know and I even tried filming a video trying this but in the fruit punch flavor and YouTube decided to delete my video so you know LBD famine stoppable honey and I came back with a great flavor so when I went to the dispensary and they had grave I was like put back on my shopping list cuz I gotta try so I'm really hyped up for this honestly like I'm pretty pretty pretty pretty hyped it's 1,200 milligrams this is the most potent edible I've ever seen on the market and that I've ever consumed you guys have seen probably my previous videos of me eating a thousand milligrams brownies trying to do my makeup and all kinds of different things and I really am NOT a fan of brownies and you know I like the rice krispies treats but they just don't hit me as hard you know sour belts are bomb but I usually like little gummies or something but something like there's like a beverage gets you so [ __ ] up you guys if you ever want to try any of one of these edibles please try the syrup do yourself favorite so I'm just gonna hop right in by mixing up our syrup because I'm just so hyped so I have my double cup my my sprite with my sprite and yeah oh actually I'm gonna take a thumbnail damn taking it thumbnails kind of hard okey-dokey well I literally could wake up the whole neighborhood anyways step yeah just so you guys know like what time it is it is 12:30 exactamente 12:30 exactly so let's see how long it takes for these edibles to hit why don't we first gotta you know consumed that no mm-hmm so I have this syrup I'm gonna just shake it because I bet you it's been sitting for a minute make sure you shake that hole nice and dandy Wow look at the cap it looks like th season there alright I'm gonna show you guys up close personality wait it off when you have no groups and you don't want a nip slip it's kind of a brown I wish it was a prettier shade okay so I used a lot I don't know if I'm gonna like this one I'm licking the syrup and taste a great I don't know okay so a lot of people like to come at me like dest you swear like you're sipping lean Jaime its [ __ ] syrup same base okay therefore you're supposed to make like I want my [ __ ] to be mixed honey mixed Loki I'm making a mess [Applause] pretty mother [ __ ] bomb I can literally see the THC in my soda like it kind of looks green like if I wish you guys could see it but it literally looks like wax on my ice it looks good though it doesn't look like what the [ __ ] is in my cup it looks like ooh that's bad again me so so far so good you guys I would give this syrup a 10 out of 10 if I had to pick one edible that's like my favorite edible technically it would be the syrup because [ __ ] bring your spray whether you're going to [ __ ] Six Flags [ __ ] Disneyland like no I'm just kidding I don't know if you're a lot of bringing drinks to Disney but sticks legs I know you're allowed to bring your own drinks honey so best believe I'm putting this in like a little canister my hydro flask I actually just recently ordered a hydro flask for college and I guess I have a six like season pass so if any of you guys are trying to go please hit me up cuz I ain't got no homies to go with and I'm fine I bring this Sara you know pour up and a hydro guess you popular okay um I don't know should I smoke or should I eat the rest of the edibles this is a mute thing I guess I should just use edibles you know I have to try that you guys I I've been dying to try these hot cheetos like I said I've tried different brands and other Browns were bombed on fire so let's see if this Alito's friends compares hmm ooh smells like like a [ __ ] spicy cheese ball with a little bit of weed it doesn't really smell like weed though that's what it looks like got a [ __ ] hot cheeto this [ __ ] looks like our normal hot cheeto it tastes just like the other ones hmm these ones were a little bit cheaper cuz the other ones I tried were 300 milligrams these are only 150 milligrams so less potency the artist Lee is still super bomb hmm smoking a blunt eating your chips and then sipping your [ __ ] lien just kidding tasty syrup it doesn't get better than this you guys like Yuki a highest [ __ ] by sipping this this tastes so good it tastes like a grape flavored sprite I love it I kind of want to add more syrup you added to do it just so I could be like really [ __ ] up you killed me cuz this is 1,200 milligrams like the big if I wouldn't take any of the other edibles and I just drank this I would be dead I would be dead but the fact that I'm eating this and I'm eating edibles like Wow I never even added up the amount of milligrams that I'm consuming but let's see 150 the syrup is 1200 I probably won't drink the entire bottle of syrup because I want to mix it also in this sprite I'm going to a family party later at a pool best believe I won't be chilling by the pool with my sprite so later I'm gonna finish the rest of that but right now I'm putting like just the perfect amount I actually added a lot more so I'm gonna mix it so 1213 50 and then the rice krispies is 500 milligrams so B 1850 and then the sour belts these are three hundred so that'll be 2150 yeah and then this is a hundred and ten oh my gosh oh honey wait twenty one fifty plus one ten twenty one fifty plus one and 21 carry the one twenty to sixty right I'm already feeling it now I'm just getting back right am i right I believe it's around 20 160 so 2,000 160 milligrams that's insane other thing mmm and these chips are so bomb if you guys like to medicate but like microdose EPS look like a sandwich and you'll be chillin won't I'm obsessed with these chips homie bomb but else is gonna say oh yeah somebody tried commenting in my other neat thing video saying that Oh a thousand milligrams ain't [ __ ] that's equivalent to one gram honey honey honey let me just sit my soda these are spicy I got the extra flamin hot ones they had regular hot ones and I got the extra hot superbomb um honey what the [ __ ] you talking about 100 1000 milligrams is one gram I'm not trying to call you out or anything much love to you but you have nothing but good intentions but that's just insane hundred milligrams is equivalent to one grab so eating a 100 milligram edible like this most likely since its 110 they used about a gram and a half maybe probably less than that excuse me they probably used about a gram to make this to make this now they used a hundred grams to make it a thousand milligrams but it's actually more than a thousand to this 1200 so there's more than that for this 300 milligram edible it's around 3 grams do you feel me you feel what I'm feeling so yeah 500 about 5 grams so as a human as a [ __ ] Union who smokes every [ __ ] day you know once I get to the first second balloon I'll be chilling so it's about 4 grams in you know the third blender mice so that's around five grams of weed so evening around 500 milligrams of an edible will get me pretty chilling but like I said the Rice Krispies don't usually hit me but that's why it 100 milligram edibles don't really hit me because if I only smoke one blood one gram I'm not gonna get that high cuz I have a high tolerance but for someone who never smokes and eats even 20 milligrams of an edible will be super fun but you know it's not always about the number it's kind of about well what's your what's your past like what's your what's your tolerance like have you tried edibles before did you smoke a lot but you've never tried edibles like yeah oh okay so I'm trying to open these and I'm super excited to try these these are the styler belts damn if I can even open it wrong it smells like cotton candy let's try it I know that flavour rx makes some like these I mean my sister tried I may really like them hmm sour I don't like sour candy but I did it for the bike for the milk bank drop them on the floor five-second rule hello wrong number wrong number the [ __ ] why you calling my phone yeah so I was told that if you eat one or two of these you'll be [ __ ] up so I'm kind of gonna save them so I can eat one or two and see if I get [ __ ] up but today I just wanted to try them out and they're pretty bomb you guys like they don't taste like weed at all none of these edibles so far it tastes like weed I hate edibles that tastes like weed I've gotten hate in my past videos where I eat the 1000 milligram brownie because people are like why are you gagging so much like it's not even that bad the honey of course you're not gonna [ __ ] know because you ain't the one eating it but when I was eating it it tasted like I was eating weed and that [ __ ] tastes bad you know this it tastes like I'm eating a [ __ ] airheads and I get high smoke it was so that shit's pretty tight same with the chips it tastes like regular hot cheetos you know it doesn't taste like I'm eating them a nug so I feel like that's really important when it comes to edibles it's just like at least for me personally is like one is it gonna get me [ __ ] up - is it gonna taste like [ __ ] cuz I don't care if it gets me [ __ ] up if it tastes like [ __ ] tastes like [ __ ] and I don't care if they taste bomb if it doesn't get me [ __ ] up you know that's again [ __ ] up so this is the little logic become behind the life beam des and me picking my edibles knees are pretty bummed I like the blueberry I like the flavor it doesn't taste like weed aiyo there's a little hit of an aftertaste but not really stay what's on my Cheetos you know like you're gonna get those little aftertaste but it's not bad at all if I could tolerate it you could part ollar a because I have a really bad like if it tastes like weed I won't eat it I'll give it away straight up and that's right today I didn't buy any brownies because brownies and cookies no matter what Brad how potent it is you know I've eaten the thousand milligram IV the 100 milligrams from the best friends from kirova to enjoyable - lol edibles like I tried it all and I'm just not a fan of the cookies and brownies especially because when you make a fresh batch of cookies at home how long do those cookies taste bomb for you guys for the first [ __ ] five minutes that those cookies come out the oven after 5 minutes those cookies taste like hard [ __ ] breaks and they're not bomb same with the [ __ ] edibles they're gonna have it in the refrigerator for months weeks months years and then you're eating it and it's hard and it's just it's not like a fresh bomb [ __ ] cookie so until I find a company who makes a bomb cookie that's like super potent I'm gonna stay away from the baked goods I really like these though these are really really really good really good and I'm not a fan of sour candy I'm not a fan of candy I have a sweet tooth too but I have it in a way where like I crave hot cheetos I'm not one to crave chocolate or sour candy and like skills like every time I go to the gas station I don't buy candy I buy water and chips super spicy chips and water so I don't I don't pass out I want to spark my blood already but I still have two more edibles to try freeze so I'm gonna try this one I'm super excited for this one this says Tama reand oh so this is a tambourine dough you guys if I ever have a me angry I'm gonna have a pinata and it's gonna be filled of these you know let's give it a gander my shirts already [ __ ] up this should taste like [ __ ] there's like a bunch of the product in the cap like that's already my 50 milligrams right there homie the [ __ ] this edible is too messy honestly it's not even that it tastes bad it's just that it's so hard to eat pbbbbbt I remember being little and thinking that was so fun to like push up these like normal candy I says it has sugar chili THC extract caramel citric acid I'm an enol egg corn product that's so weird I don't like it I'm kind of like like I don't know it's kind of like when you think about it it's like yeah like caramel and like what else did you see corn acid the [ __ ] Beach I bought this for you guys honestly I thought that maybe you guys would want to see it and it was like unique and it was cheap so 300 milligrams but honestly I don't really [ __ ] with it I wouldn't buy this to be like Tiki I wanna get high like no [ __ ] I'd rather just buy a topic rather by the sour Bell just cuz that's so much easier to eat like this it's already coming out from like the bottom right here it's all over the cap okay you guys have one more edible to try and that is this Wow crisps fruit [ __ ] so it looks like this I tried all kinds of different brands of the same Mountain milligrams oh I guess smell the weed I get smelly smells beautiful these are my favorite he's like if I can eat this every day I would Bob this is pretty bomb I really do like it it tastes a little bit like weed though out of all the edibles here I think this one smells the most like eat and taste the most like lead so really full all right you guys honestly [ __ ] the [ __ ] my camera just stopped recording for some random ass reason probably cuz I'm taking too damn long but let us spark my roach I haven't smoked all day and I honestly do love smoking obviously do love smoking but like I'm not an addict no but like you know you could eat edibles all day you know get high as [ __ ] whatever whatever but I like smoking like I like smoking my ganja and chillin so we finally get turned up on the life being dead you kill me I know you do wait I think I was imminent just to get to the big bucks ain't got no bad intentions just occupation I don't know how to so I'm gonna go do something productive like that but I hope you guys enjoyed this video I'm gonna take a little bite of everything before I go whoa first book is 10 o'clock so I'll be back at 10:30 and then it would be like an official power ok maybe at like little past we'll see yeah it's so [ __ ] saying hey I really want to go to sleep like I feel so [ __ ] tired I just I probably look all like dead right now but

"Ehur9uFryow": "[Music] oh all right let's go to YouTube so back at it again with another video guys men now let me tell you guys something real quick all right let me tell you guys something so I

started off cool the lighting was cool and then literally within five minutes the [ __ ] Sun sets so quick and then I was literally just dark you guys can barely see me and things like that so I was like you know what man I rewatched and I was like dude I'm not happy with this video I'm gonna go ahead and remake you for the boys so it's gonna it's not gonna be an unboxing cuz we can't do an unboxing because we already opened it so for today's video guys we're back on the rug Arden wave as usual man and we got the uke I'd punch number 72 right here sitting at 80 percent THC 2.0 milligrams of CBD you already know the deal man right here let's get it and this one was packaged on nine ten just a little over a month ago man and this wasn't sitting pretty clean like I said I already opened it man I got it sitting on the Pocket vapor battery right here boys look at that I've put a little dent in it yesterday we were taking some fat Ripper Reno's for you guys so that that's why there is an air bubble there so before we get into the review man let me tell you guys I still have an active affiliate link and a code with [ __ ] paper so if you guys are interested in copying this snazzy ass little battery man it's already like 40 to 50 bucks it's a hundred it's fifty dollars cheaper than the cheaper than the vessel battery and it does just the same [ __ ] man and it's a lot sleeker

the raw garden battery I mean before we put it on the pocket battery we might put it on the rug or an battery first so let me go and pop that sucker off for you guys as you guys can see here the proprietary battery for the raw garden cart if you guys everybody rock garden I do recommend tell you guys I do recommend going out and getting this one too if you guys aren't gonna buy the the pocket vapour battery to go ahead and get this one I know it I know it's just like you know no variable wattage and none of that stuff but you know it's a proprietary batter so if you're gonna be buying raw garden cartridges a lot you might as well buy prepared to everybody so go ahead and turn this air off real quick one time for the boys and hope you guys are having an amazing blessed day I know I am - man it's good it's it's been a good couple of good a couple of weeks or me tell you the truth I've been having some time off I've been having time to do things you know and I'm just I'm just happy I'm contented there's no reason to not be content and let's get to it man this thing looks so sleek it's so nice alright you kind of punched number 72 make sure you guys are smoking along with me if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over whatever it is in your legal state man only legal patients only so cheers guys let's see if we get the raw garden logo right there all right so just to touch base on the battery real quick this has literally no airflow whatsoever so when you're hitting it it feels like you're heating a clogged car as for with the pocky battery yes sir holy moly first hit of the day got me no jokes it's already noon and I still have any anything this is my first card of the day but that thing I already got me fade I'm telling you man yesterday was a good video it was a good video but it was just too dark to give it to you guys meant to wait too dark so yeah pocket vapor ultimate airflow dude ultimate [ __ ] airflow all right now now getting into the review boys so right off that initial Wow dude right off that initial hit it did the same thing to me yesterday it tastes a lot like Barry's super super super berry like it I'm for sure it has to have a cross train of purple punch in it because it's super berry super super berry like I'm talking about this the first hit the first initial hit man you're gonna get a pungent in his super mouth filling of berries bro and it's not like artificial berries to it's like you know aftertaste after you drink like after you eat a grape in shading you got the aftertaste of like a grape it's kind of similar man so the taste is [ __ ] phenomenal off this it doesn't really have too much of a cushy vibe to it or too much of like a you know a tree game going but we're gonna hit it maybe we could get something out of it but before we do let's go ahead and switch it onto the king itself the pocket labor battery mint you get the ultimate airflow a nice ass temperature you know get the most out of your cartridge man you guys should be getting up a battery like this how you guys shoot because it makes your experience so much more enjoyable man I know got dry lips excuse that guys all right pocket vapor in now so I think off of this one we're gonna be hitting it off the orange setting I think is or in your setting so I think this is like the middle the middle setting so let's see what let's see how it goes boys just listen I don't know if you guys can listen to this I'm gonna try to get as close as possible but try to listen to the airflow I try to listen to the airflow Oh holy [ __ ] no joke that clapped me that got me boys that got you bought whoa all right that's it that [ __ ] smacked me for sure not gonna be using that setting that's the setting that you put when you want to kill somebody dude seriously are you looking to just get super faded and that wasn't even the hottest setting dude the hottest setting is red I'm about to show you guys one time man I'm about to show you guys one time all right not just let me talk over it so that hey right there you guys heard the maximum airflow right maximum airflow is so [ __ ] nice on a cartridge man like when you're hitting something on a restricted cart like battery it's so horrible man because it's you're literally not getting enough airflow so you're burning up the coil at first of all slowly but surely you're burning up so that's why you get like a weird taste - you're not getting like a super you know fruity taste or whatever your cartridge is supposed to be tasting like it's probably the airflow man you're probably burning up the coil you know and it's just gunking up in there so I do recommend going out and buy this man you already know the deal and if you don't want to buy it man you could be one of the lucky one one person one person is going to be winning one of these right here this color right here right now so I'm gonna be doing a giveaway by the time you guys see this video go ahead and click on my Instagram and go follow my Instagram and pocky vapor and my gaming team prophecy gaming so I'll put all three of those accounts down below and we will be choosing one person win right and we will be giving them away a shirt also so make sure to do that man and tag your friends tag your friends and more people the better and you the more people you tag the better the higher your chances are of winning all right so let's go ahead and hit this on the red setting man cuz that hit was so good so freakin good it tasted so pungent you got me like smacked they literally smacked me right in my face I still know tree like you know no earthy earthy taste to it so this is more likely on the fruitier side of raw garden mmm cheers boys whoo oh my gosh that red setting is amazing oh yes sir oh that thing claps oh you guys need to go buy this right now you guys heard it here first if you're smoking cartridges and you guys don't have this battery you're [ __ ] up oh my gosh that was amazing I'm nyan cat that was amazing this cartridge is sitting literally all right remember to use this this thing is sitting at 80 percent THC right 80 percent total cannabinoids and and all right so let me just do a little let me show you yes and then that last raw garden cartridge that I got was at a 90 right dojo cush it was super amazing so super super smacked but I was getting most of the feeling because it was a cush strain right so that means that this this right here this has absolutely no cush at all in it it's just a bunch of fruity strains that they had that rubber and made up and it's smacking me just as hard if not harder as the dojo cush so it's sitting that at 80 percent THC so doo doo TC percentages really matter is what I'm trying to get at do they really matter or is it what strains they mix it with because tell you the truth I've had [ __ ] 93 percent cartridges and they don't they don't do [ __ ] like I'm dead serious they don't do anything for me so and I've noticed that a lot of lower end TC percentage cartridges smack me like a little like boom like I'm having a session I'm just like out after like 2 to 3 hits so raw garden you're doing phenomenal job with this frickin ucae punch like they're doing such great jobs I know this week they release a lot more flavor so by the time you guys see this I want you guys to hit that notification bill hit that subscribe button because we if you got especially if you smell Kroger mmm because we're gonna be keeping you updated with the weekly flavors and which one you should be getting so let's get it boys I'm gonna take another one on rent and go ahead and end the video out here actually I'll probably take it on the lowest setting that way you guys can see the clouds on that and end it out here and then give you guys the full review on this and get to the movement you know so cheers boys if you guys are 18 over 21 over you already know the deal like I said earlier alright that was a low setting but as you guys could see there and switch to the rainbow colors right it switched to the freakin rainbow colors and that I think from when I remember is like sesh mode and he keeps going after like more than ten seconds that one was super light super light in clouds but the taste oh we super tippy yo I'm telling you guys raw garden damn regarding and pocky vapor or literally the best combination ever so go ahead and use that affiliate code go use that code semi G get 15% off it'll support your boy and it'll chip some money off of your pockets too so let's get it boys I hope let's get into the final review of the raw garden cartridge tell us is true this thing smacks your auger and definitely knows what they're doing I feel like what they're trying to do in order it like yeah they always release new strains but I feel like what they're trying to do they're trying to create a vault of like super specific streams that they like that are super like you know fan favorites and they're gonna be keeping those in the history of lineage of like seeds and stuff like that but you've got punch number 72 is a banger dude it's super berry no it's very very like note honestly no tones of earthiness at all it's more on the berry sweeter side but if you guys have been using raw garden you guys know what kind of like sweetness it is it's not fake it's super super nice like something you would get off of a flower and the hymen the highest phenomenal I would give it an 8 out of 10 tell you the truth like the only reason I wouldn't give it a 10 out of 10 is because I since I have such a high tolerance I feel like it's not hitting me in a full effect but and then also an indica is usually super super cash luck but this one I'm like I'm relaxed I'm relaxed but I feel like I can still function which is good you know I'm not really hating on that so overall quality I'll probably give this a 10 out of 10 I'm 9 out of 10 Man 9 out of 10 it could use a little work like I said on the indica putting you a little bit more to sleep but overall man the quality raw garden never fails so if you guys are legal and illegal stay somewhere where you can get regardin years no you guys should hit them up see where you can find it legally so we're gonna end the video here if you guys enjoyed today's video man like I did go ahead and leave a sub it helps way more than you think and smash
